      "text": "External Q+A's on the Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality, 4th Edition\n\nQuestions and Answers 4 July 2011\n\nWhy are these Guidelines important?\n\nWater is essential for life, but it can and does transmit disease in countries in all continents—from the poorest to the wealthiest. The most predominant waterborne disease, diarrhoea, causes two million deaths every year. Drinking-water quality management has been a key pillar of primary prevention for over one-and-a-half centuries and it continues to be the foundation for the prevention and control of waterborne diseases. The Guidelines are a flagship normative publication of WHO.\n\nHow can the recommendations make a difference?\n\nThe Guidelines recommend shifting the focus from reacting to contamination events to preventing their occurrence. Country policies frequently overemphasize end-product testing as a means to ensure the safety drinking-water. Unfortunately, adverse test results are not known until the water has already been consumed and people have already gotten sick. This Edition provides guidance on how to formulate regulations and promote good practice to assess and reduce risks of contamination before it is too late. If the recommendations articulated in these Guidelines were to be effectively implemented, waterborne outbreaks and disease could be substantially reduced.\n\nWhat type of guidance is presented?\n\nThe Guidelines provide an evidence-based point of departure for standard setting and regulation as a basis for health protection. They include an assessment of the health risks presented by the various microbial, chemical, radiological and physical constituents that may be present in drinking-water. While the guidance is advisory in nature, health-based guideline values for hazardous constituents are derived and presented as maximum recommended concentrations.\n\nWhat are the core recommendations of the Guidelines?\n\nThe Guidelines promote a framework for safe drinking-water, composed of health-based targets, water safety plans, and independent surveillance. Health-based targets are measurable health, water quality or performance objectives that are established based on a judgement of safety and on risk assessments of waterborne hazards. Water safety plans (WSPs) provide the instrument make the Guidelines operational. WSPs require systematic catchment-to-consumer risk assessment and management and emphasize prevention for long-term improvements in water quality. Drinking-water supply surveillance entails the continuous and vigilant public health assessment and review of the safety and acceptability of drinking-water supplies.\n\nHow is this different from previous versions?\n\nThis Edition has been systematically revised in a process involving hundreds of experts, numerous consultations, and a period of more than five years. It builds on previous editions, expanding and further clarifying key concepts like health-based targets and water safety planning. Substantial new text has been introduced on how to implement these Guidelines, including on adapting these to national/local circumstances, for example through the establishment of interim standards to encourage step-wise improvements in resource-limited contexts.\n\nIt has new guidance on emerging issues of public concern like pharmaceuticals in drinking-water and the chapter on radiological aspects has been comprehensively revised. New or improved explanations have been incorporated on how to more effectively manage drinking-water quality in a range of specific circumstances including: climate change risks, emergencies, bulk water supplies, household-level water management including rainwater harvesting and point-of-use treatment and safe storage.\n\nNew or revised risk assessments have been applied to over thirty chemical and microbial hazards, including emerging organisms of concern. New guidance has been formulated on applying pesticides to drinking-water for public health purposes (e.g. to control mosquito larvae in potable water containers in order to prevent dengue transmission).\n\nWHO's role in drinking-water safety: guidelines, not standards?\n\nOne of the main roles of WHO is to establish international norms to protect human health. Since 1958, as part of its activities on drinking-water and health, the Organization has published several editions of International Standards for Drinking-water and subsequently, the Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality.\n\nIn 1982, WHO shifted its focus from 'International Standards' to 'Guidelines'. The main reason for the shift is the advantage provided by the use of a risk-benefit approach (quantitative or qualitative) to the establishment of national standards and regulations. Specifically, the application of the Guidelines to different countries should take account of the sociocultural, environmental and economic circumstances particular to those countries.\n\nWHO Member States have recognized the urgent need to improve drinking-water safety, and called upon WHO to strengthen its technical advice in this area in a World Health Assembly Resolution, agreed to in May 2011.\n\nWho uses the Guidelines?\n\nThe Guidelines are addressed to water and health regulators, policy-makers, and their advisors, mainly to assist them in the development of national standards. The Guidelines are also used by many others such as water suppliers and practitioners as an international scientific point of reference on water quality and health, and effective water safety and management approaches.\n\nThe Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality are recognized as the UN system's official position on drinking-water quality. The European Commission and Japan use the Guidelines as the scientific point of departure for their drinking-water directive and drinking-water quality standards, respectively; the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines are based on the WHO Guidelines, while the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and Canada's Health Canada actively observe and participate in the WHO Guidelines development and updating process.\n\nMany developing countries use the Guidelines directly or indirectly in setting national standards. The Guidelines are often used where guidelines or standards are unavailable and are also referred to in the food standards developed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (for instance, for mineral water and bottled water).\n\nWater suppliers—both larger utilities and those providing water to small communities—will find the recommended management approaches to be practical and effective ways to assure drinking water quality."

So, the water company will deliver an additional nine water coolers today, along with 350 water bottles for students, Kammeyer said.\n\nCulligan will be delivering water to the school every two weeks, she said.\n\nPG&E offered to supply the school with bottled water in November, but the school declined, PG&E spokesman Jeff Smith said.\n\nThe school declined PG&E's offer because its four wells tested below the maximum background levels for the cancer-causing hexavalent chromium, or chromium 6, established by the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board as 3.1 parts per billion.\n\nBut recent concerns voiced last week from Hinkley residents and environmental/consumer advocate Erin Brockovich prompted PG&E to send a formal letter to the school last week offering to supply bottled water. This time, the school accepted, Smith said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We certainly want to be responsive to the concerns of the community,\" Smith said. He said PG&E will provide bottled water to the school as long as the school requests it, and will provide even more if necessary.\n\nThe lowest level of chromium 6 detected in the school's wells was 1.4 parts per billion, and the average was 2 parts per billion, said Robert Bowcock, an environmental engineer who works with Brockovich, for whom the 2000 film of the same name was inspired.\n\nBrockovich spurred the landmark litigation in the 1990s that culminated with PG&E settling with more than 600 Hinkley residents for $333 million. The plaintiffs in the litigation accused PG&E's contamination of the groundwater with chromium 6 as the cause of their myriad health ailments including cancer, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, PG&E used chromium 6 to clean its cooling tower at its compressor station. The chemically laced water from the tower was dumped into unlined ponds and seeped into the groundwater supply.\n\nBowcock said the chromium 6 levels in Hinkley Elementary/Middle School wells are 100 times more than the recently proposed maximum contaminant level of 0.02 parts per billion by the state Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment.\n\n\"California's toxicologists came up with that number using their science, and the state has their work peer reviewed,\" Bowcock said.\n\nKammeyer, the school's principal, said PG&E conducts periodic tests of the ground wells at the school, and the results have always come back at below the maximum naturally occurring background levels established by the Lahontan Regional Water Board.\n\n\"The (chromium 6) levels are very safe here,\" Kammeyer said.\n\nShe said the provision of bottled water at the school is to alleviate the concerns of Hinkley residents.\n\nDuring a community meeting hosted by Brockovich and Bowcock last week in Barstow, Keri Kirkham, a 28-year Hinkley resident, said she was shocked to have received a letter in the fall from the school encouraging her to have her 6-year-old daughter bring her own bottled water to school. She said the school, a public entity, should provide that service.\n\n\"To me, it's just a no-brainer,\" said Kirkham, 41, who was diagnosed with lung cancer in September 2009.\n\nKammeyer denied such a letter was ever sent out.\n\nKirkham's comments triggered ire with Brockovich and Bowcock. The following day, Bowcock started putting in calls to PG&E and the school. He said Kammeyer never returned his call, and he gave PG&E an ultimatum.\n\n\"I called PG&E and told them, `you either provide it (bottled water) or I will,\"' Bowcock said Tuesday.\n\nHe said is now discussing with PG&E the installation of a water treatment system at the school that will filter out chromium 6, a more inexpensive alternative to providing bottled water."

      "text": "Water Filtering Umbrella\n\nAndrew Leinonen - Canada\n\nClean drinking water is on everyone's agenda, today. Yet rain is so often perceived as an inconvenience, taken for granted when it falls at the wrong time. In much of the world, hurricanes and tropical storms accompanied by tidal surge often cause flooding, contaminating ground water and reservoirs, leaving it unfit to drink. So much water, but so little that is potable.\n\nThe umbrella is a device that has provided protection from the sun and rain for millennia. Could we not expand its versatility, and use it not just to repel rain, but to collect it, filter it, and make it safe to drink?\n\nA funnel-shaped umbrella, looking not unlike a chantarelle mushroom, a hollow central tube, and activated carbon filter are the simple modifications necessary to complete the functional transformation. Moulded internal threads allow standard-size drink bottles to screw into the bottle of the filter tube, providing a convenient and available way of collecting water that also serves to re-use existing materials.\n\nBy attaching multiple functions to the object, it is seen as having more value, less likely to merely be tossed aside when it is no longer immediately useful. Furthermore, with an all-plastic construction made of polylactic acid blends, this is an object that is fully compostable in microbial soil, nourishing life even after in its \"death.\""

      "text": "Actually, toothpaste is one of the first places that it should be banned, since toothpaste with triclosan loads your body more heavily than any other triclosan containing personal care product.\n\nWhen you brush your teeth, you scuff your gums up and the triclosan goes directly into your blood, from where it ends up in your fatty tissues and hangs around much longer than you would like it to. The best part is when nursing mothers end up feeding it to their newborns. This is hardly the case with soaps, unless you're eating them.\n\nUnless there's a reason why somebody NEEDS triclosan tooth paste (and I can't think of one; having a statistically better chance of good breath isn't what I consider a \"need\"), it shouldn't be promoted.\n\nI prefer AAs; they last a long time by themselves, you can get a big box of them from harbor freight for like $3 and be set for at least a year, and they don't need any special consideration for disposal.\n\nSure, you can throw your expensive lithium batteries that always seem to crap out after a few months in the regular trash, too, but then you'd be an asshole.\n\nEver heard of having just enough rope to hang yourself? That's what happens with a lot of scientific arguments, just like you implied with your stem cell analogy.\n\nFluoride in ground water comes from fluoride crystal deposits--it's F+ ion. Fluoridated water has F+ ion as well, IIRC... I may be wrong there. The way it gets there, however, is by adding either a fluoride salt (NaF)...\n\nYes. Basically. Fluoride is an anion (F-), and your \"fluoride crystals\" are fluoride salts. Fluoride (the ion) must have a counter ion with it; very simple forms would be NaF (sodium fluoride) or HF (hydrofluoric acid).\n\nor complex fluorochemicals, some of which are actually acids.\n\nDefine \"complex,\" and why do we care if they are acids? The water won't be acidic when it reaches your tap.\n\nThis is toxic industrial waste with hazmat handling restrictions.\n\nThis statement adds nothing to your argument. There are plenty of beneficial compounds that are toxic at high concentrations and regulated as hazards. Furthermore, there are plenty of beneficial compounds that are byproducts of other processes. You're thinking of Hexafluorosilicic acid, and you're talking about it like it's dihydrogen monoxide--you know, the dangerous toxic waste that kills millions yearly and was used by Hitler and Stalin.\n\nYeah, you want fluoride in your water. You want it in trace amounts, though; and you want F+ ion, not all the other garbage that gets dumped in your water to get F+ ion into it artificially.\n\nThe amount added to drinking water is a trace amount, and may be less than many natural waters have. If the concentrations are the same, what's the problem?\n\nFurthermore, in the case of the two examples you gave, the \"other garbage\" (also in trace amounts) is sodium or silica, both of which you unquestionably consume in much greater quantities daily.\n\nYes, that's right, silica. According to wikipedia, in water at neutral pH, Hexafluorosilicic acid decomposes into silica, and the F- ions that kids crave:\n\nSiF6^2- + 2 H2O => 6 F- + SiO2 + 4 H+\n\nSilica, by the way, is the active ingredient in sand.\n\nIf they artificially produced F+ ion by stripping it out of toxic waste, you'd get something vastly different\n\nNo, no you wouldn't, because you can't just strip out the fluoride. That's not how chemistry works. You could spend money to convert it into another fluoride compound (like NaF), but the safety of the consumer would be exactly the same either way, as long as it was pure. In fact, it's probably better that they don't use NaF, because we get plenty of Na on our french fries.\n\n--and the argument would be entirely stupid.\n\nNo comment.\n\nInstead, the argument is between people shouting \"FLUORIDE\" while the reality is between Fluoride and Toxic Fluoride Compounds.\n\nIt's really a shame that you have no idea what you're talking about, because there is actually a huge issue at stake that is just over the horizon from your argument, and that is the growing use of fluorinated carbon compounds. These are persistent, carcinogenic, endocrine disrupting, bioaccumulating, and every other dangerous word you can think of.\n\nIf you want to talk about that, then I'm sure we'd agree that we don't want halocarbons of any kind used any more than absolutely necessary (are you listening to me, State of California?), but unfortunately you've been suckered by a bunch of pseudoscientific babble.\n\nMany water sources are naturally fluoridated, and having a minimum fluoride content can be directly correlated with occurrence of cavities in the population. Fluoride is not any less natural than any other salt (sorry, \"mineral\"), and varies geographically like all the rest.\n\nMy city has fluoridation equipment that it never uses, because the source water always exceeds the recommended dose.\n\nIf the PS4 isn't powerful enough to emulate a PS3 in software, then what makes it powerful enough to warrant obsoleting the PS3? Pretty much every previous generation has had this capability (ignoring engineered incompatibility, like cartridges).\n\ngeekspy writes \"Missile Command is a popular arcade game that was released in the 1980, it is also available for the Atari 2600 as well. The aim of this game is to save your base by shooting the incoming missiles from using a beam. In 1982 a player named Victor Ali has set a record score of 80,364,995 by playing the game for 56 hours. Guess what this record hasn't been broken for the last 31 years, but not anymore as a player from Sweden also named Victor (Victor Sandberg) beat the record by scoring a final score of 81,796,035. He played Mission Missile for 56 hours, 5 minutes, and 53 seconds on a single coin and also streamed it liveThis just in: given unlimited resources, people can do simple things in impractical ways. Film at 11.\n\nIn 1995, it was impractical to download videos on demand. Being the first idiot to wait 104 days for a video to download doesn't make you a pioneer; it means you have the resources to waste doing something impractical.\n\nThese kind of demonstrations are different than actually doing something to develop the technology. We know what the state of the art is, and we see inklings of what could be done in the future. Generating trivial results doesn't do anything more to drive that point home."

      "text": "Love that dirty water: Scientists find low-tech way to recycle H2O\n\nMay 24, 2010 By Tom Avril\n\nHorticulturists at Pennsylvania State University have come up with a low-cost, green method for recycling so-called \"gray\" water -- the stuff from sinks, showers and washing machines that would otherwise go down the drain.\n\nThey filter the water through some plant roots and layers of crushed stone, peat moss and waste materials -- making it clean enough to reuse for growing vegetables or flushing toilets -- but not for drinking.\n\nUsing gray water is generally not allowed in the United States, but some states have explored the idea. The Penn State researchers hope their data -- which show such biofilters can remove almost all suspended solids, nitrogen compounds and other pollutants from gray water -- might lead to greater acceptance.\n\nMeanwhile, such filters could be used in poor nations that lack adequate water for sanitation and irrigation, said Robert D. Berghage, associate professor of horticulture.\n\nRobert Cameron, the doctoral student on the project, presented the research this month at a sustainable-farming meeting in Cuba.\n\nThe system consists of two plastic pipes filled with layers of porous rocks, soil, crumbs from discarded tires, composted cow manure and peat moss. Vegetables and other plants are planted in holes along the sides of the pipes.\n\nThe pipes stand in a basin with still more plants -- papyrus and horsetail reed -- whose roots support microbes that remove pollutants.\n\nEach material in the pipes removes different contaminants, though the tire crumbs are there mainly as filler. Tire crumbs also contain contaminants, but tests showed they are not released into the water, Berghage says.\n\nWith enough treatment, you could even drink water that goes through such filters, Berghage says. He admits that this wouldn't gain wide acceptance, even though drinking-water plants already treat water from rivers that receive treated waste.\n\n\"Most of us have this sort of aversion to drinking treated wastewater,\" he says, \"even though much of the time we're doing it anyway.\"\n\nRelated Stories\n\nPlant roots enmeshed in layers of discarded materials inside upright pipes can purify dirty water from a washing machine, making it fit for growing vegetables and flushing toilets, according to Penn State ...\n\nMicrobiologically contaminated water plagues approximately 1.1 billion people in rural and peri-urban populations in developing countries. Roughly 2.2 million people without safe access to drinking water die each year from ...\n\nScientists in Virginia are reporting that home plumbing systems constructed with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic pipes may be more susceptible to leaching of lead and copper into drinking water than other ...\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Although America's supply of drinking water is considered among the world's safest, there is an urgent need to develop more stringent regulations to guide how water is monitored for pollutants, ...\n\nEvery year, the United State produces millions of scrap tires that clog landfills and become breeding areas for pests. Finding adequate uses for castoff tires is a continuing challenge and illegal dumping has become a serious filter the water through some plant roots and layers of crushed stone, peat moss and waste materials -- making it clean enough to reuse for growing vegetables or flushing toilets -- but not for drinking\"\n\nOh, for heaven's sake.

That's because even though there's a fairly constant demand for recycled clear glass, glass in colors such as green, brown and blue isn't all that sought-after, so many recycling centers don't bother processing it. As a result, waste colored glass is now being stock-piled in some locations, waiting for a use. Thanks to research conducted at the University of Greenwich, however, that glass may soon be used for filtering pollutants out of ground water.\n\nDr. Nichola Coleman, a senior lecturer in Materials Chemistry, has been leading the research.\n\nHer team combined ground colored glass, lime and caustic soda, then heated the mixture to 100C (212F) in a sealed stainless steel container. This transformed the ingredients into tobermorite, a mineral that is effective at removing heavy metals from ground- or waste-water streams. She is hoping to incorporate the tobermorite into filtration devices, that could be used to prevent water-borne pollutants from spreading from contaminated areas.\n\n\"The novelty of the research is that the glass can be recycled into something useful,\" the U Greenwich researcher stated. \"Nobody has previously thought to use waste glass in this way"

      "text": "Ok, not really all that related, but they both have to do with water, so two birds with one and a half stones, right? Something like that. I haven't thought much about chemistry lately so I thought I'd take a stab at these two - for the basics of each type of water, click the italicized title.\n\nHeavy water:Heavy water is also known as deuterium oxide, and is formed by using deuterium rather than \"normal\" hydrogen. Deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen that is stable and naturally-forming, but which has a neutron in its nucleus - \"normal\" hydrogen [protium] has NO neutron in its nucleus. Because D2O contains two more neutrons than water made with normal hydrogen, it's about 11% more dense. Note the ice-cube graphic - in \"normal\" water, a \"normal\" ice cube floats, but a deuterated ice cube sinks.\n\nThough D2O (and semi-heavy water, with just one deuterium - HDO) occurs naturally on earth, it's extremely uncommon. However, due to its increased density, it was one of the first effective \"moderators\" for nuclear fission reactors, and it was extremely useful in the separation of plutonium for nuclear weapons, so entire plants were set up to separate \"heavy\" water from normal water.\n\nThese days, deuterium oxide is not widely used outside of the inorganic chemistry and nuclear physics world, and is no longer commonly used as a neutron moderator in fission reactors. If consumed, it's considered moderately toxic, but it's not going to kill you unless it's all you drink for a very long time, and at $300/kg and a controlled supply chain (since using it is part of the easiest process of creating a nuclear bomb), good luck with that. I mean, not really, don't go drinking it on purpose, just don't think you'll die if you have a deuterium cocktail.\n\nDe-ionized and reverse osmosis (DI/RO) water is just water with its ionic mineral salts removed (in various fashions) - things like calcium, copper, bromide, and iron, which build up in the water while it's on or under the ground, and sometimes while it's in storage containers. Those salts are part of what makes water \"hard\", which can lead to mineral buildup on faucets, tubs, or in machines that use water.\n\nWhile de-ionized water can prevent hard water buildup, you don't want to use it as a substitute for \"regular\" (even just regularly distilled, but not deionized) water in situations where there's a possibility that the minerals in the water are not being acquired in other situations, such as in famine conditions, and on ships. The WHO recommends avoiding demineralized or deionized waterunless it's the only possible clean water source.\n\nPersonally, the lab I worked at used Milli-Q (ultrapure - RO/DI + ultrafiltration) water for our coffee machine, because the local water tap water was really hard and left limescale buildup in the drip. We already had the Millipore machine, so we figured it didn't hurt. There were no health benefits or detriments to doing so, just less effort when trying to clean the coffee machine.\n\nAt 15:30:08 UTC on Sun, 4 December 292,277,026,596[16][17]64-bit versions of the Unix time stamp will cease to work, as it will overflow the largest value that can be held in a signed 64-bit number.

      "text": "Emergency Drinking Water\n\nStoring Water For Emergencies\nTo be prepared for a drinking water emergency, you should store enough drinking water to supply each person 1 gallon a day for two weeks. This is the amount normally used by one person for drinking, cooking and teeth brushing. The following steps should be used for collecting and then storing the water:\n\nCollect the water from a supply that is safe to drink. If it is a public or community water supply, ask the water department or manager. If you have your own supply, contact your local health department about how to have it tested to see if it is safe to drink.\n\nUse proper containers. Store water in containers which are made for water storage, or glass and plastic jugs previously used for juice, milk, pop or bottled water. Clean thoroughly before using such containers to store water.\n\nDo not use containers previously used by you or the manufacturer for pesticides, chemicals, solvents, antifreeze, poisons, oils, etc.\n\nBefore storing the water, add liquid bleach to the container according to Table 1 in order to keep it safe for drinking.\n\nStore in a cool place from flooding, freezing and earthquakes. Every six months, use or throw out the stored water and replace it with a fresh supply.\n\nTreating Water In Emergencies\nIf a safe supply of water is not available, or if your usual supply becomes unsafe for drinking, you must treat the water before it can be used for drinking, cooking, or brushing teeth. There are two ways of treating water: boiling or adding bleach. If the supply has been made unsafe because of untreated surface water (from floods, streams or lakes), boiling is the better treatment.\n\nIf the water looks cloudy, it should be filtered before you treat it. You can use coffee filters, towels (paper or cotton), cheese cloth, a cotton plug in a funnel, etc. Use several layers of material for best result. You can also use filters designed for use when camping and backpacking.\n\nBoiling\nBoiling is the best way to purify water that is unsafe because of presence of bacteria. Place the water in a clean container and bring it to a full boil and continue boiling for at least 3 minutes. If you are more than 5,000 feet above sea level, you must increase boiling time to at least 5 minutes.\n\nBoiled water should be kept covered while cooling and can be stored in the manner described under \"Storing Water For Emergencies.\"\n\nPurifying By Adding Liquid Bleach\nIf boiling is not possible, the water can be made safe for drinking by treating with liquid household chlorine bleach (such as Clorox, Purex, etc.) Avoid using scented and \"color-safe\" bleaches. Household bleach has a strength of about 5% chlorine (most labels show it as 5.25%).\n\nPlace the water (filtered if necessary) in a clean container, add the amount of bleach according to the tables below. It is important to mix thoroughly and allow to stand for at least 30 minutes before using the water. If the water is cloudy, or very cold, increase the standing time to 60 minutes. For treating small amounts of water, you may find it easier to use a 1% bleach solution.\n\nYou can also use water to purifying tablets or chemicals designed for use when camping or backpacking. Always follow the directions on the package.\n\nNote: Chlorine and other chemicals will not kill cysts of the parasite Cryptosporidium (\"Crypto\"), which may be present in water supplies affected by untreated surface water. Cryptosporidium is an organism that can cause severe illness and even death in persons who have been weakened because of health problems. Boiling is the best water treatment in these situations.\n\nVery Important\nThe treatments described above work only in situations where the water is unsafe because of the presence of bacteria. If you suspect the water is unsafe because of chemicals, oils, poisonous substances, sewage, etc., do not use the water for drinking.\n\nHow to make a 1% bleach solution:\nMix 1 part of 5% household bleach and 4 parts clean water by volume to give 5 parts 1% bleach solution. For example, 1 ounce bleach to 4 ounces of water or 1 cup bleach to 4 cups water.\n\nKeep bleach solutions in tightly capped containers and labeled to it's strength. Store in a cool place. Discard and make fresh solutions every 6 months.\n\nChlorine Bleach Solution to add for clean water, or to keep water safe"

      "text": "Explanation\nof Colloidal Minerals\n\nWhen Tom Clark took the first\ndrink of the bitter water from the tiny spring it was an act of both\ntrust and desperation. Tom was sick, very sick and he chose to take the\nadvice of his Native American friend. As it turned out that advice\nprobably saved his life. The rest is history. Tom made a concentrated\nformula of the spring water and called it \"Mineral Water\".\nLater he called it \"Colloidal Mineral Water\". The words were\nintended as part of a brand name and a very general and short\ndescription of what the product is made of. Once the word was out that\nsomeone had made \"A Better Mousetrap\" many people set out to copy it. Armed with the words \"Colloidal\nMinerals\" and an elemental analysis of Tom's formula, \"Colloidal\nMineral Products\" began appearing everywhere.\n\nSo what's wrong with this picture? Suppose Tom's discovery\nwas made from a forest of Ginkgo biloba Trees. After all they were prolific in\nprehistoric times. If Tom had known the botanical origin of his discovery\nwouldn't it have been a far more informative description to name it after the\nplants it came from? The problem is, of course, that Tom didn't know the exact\nspecie of plant or plants that made his discovery work. Hence the words\n\"Colloidal Minerals\". So now that we are armed with the understanding\nof the origin of the words \"Colloidal Minerals\" what about this \"elemental\nanalysis\" that everyone seems to put so much emphasis on.\n\nSuppose\nyou took a Ginkgo biloba tree, put it in a big pot and made yourself some soup.\nThen you took your soup to a laboratory and had them perform a detailed analysis\nof every element in your soup. Now armed with your analysis you make some new\nsoup using the exact same colloidal elements you gathered from other sources\n(plant or other) and you carefully measured the exact same quantities and made\nsome new soup. The question is, would you expect your new soup to have the same\nbiological effect when you ate it as your genuine Ginkgo soup? If your answer is\nyes then why not join the crowd and make your own Colloidal Mineral Product. If\nyour answer is no, congratulations, you understand something about the wonderful\nworld of atoms, elements, molecules and minerals. As you browse our site you\nwill find a couple of analysis that demonstrate this fact. There is also a graphic display of the origin and growth of\nthe colloidal mineral business.\n\nSo what can we say about today's colloidal minerals? The\none thing we can say with certainty is that they are all different, very\ndifferent. If they work for you or don't work for you it is because of what they\nactually are. They may be Colloidal Minerals, they might even have an\nactual plant source, and they might even sport an analysis on an impressive\nletterhead showing \"38 Grams of Dissolved Solids\". And------ (this\nis the important stuff) noneof those things will give\nyou a clue about what these products may do for you or to you!\nAnd-----none of those things will tell you what these products actually\nare! Just like Ginkgo biloba, Colloidal Mineral Products are only valuable for\nwhat they actually do for you. What they do for you depends upon exactly\nwhat they are and what they are depends upon their exact molecular\nstructure not the elements that make up their structure. After all, Nature makes\neverything out of these very same elements from deadly toxins to\nlife giving nutrients. Nature makes everything by assembling these\nsame elements in different ways.\n\nBoth professionals and consumers demonstrate the\nwell-known value of T. J. Clark Colloidal Mineral Products by 80 years of\ncontinuous successful use. You also have the assurance that comes from actual function\ntesting in a prestigious laboratory. If you choose to use a colloidal\nmineral product, please take the time to understand it. Knowledge is power and\nKnowledgeable Consumers are, and have always been, the most valuable asset of T.\nJ. Clark & Company.\n\nSo to answer the question, what are \"Colloidal\nMinerals\": The answer is a lot of very different products, not to be\nconfused with the Original Colloidal Mineral Product or even with each\nother"

      "text": "Fluoride\n\nCalifornia's largest water agency voted on Tuesday to add fluoride to the water it supplies to 18 million homes and businesses, from the Mexican border to the Central Coast. The agency, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, said it would take more than two years to fluoridate its water to protect teeth from cavities. \"This is very significant in that public water fluoridation has been touted as one of the great public health achievements of the century,\" Dr. Timothy Collins, chairman of the California Fluoridation Task Force, said. \"If fluoride presents any risks to the public at levels to which the vast majority of us are exposed, those risks are so small that they have been impossible to detect in the epidemiological studies to date,\" Dr. Mason said.\n\nResearchers have found preliminary evidence that fluoride causes cancer in male rats, Federal officials said today. But they cautioned that the study did not suggest that the fluoride in water and toothpaste would cause cancer. Studies sponsored by the National Toxicological Program examined 1,360 mice and rats. The unexpected findings showed that a handful of cases of bone cancer might be attributed to fluoride-spiked water that the animals received in their diet. The cancers occurred mostly at doses 50 to 100 times the amount humans ingest...\n\nTo the Editor: The preliminary findings on water fluoridation by the National Toxicology Program (\"Rat Study Reignites Dispute on Fluoride,\" Science Times, March 13) represent just one animal study and should not diminish the importance of numerous human studies that have shown that fluoride in community water supplies, at the level recommended for dental health, is beneficial for prevention of dental decay. Further, studies by the National Cancer Institute have shown no correlation between water fluoridation and cancer in humans.\n\nBarker Hamill's children take fluoride pills every other day. The reason: Morrisville, Pa., where they live, does not have fluoridated water. \"Our pediatrician recommended taking them,\" Mr. Hamill. \"There's no lack of evidence that it helps to prevent tooth decay. \" Mr. Hamill is not just any proponent of fluoridation. He is also chief of the bureau of safe drinking water in the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, the agency that tests for proper levels of fluoride in drinking water.\n\nA long-smoldering dispute over the safety of fluoridating public water supplies has flared anew, forcing the nation's top health officials to reevaluate the risks and benefits of using fluorides to reduce tooth decay. The latest review was triggered by a Congressionally mandated study that recently reported evidence that high doses of fluoride may cause cancer in rats. The study was carried out by the National Toxicology Program, the Federal Government's top agency for evaluating chemical risks.\n\n Americans experience such tooth staining, known as dental fluorosis, in a \"very mild to...\n\nA new slow-release form of fluoride and calcium can reduce spinal fractures and build bone in elderly women with a severe form of osteoporosis, researchers said today. Scientists at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas announced final results of a clinical trial in which half the participants received the fluoride-calcium treatment and the rest received calcium and a dummy drug. They said the results showed that the therapy reduced the incidence of spinal fracture by 70 percent.\n\nIf there's one thing Christine Brook-Smith hates, it's fluoride. She hates it in her toothpaste. She hates it in her mouthwash (or she would, except that she has stopped using mouthwash). But most of all, she hates it in water. It was about four years ago that Mrs. Brook-Smith, now 49 and a part-time artists' model, saw a notice in the newspaper announcing that her local water authority in Scarborough, in Yorkshire, was planning to fluoridate the drinking water. For a woman whose craving for a simple life extends to having no car and no telephone, the news was...\n\nA panel of scientific experts today endorsed the findings of a Federal investigation showing that a compound widely used to fluoridate public water supplies may cause bone cancer in male rats. The panel found that the evidence inconclusively demonstrated a weak association between fluoride consumption and the bone cancer in male rats. Federally sponsored scientists who conducted the study say the finding does not in itself imply a hazard to humans from drinking fluoridated water.\n\nTo the Editor: I was encouraged to see your Dec. 23 London Journal on a campaign against the fluoridation of drinking water but was disappointed by the implication that Britain was some kind of reactionary outpost against modern scientific thought in being slow to fluoridate its water. Nothing could be further from the truth. Very few countries in Europe fluoridate their water. Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden experimented with fluoridation but abandoned it in the 1970's.\n\nTo the Editor: Your report on the proposed fluoridation of water in Long Island's Suffolk County (news article, March 14) contains familiar arguments from fluoridation opponents. Some of them are irrational (\"I regard fluoridation as enforced medication\"). Some are based on logical fallacies (\"We spend a lot of time . . . keeping things out of the water. It seems silly to have to put something else in\"). Some are factually incorrect (\"There is enough scientific evidence right now . . . that proves fluoridation is extremely harmful to human health\")\n\nIn the minds of many people, bottled water has become the equivalent of sunscreen or vitamins: extra protection in a sometimes dangerous world. Compared with tap water, it contains minimal amounts of lead, pesticides, coliform bacteria and unpleasant-tasting chlorine. But dentists worry that it also contains minimal amounts of fluoride, the mineral that helps build stronger teeth in children and helps prevent tooth decay in adults. With consumption of bottled water at an all-time high nationwide -- 12.7 gallons consumed per person last year -- dentists are concerned about the long-term measure as a public health hazard.\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. said yesterday that it had sold its Dutch fluor chemicals plant to Allied Signal Inc. of Morristown, N.J., for an undisclosed amount. The plant, based in the southeastern Dutch town of Weert, produces hydrogen fluoride and chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's. Its 70 employees will now become part of Allied Signal's work force. Allied Signal is already a global market leader in the production of hydrogen fluoride and CFC substitutes. Akzo Nobel, a leading international chemical company, said fluor chemical activities no longer formed part of its key operations."

      "text": "How effective should a water softener be?\n\nI live in Waterloo, which is a very, very hard water area (I've seen 22-28 grains mentioned). Pretty much everyone has a water softener in their house. Without it, the hard water is really obvious. Scale all over everything, soap doesn't work, etc.\n\nEven with the softener, the kettle and hot water dispenser both build up scale. I thought this was a fact of life, but I was recently told there shouldn't be any scale on anything if the softener is working properly. I have some hardness test strips, and the water tests as the lowest \"soft\" range, but I don't know the alkalinity or anything else.\n\nIs this normal, or is the softener not working right?\n\n_______________ \"My fellow Americans, these are not the droids the nation is looking for.\"\n\nI live in waterloo too. Had my softener installed in 2001 and i just add salt as needed.\n\nI only have anecdotal observations for you. I have a separate hard water tap in the kitchen. The tip of that faucet builds up scale on a regular basis. so i take it off and vinegar it.\n\nThe normal kitchen faucet that dispenses soft water has never needed descaling in the last 9 years.\n\nSo i would guess there's something not quite right with yours.\n\nThe resin softens the water. Over time it loses it's softening ability and must be regenerated by flushing it with the salt brine. Resins are supposed to last 25 years. I'd guess either your softener is too small or the regeneration is not performing properly. Although if the regeneration is not performing at all i'd expect your hardness to climb back up to 100% within a few weeks.\n\nI didn't mean that the kitchen faucet gets scaled. It's mainly my kettle and an electric hot water dispenser (which keeps water close to boiling). They don't scale very quickly at all, but it still builds up gradually and requires a descaling every now and then. For example, the water dispenser is three months old, and it had built up enough flakes of scale to start dispensing them, so I dumped the water and flushed it out the other day (it's lined with some material the scale doesn't stick to very well).\n\nI checked with the hardness testing strips again, and the water is still in the lowest grain range. Hard water from the outdoor tap shows extremely high hardness, as expected. You're saying I shouldn't get any scale at all on anything if the softener is working properly? This is an older house (~1980), and I'm not sure the softener or resin has ever been replaced, but the brine tank is filled regularly, of course.\n\nI installed a 28,000 grain Kenmore softener last year in my house and I just noticed now there's a small amount of mineral buildup inside my electric kettle. no hard water stains on the faucets or shower\n\nAre you sure that your kitchen faucet dispenses softened water? Normally, you shouldn't drink softened water and systems therefore usually bypass the kitchen sink - meaning that the water being boiled is not softened at all."

Working with Marc Edwards of the CEE faculty, Scardina has continued his research as a masters and doctoral student, and he recently won a highly competitive grant worth $150,000 from the American Water Works Association Research Foundation (AWWARF).\n\nScardinas research also is being used by engineers with the California Department of Health Services to identify problems at two facilities that have experienced eruptions of air bubbles.\n\nBut why would ordinary air bubbles, which occur naturally in water, be a source of concern in drinking water treatment?\n\n\"When you open a can of soda, bubbles form and rise to the surface,\" explains Edwards. \"The same thing can happen in water from lakes and rivers. When air bubbles are released in a burp during the treatment process, pathogens and other particles can escape removal.\"\n\nThe last treatment barrier in most drinking water treatment plants is filtration, Edwards says, and a burp of bubbles can punch holes in filterstiny holes, but large enough to let particles and pathogens escape into the water that goes out to customers.\n\n\"The field of drinking water treatment is about 3,000 years old,\" Edwards notes, \"but in all that time, air bubbles in water have not been studied in terms of their ability to affect treatment processes.\"\n\nScardina, who began studying air bubbles at Edwards suggestion during his senior year at Virginia Tech, identified the causes of bubble formation while he was working on his masters degree. \"Before Paolos findings, we knew that bubbles could cause problems,\" Edwards says, \"but we didn"

      "text": "Reverse Osmosis\n\nReverse Osmosis\n\nReverse osmosis is a pretty effective way to separate many contaminants from the water you want to use. Membranes allow pure water through while holding back water with contaminants in it, like fluoride, chlorine and heavy metals.\n\nAs Wikipedia says: \"Reverse osmosis (RO) is a filtration method that removes many types of large molecules and ions from solutions by applying pressure to the solution when it is on one side of a selective membrane.\"\nClick here for more Wikipedia information: \n\nThis problem with that as a solution to get healthy water is that contaminants don't sort themselves out by size of molecule. Having a large molecule does not equate with 'good'. Having a small molecule does not equate with 'bad'.\n\nIt is endlessly repeated on the internet that reverse osmosis is the only way to remove fluoride. This is not true. Even many well-intentioned authors repeat this because they have seen it so many times. A bit more research however, will show the inaccuracy of that statement.\n\nThere are many disadvantages to the use of reverse osmosis in the home. In this list we are specifically speaking about use in the kitchen, although the concepts apply for the whole house too.\n\nWater Supply & Environment\n\nReverse osmosis filters waste a great deal of water - perhaps 70%\n\nThe water wasted is sent back into our environment with a highly saturated level of contaminants!\n\nMost people aware enough to want to filter their water don't want to waste it or further add to the contamination of our environment\n\nReverse osmosis filters store water in a tank\n\nReverse osmosis filters are relatively slow to process water\n\nIf you use more water than usual, you can get ahead of the water supply\n\nBecause reverse osmosis removes trace elements from the water, when the water is in your body, it tries to replenish itself - by taking trace elements from you! (see footnote *)\n\nIt seems that many drugs, which we know are in the water, are not removed by reverse osmosis\n\nReverse osmosis is not particularly effective on many synthetic chemicals like herbicides and pesticides\n\nRO lets molecules and ions through, or not, based on size. This is not the best basis to 'sort' on.\n\n\"Dissolved gases and materials that readily turn into gases also can easily pass through most reverse osmosis membranes,\" according to theUniversity of Nevada Cooperative Extension. For this reason, \"many reverse osmosis units have an activated carbon unit to remove or reduce the concentration of most organic compounds.\"\n\nThe Water Quality Association reports that: Chloramines are small, stable molecules with no net charge making them\ndifficult to remove by distillation, reverse osmosis, and ion exchange resins. (However, kdf can break the bond between\nchlorine and ammonia (ie chloramine) allowing carbon to readily absorb both.)\n\nPhysical Issues\n\nReverse osmosis filters take up more space under your sink than is necessary\n\nReverse osmosis providers recommend that you periodically clean your system with chlorine\n\nOther Issues\n\nUnderstanding the shortcomings of reverse osmosis, providers are more and more frequently combining ro with other types of filtration and even with units to rebuild the water to drinking quality - making larger, more complex and more expensive units in order to achieve what is better done by classic filtration.\n\n* To illustrate how reverse osmosis water takes minerals from your body: You cannot use reverse osmosis in a whole house system if copper pipes follow - because the water takes minerals from the pipes in order to replenish itself. In doing so, it breaks down the pipes. Do you want this process to go on in your own body?"

      "text": "our supporters\n\nClick on a word below to find out more about some of the terms used throughout the site.\n\nBottled Water\n\nWhat's wrong with bottled water?\n\nWhy bottle? Production and transportation of bottled water creates greenhouse gas emissions and garbage. Plus, it upsets water levels in our lakes and groundwater, with no clear health advantages for consumers.\n\nWaste created by bottled water\n\nA quarter of the 89 billion litres of bottled water consumed every year is consumed outside the country of its origin. Hence the transportation of bottled water also produces large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions. As well, creating the plastic used in bottled water packaging requires large amounts of energy, and more emissions. Manufacturing the 29 billion plastic bottles used for water in the United States each year requires the equivalent of more than 17 million barrels of crude oil.\n\nHealth impacts of tap vs. bottled water\n\nBottled water is not a safer alternative to tap water, as claimed by water bottling companies. While tap water is tested regularly, water bottling plants are inspected only once every three or so years. Studies have found that bacteria levels in bottled water are much higher than in tap water.\n\nEnvironmental impacts of bulk water removal\n\nBulk water removal for bottled water damages local drinking water sources, groundwater quality, ecosystems and residents. First Nations groups are concerned that bulk water removals or diversions could affect treaty rights.\n\nNestle Waters North America takes 3.6 million litres of water per day from groundwater in the Guelph, Ontario area. This is causing a reversal of groundwater flow to the Mill Creek. This harms the ecosystem, local species, and groundwater supplies used for drinking water.\n\nWhat can I do?\n\nRefuse to purchase bottled water.\n\nCarry a refillable stainless-steel or a BPA -free water bottle, instead of buying plastic disposable water bottles.\n\nContact your local councillor and demand access to free tap water at city events, and water fountains in local parks/areas.\n\nClimate Change\n\nWhat is climate change?\n\nClimate change is a natural process. However, recent changes to the Earth's climate have been caused by human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\n\nHow will it affect the Great Lakes?\n\nA warmer climate means more severe storms, which will overwhelm storm and sewage drains. Heavy rains also move more fertilizers and toxins from land to water, leading to big, toxic algae blooms. These blooms not only poison ecosystems, but can thicken to levels which suffocate the aquatic life underneath them.\n\nWarmer weather leads to more evaporation which will reduce water levels, impacting wildlife habitat. Studies have shown that the Great Lakes have lost upwards of 70% of their ice cover over the last 40 years.\n\nWhat about the people who live on the Lakes?\n\nAs major storms challenge our storm drains, municipalities will have to spend more money improving old stormwater systems to reduce flooding and maintain drinking water quality. Storms and heavy rainfall can also increase waterborne diseases that aren't easily filtered out by the systems we currently have.\n\nInadequate Green Space\n\nGreen space is undeveloped land, or land that is left in a natural or semi-natural state. Examples include parks, forests, and even home gardens.\n\nWhy is green space important to the Great Lakes?\n\nThe benefits of green space are almost endless. Green space filters pollution out of air and water, moderates temperatures, protects drinking water sources, swallows up carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to climate change, provides vital habitat for birds and animals, reduces flooding, helps prevent soil erosion, encourages local food growth, reduces urban runoff, provides recreation space for locals and tourists, and lowers the burden on municipal storm water systems.\n\nWhat if there isn't enough of it?\n\nWithout adequate green space, we don't have enough trees to filter air pollution. Grass and dirt help decompose pollutants, but if those same pollutants end up on concrete roads they just get washed into the Great Lakes when it rains. And instead of having moist soil to absorb heavy rain, rain runs quickly into overloaded creeks and storm drains which can cause flooding in streets and homes.\n\nHow can I help preserve green space in my neighbourhood?\n\nLuckily it's easy to protect and enhance local green space.\n\n· Plant and maintain trees in your community\n· If you have a yard, grow native, drought-resistant plants\n· Water your garden with a rain barrel\n· Use parks in your neighbourhood – use it or lose it!\n· Compost household waste – it's great at absorbing water\n· Take the Greenbelt Pledge\n\nInvasive Alien Species\n\nAlien species are organisms from one part of the world that have been introduced into a new habitat in another part of the world.\n\nA species becomes invasive when it thrives so well that it causes ecological, environmental, and economic damage.\n\nHow do they get into the Great Lakes?\n\nMany alien species were introduced into the Great Lakes on purpose, mainly for economic reasons. Others hitched a ride on the bottom of a boat, or were carried into the Lakes in the ballast water of shipping freighters.\n\nWhy should I be concerned?\n\nInvasive alien species can seriously threaten the biodiversity of your region. They also cause economic damage by devastating fisheries and harming water treatment systems.\n\nWhat can I do?\n\nYou can help prevent new species from entering a water system:\n\nIf you are a boater, make sure to wash your boat when moving from one lake to another.\n\nIf you fish, don't empty your bait bucket in or near the water – it's illegal.\n\nDon't release fishy or amphibian pets into the wild; organizations like Little Res Q [ can help you handle pets you can't care for anymore.\n\nYou can also report invasive species [ to the Ministry of Natural Resources if you see them.\n\nNearshore Waters\n\nWhat is considered nearshore?\n\nThe nearshore starts at the shoreline and extends to where warm surface waters reach the lake bed in early Fall. How deep the nearshore goes depends on weather patterns and the depth of the lake overall.\n\nThis has led to algae blooms along the shores of some of the Great Lakes. Algae blooms and reduced oxygen have harmed nearshore habitats, killing off the organisms that feed fish that live in deeper waters. These offshore fish are now dying from lack of food.\n\nWhy are nearshore areas important?\n\nNearshore areas are our beaches. Smelly algae blooms, zebra mussels, and extra bacteria make it tough to enjoy the Lakes. Nearshore areas are also a major source of drinking water. Pollution in nearshore waters makes drinking water smelly and difficult to treat.\n\nThe fish we catch and eat are also fed by organisms living in nearshore waters. Reduced fish populations can cause economic damage to sport and commercial fishing industries.\n\nWhat can we do?\n\nIn 2008, Ontario introduced the Lake Simcoe Protection Act. Among other protections, the Act addresses the causes of nearshore degradation. Adopting similar laws for the Great Lakes would help restore nearshore areas and prevent further damage.\n\nFor more solutions, see \"Engaging Solutions in the Great Lakes\", Environmental Commissioner of Ontario, \n\nPharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products\n\nWhat kinds of personal care and pharmaceuticals are found in the Great Lakes?\n\nPersonal care products like shampoos, toothpastes, makeup and soaps can contain chemicals that cause cancer and other harmful effects. These chemicals eventually find their way to the water system. Pharmaceuticals like antidepressants, antibiotics, pain killers and even birth control have also been found in Great Lakes waters.\n\nHow do they get there?\n\nWhat goes into waste water systems goes into the lakes. Unused medications may get flushed or thrown into the garbage. Products like perfume, shampoos and bug repellent get washed down the shower drain. Even some of the medications we take get peed out into waste water systems.\n\nWhat do these substances do?\n\nThere is a concern that over time these chemicals could cause cancer, disrupt normal hormone processes, and make us resistant to antibiotics.\n\nCan they be removed from our drinking water?\n\nThe trouble with these chemicals is that normal sewage and drinking water systems weren't designed to treat this kind of pollution. Even the most innovative sewage treatment plant [ proposed in Ontario doesn't promise to remove pharmaceuticals and personal care products from the water it treats.\n\nNew technologies [ are being developed to remove these chemicals before they ever reach your tap, but they're a long way from being installed.\n\nPhosphorus Pollution\n\nWhat is phosphorus?\n\nPhosphorus is a naturally occurring nutrient. Phosphorus becomes a problem when there is too much of it in one place.\n\nHow does extra phosphorus get into the Great Lakes?\n\nPhosphorus is found in sewage, fertilizer, manure, and many detergents. Farms and construction sites release the phosphorus in disturbed soil. Phosphorus makes its way into rivers and lakes through ditches, municipal wastewater systems and storm drains.\n\nWhat does it do?\n\nExcess phosphorus leads to algae blooms. When too much algae exists in a water system, it creates oxygen-deprived areas that are fatal to fish and other plants.\n\nPhosphorus pollution first became an issue in the 1960s, when it caused so much algae to bloom Lake Erie that the lake was considered \"dead.\"\n\nWhat has been done to fix this?\n\nThe situation in Lake Erie inspired Canada and the US to sign the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement in 1972.\n\nMeasures taken to reduce the amount of phosphorus going into the Lakes allowed them to recover. However, new sources of phosphorus and invasive species like zebra and quagga mussels now threaten to undo that progress. Lake Erie's problems have returned.\n\nWhat can I do to help?\n\nMaintain septic systems.\n\nUse natural, phosphate-free fertilizer, or replace your lawn with native plants and shrubs.\n\nRiparian Zone Impacts\n\nWhat are riparian zones?\n\nA riparian zone is the transition area between a river and the land around it. For example, if you look at an aerial photo of a healthy stream, the band of trees and thick vegetation surrounding it is the riparian zone.\n\nWhy are riparian zones important?\n\nRiparian zones act as important links between different ecosystems, and provide diverse habitats for different species. They allow nutrients to travel from one area to another, and help clean and purify drinking water.\n\nHow are riparian zones impacted?\n\nThere are two types of impacts.\n\n1) Direct changes to stream morphology, such as dams and channelization.\n\nDams alter water levels and introduce barriers that fish and other species can't cross. Channelization involves straightening and clearing a stream, which removes species habitat.\n\n2) Indirect changes to riparian zone habitats, like land clearing and mining.\n\nLand clearing for farming and urban development eliminates species habitat and prevents vital nutrients from entering the ecosystem through dead trees. Mining introduces extra sediment and new toxins into the stream, upsetting its habitat and delicate nutrient balance.\n\nWhat can I do to help?\n\nThere are many not-for-profit groups in Ontario dedicated to restoring streams in the Great Lakes and nearby basins. Stream restoration is a great way to get involved in your community and have a direct positive influence on your local environment.\n\nToxic Substances in the Great Lakes\n\nWhat are they?\n\nPesticides, flame retardants, phthalates, and chemicals from paint and fuel have all been found in the Great Lakes.\n\nWhere do they come from?\n\nToxins are released in the waste water from factories. Pesticides are sprayed on lawns and fields and are carried into the Lakes by rain. Some toxics come through the leftover paint that gets poured down a sewer grate, or they're washed off roads that are covered in motor oil and car exhaust.\n\nWhat do these toxic chemicals do?\n\nMany of these toxic chemicals are endochrine disruptors. Endochrine disrupting chemicals get in the way of normal hormone processes in the body.\n\nEndocrine disruptors have been linked to breast cancer, fertility problems, and birth defects.\n\nWhat can I do?\n\nBecause many of these toxic chemicals come from everyday things you use in your home, there are steps you can take to help keep them from getting into the Great Lakes.\n\nFor more information on what you can do, visit Environmental Defence's Toxic Nation Campaign [\n\nCanada and the United States have also been working together since 1987 to help clean up the Great Lakes through the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, among others.\n\nFor more information:\n\n\"Chemicals of Emerging Concern in the Great Lakes Region\", International Joint Commission, 2012,"

      "text": "Introduction to Ozone\n\nOne of nature's most powerful oxidizers (second only to elemental fluorine), ozone has been used as a powerful organic sanitizer since the early 1900s. Ozone is widely used for water treatment, including disinfection of municipal water supplies, swimming pools, spas, cooling towers, and sewage treatment plants. Today, nearly all bottled water is treated with ozone. The United States Department of Agriculture accepted ozone as safe and suitable for use in the production of meat and poultry products in 2000 (Final Ruling), and the United States Food and Drug Administration approved ozone as an antimicrobial agent for food in 2001. Ozone is recognized as an efficient sanitizing agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization.\n\nWhy Ozone?\n\nUnlike other sanitizers, such as chlorine bleach, ozone gas does not damage or impact the integrity of the fabric or padding.\n\nOzone gas can sanitize fabrics and items that are non-washable.\n\nOzone eliminates the use of hot water.\n\nOzone is very inexpensive to produce.\n\nOzone substantially reduces offensive odors, which are likely the result of decomposition of the bacteria and viruses.\n\nOzone will not damage, discolor, or decrease the life of paper, wood, metal or glass items and most plastics"

      "text": "microorganismsIntroduction\n\nUltraviolet (UV) technology was originally used to ensure the adequate disinfection of municipal drinking water. Since its introduction over 40 years' ago it is now applied globally for disinfection, TOC (total organic carbon) reduction, de-ozonation and de-chlorination of water in many different industries, including food and beverage industries, pharmaceutical manufacturing, aquaculture, pools and leisure, shipping and oil drilling.\n\nUV kills all known spoilage microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, yeasts and moulds (and their spores). It is a low maintenance, environmentally friendly technology which eliminates the need for chemical treatment while ensuring high levels of disinfection.\n\nIn this article Jon Ryan, Managing Director of Hanovia Limited, discusses the myriad applications where UV is now routinely used on a daily basis worldwide.\n\nHow UV disinfection works\n\nUV is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum between visible light and X-rays. The specific portion of the UV spectrum between 185-400nm (known as UV-C) has a strong germicidal effect, with peak effectiveness at 265nm. At these wavelengths UV eliminates microorganisms by penetrating their cell membranes and damaging the DNA, making them unable to reproduce and effectively killing them.\n\nA typical UV disinfection system consists of a UV lamp housed in a protective quartz sleeve and mounted within a cylindrical stainless steel chamber. The liquid to be treated enters at one end and passes along the entire length of the chamber before exiting at the other end. Virtually any liquid can be effectively treated with UV, including water, sugar syrups, beverages and effluent.\n\nThere are no microorganisms known to be resistant to UV – this includes pathogenic bacteria such as Listeria, Legionella and Cryptosporidium (and its spores, which are resistant to chlorination). The UV dose necessary for deactivation varies from one species to another and is measured in millijoules per square centimetre (mJ/cm2). Values for specific microorganisms have been experimentally established and are used to determine the type and size of UV system required.\n\nThe dose received by an organism in a UV treatment system is dependent on four main factors:\n\n1. The energy output of the UV source\n2. The flow rate of the fluid through the treatment chamber\n3. The transmission value (ability to transmit UV light) of the fluid being treated\n4. The geometry of the treatment chamber\n\nBy optimising these criteria, a UV system can be tailored to effectively treat large or small flows, as well as viscous fluids or those containing dissolved solids and high levels of starch or sugar compounds.\n\nThere are two main types of UV technology based on the type of UV lamps used: low pressure and medium pressure. Low pressure lamps have a monochromatic UV output (limited to a single wavelength at 254nm), whereas medium pressure lamps have a polychromatic UV output (with an output between 185-400nm).\n\nBenefits of UV Disinfection\n\nUV disinfection has many advantages over alternative methods. Unlike chemical treatment, UV does not introduce toxins or residues into process water and does not alter the chemical composition, taste, odour or pH of the fluid being disinfected.\n\nUV treatment can be used for primary water disinfection or as a back-up for other water purification methods such as carbon filtration, reverse osmosis or pasteurisation. Since UV disinfection does not rely on a chemical residual, the location(s) of the units should be carefully considered for optimum performance.\n\nUV applications\n\nFood, beverage and brewing industries\n\nDisinfection of direct contact water\nAlthough municipal water supplies are normally free from harmful or pathogenic microorganisms, this should not be assumed. In addition, water from private sources such as natural springs could also be contaminated. Any water used as an ingredient, or coming in direct contact with the product, can therefore be a source of contamination. UV disinfects this water without chemicals or pasteurisation. It also allows the re-use of process water, saving money and improving productivity without risking the quality of the product.\n\nCIP (Clean-in-Place) rinse water\nIt is essential that the CIP final rinse water used to flush out foreign matter and disinfecting solutions is microbiologically safe. Fully automated UV disinfection systems can be integrated with CIP rinse cycles to ensure final rinse water does not reintroduce microbiological contaminants. Because of their high energy density, MP lamps are less affected by any sudden changes in the temperature of the CIP water than a LP lamp.\n\nFilter disinfection\nReverse osmosis (RO) and granular activated carbon (GAC) are often used to filter process water, but can be a breeding ground for bacteria. UV is an effective way of disinfecting both stored RO and GAC filtered water and has been used in the process industries for many years.\n\nCooling media and chiller disinfection\nSome meat and dairy products are subject to contamination after heat treatment or cooking. UV provides an excellent way to protect foods from contamination by contact-cooling fluids.\n\nSugar syrups\nSugar syrups can be a prime breeding ground for microorganisms. Although syrups with very high sugar content do not support microbial growth, any dormant spores may become active after the syrup has been diluted. Treating the syrup and dilution water with UV prior to use will ensure any dormant microorganisms are deactivated.\n\nLiquid sweeteners\nSucrose-based sweeteners can be a prime breeding ground for microorganisms. UV systems are available specifically for treating these syrups.\n\nDe-aerated liquor\nDe-aerated liquor is added as part of a high gravity brewing process, often in the packaging operation. This liquor is added directly to the beer so needs to be kept free from contamination by gram negative bacteria, which can cause off-flavours and acidity.\n\nYeast preparation\nThe problems associated with yeast preparation in breweries are well recognised and include hazes, altered fermentation and surface membranes on packaged beer. A single cell of Sacchoromyces (var. Turbidans) in 16 million cells of pitching yeast will cause detectable hazes. UV destroys all known yeasts and their spores.\n\nWaste water\nAs part of a multi-barrier process, including filtration, UV can destroy microorganisms in the effluent from food and beverage facilities prior to discharge. As UV reduces reliance on hazardous chemicals, it also ensures all discharges meet with local environmental regulations.\n\nBromates and bottled water – UV as an alternative to ozonation\n\nNongfu Spring Co. Ltd., one of China's leading producers of bottled water and beverages, has recently opted to use UV for its production plants across China. This is a major milestone in the bottled water industry – particularly in China – because presently in that country virtually all bottled water is disinfected using ozone. And around the world ozone is still the disinfection method of choice for many producers.\n\nThe decision by Nongfu Spring to opt for UV was driven by a number of reasons, not least of which was concerns about ozonation by-products such as bromate. In fact, Hanovia has noticed that more and more bottled water and soft drinks producers are now looking for ozone alternatives, and enquiries about UV are on the increase.\n\nBromide ions occur naturally in many spring waters and on their own pose no problem. However, the presence of ozone can cause conversion of bromide into bromate, with the consequent potential for consumer health problems. The World Health Organization (WHO) lists bromate as a carcinogenic substance and recommends its maximum limit in mineral water be set at 0.01mg/l (10ppb). In July 2008 the Chinese General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ), recommended in a revised draft national standard for drinking water and mineral water that a maximum limit for bromate in bottled water be in line the WHO guidelines. This limit has now been in force since October 2009.\n\nPharmaceutical industry\n\nDisinfection\nAs in the food and beverage industries, UV is used to disinfect water used in the manufacturing process, whether it is for direct product make-up or for rinsing and washing process equipment.\n\nTOC reduction\nShort UV wavelengths (below 200nm) are highly effective at breaking down organic molecules present in water, especially low molecular weight contaminants. The process works in two ways: the first method is by direct photolysis, when energy from the UV actually breaks down chemical bonds within the organics; the second method is by the photolysis of water molecules, splitting them to create charged OH- radicals, which also attack the organics.\n\nDechlorination\nTo date, the two most commonly used methods of chlorine removal have been granular activated carbon (GAC) filters or the addition of neutralising chemicals such as sodium bisulphite and sodium metabisulphite. Both of these methods have their advantages, but they also have a number of significant drawbacks. GAC filters, because of their porous structure and nutrient-rich environment, can become a breeding ground for bacteria. Dechlorination chemicals such as sodium bisulphite, which are usually injected just in front of RO membranes, can also act as incubators for bacteria, causing biofouling of the membranes. In addition, these chemicals are hazardous to handle and there is a danger of over- or under-dosing due to human error.\n\nUV is now becoming increasingly popular as an effective alternative method of dechlorination. It has none of the drawbacks of GAC or neutralising chemicals, while effectively reducing both free chlorine and combined chlorine compounds (chloramines) into easily removed by-products.\n\nAquaculture\n\nIncreased water extraction and lowered water quality can result in increased outbreaks of viral and bacterial fish diseases in the aquaculture industry. Due to the intensive nature of fish farming, fish stock is also highly susceptible to infection from natural fish populations in the water feeding the farm. To break the infection cycle between fish farms and natural fish populations, a disinfection system is needed to treat water entering and circulating within fish farms.\n\nUV is ideally suited for these applications as it uses no chemicals and does not create by-products which would harm the fish stock, or other aquatic life, on discharge. Unlike other treatment methods, UV avoids the expense of complex monitoring systems involved in adding and removing chemicals before the water reaches the fish. In addition, it does not alter the pH of the water. Indeed, UV is the most economical disinfection technique that can be used in fish aquaculture. Applications include treatment of water in hatcheries, shell-fish purging tanks and fry rearing tanks, and recirculation water in marine parks and aquaria.\n\nSwimming pools and spas\n\nUV is now a well-established method of swimming pool water treatment, from hydrotherapy spas to full-sized competition pools. This growth in popularity has been largely due to UV's reliability and ease of use. Another major factor is the reduced reliance on traditional chemical treatments it affords, particularly chlorine. UV is also highly effective at destroying chlorine-resistant microorganisms like Cryptosporidium and Giardia.\n\nSome of the more unpleasant by-products of chlorination are chloramines, formed when chlorine reacts with sweat or urine in pool water. Trichloramines in particular are powerful irritants which are responsible for eye and respiratory complaints and the unpleasant smells commonly associated with indoor public pools. They are also corrosive and in time can lead to damage to pool buildings and structures such as ventilation ducts.\n\nAnother major benefit of UV is that it significantly reduces the need for backwashing and dilution, saving hundreds of pounds a month for pool operators.\n\nLink between chloramines and asthma\n\nA recent study found an increased incidence of asthma in children who swam regularly in chlorinated pools. In some cases the damage was equivalent to that found in heavy smokers. Even people sitting at the sides of pools, such as lifeguards and instructors, were found to be at risk.\n\nThe symptoms are caused, the researchers believe, by chloramines – particularly trichloramines. The problem is potentially so serious that the study's authors suggested pool operators should seriously consider alternatives to chlorine-based disinfection. They also recommended better ventilation to help remove chloramine-laden air from pool surroundings, improved hygiene practices by bathers themselves – such as showering before swimming – and the regular renewal of pool water.\n\nWhile further research is needed, these findings add further credence to the importance of reducing chloramines as much as possible.\n\nShip Ballast Water\n\nAll ocean-going vessels take on water to provide ballast and stability. It is usually taken on in coastal port areas and transported to the next port of call, where it may be discharged. The IMO (International Maritime Organisation) sets tough standards to treat all ballast water prior to discharge, and UV disinfection – in conjunction with filtration – is now one of the accepted methods of treatment.\n\nOil Drilling\n\nThe control of bacteria in injection water – the water injected back into an oil or gas reservoir to increase pressure and stimulate production – is vital in the oil and gas industry. Inadequate treatment can cause 'souring' of the reservoir with hydrogen sulphide gas or microbial induced corrosion of drilling equipment. Recent studies commissioned by Hanovia have shown that UV disinfection is effective at preventing bacterial contamination of injection water.\n\nConclusion\n\nMeeting the increasingly rigorous hygiene standards required in the production of food, beverages and pharmaceuticals, as well water quality concerns in the leisure, aquaculture, shipping and oil drilling industries, now finding applications in many other industries.\n\nUV disinfection systems are easy to install, with minimum disruption to the plant. They need very little maintenance, the only requirement being replacement of the UV lamps every 9 – 12 months, depending on use. This is a simple operation that takes only a few minutes and can be carried out by general maintenance staff.\n\nHanovia's Singapore distributor, Repassa Singapore Pte Ltd, will be representing the company at Interphex Asia this May. Interphex Asia is the region's leading trade show for the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries.\n\nThe Hanovia 'dry' UV monitor for use with the company's PharmaLine PQ UV disinfection system\n\n(Caption: The Hanovia 'dry' UV monitor for use with the company's PharmaLine PQ UV disinfection system)\n\nLocated at booth 312, Repassa will be offering demonstrations of Hanovia's 'dry' UV monitor for use with the new PharmaLine PQ range of UV systems. The dry monitor is unique as it is located within the chamber, but outside the water flow. This allows the controller to automatically correct the dose calculation as UV transmittance varies, without the need for an external UV transmittance monitor. It provides absolute UV intensity monitoring in real-time and, because it remains outside the water flow, it can be removed and inspected without interrupting the process. The dry monitor also allows for field verification using a portable reference UV sensor.\n\nRepassa will also have posters and brochures with information about Hanovia's entire high purity UV disinfection product range.\n\nUV disinfection specialist Hanovia has appointed Aqua Italy as a new Italian distributor. Aqua Italy will handle all sales enquiries and provide technical support for existing and new Hanovia products in all applications excluding the pool and leisure market.\n\nEstablished in 1976, Aqua Italy has many years' experience in the water treatment industry, particularly for pharmaceutical and other high purity processes. The company is internationally recognized for its expertise and wide range of water treatment capabilities, with a presence in many international markets, including South America, the Middle East and Russia.\n\nBased in the United Kingdom, with a worldwide distributor network, Hanovia is a world leader in UV disinfection technology for industrial applications.

      "text": "First, some facts: Americans consumed 9.1 billion gallons of bottled water in 2011. On average, each American used 221 half liter bottles per year. Roughly seventy percent of those bottles were not recycled.\n\nClass of 2014, it doesn't take a Baker Scholar, or even Erik Peterson, to realize that trashing approximately 53 billion plastic water bottles every year is not ideal. Most plastics do not decompose quickly or completely. It takes hundreds if not thousands of years for plastic bottles to decompose in landfill. If plastic is washed out to the cold dark depths of the sea, it doesn't decompose at all; it just fragments into smaller and smaller pieces that accumulate in the ocean. These pieces of plastic can have direct effects on marine life, such as malnourished fish, and longer-term effects on ocean ecosystems that are not yet well understood.\n\nThat's only what it takes to dispose of bottled water. Even more troubling is how much oil it takes to produce it. The Earth Policy Institute calculates that we used about fifty million oil barrels worth of energy to feed our bottled water habit in 2006. That's 2.5 days of total US oil consumption.\n\nAnd no, it's not because all the water needs to be shipped here from an eternal spring in Fiji.\n\n45% of all bottled water in the US is tap water that is purified to remove minerals and adulterants and sold at an enormous markup.

Come and try to prove to us that Evian does taste better, and at the end of the week we will share the results.\n\nThe taste test is just one of a series of events that Sustainability Associates and Section Green Reps will be running over the next two weeks, in order to promote awareness of the facts about bottled water and encourage HBS students to use their Swell water bottles instead. We'll be running randomized audits by section to count the number of people drinking bottled water, screening the movie \"Tapped\" with free beers for the first 50 people who arrive (8pm, March 5th at the Grille), and eventually asking people to sign one of the following two pledges. In order of hardcore-ness, they are:\n\n1) \"No more bottled water, for the rest of the RC year.\"\n\n2) \"I will recycle every water bottle I drink at HBS, for the rest of RC year.\"\n\nIf you want to take a sticker to put on your name card, so that you make a statement and your buddies can hold you accountable, the section reps will be happy to give you one.\n\nIf we get one hundred pledges, we'll have saved thousands of water bottles from landfill. And we'll be catching up a bit with the Harvard Faculty Club, which in November banned bottled water and introduced the snazzy bottle below for guests, as well as many other campuses that have banned or restricted bottled water.\n\nIf you're an RC, contributing to the taste tests, audits, and pledges will accumulate points for your section in the Green Cup Competition. The Green Cup grand prize is $1,000 for your section to spend however you wish. Whoever wins, enjoy the party!

      "text": "Bottled Water Is Still A Scam\n\nJuly 3, 2007\n\nEmbed:\n\nBottled water in America is generally less healthy than tap water, extraordinarily more expensive, and far more destructive to the environment. It's something I started blogging about years ago, and thanks to an an exceptional package of stories in Fast Company, I had a reminder to revisit the issue.\n\nFrom my old post:\n\nIn case you don't know, bottled water is an incredible scam. I used to help out with running a water company when I was a kid, so I got a good background in the stringent set of requirements that utilities must meet when providing drinking water to a community. Generally, bottled water doesn't have to meet standards that are anywhere near as tightly regulated in regards to contaminants, filtering, or purity. Not to mention the fact that waterwhich stagnates in plastic containers on supermarket shelves frequently has a higher bacteria count than water from public utilities.\n\nMeanwhile, the Fast Company article adds an incredible amount of new specifics, particularly about the explosive growth in sales of bottled water. As Charles Fishman says,\n\nBottled water is often simply an indulgence, and despite the stories we tell ourselves, it is not a benign indulgence. We're moving 1 billion bottles of water around a week in ships, trains, and trucks in the United States alone. That's a weekly convoy equivalent to 37,800 18-wheelers delivering water. (Water weighs 81/3 pounds a gallon. It's so heavy you can't fill an 18-wheeler with bottled water—you have to leave empty space.)\nMeanwhile, one out of six people in the world has no dependable, safe drinking water. The global economy has contrived to deny the most fundamental element of life to 1 billion people, while delivering to us an array of water \"varieties\" from around the globe, not one of which we actually need. That tension is only complicated by the fact that if we suddenly decided not to purchase the lake of Poland Spring water in Hollis, Maine, none of that water would find its way to people who really are thirsty.\n\nIt's worth reiterating that Aquafina and Dasani are just tap water. There's nothing wrong with that, since tap water is very good water — it's just not worth paying 500 times as much for. I don't have any argument against the convenience factor, either, since it makes perfect sense to take water with you when you're on the go. You'll just get something that's got less bacteria and generally better quality if you fill your bottle from your tap. It's also worth checking out this story for the slideshows that are displayed alongside it; These usually just seem like blatant attempts for magazines to increase their page views online, but in this case they seem to have actually included original content and research.\n\nSome of the other points made in the article:\n\nFiji Water produces more than a million bottles a day, while more than half the people in Fiji do not have reliable drinking water.\n\nIf the water we use at home cost what even cheap bottled water costs, our monthly water bills would run $9,000.\n\n24% of the bottled water we buy is tap water repackaged by Coke and Pepsi.\n\nThe bubbles in San Pellegrino are extracted from volcanic springs in Tuscany, then trucked north and injected into the water from the source.\n\nWe pitch into landfills 38 billion water bottles a year—in excess of $1 billion worth of plastic.\n\nWorldwide, 1 billion people have no reliable source of drinking water; 3,000 children a day die from diseases caught from tainted water.\n\nI'd encourage everybody to take a look at the Fast Company article — it makes it clear that the costs of bottled water, aside from its extraordinarily expensive price, are simply not worth it. And that's not even taking into account the fact that a lot of experts think the next resource that will spark a wide-scale international conflict isn't going to be oil, but fresh drinking water.\n\n3 TrackBacks\n\nAnil Dash: Bottled Water Is Still A Scam: It's worth reiterating that Aquafina and Dasani are just tap water.

Read More\n\n74 Comments\n\nI find that one of the main reasons I buy bottled water is that they make a cheap readily available container for tap water. I use a bottle until it starts to smell a little and then figure I should probably spring for a new bottle of water.\n\nI however admit (confess?) this is not the most responsible use of resources. Has anyone done any research on the best portable and refillable containers for water?\n\nAlso, any thoughts on water filters like those offered by Brita? I find that I prefer the taste of water that has been filtered. It often tastes cleaner and less \"chemically\" to me even if those tastes I am detecting are safe.\n\nGreat information, Anil. I've always thought it odd that anyone would buy what can be had by opening a tap, and the points about who gets the water are right on. But on the other hand, are water bottling companies selling water or are they selling convenience? When you lay out 2 bucks for that Dasani, is it for the water or the bottle it's in?\n\nThe argument is nuanced for people who live outside the city and drink well water. Their tap water is often not very good and can be quite hard, though it is still safe to drink. It is more difficult to fault those people for buying bottled water, especially given that they're buying it instead of soda or juice (whereas a city-dweller is buying bottled water as opposed to not buying anything).\n\nCall your company \"Tap Water\" and and sell local water, straight from the tap, but put into the most eco-friendly bottles you can find. Encourage people in restaurants and at home to drink \"Tap Water\" straight from the tap, but buy your \"Tap Water\" when out and about.\n\nNot only can you advertise against Fiji water being transported miles by air, spring water being transported hundreds of miles by truck, you can even beat Dasani by not wasting energy re-treating water, just test it to ensure it's quality and work with local water companies to ensure the quality.\n\nIf you then gave some large percentage of your profits to providing clean drinking water to the entire world (which also happens to open up new markets for you to sell portable tap water) and you've got a killer green product.\n\nYou could also sell branded re-usable containers so that people can advertise that they're drinking tap water (in an iPod earbud style).\n\nI have to admit this might work better in countries (like Scotland or Wales) or regions where people are already proud of their water.\n\nI just realised you could work the nationalist, keep jobs local angle too. I can't believe no-one's done this already heyMy wife and I buy as little bottle water as possible and, as shmuel said, we usually refill the few bottles we buy with tap water.\n\nThe thing is, water is so important to human health that no one should not drink bottled water (or as little as possible). The one best investment we did make in our home was a sophisticated water purification system. It cost us over $6000 (Canadian) but it was worth every penny.\n\nThe main system removes chlorine, smell and taste with a (huge) activated carbon filter tank then the water goes through a different tank filled with a special resin that takes out heavy metals as well as lots of other stuff but mostly it removes the hardness of the water.\n\nIn our small town, the water didn't smell and wasn't too chlorinated but it was very hard and stained sinks, the bathtub and the toilet with yellow hard water residue that was also near impossible to wash out. This problem is completely gone for us. Clothes feel softer and showering is a very different experience than before (softened and \"de-chlorinated\" water does not remove natural skin oils). For someone like me that suffers from dry skin isues, this alone was worth the investment.\n\nBut closer to the topic at hand, we now have a separate tap connected to a reverse osmosis filtration system in our kitchen and we only drink and cook that water. Again, huge difference. The water has no foreign taste or smell and it feels pure and more refreshing somehow. Plus, I am able to drink more of it more easily. It's a huge difference from even Brita filtered water which will remove most of the taste and smell but not to the extent of a complete water treatment system.\n\nWe bring plastic bottles at work and only drink \"our\" water now. We bough largish heavy plastic bottles that we wash in the dishwasher once in a while. We bring our filtered tap water to work or on car trips or whatever and we feel much better for it.\n\nI know that not everyone can afford such a system but it made such a difference to such a fundamental part of our lives that I would recommend one to anybody who's concerned with the quality of their water.\n\nBottled water is among the stupidest qualities of modern living I can imagine. Well that, and re-electing Bush. The only time I end up drinking bottled water is on road trips, where it can be otherwise hard to find just plain old tap water.\n\nI drink bottled water constantly, usually Volvic or Poland Spring. It just tastes a lot better than tap water.\n\nI'm under no illusions that I'm making the world a better place by doing this. Paying for something that I enjoy does not mean that I'm a sucker, and the people selling it to me are not committing a scam. The fact that you don't even mention the possibility that some bottled water may actually taste better to some people indicates that you really don't have a solid grasp of the situation at all.\n\nNot to rain on your parade, but this is a business. They don't care if their water is inefficient and worse than tapwater. As long as there is market demand, they have no reason to stop. OK, so you don't like bottled water, but millions of others do.\n\nMichael (miconian), I'm sorry that you don't care about the impacts of your choices. I'm far from perfect in terms of my resource footprint on the world, but most moral people I know do care about such things. That's who I had in mind while writing the post.\n\nAs far as the issue of taste goes, I haven't found any indication that water quality in Hoboken, where you live, has any impurities that would affect taste. I'm quite sure that if you ran your water through a cheap Brita filter, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between your bottled water and tap water. Hoboken Water Supplies lists very few contaminants, and the info there certainly seems in line with the impurities in Polan d Spring's sourcing.\n\nElliott, I do understand it's a business driven by demand. I think by educating people, we can reduce demand for a wasteful product, or at least increase the pressure on the businesses to be more efficient in their use of resources.\n\nDrinkable tap water is such a luxury, how many don't have that, it's obsene abuse not to use it. It's funny to see people complain about the price of petrol, while they happly pay far more for a bottle of water. I know which is easier to find, package and distribute...\n\nBottled water is a convenience. Many people have cut way down on soda drinking, for health/weight reasons. So, instead they buy a bottled water as an easy, convenient, available, portable, disposable water source.\n\nThey probably refill that water bottle with tap water. They probably just drink tap water at home.\n\nMaybe more people should get in the habit of carrying Nalgene bottles with them everywhere they go. But, until then, buying a water bottle is a nice option to have.\n\nHeres a couple thoughts to chew on though...\nif so many of the residents at these places we buy bottled water from (ex: fiji) don't have drinkable water, and if we didn't buy that water its not like it would get to the residents who need it - its only an argument FOR buying drinking water - you are putting money back into that country's economy and helping them in a small way.\nLike wine... water from all over the world tastes different and needs to be experienced... there are plenty of people who can't afford wine, but does that mean the people who can shouldn't try wine from all over the world because its a luxury?\nAlso, if you live in an area and drink water from there for your whole life, you start getting a build up of the minerals/additives that are in that water... granted if you live in an area where the minerals/additives to the water has health benefits or no effect at all, thats great... but if you live in a place where the minerals/additives naturally occuring in the water has negative benefits, than over time you will be better off mixing it up, tap water + bottled water...\n\nWhy do only focus on people that enjoy bottled water and let the soda/juice drinkers off the hook. While one out of six people in the world have no dependable, safe drinking water; we add sugar, food coloring and various chemicals to out perfectly good water, eroding its nutritional value. Soda/juice drinking seems no less morally irresponsible to me. Although I have a readily available source of tasty tap water in my house, I don't when I'm driving in my car or walking around town. So there are situation where buying water makes sense to me. Bottled water has a valid place in the marketplace, so unless you are willing to give up all bottled beverages it seems a little hypocritical to single out water.\n\nI can see your point that it is really not necessary to use bottled water in your home or office, and I agree their is a certain degree of \"hipness\" attributed to certain brands. But, when you are on the go, for me, it is essential to have that option (and I am no brand snob, what ever is least expensive in a managable sized container). I don't like drinking soda and if you are on the road, getting a drink from a gas station, it is perfect. Especially in Arizona. Considering all the calories, and sugar in pop, and all the chemicals in diet pop, isn't that a valid choice to have available. And if you are really concerned about the environmental impact then why aren't Coke, Pepsi, etc just as guilty with their other products. They are packaged the same way? Yes, I suppose I could use a fountain drink cup and get water from the weird water tab on the dispenser, but you want to talk about tasting bad? what comes our of that spout can barely be called water.Yuck! And again, where does my cup go to die?\n\nPeople just need to stop following the marketing. Most bottled water is not better for you than your tap water. Most people can't really tell a difference in brands. It doesn't make you look cool. But water, in any form, is a better option than the other junk that is shoved down our throats by these companies.\n\nto shmuel, and anyone else who has trouble finding a container for water- nalgene bottles are virtually unbreakable, come in a variety of sizes, can be thrown in the dishwasher, and are very handy for always having water with you. you can buy them at REI ( or any outdoor store or probably lots of other places. i have mine always. in talking to my sister about why she throws away six plastic water bottles a day, it seems the issue is temperature - and maybe that is part of the taste issue too, because i find people at a movie theater where i work much prefer cold water. if that's the case, buy two bottles, and just chill and switch. good for the environment, your health, your wallet…\n\nwater bottles contain bisphenol A (BPA) a chemical that has recently been demonstrated unsafe in peer-reviewed scientific journals. BPA mimics the effects of estrogen in the body.\n\nThe original safety experiments on BPA have been shown to be inadequate and imprecise.\n\nReuse of a water bottle greatly, greatly increases the amount of BPA leached out of the bottle. Especially, cleaning the bottle with detergent, placing acidic liquids (i.e. juice) in the bottle and placing hot water in the bottle will accelerate this leaching.\n\nThere's a lot of debate about this online, check it out. Note that there's also a lot of industry-sponsored \"debate\" out there. regardless, 90% of 130 non-industry sponsored articles have found BPA to be harmful.\n\nI was working in geneva and used to buy a 2l bottle of evian each morning on my way to work.\nAfter a couple of months it dawned on me I could actually see the evian mountains from my desk and all i had to do was turn on a tap to get the exact same water for free!\n\nHe forgot to mention one important point: We drink bottled water because it tastes good. Tap water/municipal water smells like crap and tastes like crap too. That's the number one reason we drink bottled water.\n\nNalgene bottles will befoul the taste of your water after a very short while; I use Nalgene bottles while hiking and they generally last about 3 months before the water is undrinkable. SIGG bottles taste metallic to me.\n\nAlso, a lot of bottled water is carbonated, and some people prefer carbonation. My wife drinks Propel water because she prefers the taste to tap water. I'm not sure how this is any different than any other type of consumption.\n\nEven if you reuse your purchased water bottles with regular tap water, you still end up advertising for the bottling companies that contribute to the overall waste. Then others will continue to follow this trend of wasting valuable resources heyI strictly drink bottled water. I've drank tap water 3 times in 4 yrs. All three were in restaurants. One was a glass of water because they didn't offer bottled water. One was in the Cheesecake Factory where they had replaced their bottled water with tap water and the other was at Salt Grass restaurant where they did the same thing.\n\nSince I have had only spring bottled water in 4 yrs, I am very sensitive to the smells and taste of tap water.\n\nTry drinking nothing but bottled water for a few months. I guarantee if you then take a sip of tap water you'll notice how stinky and sewage like the water smells and tastes.\n\nYes, Aquafina and Dasani are tap water, but it's tap water that has been filtered through reverse osmosis and charcoal filtering. This greatly improves the taste. I usually don't drink bottled water anyways, I drink distilled water.\n\nSo many, many consumers don't realize that if they have a fridge made in the past 6-7 years it probably has a built-in consumer-replaceable water filter. The same filter is used to filter water for the ice maker and water dispenser.\nThen, you can fill that nice bottle with water that is filtered, and the filter specs actually tell you what is removed from the water!\nYes, I work for a company that sells same.\n\nI think you miss one point: it's not the general water condition I fear, it's the quality of the pipes in my home.\n\nI've lived in a number of much older residences in the past few years, and while I don't fear the water coming from the source, I fear that once it makes it onto my house, it's being contaminated with rust, bacteria, or both. Ick.\n\nAnother very important angle is that Bottled water may be harmful as well, due to the slow leaching of an estrogen-like compound, which is used to provide the clarity in the plastic ued to bottle water, but which probably ends up majorly interfering with the body's hormonal balance!\nSome scientists now wonder if this has had a hand in the obesity epidemic in modern society. In a few years we will have a definitive answer -- but it may be a few years too late to switch, for some of us.\n\nI buy bottled water when I'm at work, because all the taps near me are about two feet from a whole lot of raw fish. Even the ones that aren't are in sinks used to clean dishes etc, and the water tastes all soapy. I do reuse the bottles though, filling them at home.\n\nYes, those bottles are a problem but what is in them often a greater problem by orders of magnitude.\n\nPeople often make similar comments to what has been written here as I pull a bottle of water from the coolers these days as though I'm stupid, foolish and uninformed. I'm drinking water people. Not the sugars, not the syrups.\n\nI have read all the comments (some several times). It has been an eye opener. I have checked the water supply in my area (Newark, N.J.) and it seems to be above average. I do use a Britta filter for piece of mind. Thanks for the link and the info.\n\nIs there a similar web site that lists the pollutants in all the popular bottled water? Some areas may find that commercial bottle water contains the same or more pollutants and that boiling+refrig is the best way to go.\n\nHow dopey is Amazon promoting bottled water on this page.\nI suppose some bot reads \"water\" in the tag clould and drops the ad on the page. Seems incredibly ironic.\nPS. A charcoal water filter jug does a good job of purifying tap water, I've used one for years.\nPPS. In Victoria, Australia, in the midst of our worst drought in a hundred years, Coca Cola-Amital has been paying a measly 5c a gigalitre for the water they resell at exorbitant rates.\nI refuse to support these corporate parasites.\n\nANIL is right on. If you consider that New York City has probably the Worlds best water that's gravity fed from the Catskill mountains and Delaware region of NY and the number of bottled water consumption in the 'city' it's just mind numbingly silly. I live far north of NYC and rely on well water that has been contaminated with MTBE and had to connect to another source. City dwellers should buy their bottles and send them to those that truly need them"

Because most water filters, like the Katadyn Hiker, will filter particles in your water as small as .2 microns, they are more than adaquate to handle water born bacteria and protazoa. However, A water purifier, like the MSR MIOX, are required to kill particles as small as .004 microns which include viruses. Typically, viruses are only a problem when drawing water from areas where humans are nearby.\n\nIt is certainly possible to drink water from a mountain stream without becoming ill, but do you want to take the chance? Many portable water filtration options are available to ensure safe hydration. Some water bottles have their own water bottle filters, or you can choose a separate filtering device for water disinfection.\n\nCustomer Support for Online Sales 1-866-786-3869 • Shop Online or at any one of our 30 Retail Stores"

Take Deepika Kurup, a 14-year-old high school student from Nashua, New Hampshire. After seeing children in India drinking dirty water from a stagnant pool, she decided, in her words, \"to find a solution to the global water crisis.\" And then she actually made some progress towards that goal, developing a solar-powered water purification system.\n\nKurup's low-cost invention just won her $25,000 in The Discovery Education 3M Young Scientist Challenge–a high-stakes science competition for students in 5th to 8th grade (Kurup entered the competition before she was in high school). This was her second time entering; in 7th grade, she took first place in her state.\n\nThis time around, Kurup spent three months toiling away at the project, foregoing vacations and summer camp to leaf through PhD papers about water purification methods. She spoke with her mentor at 3M every day. And she tested the purification system independently in her backyard with contaminated water taken from the Nashua wastewater treatment facility. She ultimately came up with a system that exposes titanium oxide and zinc oxide to sunlight, creating a chemical reaction that generates hydroxyl radicals, which in turn can kill harmful bacteria.\n\nKurup used her system for one set of testing; the other was a control. She counted bacteria before and after purification (with 3M petrifilms), and discovered that water which had gone through her composite–which costs about half a cent per gram–had significantly fewer coliform units and E.Coli colonies in a matter of hours.\n\nUnlike today's popular water purification methods–using UV lamps that require electricity or chemicals that give water a nasty smell and taste–Kurup's method can run off-grid, generating fresh-tasting water. She has competition from innovative water filtration systems like LifeStraw, of course, but this isn't the last we'll see of Kurup's inventions.\n\nThe high school freshman hopes to work with Discovery and 3M on developing the water filtration project. She's also interested in speaking with other companies that could help with funding. \"My next step is applying for a patent,\" she says. \"I want to start a nonprofit organization to deploy my innovation.\"\n\nAfter graduation, Kurup wants to become a neurologist. But first, more science competitions. \"Science is really my passion,\" she says.\n\nAny food for that matter, taken in large quantities could be a poison. For example: We cannot exclude salt from our daily meals, but drinking sea water would harm your stomach and also lead to death. Drinking 2 gallons of water in one hour could kill you due to hydro-toexima.\n\nBe it a weekend party with college mates, or just a movie with friends, teens these days are addicted to the fizzy soft drinks.\n\nStudies reveal that teenagers who consume more than 5 cans of soft drinks are more prone to violence. Results also show that the percentage of violent behavior among those who drank these soft drinks, was 9 to 15 percentage points higher, the same as that of those who consume alcohol.\n\nThe level of violence these days too has risen. From the normal cat fights that involved some light fist fights, teens these days use weapons and other harsh items among siblings. We hear a lot of stories these days about violence among teenagers. It may not necessarily be the effect of the excessive intake of sugar or caffeine but you cannot ignore the studies! Findings show that aggressive behavior towards peers rose from 35 percent to more than 58 percent and violence towards siblings rose from 25.4 percent to over 43 percent.\n\nParenting also needs to be blamed here. A majority of parents these days, busy in their own commitments tend to overlook such habits of their brood and are almost unaware of the impact of such non-diet drinks.\n\nApart from violent behavior, soft drinks cause various other damages to the system. Sugar in fruits and vegetables is basic and harmless; soft drinks are made of highly processed sugar which is way too unsafe for the human body. The phosphorous and carbon content in these drinks lowers the body's pH and makes it vulnerable to various bacterial and viral diseases. It is known to all that soft drinks damage the teeth as well. The amount of benzene present in them is around eight times of that in drinking water. It is a chemical associated to leukemia.\n\nIt would be wise if parents could spend a few minutes on replacing the soft drinks with some delicious milkshakes or fruit juices. The teens are to realize the aftermath of continuing such habits and should not take\n\nIf you've been diligently avoiding the consumption of chemical sweeteners like sucralose, you may be alarmed to learn that researchers have found sucralose lurking in the drinking water supply of more than 28 million Americans.\n\nA recent study tested water samples from 19 water treatment plants in the United States serving more than 28 million people. Researchers analyzed the samples for the artificial sweetener sucralose. Samples tested positive for sucralose in the source water of 15 out of 19 plants. Furthermore, treatment failed to remove the sucralose from the drinking water: sucralose was also found in the finished drinking water from 13 out of 19 plants.\n\nResearchers determined that current water treatment methods fail to effectively remove sucralose from our water supply, leaving millions of Americans to unknowingly consume this artificial sweetener every single day.\n\nWhen a person ingests sucralose, a large percentage of it is not broken down and is instead excreted as waste. This waste goes through the water treatment plant, where the sucralose remains intact and goes on to become part of our drinking water supply.\n\nBecause sucralose has become one of the most widely used artificial sweeteners in commercial soft drinks and snack foods, it is no wonder that it is making an appearance in our drinking water. If sucralose consumption continues to rise, it stands to reason that everyone drinking public water will be ingesting more of this chemical sweetener as well – whether they want to or not.\n\nSucralose is Not Safe for Consumption\n\nThe public should be aware that the majority of the studies on the safety of sucralose are funded by the creators of the most popular sucralose product on the market. The conflict of interest is obvious and the results of these studies are clearly biased in favor of sucralose.\n\nIndependent studies aren't nearly so positive. Questions about the negative impact sucralose has on male fertility, red blood cell count, kidney health, gut flora balance and body weight are serious concerns generated from the results of these studies. Many researchers and health experts are convinced that sucralose should never have been deemed safe for human consumption.\n\nCommon sense dictates that anychemically-processed food is unfit for human consumption. The fact that these substances are now running rampant through our water supply is an atrocity that violates our right to choose what we put into our own bodies."

It takes a little more thought to make this work that your average filter, but is pretty straightforward nonetheless. The main idea is to place the filter in a pot of water above the bottle (or whatever water container you are using) and allow gravity to move the water. The idea behind this is the siphon principe:  The steps to get his all to work are as follows;\n\n1. Put filter in a pot of water above the bottle.\n2. To start the flow of water, there must not be air in the hose, so suck water into the hose with your mouth\n3. Place end of hose into water container.\n\nOnce the flow has started it will continue until the pot is empty. To filter more than one pots worth of water, simply add more water before the pot is empty and air enters the hose.\n\nTips for use:\nRemember that your pot has touched unfiltered water, so be sure to heat something all the way to a boil before you eat from it!\nThis technique takes a bit longer than pumping, so its often most convenient to do in camp while doing other things like preping dinner.\nTo make the water move through the filter faster, increase the vertical distance between the filter and the bottle.\nEven if you don't use this technique regularly, remember it in case your pump breaks- it has happened to me before!"

That \"squeaky\" feeling is not clean skin. Your skin naturally has oils that make your skin slick and moist when clean.\n\nDishwashing\n\nWhen washing dishes, especially in a dishwasher, hard water may cause spotting and filming on your stemware and dishes and look of your dishes.\n\nAppliances and Pipes\n\nHard water also contributes to inefficient and costly operation of water-using appliances. Heated hard water forms a scale of calcium and magnesium minerals (lime scale deposits) that can contribute to the inefficient operation or failure of water-using appliances. Pipes can become clogged with scale that reduces water flow and ultimately requires pipe replacement. Lime scale has been known to increase energy bills by up to 25%.\n\nHow does Water Softening Work? in the house runs through a bed of small plastic beads (resin). The beads are covered with sodium ions. As the water flows past the sodium ions, they swap places with the calcium and magnesium ions. Eventually, the beads contain nothing but calcium and magnesium and no sodium, and at this point they stop softening the water. It is then time to regenerate the beads.\n\nRegeneration involves soaking the beads in a stream of sodium ions. Salt is sodium chloride, so the water softener mixes up a very strong brine solution and flushes it through beads (this is why you load up a water softener with salt). The strong brine displaces all of the calcium and magnesium that has built up in the resin beads and replaces it again with sodium. The remaining brine plus all of the calcium and magnesium is flushed out through a drain pipe.\n\nSanta Barbara has some of the hardest water in the country.\nThe benefits of soft water include:\n\nAutomatic water softener technology has improved dramatically in recent years. New models monitor your water usage and know when to recharge to ensure continuous soft water supply.

Drinking water is strictly regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The state division of the EPA, the Environmental Protection Division, sets limits for the maximum amount of certain contaminants permitted in water provided by public water systems.\nThe water plants in Madison, Bostwick, Rutledge and Buckhead were all required by the EPD to include a consumer confidence report, also known as a water quality report, for the year 2007 in each customer's July 1 water bill. The EPD has required these reports since 1999. The town of Buckhead and Rutledge both receive some of their water from the city of Madison.\nA copy of Madison's water quality report was enclosed in bills for water consumers in addition to Buckhead's water quality report.\nEach water quality report lists the type and quantity of contaminants that were found in the water. If a contaminant was not found in the water, it was not included on the list. For example, the Madison plant did not find any traces of asbestos, E. coli, or Giardia in their water.\nUntreated water, such as that found in lakes and rivers, is the source of all drinking water, including bottled water. Bacteria, viruses, pesticides, metals, chemicals, and waste materials can contaminate this raw water.\nThese contaminants can come from sewage treatment plants, agricultural and livestock operations, septic systems, industrial waste water, and from other sources.\nTreated water still contains some contaminants, though treatment keeps the quantity of these contaminants under a safe level as specified by EPD regulations.\nLast year, the City of Madison treated 509 gallons of water and performed more than 240,000 laboratory tests for contaminants.\nMadison, Bostwick, Rutledge and Buckhead all have quality drinking water for the year 2007. Buckhead had three violations during 2007, in the months of June, October, and November, but each violation was monitored by the EPD and corrected by the water treatment plant.\nJ. Everette Jenkins, utility plants supervisor of the Madison Water Treatment Plant said the goal of treatment plants is \"to give everybody water of sufficient quality and quantity by meeting or exceeding the EPD requirements.\" Residents of Buckhead who wish to learn more about their water system can attend the monthly city council meeting on the third Monday of each month a speak with water superintendent Tim Saye.\nInhabitants of Rutledge can attend their city council meetings, which meet on the third Monday of the month.\nQuestions or concerns can also be directed to Rutledge City Hall at (706) 557-2223.\nAdditional copies of Madison's water quality report can be found at City Hall and citizens of the city are encouraged to call the city's Water Treatment Department at (706) 343-1251 or attend city council meetings. Bostwick residents can express concerns or ask questions at the city council's regular meeting, held the first Monday of every month at 7 p.m. at Bostwick City Hall."

It is used in the treatment of cancer and some skin diseases. Radium 226 and radium 228 are of most concern when found in drinking water because of the effects on the health of individuals. Radium 228 causes bone sarcomas. Radium 226 induces carcinomas in the head. Radioactivity in water can be naturally occurring or can be from man-made contamination. Radiation is generally in curies (Ci). One curie equals 3.7~x 1010 nuclear transformations per second. A picocurie (pCi) equals 10.12 curies. The US EPA has set the MCL (maximum contamination level) for radium 226 and 228 at 5 pCi/L under the NIPDWR (national interim primary drinking water regulations).\n\nTreatment of Radium\n\nRadium can be removed by sodium for cation exchange resin in the form of a water softener. Reverse osmosis will remove 95 - 98% of any radioactivity in the drinking water."

      "text": "UVO3 Ltd's blog about UV disinfection and water treatment\n\nThe history of UV disinfection\n\nUV has been a known mutagen i.e. it has been proved to degrade DNA, for over 100 years. In 1903 the Nobel Prize was awarded to Niels Finsen for his application of UV radiation to combat TB. The first use of UV in regards to water disinfection was in 1916 (though I can't find where and how it was done) but it was not used commercially until the 1960's.\n\nThe cylindrical style chamber (excepting the UV lamp) that have been the most efficient design for decades, have recently been spruced up to include the newest bit of kit in UV flow technology, the Van Remmen flow plate. Put in my simple layman terms, it's a cross sectional plate filled with precision placed holes for the water to pass through. The total surface area of the holes are greater than the input/output connections so pressure and flow rate are unaffected. There is still a hole in the centre of the plate for the lamp to fit through so the fastest flowing water is not affected considerably. The water passing through this hole will get the most efficient exposure to the UV lamp so it's ok.\n\nWhat would happen without a flow plate is that water will try taking the fastest route through the chamber. If water falls out of the 'faster' stream then it tends to take a much longer time to exit the chamber. The average exposure, which is used as the measure for treatment tends to look ok on standard units, but if you could see what the water was doing you would see a lot of it receiving minimal treatment (the fast water) and a lot receiving huge overdosing (the slow water). With a flow plate, because the whole stream is interrupted, a lower power lamp can be used because the vast majority of water will be exposed an equal amount to the UV light.\n\nI think that flow plates are a good thing that we will see more and more of as big companies invest in the research and development of them. We're starting to see interest in the industry but it's probably a bit more fiddly and expensive to install a flow plate and you could argue that UV systems do their intended job as they stand today, and if it ain't broke."

      "text": "Water Softeners 101\n\nMore than 8 out of 20 homes have a water supply that is considered \"hard\". Hard water contains all kinds of trace minerals dissolved into it. These minerals usually include calcium, magnesium, lead, limestone, copper, iron and even sulfur. Rather than live with all the many problems hard water causes, there is an easy way to solve the problem on an ongoing basis. All you need to do is have a water softener installed and it will take care of the water day after day.\n\nWhat Problems are Associated with Hard Water?\n\nHard water causes all kinds of little headaches that can be very frustrating and expensive. Clothes never quite come clean out of the washer. Dishes are hard to get clean too, even in the dishwasher and it always seems like you have to use more than the recommended amount of detergents when trying to clean anything, even yourself.\n\nHard water causes problems you cannot easily see as well. Mineral deposits build up on the inner workings of appliances that use water, making them less efficient and decreasing their useful life. Wonder why your home brewed Starbucks coffee never tastes as good as it does in the stores? Its probably because of hard water.\n\nHard water can also be expensive, far more so than the cost of having a water softener installed. The extra detergent, the extra soap, the ruined appliances, all of these things add up financially. So despite the initial investment the long term prospects for savings are good and a water softener will usually pay for itself rather quickly.\n\nHow Does a Water Softener Work?\n\nThe main body of a water softener contains lots of little resin beads and it is these sodium coated beads that work the magic. As water flows over them the bad mineral ions are attracted to them like metal to a magnet. The water that leaves the softener and goes off into the house is now free of these minerals and is therefore softer.\n\nThe resin beads do have to be refreshed on a regular basis of course. This is where the second part of a water softener, the brine tank, comes in. The brine tank flushes the resin beads on a regular basis, which can usually be a cycle you can \"set and forget\". The only thing you do need to remember t6o do is keep the right amount of salt (usually rock salt crystals) in the brine tank at all times."

      "text": "Compone, Peru The community had two water-related issues. First, annual spring output has declined in recent years, causing daily water shortages in the dry season. Secondly, the water is not treated and thus spreads gastro-intestinal illnesses from waterborne viruses, bacteria and cysts. It is believed that the contamination stems from animal waste, which is commonplace in an agricultural community such as Compone.\n\nThe Need\n\nCompone's drinking water is currently supplied by numerous springs located in the adjacent mountains. Since 1997 a total of five gravity-fed systems have been built to supply water from these springs to the 1500 inhabitants of Compone. Each of the five independent systems currently provides water, but lacks adequate treatment to prevent the spread of waterborne illness.\n\nBeing a community of subsistence farmers, Compone is alsoIrrigation Channel Improvements\n\nWater Tank and Chlorine Dosing\nDuring a design process over the fall 2008 and spring 2009 semesters, a project team reviewed a variety of water purification methods and selected a passive chlorination system as the most feasible treatment option.\n\nImplementation of the treatment solution in June 2009 was focused on adding chlorine to the distribution systems and ensuring that enough time passed before the chlorinated water reached tap stands. Passive chlorine tablet feeders were installed near the spring boxes in each of the five water districts to provide a continuous supply of chlorine. To ensure adequate reaction time between the chlorine and water, baffles were installed in the reservoirs. In the case of one water district, a ferrocement tank was constructed to provide additional retention time. While the infrastructure for treatment systems has been installed in Compone, compatibility difficulties between locally available chlorine and the chlorine feeders have prevented the systems from becoming operational.\n\nBuilding upon the infrastructure constructed the previous June, a January 2010 trip looked to further assess the feasibility of a tablet chlorination system. The team was able to successfully construct a tablet press in country with local materials, and pressed tablets from powder chlorine for in-country testing. These tablets, though, were not entirely compatible with the existing tablet doser, and so the team was required to develop alternative solutions to the problem.\n\nThe most recent trip was an assessment trip in January 2013 intended to provide the team with a fresh outlook on the most feasible approach to Compone's water disinfection problem. During the trip, students, faculty and professionals worked to collect water quality data, develop contacts within the community, and reexamine work that the chapter had previously done.\n\nMoving Forward\n\nAfter the success of the most recent assessment, the team decided to move into the design phase of the potable water project. Currently, the team preparing for an implementation trip in August 2013. The purpose of this trip will be to install a chlorine water disinfection unit in the Ayllu San Isidro sector of Compone. During the trip, the team will also examine the possibility of expanding the chlorination technology to serve the remaining sectors of Compone."

      "text": "is Lab Grade Water Purified?\n\nThere's something in the water, and it would love to go after your experiments.\n\nStraight out of the tap, water contains microorganisms, endotoxins, DNase and RNase, salts and other impurities that could gobble up your experiment in one bite. Of course we avoid this drama completely by using purified water from which these nasties have been removed. But how is this purification done?\n\nWell in practice a number of techniques are used, each of which can remove a different set of impurities.\n\nSo here are the techniques:\n\n1. Distillation. A technology as old as the hills (or at least as the stills that were hidden in the hills). Water is heated to its boiling point then condensed back to liquid. This will remove many impurities but impurities with a boiling point equal to or less than that of water will also be carried over in to the distillate.\n\n2. Microfiltration. In this technique, pressure is used to force the water through a filter with pore sizes of 1 to 0.1 micron in order to remove particulate matter. Filter diameters lower than 0.2 micron removes bacteria – so-called cold sterilisation.\n\n3. Ultrafiltration uses even smaller pore sizes (down to 0.003 micron). These are essentially molecular sieves, which remove molecules with a diameter larger than the pore size. It can be used to remove viruses, endotoxins, RNase and DNase\n\n4. Reverse osmosis. If you thought that ultrafiltration used impressively small pore sizes, you'll be even more impressed by reverse osmosis . Reverse osmosis filters have pore sizes of less than 0.001 microns, which allows them to sieve ions depending on their diameter. This is used for desalting the water.\n\n5. Filtration through a bed of activated carbon is useful for removing things like chloride ions and organic compounds, which are adsorbed onto the surface of the carbon.\n\n6. UV radiation. We all know what UV radiation, at specific wavelengths, can do to DNA and microorganisms. So UV is an obvious way to remove microorganisms from the water. It can also clean up the water by breaking down certain organic compounds into less harmful products.\n\n7. Deionization/ Ion exchange. This technique removes ions from the water by passing it through a resin bed containing a mixture of cationic and anionic resins. Positive ions in the water are attracted to the anionic resin particles and negative ions are (yes, you've guessed it) attracted to the cationic resins. The result is that nicely deionised water comes out of the other end of the resin bed.\n\nCommercially available water, or water purification systems will typically use a combination of these. The higher the water purity grade, the more techniques used.\n\nAny questions or comments? Just jump in and join the discussion in the comments section below. The water's lovely.One of my colleagues, a very good molecular biologist, told me that the only time she uses chemistry is when she needs to calculate molarities. I, of course, scoffed at this statement, and tried to remind her of all the chemistry she uses daily. True, I may be a bit biased since I am a [...]\n\nEvery biologist is familiar with the profile of the rate of an enzymatic reaction versus temperature as shown in the figure. We know that enzymes from E.coli or warm-blooded animals tend to have an optimum around 37°C while those from thermal vent bacteria have much higher optimal temperatures. Surprisingly, I find that many biologists don't [...]\n\nIf you want to isolate plasmid DNA, you crack your cells open and carry out a miniprep, trying very hard not to get any contaminating genomic DNA in your sample. If you want genomic DNA, you crack your cells open in a different way and try to isolate as much of the stuff as possiblefrom John Mackay on\nJanuary 11, 2010\n\nInteresting that often reagents such as Taq and other enzymes, dNTPs etc are qizzed first for contamination rather than looking at the reagent that makes up probably 90% of the reaction\nStill, have been reports of DNA sequences (legionella comes to mind) and another one I cannot recall the publication, being amplified from commercial water supplies.\nNice review Nick\n\nLab water is so often overlooked as an important factor when designing experiments and (as mentioned by John here) when looking for sources of errors. The whole area of lab water has been carefully looked at by a number of agencies/groups including the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute-Clinical Laboratory Reagent Water (CLSI®-CLRW). These organisations have similar (but not identical) definitions for highly purified water, which are determined based on parameters such as the water's conductance, resistance, the presence of colloids, bacterial count, organic content and pH. Using ASTM nomenclature, type IV is the lowest grade of purity, suitable for most routine lab work, while type I is the highest grade. The most commonly used standard, ASTM D1193-6 is summarized in table below. This standard can then be further sub-divided into A, B and C, where A is the most pure, as a measure of heterotrophic bacteria count (CFU/ml) and endotoxins (units per ml).\n\nIt is also important, I think, to note that the purification technologies are often combined in lab water generators and can be used to replace commonly used techniques: for example, the DEPC treatment of water as used for RNA work can be replaced by using a water generator using a combination of UV and UF (ultrafiltration) – e.g. Thermo Scientific Barnstead Nanopure UV/UF.\n\nJust a chemist's quibble… Cationic resins will have positively charged ions in them — so these will attract *negative* ions, not positive. This confusion is not infrequent and might come from the names of the common \"exchange\" resins; for example strong anion exchange resin, SAX, binds to strong anions but is therefore itself cationic."

Prevalent, and usually preventable, water-borne diseases result in a staggering 3.5 million deaths per year, and has devastating economic affects through lost productivity and medical expenses.[1],[2]\n\nThese effects are often most severely felt in slums, where immense over-crowding, severely compromised sanitation systems and a lack of legal regulations surrounding line access means that inexpensive, clean water is almost non-existent. The number of slum dwellers – now at around 1 billion – is expected to double by 2030. Around the world, not only do slum dwellers typically pay more for their water than high-income residents of the same city, they even pay more than people in developed countries.[3]\n\nGiven a lack of infrastructural backing, point-of-use (POU) technologies, in which water is purified immediately before use, could be an inexpensive but invaluable method of individual decontamination. However, up until now, POU products have been slow to enter to slum markets because many companies fear high entry costs, as well as social and political stigmas.\n\nOne organization, WaterWalla, is helping to bridge this gap between the technology, education, and profitability of clean water in the Dharavi slum of Mumbai. Founded in August 2010 by a group of five American college students from the Rhode Island School of Design and Brown University, WaterWalla establishes micro-businesses that sell and distribute POU technologies from reliable companies such as Bajaj, Eureka Forbes, and TATA, through entrepreneurs in independently-owned franchises. The local franchise-based model means that water purification can become a sustainable livelihood for entrepreneurs as well as improve standards of living.\n\nNeil Parikh, who co-founded WaterWalla as a junior at Brown University, and now serves as an advisor, said that, \"As a pre-medical student, I wanted to apply what I was learning in class to a meaningful, tangible problem. As I talked with my classmates and friends, we decided that water was the most important pillar of the pyramid and one that we could impact with scale as students.\" After he graduated, Anshu Vaish (Brown '11.5) & Soaib Grewal (RISH '11) took over to lead the US & India teams respectively.\n\nNeil continued, \"The initial research we did into the condition of slum water sanitation in Dharavi was shocking. 33% of families had significant E. coli contamination. We wanted to design a solution through which these residents not only got the best technology, but also became empowered to advocate to their communities about the benefits of clean water.\"\n\nWaterWalla equips interested local entrepreneurs to run their own WaterWalla shops, giving them a renovated storefront, marketing assistance, and access to technology. By July 2012, WaterWalla will have an expected 10 shops throughout Dharavi.\n\nBuilding the market for these shops through increased awareness is an integral component of WaterWalla. WaterWalla trains local women's groups and networks as a vehicle for not just education, but also marketing, and door-to-door sales. Beyond solely describing its health benefits, WaterWalla also raises awareness about the effects of clean water on slum dwellers' personal finances and other, more tangible benefits, like decreases in medical expenses, increases in productivity, and higher school attendance rates.\n\nWaterWalla not only harnesses the unique entrepreneurial spirit of Dharavi to improve its quality of life; it also empowers the community to make this change for themselves. WaterWalla's first shop-owner, JT, used to run an ayurvedic medicine business, but from the beginning, says Parikh, \"It was clear that WaterWalla for him wasn't about the money, it was about finding ways to fill a need in his own community. And that's what we're hoping to find in every community we work in.\"\n\n[2]Department for International Development Sanitation Reference Group. 2008.\n\n[3]UNHDR 2006\n\nAbout the Author\n\nHilary Fischer-Groban is a freelance writer based in Mumbai, with a background in corporate social responsibility.

But for the rest of the world, clean water is a precious commodity that can mean the difference between life and death.\n\nA group of public health students are getting a wider view of the importance of clean water to health this fall semester, and are not only learning about water on a global scale, but also how Georgia deals with its own clean water issues.\n\n\"The class gives a good perspective to people without any international travel, and at least they can know how good they have it here,\" said Kate Kroell, a student in the class of Christine Stauber, assistant professor of public health.\n\nBad water can lead to diarrhea — something that might cause suffering for people living in the developed world, but it can lead to dehydration and death, and exacerbate existing diseases like tuberculosis.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, diarrheal disease kills 1.5 million children per year, and is a leading cause of child malnutrition.\n\n\"Water-borne illnesses like diarrhea are one of the leading causes of death globally,\" said Stauber, whose research takes a look at clean water and the use of filtration systems in the developing world. \"In the United States, we really have moved forward tremendously, since the 1900s.\"\n\nKroell spent time in rural India and saw the effects of raw sewage first hand. Sewage often goes straight into water ditches in rural villages.\n\n\"I'm aware of what raw sewage can do,\" she said. \"There's a stigma against waste in the household. On the trains, the toilet is just a hole. That was eye opening. There's such a different standard here.\"\n\nIn GSU's own backyard this September, the students toured the R.L. Sutton Water Reclamation Facility in Cobb County, just over the Chattahoochee River from the city of Atlanta, where nearly 40 million gallons of wastewater pass through the facility daily on its way to be returned to the river.\n\nWaste water passes through a high-tech system that removes solid waste, uses microorganisms to clean the water of pollution, disinfects the water, puts oxygen back into the water and returns it to the river in a better state than the water that's already in the Chattahoochee.\n\nGeorgia's local governments did not always make painstaking efforts to treat wastewater.\n\nWhen David Word, formerly of the Georgia Environmental Protection Division, came to Georgia in 1974, pollution levels were high in the rivers and streams of the state. Word lives on the other side of the Chattahoochee from the treatment plant, and smelled the effects first hand.\n\n\"In the 70s, I couldn't sleep with my windows open because of the stench. Waste water would be put back into the streams either untreated or only partially treated,\" said Word, who briefed students on water quality and helped them tour the facility. \"In the summer, the streams were dead, because there was no oxygen for fish to breathe. But the fish are back now.\"\n\nThe problem for Georgia's rivers and streams now is really not sewage, but storm water runoff, Word said. When it rains, all sorts of pollutants are washed straight into bodies of water. Solving this problem, he said, will take efforts to change our behavior to prevent this pollution to negate other efforts in protecting Georgia's bodies of water.\n\n\"We're amazed that the water quality is now so much better than before, and we've come a long way,\" But there's still a lot to be done, and it's up to the students to take the lead.\""

      "text": "Wow! I couldn't believe what I was reading!!! Here we are in a depressed economy in Maine (and the nation) and there are those who want to ban the sale of bottled water to Maine State agencies, and others! Bottled water industry is a good clean business in Maine and employs several people. Who in their right mind would want to intefer in that. Yes, the environment is important and that is why we have people who have business to recycle bottles. Who wants to cut down on those good folks? Let's get real and look at more important issues than banning the sale of bottled water to State agencies. Why don't those who are supporting such a ban putting their energy into attracting more businesses to Maine so that we can reduce our under employment and unemployment situation. Thanks for reading.\n\nBottle is more a handy thing then a hoax, but i understand why it's important to get rid of bottle water. Aren't they doing changes in the booze area, so less bottle water to grab makes more booze available. This is a top issue to look at. I mean it's more important then the tobacco fields, because the government has to much in the tobacco company and not bottle water, besides tobacco only kills or injurys millions. So we really don't need all those empty bottles being re-cycled and helping some homeless person get a sandwich. Makes sense...(just my opinion and not that of this paper)\n\nIf you do not like bottled water do not buy it.\nIt is evident that they have never fought a fire on a very hot day and badly needed hydration. Botled water is very easy to carry and use.\nIn many emergencies bottled water is necessary for a quick portable supply.\nGetting tired of lame brain do gooders with no common sense.\n\nWhat, exactly, is the hoax? Are you referring to the fact that most of it that's not Poland Spring is just filtered tap water? Or the fact that we pay more for bottled water than we do even for soda? Or how most of the bottles end up in landfills and not the recycle bin (really, though, who would throw out all those nickels?) None of these things make it a \"hoax\". And none of these things are a good basis for prohibiting municipalities from buying it. That's just dumb nanny-state behavior.\n\nI am sorry, I could not disagree more. There is a lot wrong with our tap water. I use a sleep apnia mask at night and ran out of bottled water. I filled the tank with tap water and took the mask off after about two minutes. The smell of chlorine was so strong. I can no longer drink tap water because of the chlorine. What do you think the chlorine, and other additives, are doing to your body? It can't be good for us.\n\n...to my body and it's 75 years old - a lot of that before they started putting floride in it, which has been REALLY good. Don't think they put chlorine in it here but I'm not sure. Guess I'm just not as sensitive as you are.\n\nBecause really, what could be more important than pushing another anti-corporate sop to the lefty environmental extremists? If they claim it's not about hurting a company that's owned by someone From Far Far Away, they are lying to themselves and to you."

      "text": "Natural disasters are indiscriminate and strike without warning. Sadly floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes and other natural disasters claim thousands of lives every year. Unfortunately in most cases, only limited precautions such as early warning systems and earthquake-resistant buildings can be made against disaster striking again. There is however, another way in which the toll on human life can be reduced.\n\nOne of the biggest problems that disaster relief organisations face is providing uncontaminated drinking water in the wake of a disaster. Damage to infrastructure can contaminate drinking water supplies and make the spread of waterborne diseases a huge threat. If there is no alternative to drinking from these contaminated supplies, a second wave of deaths can occur, this time a tragedy that is fully preventable for all ages.\n\nWater purification bottles such as those produced by LIFESAVER systems contain a sophisticated nano filtration system that removes bacteria, parasites, viruses, cysts and other pathogens from any water, making it safe to drink. Clean and sterile water saves lives and an emergency water purification system reduces or removes the need for bottled water to be shipped in, which can prove to be very expensive and logistically difficult. Shipping bottled water into a disaster is impossible and can create chaos further adding to the panic within an emergency situation.\n\nThe LIFESAVER bottle is the world's first and only water purification bottle to remove all contaminants without using chemicals or power. The LIFESAVER bottles are portable, easy to use and contain a replaceable cartridge, which is suitable for filtering up to 6,000 litres of water. It can be used with just three simple steps – fill it, pump it and drink it.\n\nThe LIFESAVER bottles were developed in the wake of the December 2004 earthquake and subsequent tsunami, in which an estimated 300,000 people lost their lives. Since then the world has seen a number of large-scale natural disasters including the 2005 Hurricane Katrina, the 2010 Haiti earthquake and the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. In each case, many lives were saved by the efforts of disaster relief agencies supplying potable drinking water.\n\nIf individuals and households invested in a survival water purification system, access to uncontaminated water in the event of a natural disaster would not be a problem. This would result in less reliance on resources provided by disaster relief agencies and more time and money could be spent on other aid such as providing food and shelter. In short, many more lives could be saved.\n\nThe UK's Rapid Response Facility – Providing Humanitarian Aid in the Wake of a Disaster\n\nIn 2012, the British government set up a rapid response network with the mission of delivering life-saving emergency relief to developing countries in the hours following disasters such as earthquakes, floods and famines. The network is made up from a number of organisations that can provide specialist equipment and assistance following a disaster, with the aim of mobilizing aid within 72 hours following a disaster.\n\nLIFESAVER systems is one of the private sector organisations involved in this initiative and provides survival water purification in the form of bottles and jerrycans. The LIFESAVER bottles utilize sophisticated filters that have the ability to sterilize contaminated water and make it safe for drinking and washing.\n\nLIFESAVER jerrycans and LIFESAVER water bottles remove all viruses, bacteria, parasites, cysts, fungi and other microbiological pathogens, making any source of water safe to drink. One of the biggest risks to health in the hours and days following a natural disaster is limited access to potable water, so using emergency water purification systems such as those provided by LIFESAVER, really can save lives.\n\nLIFESAVER survival water purification products were distributed to victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, 2011 Thailand floods, and are part of an initiative in rural Malaysia to bring safe drinking water to villagers.\n\nThe members of the Rapid Response Facility (RRF) are ready to take immediate action and deliver aid, equipment and experts to the disaster zones within the crucial time period of 72 hours, in order to save as many lives as possible. The RRF is an initiative of the UK's Department for International Development (DFID).\n\nCholera and other waterborne diseases are a large risk after a natural disaster but they can be prevented easily with adequate sanitation and access to clean, sterile drinking water. By providing a long-term solution in the form of a water purification system, many lives have been saved already; LIFESAVER continue to provide water filtration systems to those hit by disasters globally, to ensure people can have access to clean, sterile water in an emergency situation.\n\nNatural disasters can strike at any time and worryingly, many people make no provisions to help them cope in the event of an emergency. Disaster preparedness kits aren't just for people living in earthquake zones or hurricane risk areas. The worldwide climate changes due to global warming are making natural disasters such as floods and storms increasingly common and the effects can be devastating.\n\nIn 2012, a storm system battered New York, flooding subways and tunnels, leaving thousands without power for days. Wild fires in Australia destroy homes and claim lives every year; while millions of people here in the UK live in flood risk areas and are affected by flooding every year.\n\nWherever you live in the world, you should take the time to prepare a disaster kit and store it in a safe place. In the event that disaster does strike, this LIFESAVER Solo Disaster Kit may just save your life.\n\nWhat to put in a disaster supplies kit\n\n- Water – one gallon per person per day for three days supply is recommended\n\n- A LIFESAVER jerrycan or LIFESAVER bottle with filters – it is not practical to store more than a few days water supply, but an emergency water purification system will allow you to remove bacteria and pathogens from any water supply, making it safe to drink\n\n- Food – choose dried and tinned food that is non-perishable and include enough supplies to last you at least three days\n\n- First aid kit\n\n- Mobile phone with spare battery or solar charger\n\n- Torch with spare batteries\n\n- Radio with extra batteries or a wind-up radio\n\n- List of emergency contact numbers\n\n- Copies of important documents\n\n- Penknife and whistle\n\nOf all the supplies that you may need in an emergency, clean water is the most important. It is possible to live for weeks without food but most people will die within three to five days without water.\n\nDrinking or even washing in contaminated water puts you at risk of contracting waterborne diseases such as dysentery and typhoid. This is why a water purification system such as the LIFESAVER bottles andLIFESAVER jerrycans should be a part of everyone's disaster kit.\n\nBy investing in a survival water purification system, you are ensuring that you have access to clean water for months, which could make a huge difference to your survival. Clean water saves lives and a LIFESAVER water filter bottle could certainly save your life one day.\n\nHi, my name is Stephen Whittaker and I want to support LIFESAVER and win The Best Job in the World competition with the Australian Tourist Board\n\nAbout me!\n\nI am a full time Carer and nature lover who has made it to the final 25 out of 100,000 contestants across the globe in The Best Job In The World Competition, more information can be found here  The particular category I am featured in, is the Queensland Park Ranger position. When I win I will be working in the Australian Rainforest and Great Barrier Reef on behalf of Tourism Australia.\n\nHow does this connect with LIFESAVER?\n\nI first came across the LIFESAVER technology in 2009, where I saw the captivating TED talk by Michael Pritchard, Inventor Founder. My initial reaction was one of awe and I thought 'why give a starving person a fish, when you can give them a fishing rod!' This is the same concept when applied to LIFESAVER – using technology to allow people to find and use their local water source, but filter it into sterile drinking water without needing bottled water or to wait for costly infrastructure that wouldn't happen.\n\nHow I need your support\n\nThe top 3 contestants will be announced on the 15th May 2013, and I need all the help and support I can get. I want to win the chance to have the 'best job in the world' and also support LIFESAVER by giving the gift of water. So, how can you help me? Well 'sharing is caring' so share this blog on your social media sites, tweet, post and tell the world about my pledge to give the gift of water and have the best job in the world – an amazing achievement I think you will agree.\n\nYou can also use the hashtag #ivoteforste on social media sites, so please use this to help spread my pledge to help LIFESAVER when I win the best job in the world in Australia!\n\nMy promise to LIFESAVER\n\nWhen I win, I would like to donate 1000AUD (approx £650) of my salary to LIFESAVER, to purchase LIFESAVER jerrycans to send out to The Paskay Charity in Peru. LIFESAVER systems have agreed to allow me to double my purchase of LIFESAVER jerrycans for the same amount of money, so I can now send out 40,000L of clean water rather than 20,000L! A great and generous amount of support to give me and those really in need; and a big thank you to LIFESAVER.. You can find out more about the charity here:- \n\nWhen we think of children, we think of innocence; Clean, fun, excited, innocent children. Do you have children? How would you describe them? I'm sure, as a fellow parent, you would agree, the bath time routine in the evening is fun to say the least. Full of bubbles, giggles, toys and laughter, and out pops a squeaky clean bundle of joy, for a few hours at least any way. And just before bed time, a cup, beaker, bottle, glass of clean juice or water on the bed side table, in case of thirst in the night.\n\nBut what if this wasn't possible. Look, just look now at the picture. This beautiful little boy filling up his bottle with his drinking water; Yes, that is drinking water. The brown, yellow sludge in that bottle is what this beautiful little boy will drink when he is thirsty. He is filthy, covered in sweat and dirt soaked clothes, far from the bubble bath we all long to give him. Does that sit well with you? For me, as a mother, its heart breaking. Children should be full of energy, happy and excited. They should not be thirsty, dying and riddled with bacterial infections due to drinking brown sludge from the local river. They should not be covered in sweat and mud from weeks worth of not washing.\n\nSo look again, at the beautiful little boy, and feel that surge of overwhelming protection wanting to hand him clean, sterile drinking water. You can do that, today. Help us give the gift of water, and ensure that with just three simple steps of fill, pump, drink, that children can have access to safe drinking water globally.\n\nThe LIFESAVER technology is the worlds first and only to remove all bacteria, viruses, cysts, parasites, fungi and all other microbiological waterborne pathogens from water without the aid of chemicals like iodine or chlorine, the need for any power or UV light. It allows water to be produced instantly, with a fast flow rate and the water can be stored and filtered when you need it.\n\nThe f-diagram is used by many NGOs to help promote behaviour change surrounding hygiene.\n\nThe famous f-diagram, demonstrates the major transmission routes of faecal-oral diseases. It illustrates the different routes that the microbes of diarrhoea take from faeces, through the environment, to a new person. For example; microbes in faeces on the ground by a well can get into the water system and be drunk by a child, hands that have not been washed after going to the toilet can carry microbes onto foods, which are then eaten, infecting another child, who gets diarrhoea and spreads more microbes...[1]\n\nPhoto courtesy of water1st.org\n\nWhat is the faecal-oral route?\n\nThe faecal–oral route is a route of transmission of a disease, when pathogens in faecal particles pass from one host and are introduced into the oral cavity of another host.\n\nThe most common steps are:\n\nwater that has come into contact with faeces and is then inadequately treated before drinking;\n\nfood that has been handled with faeces present;\n\npoor sewage treatment along with disease vectors like houseflies;\n\npoor or absent cleaning after handling faeces or anything that has been in contact with it[2]\n\nWhy do we need to worry about Faeces?\n\nIn simple terms, the average faeces can contain 10,000,000 viruses and 1,000,000 bacteria.[3]\n\nWhat diseases can you get via the fecal-oral route?\n\nCholera\n\nPoliomyelitis\n\nTyphoid Fever\n\nHepatitis A and E\n\nShigellosis\n\nKey practices designed to prevent diarrhoeal infection and break the transmission route:\n\nSafe disposal of Faeces\n\nFaeces in the public and domestic environment are the primary source of diarrhoeal pathogens. Safe disposal of stools is the best way to prevent infection. Ideallyadult and child stools should be disposed of in toilets orlatrines. In places where this is not possible, stools shouldbe buried.[4]\n\nHand washing\n\nHands readily become contaminated with faecal material after going to the toilet or cleaning children's bottoms. Rinsing fingers with water alone is not enough. Hands need to be well washed after contact with faeces; either rubbed with an abrasive such as ash or mud, or with a detergent such as soap.[5]\n\nPhoto courtesy of guardian.co.uk\n\nKeeping water clean\n\nA plentiful and accessible water supply makes hand washing and cleaning easier, which helps to keep the environment free of pathogens. Ensuring that faecal material does not get into water supplies at the source is probably far more effective than boiling, filtering, and covering water jars. [6]\n\nFly control\n\nThough flies can carry microbes from faeces to food, fly control is difficult to achieve. If stools are disposed of in toilets or latrines and these latrines have covers, then fly-based disease transmission will be minimised.[7]\n\nFood hygiene\n\nPoor food handling practices contribute to diarrhoeal infection largely because they offer bacterial pathogens the opportunity to multiply. This way people can consume much greater doses of microbes. Diarrhoeas often peak in warm, humid seasons in the tropics, when conditions are favourable to the multiplication of bacteria on food.\n\nFeeding bottles are especially dangerous because they are hard to sterilise and bacteria grow quickly in warm milk.[8]\n\nKey facts on Diarrhoea\n\n(Courtesy of WHO)\n\nDiarrhoeal disease is the second leading cause of death in children under five years old. It is both preventable and treatable.\n\nEach year diarrhoea kills around 760 000 children under five.\n\nA significant proportion of diarrhoeal disease can be prevented through safe drinking-water and adequate sanitation and hygiene.\n\nGlobally, there are nearly 1.7 billion cases of diarrhoeal disease every year.\n\nDiarrhoea is a leading cause of malnutrition in children under five years old.\n\nPhoto courtesy of topnews.ae\n\nDiarrhoea can last several days, and can leave the body without the water and salts that are necessary for survival. Most people who die from diarrhoea actually die from severe dehydration and fluid loss. Children who are malnourished or have impaired immunity as well as people living with HIV are most at riskof life-threatening diarrhoea.\n\nDiarrhoea is usually a symptom of an infection in the intestinal tract, which can be caused by a variety of bacterial, viral and parasitic organisms. Infection is spread through contaminated food or drinking-water, or from person-to-person as a result of poor hygiene.[9]\n\nA 2009 UNICEF study found hand washing with soap to be among the most effective and inexpensive ways to prevent diarrhoeal diseases and pneumonia, which together account for 3.5 million child deaths annually.[10]\n\nIn addition, improved sanitation will contribute to reducing malnutrition in children, improve[ing] the quality of life and dignity of girls and women, protect[ing] the environment, and generat[ing] economic benefits for communities and nations.[11]\n\nLIFESAVER and the f-diagram\n\nLIFESAVER technology can support the introduction of hygiene promotion programmes by providing clean safe drinking water at the hand washing and food preparation stage as well as reducing numbers of children being diagnosed with diarrhoea. LIFESAVER technology can dramatically weaken several of the transmission routes shown in the f-diagram above, and can be used in partnership with pit latrines/toilets and health awareness programmes to reduce the transmission of diseases via the faecal-oral route.\n\nGreen Recycling Ltd provides a wide range of tailor-made waste management and recycling solutions to businesses and local authorities throughout the South East of England.

Globally, about 40 million people have an active infection and as many as 8 million people are visually impaired as a result of this disease. It is one of the 17 neglected tropical diseases (NTDs).\n\nWhat causes trachoma and how does it spread?\n\nInfection can occur if an individual comes into direct contact with the discharge produced from the eyes or nose of an infected person, or by contact with contaminated objects, such as towels and clothes. Flies can also transfer the bacteria from the discharge. In the developing world, flies are one of the main ways trachoma is spread.\n\nAs a disease, trachoma mainly affects the most vulnerable members of neglected communities – women and children. Women are more at risk than men simply because women generally spend greater amounts of time in close contact with small children, who are the main source of infection.\n\nA simple infection can heal without medical intervention. However, repeated infection leads to progressive scarring of the inside of the eyelid that can turn the eyelid inwards so that the lashes constantly rub on the eyeball, injuring and scarring the cornea.\n\nEnvironmental factors\n\nTrachoma bacteria thrive in environments where there is High levels of overcrowding, Limited access to clean water, Limited access to washing facilities, such as showers or baths, A large fly population and Limited access to healthcare services.\n\nPhoto courtesy of guardian.co.uk\n\nTrachoma and Poverty\n\nTrachoma is a disease directly linked to poverty. The cycle of poverty and infection caused by Trachoma can limit access to education and prevent individuals from being able to work or care for their families and themselves. Improvements in health and hygiene mean the condition is now rare in the UK and the rest of the developed world.\n\nTrachoma is usually only found in the very poorest communities – typically villages and slums in hot, dusty climates where hygiene levels are poor and access to water and sanitation is limited. The majority of trachoma cases occur in Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia. Trachoma is most common in children between one and five years old.\n\nTrachoma and Gender\n\nIn some more patriarchal societies, women are often responsible for much of the household work leaving them restricted to the household (in many cases). Tasks such as collecting water and firewood, and cooking, place women at disproportionately higher risk for health problems compared to their male counterparts. As already mentioned, the responsibility of caring for the sick, also exposes women to infectious agents more regularly than men.[1] Given this, gender must be considered when looking at intervention programmes and the SAFE strategy (addressed shortly).\n\nInterventions\n\nPrimary interventions backed for preventing trachoma infection include improved sanitation, reduction of fly breeding sites and increased facial cleanliness (with clean water) among children at risk of disease. The scarring and visual change for trachoma can be reversed by a simple surgical procedure performed at village level.\n\nGood personal and environmental hygiene has been proven to be successful in combating trachoma. Encouraging the washing of children's faces, improved access to water, and proper disposal of human and animal waste has been shown to decrease the number of trachoma infections in communities.\n\nEncouraging the use of water for specific hygiene purposes (face washing) through health education can help prevent cases of trachoma and can be a cheaper alternative to building water supplies.\n\nTrachoma control\n\nThe WHO, along with a coalition of other interested parties, have adopted the \"SAFE\" strategy to combat trachoma. The four components of this strategy include:\n\nSurgery\n\nAntibiotic treatment (Tetracycline eye ointment new antibiotic, azithromycin has been tested in a number of countries and initial results are very promising)\n\nFacial cleanliness\n\nEnvironmental changes\n\nWithout full implementation of these four elements, trachoma programmes cannot be fully achieved. As mentioned earlier, gender is also important to consider within any SAFE strategy.\n\nPhoto courtesy of cartercenter.org\n\nWater supply\n\nThere are four reasons why one might expect improvements in water supply to reduce the transmission of trachoma in a community.\n\nChildren's faces are the sources and sites of re-infection with the organism, Chlamydia trachomatis, which causes the disease. Increased water availability means that faces can be cleaned more thoroughly and more frequently.\n\nIt also means that the objects which carry the organism between one person and another (such as fingers and bedclothes) can be kept cleaner and are less likely to be infected.\n\nTrachoma is transmitted by flies. If there is more water in a dry environment, including water spilt or thrown on the ground, this will provide alternative sources of moisture to flies which would otherwise seek it on children's faces.\n\nFinally, the water supply helps people to maintain a cleaner domestic environment (for instance, by washing dishes rather than leaving them around with food remains on them). The environment will be less attractive to flies.[2]\n\nHow the water is used determines whether it will help to control trachoma. One study in The Gambia found that the total quantity of water used by a household had no effect on the prevalence of active trachoma, but that trachoma-free households used more water for washing children than households with trachoma cases.[3]\n\nLIFESAVER technology can help\n\nBy enabling families to gather water nearer to their houses, and by using the clean sterile water that LIFESAVER technology provides, to wash their hands and faces in, children and mothers stay cleaner and are at less risk of contracting Trachoma. Women who work outside the home are also less likely to lose much needed income when using LIFESAVER technology as hygiene levels and cleanliness of the domestic environment will be much improved.\n\nToday is World Malaria Day, which is celebrated annually on 25 April. Over the last decade, the world has made major progress in the fight against malaria.\n\nSince 2000, malaria mortality rates have fallen by more than 25%, and 50 of the 99 countries with on-going transmission are now on track to meet the 2015 World Health Assembly target of reducing incidence rates by more than 75%.\n\nWorld Malaria Day was instituted by WHO Member States during the World Health Assembly of 2007. It is an occasion to highlight the need for continued investment and sustained political commitment for malaria prevention and control.\n\nHistory of Malaria\n\nThe Greeks were the first to write about malaria. Earlier on, the Egyptians made numerous references to it in their hieroglyphs. However, it wasn't until late in the 18th century that its aetiology was better understood.\n\nWhat is Malaria?\n\nMalaria is a disease of the blood that is caused by the Plasmodium parasite, which is transmitted from person to person by a particular type of mosquito.\n\nPhoto courtesy of nrp.org\n\nThe Anopheles Mosquito\n\nThe female Anopheles mosquito is the only mosquito that transmits malaria. These mosquitoes are called \"malaria vectors\".\n\nShe primarily bites between the hours of 9pm and 5am, which is why sleeping under a mosquito net at night is such an important method of prevention.\n\nThe Malaria Parasite\n\nThere are more than 100 species of malaria parasite. The most deadly – and most common in Africa - is known as Plasmodium falciparum. Once the parasite enters the human body, it lodges itself in the liver where it multiplies approximately 10,000 times. Two weeks after entering the body, the parasite bursts into the blood stream where it begins infecting red blood cells.\n\nMalaria Transmission Cycle\n\nPhoto courtesy of crick.ac.uk\n\nMalaria Symptoms\n\nSymptoms begin 10 days to 4 weeks after infection, although a person may feel ill as early as 7 days later. Symptoms include fever, headache and vomiting.\n\nHow it kills\n\nIf drugs are not available or if the parasites are resistant to them, malaria infection can develop to anaemia, hypoglycaemia or cerebral malaria, in which capillaries carrying blood to the brain are blocked.\n\nTravellers that become ill with flu-like symptoms, either while travelling in a malaria-risk area or after returning home, should seek immediate medical attention.\n\nWhat can be done to avoid catching Malaria?\n\nMosquito nets (or LLINs) are the surest way to prevent malaria. Some NGOs have invested in rapid diagnostic tests and artemisinin-based combination treatments to reduce malaria deaths in women and children.\n\nImproving surface water management at relief camps, and in areas where water drainage is an issue, will reduce breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nIndoor residual spraying (IRS) have been shown to be highly effective vector control interventions in preventing malaria morbidity and mortality. IRS is the practice of spraying insecticides on the interior walls of homes in malaria-affected areas. For individual protection, the most effective chemical insect repellents to reduce human-mosquito contact are those based on DEET. Malaria No More have introduced a mobile platform to deliver health education to ensure families sleep under nets and seek testing and treatment."

A modeling study published in the journal Hypertension (Coxson, P.G., et al. 2013. Mortality Benefits From US Population-wide Reduction in Sodium Consumption: Projections From 3 Modeling Approaches) suggests that even a small reduction in sodium consumption could save hundreds of thousands of lives. I've been involved with a lot of research on the contamination of shallow aquifers from road salt (sodium chloride) runoff, but we typically focus on chloride and not sodium. Chloride is a conservative ion, so it travels in groundwater basically at the speed of the water, whereas sodium is more reactive and thus more difficult to predict in the subsurface. But sodium is definitely increasing in these aquifers. This sodium study got me wondering how much sodium we ingest through drinking water.\n\noptional post actions\n\nDrought and Algal Blooms\n\nDuring the 2012 drought, the hot, dry conditions caused blooms of blue-green algae (also known as cyanobacteria) in some water bodies.

Another article told how public schools in New York City are saving large volumes of water as a result of replacing thousands of old toilets with low-flush models. There was also an op-ed piece about how the melting of ice in the Arctic Ocean is opening up sea lanes and what that might mean. But the article that really caught my attention was in the World Briefing section about how 6,000 dead pigs were found floating in the Huangpu River in China, which provides drinking water to Shanghai.

We expect them to clean up our sewage, so that the effluent that is returned to our water resources is environmentally benign. A century or more ago, the main goal was to prevent the spread of water-borne diseases, and treatment mainly consisted of dilution. Since that time, our environmental sensibilities have increased, and treatment techniques have been vastly improved to disinfect wastewater and remove pollutants to protect receiving waters. At first those pollutants were primarily limited to nutrients. Now we're asking WWTPs to remove other things. Any idea what this compound is?\n\noptional post actions\n\nOur Stressed Great Lakes\n\nA recent study investigated the cumulative effects of human activities on the health of the Great Lakes, and concluded that Lakes Erie, Ontario, and Michigan face the greatest threats, while Like Superior is the least threatened.

Threats include invasive species (especially zebra mussels and lampreys), climate change (affecting lake temperature and water levels), phosphorous from erosion of agricultural soils, and contaminants from urban areas. Stressed areas almost always have multiple stressors, complicating restoration efforts. The authors of the study note that restoration efforts in the Great Lakes are almost exclusively focused on high-stress sites, but almost never have information about the full range of stressors.\n\noptional post actions\n\nBottled Water vs. Tap Water: And the Winner is'\n\nOne of the first posts I wrote for this blog was that the quality of bottled water was no better than tap water.

      "text": "Wastewater\n\nWastewater is the water that is contaminated by various substances, that is collected using different methods and cleansed. There are many different ways that water can become contaminated, ranging from sewage water to rain water on the ground. Wastewater should not be confused with sewage. Sewage is a form of wastewater that contains urine or faeces, often collected in sewer systems. Wastewater can be any water that has been mixed with waste products of any kind.\n\nSewage is the most widely recognised form of wastewater. Sewage is mostly composed of about 95% pure water and the rest faeces and urine. The majority of households in developed cultures will have drains and piping systems that carry sewage to sewers. The sewage is then taken to places where it can be safely disposed or filtered for reuse. A good method of dealing with sewage is to have a septic tank installed. This is a small treatment system that can help treat the sewage. Bacteria inside the tank break down many of the elements of the sewage, and the remains are collected periodically. This is a very environmentally friendly method of dealing with sewage.\n\nThere are other ways of dealing with sewage that are not so efficient, and can cause serious harm to the environment. Many countries cannot afford septic tanks or fully functioning sewerage systems. They may not have access to means of treating the sewage, and it is often dumped in rivers or the sea for example. This can be extremely detrimental to the environment. If the waste products in sewage end up contaminating water supplies, this can cause serious illness or death in large communities.\n\nThe ideal method of treating sewage is for it to be dealt with in a proper wastewater treatment facility. These places use chemicals and bacteria to break down the waste elements of the sewage. They can safely dispose of the elements that cannot be broken down any further, and which cannot be reused. It is often possible to purify the water in sewage to allow for it to be reused.\n\nThere are many other forms of wastewater, such as water drained from roads or industrial facilities. This water can be treated similarly to sewage, but it is often not necessary for it to go through such vigorous procedures. Water collected in storm drains is ideal for purification and reuse; the water that is purified can be used as drinking water."

      "text": "Bacteria in Water\n\nColiform bacteria\n\nThe Chattahoochee Bacteria Monitoring Network is sampling for total coliform and E. coli bacteria.\n\nTotal coliform\n\nTotal coliforms are gram-negative, aerobic or faculative anaerobic, nonspore forming rods. These bacteria were originally believed to indicate the presence of fecal contamination, however total coliforms have been found to be widely distributed in nature and not always associated with the gastrointestinal tract of warm blooded animals. The number of total coliform bacteria in the environment is still widely used as an indicator for potable water in the U.S.\n\nFecal coliform\n\nFecal coliform bacteria are a subgroup of coliform bacteria that were used to establish the first microbial water quality criteria. The ability to grow at an elevated temperature (44.5 C) separate this bacteria from the total coliforms and make it a more accurate indicator of fecal contamination by warm-blooded animals. Fecal- coliform bacteria are detected by counting the dark-blue to blue-grey colonies that grow on a 0.65 micron filters placed on mFC agar incubated in a 44.5 C oven for 22-24 hours. The presence of fecal coliforms in water indicates that fecal contamination of the water by a warm-blooded animal has occurred, however, recent studies have found no statistical relationship between fecal coliform concentrations and swimmer-associated sickness.\n\nE. coli\n\nEscherichia coli (E. coli) is a rod-shaped bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract and feces of warm-blooded animals. It is a member of the fecal coliform group of bacteria and is distinguished by its inability to break down urease. E. coli numbers in freshwater are determined by counting the number of yellow and yellow brown colonies growing on a 0.45 micron filter placed on m-TEC media and incubated at 35.0 C for 22-24 hours. The addition of urea substrate confirms that colonies are E. coli. This bacteria is a preferred indicator for freshwater recreation and its presence provides direct evidence of fecal contamination from warm-blooded animals. Although usually harmless, E. coli can cause illnesses such as meningitis, septicemia, urinary tract, and intestinal infections. A recently discovered strain of E. coli (E. coli 0157:H7) can cause severe disease and may be fatal in small children and the elderly.\n\nThe relation between bacteria counts and sickness\n\nConsumption of or contact with water contaminated with feces of warm-blooded animals can cause a variety of illnesses. Minor gastrointestinal discomfort is probably the most common symptom; however, pathogens that may cause only minor sickness in some people may cause serious conditions or death in others, especially in the very young, old, or those with weakened immunological systems.\n\nAs these charts show, studies have shown that there is not a positive relation between either total coliform or fecal coliform counts and sickness. But, studies have shown a positive relation between E. coli and sickness — as E. coli counts go up, the occurrences of sicknesses go up. That is why this project is focusing on E. coli as the main indicator of potential risk."

      "text": "Water treatment\n\nWater Treatment System\n\nOne possible configuration for a water treatment system is shown in the diagram below. This sample system includes at least one of the options from Sections 1-4 below.\n\nDe-ionisation\n\nRationale Tap water can often contain significant amounts of dissolved ionic material. The most obvious side effect of this is an increase in the water conductivity, which can result in a \"short circuit\" path between electrodes of some co-planar membrane hydrophones. The increased conductivity can provide a conduction path for Electro-Magnetic Interference, which will increase the noise received by the hydrophone. There is also a likelihood that these dissolved solids will crystallize out onto any objects left within the water. This is a particular problem in \"hard-water\" areas where chalky deposits can build up on anything left within the tank. If hydrophones are subject to such deposits then there will be a gradual reduction in the sensitivity of the hydrophone as the thickness of the contamination increases.\n\nThe forthcoming IEC62127-part 1, detailing the use of ultrasonic hydrophones, recommends a conductivity of no more than 5 mS for measurements involving electrically unshielded membrane hydrophones. The same figure is also recommended by IEC61102, and IEC61161 also recommends the use of distilled water for the same reason.\n\nPreventative Measures\n\nIon Exchange Resins These resins contain a mixture of anionic and cationic reagents that replace all dissolved ionic content with their respective hydrogen or hydroxide ions leaving pure water. The initial equipment costs for an Ion Exchange system are relatively low, but the exchange resin is a consumable item that must be replenished. This process is suitable for infrequent use as running costs (due to resin replacement) can be expensive if larger quantities of water are required.\n\nDistilled Water By boiling, and then separately re-condensing water, any dissolved solids are left on the inner surfaces of the still and the emerging water has a lower ionic content. Whilst the capital cost of a still is small, distilled water is not as effective as de-ionisation and water must often be double or triple distilled before it approaches the purity of an ion exchange resin. This process is best suited to production of larger volumes of water when poorer levels of de‑ionisation are acceptable.\n\nReverse Osmosis Reverse osmosis uses a membrane that is semi-permeable, allowing the fluid that is being purified to pass through it, while rejecting other ions and contaminants from passing. Reverse osmosis systems are often quite expensive, but have relatively low running costs. This process is best suited for applications that demand high large volumes of very well de-ionised water and can tolerate the high initial equipment costs.\n\nRemedial Action\n\nIf calcium carbonate (chalk) deposits have built up on the surface of a hydrophone, then it may be possible to gently remove them by soaking the affected part of the hydrophone in lemon juice. This works because the citric acid in the lemon juice reacts with the alkaline calcium carbonateto remove it - but the solution is sufficiently weak acid that it will not damage other components of the hydrophone. Leave the hydrophone in lemon juice for no longer than 30 minutes and then rinse thoroughly with de-ionised water before allowing to air dry.\n\nUnder no circumstances should the hydrophone be rubbed with a cloth or paper towel, as this is likely to abrade the gold electrode and damage it.\n\nDe-Gassing\n\nRationale Tap water is often super-saturated with dissolved gases (primarily oxygen). Bubbles can be a cause of major experimental problems since they act as near perfect reflectors of ultrasound. This can perturb the ultrasound field being measured. Worse still, if a bubble forms directly in front of the active element of the hydrophone it will prevent any propagating ultrasound from being measured by that hydrophone. Finally, in high-pressure fields bubbles are able to cavitate. This will result in the production of spurious acoustic signal at both lower frequencies (stable cavitation) and higher frequencies (inertial cavitation). Particular care should be taken to avoid inertial cavitation as the bubble collapse is a particularly destructive event. If such a collapse happens on the surface of a hydrophone, damage to the hydrophone may well occur. It is useful to note that macroscopic bubbles are visible to the naked eye. However, microscopic bubbles may be much harder to visually detect, but can be just as much of a problem.\n\nMany international standards require the use of degassed water including IEC61161, IEC61689, IEC61102, IEC61220, IEC60854 and the forthcoming IEC62127-part 1. This topic is sufficiently important to warrant a dedicated annex in IEC61161 Ed 2.0 discussing methods of water degassing.\n\nPreventative Measures\n\nThere are many possible methods of degassing water, but the reader is referred to IEC61161 Ed2.0 Annex D or Fowlkes and Carson (1991) for a more rigorous review of available methods. It is also important to note that re-absorption of gas occurs at all exposed water surfaces therefore water surfaces should be covered where possible to prevent reabsorption. A brief review of some degassing methods follows.\n\nVacuum Degassing When a vacuum is applied to a standing body of water, the reduced pressure will prevent dissolved gases from remaining in solution. Under these conditions the water will appear to boil as the gas bubbles rapidly expand and then break at the water surface. When subject to hard vacuums, levels of dissolved oxygen can be reduced below the 1 mg/litre level. This method of degassing is suited to small volumes of water (such as would be needed for a power balance), but can be difficult to implement for larger volumes (such as would be needed in a scanned hydrophone measurement tank).\n\nReduced Pressure Re-circulation This can be considered as being a derivative of vacuum degassing, but provides an inexpensive means of degassing on a much larger scale. The system comprises a high volume pump connected to a standing body of water by rigid walled tubing. A pressure restrictor is fitted to the inlet tube, such that the pump is attempting to draw water through the tube faster than water is allowed in. This creates a partial vacuum within the rigid walled tube and any dissolved gas bubbles increase in size, and eventually nucleate to form larger bubbles. These larger bubbles (due to their lower surface area to volume ratio) are less able to dissolve back into the water, and thus remain as bubbles as they pass through the pump into the outlet stream. The outlet stream will then contain larger (non-dissolved) bubbles which then float to the water's surface and escape to the atmosphere. It is important to note that both inlet and outlet points should be as low as possible in the water tank to prevent the turbulent flow nearby promoting gas re-absorption. The effectiveness of this method depends upon the pressure drop that can be achieved within the inlet hose, but with appropriate configuration oxygen levels of 2-3 mg/litre can be achieved.\n\nBoiling This is a simple but effective way of degassing water. Boiling periods as short as 5 minutes are sufficient to yield acceptable levels of degassing (oxygen levels below 2 mg/litre).The water should NOT be stirred whilst cooling as this will promote re-absorption of gases.\n\nAddition of Sodium Sulphite Sodium sulphite works by reacting with the dissolved oxygen in the water. Concentrations as low as 4 g/litre will keep oxygen levels below 2 mg/litre for at least 40 hours. However this technique introduces significant ionic content and the conductivity will increase to about 5 mS/cm - which is in contradiction to the efforts made in section 1. Furthermore sodium sulphite solution is alkaline and will result in corrosion on many metals including Aluminium and Nickel.\n\nPrevention of Biological Activity/Growth\n\nRationale Whilst not explicitly mentioned in ultrasonic measurement standards, prevention of biological growth is an important issue. The most obvious side effect of biological activity within a water tank is that the water tends to develop a cloudy yellow/green appearance, and can start to smell. A slimy film tends to accumulate on the surfaces of any items that are exposed for long periods. These deposits will serve to compromise the performance of a hydrophone in the same manner as calcification (see Section 1). Most importantly however, is that bacterial growth within the water can be a health risk to users of the measurement tank.\n\nPreventative Measures\n\nRemoval of dissolved solutes and gases (see Sections 1 and 2) will serve to slow down biological growth by reducing the available \"food sources\". However, these methods will not kill off any bacteria already present and a selection of methods is listed below. Please also note that either of the chemical methods will re-introduce ionic content into the water and will thereby compromise the deionisation discussed in Section 1.\n\nUV filtration Exposure to high intensity ultraviolet is a very effective means of destroying water-borne bacteria. There are numerous commercially available UV filters that can be fitted in-line with a pre-existing re-circulatory water conditioning system.\n\nChlorine Based Chemicals Chlorine based chemicals are commonly used to control biological activity in Swimming Pools. These chemicals are sometimes used as antibacterial agents in measurement tanks, although elevated concentrations of chlorine solutions can cause bleaching of fabrics. Furthermore prolonged skin exposure may lead to skin sensitisation and irritation for users of the tank.\n\nCopper Based Chemicals Copper based compounds have been used extensively in the marine industry as anti-fouling agents and there are some copper based solutions that are designed for addition to Swimming Pools. Care should be exercised though since copper can react with other metals (particularly Aluminium). It has also been know to react with the thin gold electrodes that are commonly found on hydrophones and transducers, thereby reducing the sensitivity of the devices.\n\nRemoval of suspended particulates\n\nRationale The presence of suspended particulate is also not mentioned explicitly in ultrasonic measurement standards. However, increased particulate load in the water can result in an increase of scattering at higher frequencies and thereby an increased attenuation. The commonest source of suspended matter is airborne particulates (dust) that fall into the tank. Suspended particles are also often introduced as transducers and hydrophones are moved into and out of the measurement tank. Since many of these particulates are organic, they are a further \"food source\" for biological activity. Consequently, removal of suspended particulate matter inhibits biological growth, as well as improving the optical clarity of the water.\n\nPreventative Measures\n\nParticulate filtration A re-circulation system that incorporates particulate filters will significantly reduce the suspended load. A common approach is to employ a two-stage filtration system: a coarse (e.g. 5 mm) filter will remove the majority of particulates, whilst a subsequent fine (e.g. less than 1 mm) filter will remove any residual suspension.\n\nCovering the surface of the water. Thin plastic film, or hollow plastic balls (e.g. polypropylene) provide an effective means of stopping airborne debris falling into the tank. These methods also serve to reduce the surface area exposed to the air and thus reduce gas re-absorption."

When that finally happens, ZeroWater may be the city's best hope to regain the taste and purity they're accustomed to.\n\nThe city of Anchorage, Alaska relies on a glacier for drinking water and hydro power. But according to a recent story on NPR, scientists are unsure how long this tradition will last.\n\n\"It gets to be the consistency of really strong Styrofoam,\" says glaciologist Louis Sass, regarding the glacier's top layer of snow. The researchers camp on the glacier for three weeks every May. They ski to several survey points and collect samples of snow. They're determining just how much snow is accumulating every winter. The data is then provided to Anchorage's utilities departments.\n\nThe studies have determined that the glacier has been shrinking rapidly since the 1950's. For now, this is actually good news, as it supplies the reservoir with extra drinking water. The glacier is expected to last at least the next few decades. So on a bittersweet note, the locals know they'll be in good standing for a while. However it means they need to be considering future alternatives.\n\nOf course, there is no replacement for the natural crispness of pure glacier water, but ZeroWater might be the next best thing. The product has been on the market for a little over three years. Unlike competing filtration products, ZeroWater utilizes a five-stage filtration process. The five stage process is responsible for creating the purest, most refreshing water this side of the arctic.\n\nSurely the locals will never consider anything as delicious as the fresh glacier water. However, when they finally have to find a new source, they may just agree that ZeroWater is the closest solution.\n\nABOUT\n\nZeroWater was founded by a father and son team.

Yet, when water comes from underground - right into your household - there are no guarantees as to its purity or quality. Every day you expect to have quality water to use for everything from laundry and house cleaning to drinking and bathing. Private wells are reliable sources of good tasting water; however, regular testing is needed to ensure your water is safe to drink. Fortunately, testing is simple, fast and affordable.\n\nThe Coastal Health District Laboratory is a full service, state-certified laboratory specializing in water testing for residential, commercial, and industrial customers. In conjunction with promoting safe water, we offer well and septic system inspections. We also offer testing for Volatile Organic Chemical (VOC) contamination in water and soil. Our qualified staff has earned the respect of both state agencies and customers alike by providing accurate testing along with prompt and professional service.\n\nCommon Contaminants Found in Residential Well Water\nWell water can become contaminated without any change in the water's taste, smell or appearance. The following are common contaminants found in residential Georgia wells:\n• COLIFORM BACTERIA: A natural part of the microbiology of soils, insects, and warm-blooded animals, coliform bacteria is the primary indicator for presence of disease causing organisms in water.\n• NITRATES: Elevated levels can be an indication of contamination by farm chemicals, lawn fertilizers, or septic saturation. Nitrates can pose a serious health risk to young infants.\n• ARSENIC: This toxic element is found naturally in soil and bedrock. Ingestion can lead to serious health problems.\n• LEAD: Houses built before 1985 may contain lead pipes or lead-based solder. Lead can cause serious health problems in young children.\n• FLUORIDE: Found naturally in water. While low levels of fluoride are desirable, excessive amounts may stain teeth.\n• SULFATES: High levels of sulfates can cause odors, leave spots, taste bitter and have a temporary laxative effect.\n• CHLORIDES: Small amounts of salt are natural. Higher levels are unnatural and may indicate a faulty water softener, road salt, and septic waste or fertilizer contamination.\n\nCommon Questions About Well Water Q. Is well water safe to drink?\nYes. Water from a private well can be just as safe, if not safer, than municipal water. However, regular testing is needed to ensure a continued supply of clean, safe water.\n\nQ. How can I tell if my well water is safe?\nWhile some contaminants will change the appearance or taste of the water, others cannot be seen, smelled, or even tasted. The only sure way to know is to have your water tested.\n\nQ. Can I test my water at home?\nWhile do-it-yourself test kits are available on the market, these tests are never as accurate as those performed by a state-certified lab. Safe water shouldn't be a guessing game. To know what's in your water for sure, utilize the services of a certified lab.\n\nQ. How often should I have my well tested?\nMany state and federal authorities recommend having your water tested annually for coliform bacteria and nitrates. Other contaminants should be tested for at least once every five to ten years.\n\nQ. How long will it take to get the results?\nSome laboratories may take as long as two weeks to return your results. For typical tests, Clean Water Testing will usually return your results within two business days.\n\nQ. How much will a water test cost me?\nCosts can vary depending on the number and type of tests you request. Typical tests range from $15 - $90.\n\nI want to have my water tested. Now what?\nContact the Coastal Health District Laboratory at 1395 Eisenhower Drive Savannah, Ga. 31406, or by phone at (912) 356-2148, or via fax at (912) 356-2499.\n\n• The lab will send back a comprehensive report on your results, or will contact you by phone if a serious problem exists with your water. Typical tests are completed in approximately 5-7 business days, depending on tests ordered. After reviewing your results, you may determine a water treatment solution is necessary. The answer may be as simple as a water conditioner or a drinking water system. You may want to talk with a qualified water treatment specialist to properly evaluate your needs and options."

      "text": "Reuse of municipal wastewater has potential to augment future drinking water supplies\n\nJan 10, 2012\n\nWith recent advances in technology and design, treating municipal wastewater and reusing it for drinking water, irrigation, industry, and other applications could significantly increase the nation's total available water resources, particularly in coastal areas facing water shortages, says a new report from the National Research Council. It adds that the reuse of treated wastewater, also known as reclaimed water, to augment drinking water supplies has significant potential for helping meet future needs. Moreover, new analyses suggest that the possible health risks of exposure to chemical contaminants and disease-causing microbes from wastewater reuse do not exceed, and in some cases may be significantly lower than, the risks of existing water supplies.\n\n\"Wastewater reuse is poised to become a legitimate part of the nation's water supply portfolio given recent improvements to treatment processes,\" said R. Rhodes Trussell, chair of the committee that wrote the report and president of Trussell Technologies, Pasadena, Calif. \"Although reuse is not a panacea, wastewater discharged to the environment is of such quantity that it could measurably complement water from other sources and management strategies.\"\n\nThe report examines a wide range of reuse applications, including potable water, non-potable urban and industrial uses, irrigation, groundwater recharge, and ecological enhancement. The committee found that many communities have already implemented water reuse projects -- such as irrigating golf courses and parks or providing industrial cooling water in locations near wastewater reclamation plants -- that are well-established and generally accepted. Potable water reuse projects account for only a small fraction of the volume of water currently being reused. However, many drinking water treatment plants draw water from a source that contains wastewater discharged by a community located upstream; this practice is not officially acknowledged as potable reuse.\n\nThe report outlines wastewater treatment technologies for mitigating chemical and microbial contaminants, including both engineered and natural treatment systems. These processes can be used to tailor wastewater reclamation plants to meet the quality requirements of intended reuse applications. The concentrations of chemicals and microbial contaminants in reuse projects designed to augment drinking water supplies can be comparable to or lower than those commonly present in many drinking water supplies. The committee emphasized the need for process reliability and careful monitoring to ensure that all reclaimed water meets the appropriate quality objectives for its use.\n\nCosts of water reuse for potable and non-potable applications vary widely because they depend on site-specific factors, the committee said. Water reuse projects tend to be more expensive than most water conservation options and less expensive than seawater desalination and other new supply alternatives. Although the costs of reclaimed water are often higher than current water sources, the report urges water authorities to consider other costs and benefits in addition to monetary expenditures when assessing reuse projects. For example, water reuse systems used in conjunction with a water conservation program could be effective in reducing seasonal peak demands on the drinking water system. Depending on the specific designs and pumping requirements, reuse projects could also have a larger or smaller carbon footprint than existing supply alternatives or reduce water flows to downstream users and ecosystems.\n\nWater reuse regulations differ by state and are not based on risk-assessment methods, the report says. Adjustments to the federal regulatory framework could help ensure a high level of public health protection, provide a consistent minimum level of protection across the nation, and increase public confidence in potable and non-potable water reuse. The report notes that existing legislative tools could be applied to improve the quality of water for reuse, including updating the National Pretreatment Program's list of priority pollutants to include a wider inventory of known toxic substances. Also, it lists 14 areas of research to help guide the country on how to apply water reuse appropriately. Such research would require improved coordination among federal and nongovernmental organizations.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nA $2 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) will allow the University of Miami (UM) College of Engineering to develop an autonomous net-zero water dormitory at UM.

Typically I try to buy Spring Water, however, I will also buy water that has been...\n\nIn the last two decades bottled water has gone from extraneous to ubiquitous. Despite having one of the best public water systems in the world, Americans continue to buy more and more bottled water—per capita, 27.6 gallons last year, up from 17.8 gallons in 2000 (and only 1.6 gallons in 1976). Is it worth it?\n\n1. 40% of bottled water—including top-brands Aquafina and Dasani—is simply filtered tap water, not water from natural springs or other \"pure\" sources.\n\n2. In the United States, more than 10 million barrels of oil are used to bottle water annually—and that's just production. Consider the oil consumption (and emissions) required to bring water to the U.S. from Fiji, for example.\n\n3. Americans throw away 22 billion water bottles each year, over 60 million each day. It can take as long as 1,000 years for the average plastic bottle to biodegrade.\n\n4. Numerous studies have shown that bottled water is generally no safer or healthier than tap water, despite costing up to 10,000 times more."

This ensures the safety of bottled water from the time it\nis produced and packaged through to when it is consumed.\n\nFederal Regulations for Bottled Water\nThe FDA basically uses the EPA standards for drinking water as a\nguideline for bottled water. The combination of these standards\nwith the FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices makes it clear that\nbottled water is a product with checks and balances. Along with\nthese standards is the FDA's labeling rules for bottled water,\nwhich clearly defines the type of water you are purchasing. These\nterms are standardized definitions of the various types of water\nsold on the market from \"spring water\" to \"seltzer water\" and every\nkind of water in between.\n\nState Standards\nThe primary responsibility for the safety of bottled water at the\nstate level lies in the certification and inspection of the water\nsource. States can also require that bottling plants be registered\nwith the state and meet state requirements. Most states will also\ninspect bottlers annually and sometimes perform unannounced\ninspections of the bottling facility.\n\nIndustry Standards\nMany bottled water companies join the IBWA (International Bottled\nWater Association) and adhere to IBWA standards (which are stricter\nthan the FDA's). To become a member and maintain good standing,\nbottlers must allow plant inspections annually that are often\nunannounced.

Technology allows for water distribution over vast distances, however some unintended consequences of wastewater disposal may ruin drinking water.\n\nEmily Pickrell, writing at the site Fuel Fix, highlights a recent study by Stony Brook University that explores the effect hydraulic fracturing has on water:\n\nHydraulic fracturing, a process where a mixture of water, sand and chemicals are pumped underground under high pressure, could be polluting nearby surface water sources through five different ways, according to a Stony Brook University study.\n\nThe study found water could be contaminated by transportation spills, well casing leaks, leaks through fractured rock, drilling site surface discharge and wastewater disposal. The greatest contamination risks came from wastewater disposal.\n\n\"The used hydraulic fracturing fluid is transported to a wastewater treatment facility and discharged to streams,\" according to the report. The researchers said those treatment facilities may not be equipped to handle the chemicals found in the used fracking wastewater, leading to contaminated drinking water if it is released into nearby water sources, according to the report.\n\nA few well operators recycle hydraulic fracturing fluids, but its higher costs have prevented it from being widely used.\n\nHydraulic fracturing has faced heavy criticism from environmentalists who claim the process can cause earthquakes, pollute air and can contaminate drinking water supplies. The industry has routinely disputed those claims, saying the process is safe.\n\nThe Stony Brook study recommended further study of how industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants could remove contaminants from used hydraulic fracturing fluids. It also suggests that various alternative approaches to hydraulic fracturing, such as nitrogen-based or liquefied petroleum gas fracturing, be explored by regulators, in order to reduce the wastewater usage."

When you consume these beverage you may leave a chemical imprint in your hair that could be used to track your travels over time, a new study suggests. The findings, believed to be the first concerted effort to describe the use of beverages as a potential tool to investigate the geographic location of people, appears in ACS' Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry.\n\nLesley Chesson and colleagues explain that the body removes hydrogen and oxygen atoms from water (H2O), and beverages containing water, and incorporates them into proteins, including the protein in hair. Hydrogen and oxygen exist in different forms, or isotopes. The proportions of those isotopes vary in a predictable way geographically, with higher values in low-latitude, low-elevation, or coastal regions, for instance, and lower values elsewhere. Since manufacturers usually use local or regional water sources in producing beverages, isotope patterns in hair could serve as a chemical \"fingerprint\" to pinpoint the geographic region where a person has been.\n\nThe scientists analyzed isotope patterns in bottled water, soda pop, and beer from 33 cities and found that patterns in the beverages generally matched those already known for the tap water. They noted that the isotope pattern in beverages tends to vary from city to city in ways that give cities in different regions characteristic \"iso-signatures.\" A person who drinks a beer or soda in Denver, Des Moines, or Dallas, for instance, consumes a different isotope signature than a person in Las Cruces, Las Vegas, or Laramie.

      "text": "lueless about softwater issues\n\nI was researching the cost of installing soft water systems recently.\nI cannot recall who or where I read it but this comment was made:\n\n\"..(after installing a soft water system) you then will have to deal with\nthe soft water problems, instead of hardwater problems...\"\n\nI have no idea what this might refer to....?\n\nI live in the California high desert and our water is really bad (hard).\nMineral stain/etching all over the place.\nMy windows are permanently etched. I have washed the windows with CLR and it helps only some and not for very long...\n\nDon't remember the post on problems, but here are some factors to consider:\n\nSofteners are very effective and make very soft water (No hardness). That tends to make it difficult to remove suds. Municipal systems usually blend soft and hard water to deliver something on the order of 80 to 120 mg/liter of hardness. That is a little tricky for the system in your basement.\n\nSoftening replaced the calcium in your water with sodium. If you are sensitive to sodium, that can be a problem, Usually, you don't drink enough water for it to matter.\n\nVery soft water can be more corrosive than hard water. You want to check your pH and may have to deal with corrosive water.\n\nYou should have a water test to understand all of the issues with your water. Look especially for hardness, iron, manganese, pH, magnesium, nitrates, nitrites, total dissolved solids, and coliform bacteria. Sometimes they will report a corrossivity index for which the ideal result is 0 to +0.5. If it is negative the water is corrosive, if more positive you may get scaling.\n\nSometimes people run a line to the sink to use unsoftened water for drinking because they like the taste better.\n\nI'm not sure what they were referring to exactly, but reminds me that I recently installed a Desert Spring humidifier on my furnace. The Q and A that the company puts on the web make reference to white deposits which they claim softened water will cause the humidifier to emit into the air stream. Seems backwards to me -- you should get calcium and magnesium deposits with hard water, but seems you shouldn't have a problem with soft water.\n\nI have read that if you have old pipes with lead-based solder, hard water may cause the lead to be covered over with mineral deposits. I don't know if you then switched to soft water whether it might desolve some of those deposits and expose the lead?\n\nFrom my point of view, softened water has been helpful around the house. One of my outside hose bibs is plumbed to have soft water -- I rarely use that one for watering plants, but use it a lot for car washing, which is nice since it leaves fewer water spots if you don't dry it immediately.\n\nIt does take a week or two to get used to the \"slippery\" feeling when you shower with soft water, but eventually you realize that you don't actually have soap residue on your skin. Rather, you're feeling what your skin feels like if you don't have residue created by soap + Mg + Calcium.\n\nVery interesting...\nOne concern for me might be my landscaping which consists of cactus, agave and yucca-not to mention the very rare Joshua Tree.\nThese have thrived here for literally thousands of years with this hard water.\n\nLosing a Joshua tree would be awful. They cannot be replaced.\nYou can't buy them full grown or transplant them.\nI dont think I should mess with mother nature......in my particular case.\n\nMike, hard water can not etch glass, either there's something else doing it or\n\n\"..(after installing a soft water system) you then will have to deal with\nthe soft water problems, instead of hard water problems...\"\n\nMore than likely that is from someone that doesn't like the 'slippery' feeling. A feeling that they can't rinse the soap off themselves. They mistakenly believe it is due to the sodium in softened water, or the soap on their skin but neither is true.\n\nThe feeling is due to the softened water cleaning their skin much better than when they wash in hard water. Hard water leaves a film on everything that it is used on or to clean etc..\n\nSoftened water cleans the pores of the skin allowing the skin's natural oils to come to the surface, causing the 'slippery feeling'. Unless you use facial cleansers etc. your skin is never as clean as when washed in softened water. The reason is that hard water blocks pores keeping the oils from protecting the skin from dryness, cracking, scaling etc.. That is why so many women buy skin cleaners, bath oils, facial creams etc.. Softened water cleans everything easier and faster than hard water and softened water allows those things to stay cleaner longer. That saying \"squeaky clean\", it was never true unless there was oil or grease on the surface and it was removed with a rag etc. and then with hard water which will leave a film on the surface that by drawing a finger across it, will cause a squeaking sound.\n\nAnother possible reason for the comment is that some people mistakenly believe that the added sodium is a problem but they have no idea of how much sodium is added; they just see all the salt in the brine tank disappear and mistakenly think it is all added to their water. The truth is that two ions of sodium is added per ion of (ion) exchange. And the formula to find out just how much has been added is 7.85 mg/l per grain per gallon. So if the water hardness is 15 gpg, then 7.85 * 15 = 117.75 mg of added sodium per roughly a quart of softened water. If you check the label on a loaf of white bread, you usually see between 120 to 150 mg of sodium per slice. So drink your recommended two quarts of this softened water per day and you get the same sodium, or less than a sandwich made with white bread alone... And those folks on sodium restricted diets know how to adjust their daily intake.\n\nAs to softened water being corrosive. That is not true. If it were then harder water would be progressively less corrosive and that is not true.\n\nSoftening water does not decrease the TDS (total dissolved solids) content of water, it slightly increases TDS, due to the added sodium ion; recall the two for one above? Naturally soft water, low TDS and thereby usually acidic water is corrosive, but not ion exchange softened water. And BobNH, the Langlier Saturation Index (LSI) was never meant to be used to determine the aggressiveness or curiosity of ion exchange softened water. It was invented and supposed to be used solely for determining if a given water would dissolve asbestos fiber reinforced cement water distribution pipe or not; and it has been misused ever since.\n\nYou should NEVER use softened water for any plant material. It contains enough sodium to make the leaves turn yellow. If you use calcium chloride instead of sodium chloride, I think it is ok, but the salt is 2 to 3 times the price. Generally, the best idea is to just install the softener at a point in your system that the outdoor water will not be softened.\n\nGet a water test and you can figure out what you need, or you can ask here.\n\nYou can get different heads with different bells and whistles, but simpler is better. I installed one at my mother's place about 15 years ago and it still works fine. It has a little turbine meter that measures usage and starts a clock cycle for regenerating. Nothing fancy. If you can solder 3/4 copper you can install it yourself. It wll cost you a lot less than $1000.\n\nDifferences in price for the same head are based on the size of the resin tank, which is based on your hardness level and demand. You must have the water test to determine what you need. They are inexpensive and often available from public agencies.\n\nHere is a quote from a recent post by Speedbump, who sells water treatment systems and is a respected member of this forum. Note that the softener that he remarks on is the same model as is available at the link in my previous post.\n\n\" I have a very wealthy customer who wanted a softener installed at his dock so he could wash off his 40 some odd foot boat. . . . . . he called me and asked what I thought of magnetic softeners. . . . . . . it sure did look nice all plumbed into his PVC plumbing out at the dock. He now has a 1 cu. ft. unit with a Fleck 5600 metered head to actually soften his water.\"\n\nWhat about excess sodium in softened water (from a malfunctioning/incorrectly set softener). Does (or can) the excess sodium precipitate water heater failure?\n\nI have my theories, but I'll sit back and listen.\n\nIt would be very difficult to get a softener to pass \"excess\" sodium into the softened water and the control valve set up can't accomplish it. So no, sodium is not gong to cause water heater failure.\n\nThe primary cause of water heater failure is a failure of the glass lining of the mild steel tank allowing water to rust the tank until it leaks. All waters have some sodium in them and there is no \"excess\" sodium other than that which is added as part of the ion exchange process. As part of the regeneration all softeners rinse all the sodium out of the resin tank that is not held on the resin bead sites. As ion exchange occurs, two sodium ions are released per ion of calcium, magnesium etc. that is removed by a softener. If the glass lining in the heater is intact, there can not be any rusting (corrosion), and if the outside didn't rust, which is impossible, the tank would last forever.\n\nAs to the web site page mentioned above, be careful, there is some incorrect info there. Read the 5600 spec sheet and you'll see the control valve is being used on tanks larger than it is supposed to be. And there is no mention of SFR rates of the various size softeners; the SFR of the control valve is not used for the resin, that is done by the resin manufacturer solely.\n\nAs to control valves, I think the Clack WS-1 is the best choice all around and especially for a DIYer that will replace a part if needed. There is no control more simple in design as to ease of repair. The Clack is extremely simple, easy and faster to repair and there are no special Fleck control valve specific tools required; as most Fleck valves require.\n\nAs to using potassium chloride instead of sodium chloride and especially with plants, the link given above has a number of answers in the Potassium FAQs sectin concerning that, including a number of cautions.\n\nHow about the excess sodium that results from an undersized, excessively long or otherwise restricted drain hose? Another situation would be a shallow well that cannot produce the sustained GPM necessary for the rinse cycle.\nThe sort of situation where the hose can pass enough water for the brine cycle, but not enough water for a thorough rinsing.\n\nI have fielded issues of brine residue/salty taste in softened water. Most of the time the issues are a softener not calibrated to actual hardness, systems of relatively low hardness that are removing high amounts of iron, old timed systems which are regenerating far too often, dramatically oversized systems or what I've already mentioned above.\n\nTo simply say that an issue cannot happen (and even if it did...it can't, and there's already sodium in the water, so any more can't have an effect) is a classy way of side-stepping an issue that, from what I read here, can never happen.\n\nWhile it shouldn't happen on paper, the truth is that much happens in the real world. Be the cause from an installer who just puts it in, and has no clue of how to set the head, a salesmen who gives the customer 'the best one they make' not fully realizing whether the system is oversized, or using a softener primarily for iron removal.\n\nWhat I'm trying to get at is simply this. Does excess sodium, how ever it gets into the water, make the water more corrosive.\n\nI already said no to the \"is sodium going to cause water heater failure\", but then went on to say why because of your sitting there with your own theories.... which now you state a few and seem to be wanting to hear that the answer is yes, sodium causes heater failure but, how stills has to be stated...\n\nSo, let me say that if those things were present, the softener has not been working correctly from the git go. And anyone that allows the softener to sit there not working... or working that way... Well I was seeing a softener that was, or had been, set up and working correctly and then all of a sudden is allowing a salty taste.\n\nA more restricted drain line, all softeners have a flow control, will prevent the brine from being drawn out of the brine tank, hence it isn't in the resin bed to be added to the softened water. The clue for that is higher and higher water level in the brine tank and hard water leakage into the softened water, or said another way, having hard water instead of softened.\n\nA well that can't produce say the 3.0 gpm to backwash say up to a 2.5 cuft softener for up to 12 minutes ( a 'normal' shower can flow more and usually flows longer!), isn't going to be doing much good when the softener isn't in regeneration... And maybe you're confusing the recovery rate with the delivered water peak demand flow rate OR you're forgetting the storage capacity of the well. I.E. a 6\" well has 1.47 gals/foot of water. Plus, most folks don't use much water after midnight, and that allows the well 2 hours of recovery before the softener goes into a regeneration. So the well should be fully recovered from most late night water uses such as a couple showers and toilet flushes.\n\nTo my knowledge sodium does not make water corrosive, and salt is sodium chloride, not just sodium.\n\nChloride is corrosive. The chloride part of sodium chloride and/or potassium chloride goes right through a softener and out to drain. If you have incomplete rinses, you leave brine (sodium, or potassium, chloride) in the resin tank that will cause a salty taste but it takes little salt to make water taste salty. BUT, if you've left brine in the resin tank, then you have the salt dose set way too high and/or the rinse times way too short. And you'd know that immediately after installation, well, after the first regeneration, but close enough.\n\nThe slow rinse/brine draw (brining) position/cycle is always, in the vast majority of softeners, from 45-75 minutes and the flow is usually .25 to .5 gpm. During all that time the well is recovering from the prior backwash water use that usually happens before brining. That time is usually no more than 6-12 minutes; at the same flow rate as backwash.\n\nIf any of those things exist, then I agree, the dealer/installer etc. have it set up wrong (and deserve to have the complaint and expense of salty water IMO! LOL). If the drain line ID is too small or the run is long enough to require a larger DLFC (drain line flow control) and they didn't increase the ID and/or raise the DLFC, dittos. If they didn't check for proper pressure and/or flow rate or time on a well water system, dittos. Personally, I've seen plumbers, well drillers and some DIYers do those things but not dealers and their installers.\n\nNot many private water systems that I know of have 6\" casings. Four inch is more on par around here, while many seasonal homes have 1 1/4\" sandpoints that are maybe 25' deep at most. It's the sandpoints of which I speak.\n\nWhen I speak of a restricted or long drain hose, I'm meaning one that will pass the .5 gpm for brine draw, but will not pass the full volume during the backwash cycle.\n\nWhile all of this goes back to incorrect installations (or applications), not everyone is an engineer, nor do many plumbers completely understand the processes.\n\nI've seen many (mostly old) softener installations where only the supply to the water heater was softened, not any other cold lines. One customer in particular was averaging 13 months per heater with such an installation. He is now on warranty heater #5 (all were tank leaks/52 gal electric). The last replacement was done by me, and the old antiquated (20 year old) softener was bypassed after conferring with the homeowner. The softener was an old rental unit that had long since been forgotten, just the customer dutifully adding salt since the company went belly-up. The city water in that area is around 7 grains, so the softener is not a total necessity. While time is not on my side, yet, that last replacement was 15 months ago.\n\nI'm not implying that there are not other factors which may be the cause, but I've seen a few things over the years that really gets me wondering on the 'what if' side of things.\n\nI've never seen anything other than 6\" and 5 5/8\" wells and I did pump work on many wells over the years. I don't know how people live with anything less than 4\".\n\nAnyone setting up and/or installing a softener should know what they're doing or follow the directions, but they don't have to be an engineer.

      "text": "Food and Beverage Precautions\n\nContaminated food and drink are frequently encountered threats\nduring international travel. The more common infections that travelers\nmay acquire include E. Coli infections, shigellosis or bacillary\ndysentery, giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, and hepatitis\nA. Other potential infections include typhoid\nfever and other salmonelloses, cholera,\npoliomyelitis, and infections caused by\nparasites.\n\nWater that has been adequately chlorinated will provide significant\nprotection against viral and bacterial waterborne diseases. However,\nchlorine treatment alone may not kill some viruses and the parasites\nthat cause giardiasis, amebiasis, and cryptosporidiosis. In areas\nwhere chlorinated tap water is not available, or where hygiene and\nsanitation are poor, travelers should be advised that only the following\nmay be safe to drink:\n\nBeverages, such as tea and coffee, made with boiled water\n\nCanned or bottled carbonated beverages, including carbonated\nbottled water and soft drinks\n\nBeer and wine\n\nWhere water may be contaminated, ice or containers for drinking\nalso should be considered contaminated. In these areas, ice should\nnot be used in beverages. If ice has been in contact with containers\nused for drinking, the containers should be thoroughly cleaned,\npreferably with soap and hot water, after the ice has been discarded.\n\nIt is safer to drink directly from a can or bottle of a beverage\nthan from a questionable container. However, water on the outside\nof cans or bottles of beverages might be contaminated. Wet cans\nor bottles should be dried before opening, and surfaces which are\ncontacted directly by the mouth in drinking should first be wiped\nclean. Where water may be contaminated, travelers should avoid brushing\ntheir teeth with tap water.\n\nBoiling is by far the most reliable method to make water of uncertain\npurity safe for drinking. Water should be brought to a vigorous\nrolling boil for one minute and allowed to cool to room temperature,\nwithout ice. At very high altitudes, generally above two kilometers,\nboil for three minutes or use chemical disinfection. Adding a pinch\nof salt to each quart, or pouring the water several times from one\ncontainer to another will improve the taste.\n\nChemical disinfection with iodine is an alternative method of\nwater treatment when it is not feasible to boil water. Two well-tested\nmethods for disinfection with iodine are the use of tincture of\niodine and the use of tetraglycine hydroperiodide tablets. The tablets\nare available from pharmacies and sporting goods stores, and manufacturers'\ninstructions should be followed. Chlorine is less reliable than\niodine for chemical disinfection. Cloudy water should be strained\nthrough a clean cloth into a container to remove any sediment or\nfloating matter, and then the water should be boiled or treated\nwith iodine.\n\nThere are a variety of portable filters currently on the market\nfor providing safe drinking water. Although, in theory, these filters\nmay be useful, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nhas not established the effectiveness of such filters, and makes\nno recommendation regarding their use.\n\nAs a last resort, if no source of safe drinking water is available\nor can be obtained, tap water that is uncomfortably hot to touch\nmay be safer than cold tap water; however, proper disinfection or\nboiling is still advised.\n\nFood should be selected with care to avoid illness. All raw food\nis subject to contamination. Particularly in areas where hygiene\nand sanitation are inadequate, the traveler should be advised to\navoid salads, uncooked vegetables, unpasteurized milk and milk products\nsuch as cheese; and to eat only food that has been cooked and is\nstill hot, or fruit that has been peeled by the traveler. Cooked\nfood that has been allowed to stand for several hours at ambient\ntemperature may provide a fertile medium for bacterial growth and\nshould be thoroughly reheated before serving. Consumption of food\nand beverages obtained from street vendors has been associated with\nincreased risk of illness. The easiest way to assure a safe food\nsource for an infant less than six months of age is to have the\nchild breast-feed. If the infant has already been weaned from the\nbreast, formula prepared from commercial powder and boiled water\nis the safest and most practical food.\n\nSome species of fish and shellfish can contain poisonous biotoxins,\neven when well cooked. The most common type of fish poisoning in\ntravelers is ciguatera fish poisoning. Barracuda is the most toxic\nfish and should always be avoided. Red snapper, grouper, amberjack,\nsea bass, and a wide range of tropical reef fish contain toxin at\nunpredictable times. The potential for ciguatera poisoning exists\nin all subtropical and tropical insular areas of the West Indies,\nand Pacific and Indian Oceans where the implicated fish species\nare consumed. Cholera has also occurred among persons who ate crabs\nbrought back from Latin America by travelers. Travelers should not\nbring perishable seafoods with them when they return."

      "text": "Main menu\n\nTag Archives: Public Education\n\nSome of the comments on my \"Don't Be a Sucker 101″ post accused me of assuming that most people buy bottled water because they wish to avoid the fluoride that is added to tap water. I'm sorry if I was unclear, but I was not making that assumption. I don't give regular bottled water drinkers THAT much credit.\n\nHere's the problem.\n\nOld man giardia\n\n1) TAP WATER IS FINE IN MOST CASES. Tap water is regularly tested and local municipalties have to abide by super stringent water quality standards. Lots of research has gone into establishing these standards and confirming that the levels of compounds in the water are safe for human consumption.\n\nAccording to a 4-year National Resource Defense Council report, bottled water companies frequently are not held to the same standards. For example, bottled water companies are not required to test for waterborne parasites like giardia (a parasite that looks like an old man and will give you a nasty case of diarrhea) while local water municipalaties are required to do so.\n\nIn fact, the same NRDC report that I mentioned above identified contamination (bacteria, arsenic and synthetic organic chemicals) in nearly 1/3 of the bottled waters that they tested. I tried to read the rebuttal argument to the NRDC report from Bottled Water Web (the \"definitive bottled water site\"), but only paying members are allowed to view the document.\n\n2) LOTS OF BOTTLED WATER CAME FROM THE TAP TO BEGIN WITH. Between 25-40% of the bottled water found on shelves didn't come from pristine mountain springs, but from the local water utility near bottled water production plants. On the plus side, this at least means that the water has met FDA standards…\n\nFor example, Coca-Cola's Dasani and Pepsi's Aquafina come from local water sources and pass the water through a few additional filters before marking it up 10,000% and sticking it on the shelves.\n\nIf you've examined the research and have decided that you personally believe the levels of certain compounds should be even lower than recommended, then fine. Go find a bottled water company that filters more of this compound out than local municipalities do. I am going to go out on a limb here and say that probably no more than 10% (I think this is a conservative estimate) of bottled water consumers have looked at the research and made an educated decision about buying their water.\n\n3) BOTTLED WATER IS RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE. I'm not convinced that tap water which is already totally safe for human consumption is worth a huge mark-up after being run through a few more filters. During my days in the food service industry (thank god those are over!) I remember selling bottled water to customers for $2.16. I would always offer to give them a glass of tap water, but many preferred the bottled water instead. I found this particularly amusing as we were selling Dasani, which I've already noted is simply refiltered tap water anyway. Anyway, if you consider that they could have gotten tap water for free then they're essentially paying infinitely more for bottled water.\n\n4) PACKAGING AND PROCESSING CAN INTRODUCE CONTAMINANTS. In the past, processing and packaging the tap water introduced bacteria, resulting in water that was less safe to consume than when it first left the faucet (references here and here). The last study that I read on this topic was published in 1998, so I'll concede that the industry may have cleaned up its act by now. That doesn't change the fact that the water has encountered a whole lot more surfaces and has had a lot more time to sit and culture bacteria than would water that came directly from the tap.\n\n5) WASTE. This one is pretty obvious, so I won't harp on it for long. You can probably imagine how much plastic is wasted in packaging bottled water, but lots of water is wasted as well. For example, producing 1 liter of bottled water requires the usage of 3 liters of water in the production process. Here are some other fun facts.\n\n–\n\nTo be fair, there are certainly some cases where it may be smart to drink bottled water. For example, if you have a kidney condition and need to avoid fluoride, then researching which bottled water companies remove fluoride and then purchasing water from that company may be a good idea.\n\nIf you're ever in an area where you know the tap water is contaminated or are outside of the US in countries where the tap water isn't well regulated, then again it might be a good idea to drink bottled water.\n\nTo reiterate, if you live in a town in which the EPA's yearly water quality report has informed you that you have high, unsafe contaminant levels in your drinking water, then I'm NOT talking about you. But you're in the minority, so I'm talking about nearly everyone else.\n\nThere certainly are times when spending a lot of money on bottled water makes sense, but the majority of bottled water sales are purchased outside of these circumstances. Part of the taxes I pay go to ensuring the quality of the tap water I consume. As I live in a city that boasts no water quality problems, I stay away from bottled water as much as possible.\n\nIn an earlier blog I chastised parents for taking advice from celebrities like Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy on important health topics. In the days since I wrote that blog I've been wondering about the scientist's role as a public servant. Could the scientific community have done more to counter this misinformation, perhaps preventing the decrease in vaccine use that we're currently witnessing?\n\nI believe that the answer is yes, we could have done more. Vaccines aren't the only area where greater scientist involvement could make a difference. I'm confident that just about every scientific subdiscipline has something important to offer the public.\n\nSo how do we get this information to the public? It won't be easy, but I think we need to be proactive. We could contact newspapers, TV stations and radio stations, for starters. We could contact local high schools and offer to give special lectures to students during their scheduled science classes.\n\nBut the question remains, \"Are we obligated to do anything?\" It likely depends on which scientific position you hold, but the contracts that most of us have signed in no way state that we're obligated to educate the public. That being said, I think it's important to remember that taxpayers pay our bills. Whether you're funded by NSF, NIH, the university or college that you work for or some other government agency, it's likely that state and federal tax monies are going towards funding your projects and paying your bills.\n\nDespite this, it is the case that what we're actually being paid to do is to either teach courses or conduct research. Our bills are also being paid by the students sitting in the courses that we teach. In fact, in academia at least, too much public service could be detrimental to your career.\n\nWhy don't scientists spend more time engaging the public?\n\nThe answer, in my mind, is because it's often detrimental to our careers. It'll probably take a lot of time and effort to really get the public's attention (especially when we're going up against celebrities) and many of us are in a system where we can't afford to offer that kind of a time commitment.\n\nIf you're a professor going up for tenure, then you're going to be judged on a set of predetermined criteria. I have yet to go through the tenure process myself (I'm still a graduate student), but I believe I have a pretty good understanding of what the criteria are for achieving tenure. The tenure committee focuses on how many papers you've published and where you published them, how many courses you taught and how well you taught them, how capable you were at establishing your lab, and how much service you provided to the department and the institution as a whole.\n\nCarl Sagan\n\nIf you're going to excel in all of these areas in the space of 7 years, then just about any activity you engage in that isn't focused on achieving these ends is going to set you back. I know people who have even put off having the children that they eventually want until after they've received tenure because they don't even feel like they have time any spare time at all. During the years when you're really getting into the groove of what kind of a scientist you're going to be, you're keenly aware that you don't have time to spend communicating with the public. This is critical because, as far as I can tell, not making tenure is devastating to one's career.\n\nOnce tenure has been reached, there is still no incentive to spend one's time with the public. Professional scientific societies and the scientific community as a whole primarily praise and award achievements in research, not public education. So again, time spent communicating with the public is time that you're taking away from advancing your career.\n\nSo what is the solution?\n\nI don't think that change is going to come without a push from research institutions and professional societies. For example, I think it would be absolutely fantastic if universities hired scientists who were paid to spend all of their time finding ways to communicate with the public. They should be required to stay on top of important public issues (swine flu, vaccines, etc.) and should then disseminate this information through public media as well as more direct avenues (public lectures, etc.).\n\nAlternatively, universities could offer professors limited teaching loads for a semester every couple years in return for time spent educating more publicly. They would be charged with discussing whatever topics are pertinent in their field and would be required in some way to show that they had made a strong effort to get this information out.\n\nThe problem with both of these solutions is that they require even MORE taxpayer money to get them accomplished. Hiring a scientist whose sole job it is to educate the public wouldn't be cheap, nor would paying a professor who wasn't teaching (as college students sitting in a classroom are paying tuition which keeps the university running).\n\nE.O. Wilson\n\nUntil we figure out another solution, our hopes rest on the few scientists who really do try to reach out to the public. There are and have been a few greats. My personal favorites are Carl Sagan and E.O. Wilson.\n\nMany others have good intentions, but end up preaching to the choir. Some choose channels that have a tendency to reach people who are already science minded. Others close out those that they need to educate by insulting them for holding different beliefs or for not understanding the concepts that we're trying to get across. I guess my point here is that, if you're a scientist interested in public education, please please please stay patient and don't fuel the growing stereotype that scientists are assholes. This makes it difficult for us to get the public to listen when it's really important.\n\nIn conclusion….\n\nI look forward to reading your comments in regard to this post. I'm sure that there'll be controversy over whether or not we should feel obligated to spend our time communicating with the public. I'm not suggesting that all scientists should be obligated to do this, but simply that we could probably make a big difference if we did find ways to spend at least some of our time correcting misunderstandings and spreading new information. What do you think?"

      "text": "Archive for May, 2012\n\nIn restaurants, water is quickly on the rise as the preferred drink – perhaps because of the price, for health reasons, or for the palate's sake – as water has a way of simply pairing with a meal. Clean water hydrates, keeps us active, clears up our skin and does so many more things for our bodies – it's amazing! But what about when the water isn't clean? What happens when people drink contaminated water, and what can be done about it?\n\nContamination in water comes from a whole slew of man-made and naturally occurring things: industrial waste, hazardous sediments, household chemicals, bacteria, viruses and parasites to name a few. We've previously discussed some ground and surface water contaminants, but what do parasites have to do with water?\n\nThe most notable parasitic water outbreak in the United States occurred in Milwaukee in 1993. Cryptosporidium, a parasite, had unknowingly contaminated Milwaukee Water Works' (MWW) source water: Lake Michigan. The source water flowed to MWW as it always did, and after being treated, was provided to the homes of Milwaukee residents.\n\nAlthough the turbidity readings had been unusually high, which can signal microbial contamination, the MWW employees did not catch the problem until after the fact, as all of the water quality standards were met. The municipality became alerted of the problem when people throughout the city began calling about diarrhea, and increased absences from school and work were reported. A boil alert was put into effect, the water plant was shut down, and in a week's time, the incidence of sickness tapered off. When all was said and done, this specific parasite, in a single occurrence, caused 400,000 people in Milwaukee to become sick, and resulted in 100 deaths of people with weak immune systems.\n\nSo how did this happen? For starters, cryptosporidium contaminated the water source through infected stools of animals or people. Secondly, Cryptosporidium cysts have tough walls that can withstand many environmental stresses and are resistant to chlorine which many municipalities use to disinfect water.\n\nOf course since the 1993 outbreak, more measures to keep water safe are being taken. The EPA's Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule regulates that 99% of Cryptosporidium be removed if a municipality serves 10,000 people or more. Since then, no more large-scale outbreaks have occurred. However, if you are served by a smaller scale source for your water or looking for an added factor of safety, consider a home filtration system like the Zuvo Water Filtration System. The Zuvo system is tested to NSF/ANSI standards for the reduction of protozoan cysts including Cryptosporidium.\n\nWe'd like to hear from you, what potential drinking water contaminants are of most concern to you?"

PureMadi brings together U.Va. professors and students to improve water quality, human health, local enterprise and quality of life in the developing world. The organization includes students and faculty members from engineering, architecture, medicine, nursing, business, commerce, economics, anthropology and foreign affairs\"Eventually that factory will be capable of producing about 500 to 1,000 filters per month, and our 10-year plan is to build 10 to 12 factories in South Africa and other countries,\" Smith said. \"Each filter can serve a family of five or six for two to five years, so we plan to eventually serve at least 500,000 people per year with new filters.\"\n\nThe idea is to create sustainable businesses that serve their communities and employ local workers. A small percentage of the profits go back to PureMadi and will be used to help establish more factories.\n\nThe filters produced at the factory are made of a ceramic design refined and extensively tested at U.Va. The filters are made of local clay, sawdust and water. Those materials are mixed and pressed into a mold. The result is a flowerpot-shaped filter, which is then fired in a kiln. The firing burns off the sawdust, leaving a ceramic with very fine pores. The filter is then painted with a thin solution of silver or copper nanoparticles that serve as a highly effective disinfectant for waterborne pathogens, the type of which can cause severe diarrhea, vomiting and dehydrationU.Va. medical school studies are showing that use of the filters significantly improves health outcomes for users and are particularly beneficial to people with compromised immune systems, such as people living with AIDS. HIV prevalence is more than 17 percent among the general population in South Africa, and millions suffer each year from waterborne diseases.\n\nThis video is not supported by your browser at this time.\n\nJames Smith discusses PureMadi -- how it works and the hopes behind it.\n\nSmith said testing has shown that 99.9 percent of the pathogens in water can be removed or killed by the filter.\n\nMadiDrop is an alternative to the flowerpot filter, but ideally would be used in conjunction with it. The plan is to mass-produce the product at the same factories where the PureMadi filters are produced.\n\nGraphic: How the filter works.\n\n\"MadiDrop is cheaper, easier to use, and is easier to transport than the PureMadi filter, but because it is placed into the water, rather than having the water filter through it, the MadiDrop is not effective for removing sediment in water that causes discoloration or flavor impairment,\" Smith said. \"But its ease of use, cost-effectiveness and simple manufacturing process should allow us to make it readily available to a substantial population of users, more so than the more expensive PureMadi filter.\"\n\nTesting shows that the filters are safe to use and release only trace amounts of silver or copper particles, well within the safe water standards of the developed world. The filters also would be useful in rural areas of developed countries such as the United States where people rely on untreated well water.\n\nSmith noted that U.Va. Architecture School professor Anselmo Canfora and his students have worked closely with PureMadi to design sustainable filter factories for developing countries that would optimize use of local labor and materials.\n\nIn northern Ghana, that nation's poorest and most rural region, most families get their drinking water from rivers or large, shallow ponds. The water in these bodies, which are also used by livestock, is clouded with ...\n\nMicrobiologically contaminated water plagues approximately 1.1 billion people in rural and peri-urban populations in developing countries. Roughly 2.2 million people without safe access to drinking water die each year from Nicole Heinley, a graduate student at Missouri University of Science and Technology, traveled to Guatemala twice in the past year to conduct research on ceramic pot filters that are used locally ...\n\nNearly 1 billion people do not have access to clean drinking water. The problem is particularly dire in Ghana, where diarrhea causes 25 percent of all deaths of children below the age of five each year, accordingSilver is ok, but copper device may release toxic amounts of copper if used improperly, boiling or in acidic medium. There are already laws that control the use of copper pots and other containers for human foods.\n\nThe idea is to create sustainable businesses that serve their communities and employ local workers.\n\nIMHO, we need to apply this idea to all communities in the United States. Many products that are either imported from China or made in centralized megafactories, then shipped countrywide, may be better produced in community factories with local workers. Such workers could own shares of the company they work for, giving them a vested interest in the performance of the company"

Like tuberculosis, they can cause chronic infections, such as abscesses and bone infections. Besides water, the germs are also found in the soil. Unlike TB, these infections are not contagious.\n\nIt is not clear that sinus rinsings with tap water caused these infections, as the water in the homes of patients was not tested for atypical TB.\n\nSinus rinsing involves squirting salt water into one nostril, up into the sinuses and out the other side. Sinus rinses are commonly used by allergy patients to rinse out pollen from the nose.\n\nAll the study patients had rinsed their sinuses with tap water and salt, so infection from water is a possibility. Several special antibiotics cleared up Bill's TB-like infection.\n\nDoctors say more studies need to be done on tap water-TB-like sinusitis connection.\n\n\"At this point, to be the safest, we are suggesting that patients use sterile saline water to irrigate their nose,\" Walsh said.\n\nThis is a very preliminary report, with many unanswered questions.

The City Council approved a plan Wednesday to fluoridate the city's water supply.\n\n/\nAP\n\n(CBS/AP) Portland's City Council approved a plan Wednesday to add fluoride to the city's water supply, meaning Oregon's biggest city is no longer the largest holdout in the United States.\n\nThe ordinance approved Wednesday morning calls for the city water to be fluoridated by March 2014.\n\nHealth experts say fluoride is effective against decay by providing teeth with frequent contact with low levels of fluoride throughout each day. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cite studies that show water fluoridation reduces tooth decay nearly 25 percent over a person's lifetime. The agency also said its been studied for more than 65 years and has shown strong evidence of its safety and efficacy.\n\nOpponents of public fluoridation say it's unsafe and violates an individual's right to consent to medication. They also add that council members rushed into action without a public vote, and they plan to collect signatures to force a referendum in May 2014.\n\nVoters in Portland twice rejected fluoridation before approving it in 1978. But that plan was overturned before any fluoride was ever added to the water.\n\nPortland's drinking water already contains naturally occurring fluoride, though not at levels considered to be effective at fighting cavities.\n\nPortland City Commissioner Nick Fish, who co-sponsored the plan, has said more than 200 million Americans drink water with added fluoride, and it doesn't appear to have caused great harm. Most mainstream health organizations, such as the American Medical Association and American Dental Association, endorse it as safe.\n\nPublic fluoridation came up this week in Phoenix when a public stir prompted re-examination of a policy in place since 1989. After a contentious hearing Tuesday, council members voted to continue adding fluoride to the water in the nation's sixth-largest city.\n\nGrand Rapids, Michigan became the world's first city to fluoridate its water supply on January 25, 1945, according to the American Dental Association.\n\nThe CDC says more than 204 million Americans are served by community water supplies that contain enough fluoride to protect dental health - about 74 percent of the country. For its Healthy People campaign, the agency hopes to boost that level to about 80 percent of Americans by 2020.\n\nThis is interesting. Would people be taking in too much fluoride then? My father is a <a href=\" in calgary</a> so I'll have to ask him what he thinks of this idea. Thank you for sharing!\n\nThat is interesting to me. But I have dentures which cannot get cavities. Does anyone know if the floride in the water helps with my <a href=\" ??\n\nI cannot imagine what would cause someone to vote for something that the populace vehemently doesn't want. Not to mention the fact that it is a poison when people get too much. I'm from St. Louis where they have had it since the fifties. About the same time that the government used poison gas in downtown St. Louis for testing. What???? Look it up, it happened and no one ever has told us what it was other than it was phosperous based. Why add a toxic substance to your water? My teeth are ruined because of it. Who is making money off this? This is who we need to find out because undoubtably, they know your mayor very well.\n\nIt seems to me that it would be easier to just leave <a href=\" in calgary</a>, or oregon, or wherever to the dentists. I guess that not everyone can afford dental work, though. Maybe it's a good idea after all!\n\nI really appreciate what was said in this article. Fluoride has always helped a lot of people keep their teeth healthy and stay away from cavities. I have a grandma that uses <a href=\" in calgary</a>. Does fluoride have an affect on dentures? Does it matter if the water has it in it or no?\n\nI really appreciate what was said in this article. Fluoride has always helped a lot of people keep their teeth healthy and stay away from cavities. I have a grandma that uses <a href=\" calgary</a>. Does fluoride have an affect on dentures? Does it matter if the water has it in it or no?\n\nThank you for this wonderful! They should have added fluoride in the water supply a long time ago. Like an our office of dental in Calgary we told our clients our important it is to use toothpastes that are high on fluoride. Good for them for doing this \n\nHitler was the first to put fluoride into the water supply, it had ZERO to do with cavities or dental health. Fluoride causes a \"calming\" sensation when ingested, thus quelling any who consume it. I too grew up with fluoride in my water supply in ohio and it did little to prevent my teeth from falling out of my face. I see no benefit for the populous of oregon in having fluoride added to the water, I have not seen any evidence in my research that supports it actually having any long term affect, I will NOT be drinking Oregon tap water, I will filter the water for my pets because I don't think they need the INDUSTRIAL GRADE SURPLUS FLUORIDE in their water either"

      "text": "Wichita pro-fluoride campaign begins\n\nIt's a question many viewers have shared with us. How does the process of adding fluoride to water work?\n\nWe traveled to Topeka, which treats 30 million gallons of water a day. The capital has fluoridated its water for decades.\n\n\"Is there a lot of controversy around it here in Topeka?\" said Bruce Northrop who runs the Topeka Water Plant. \"In the 40 years I've been doing it, there has been very little controversy about adding fluoride to the drinking water.\"\n\nTopeka dentist Dr. Amy Thompson says the same thing. In her practice, most of her patients don't even know about it - or they simply don't talk about it.\n\n\"It's not something you hear about around here.\" Dr. Thompson told us. \"Here in Topeka it's not something you hear a lot about.\"\n\nWe were able to take a rare look inside the Topeka water plant. The concentrated fluoride is delivered by truck and stored inside 4,000 gallon tanks. Those tanks last around 3 months.\n\nThe system is controlled through computerized calibration pumps which deliver .7 parts per million of fluoride to the water during its final stages of filtration. After that, it's pumped out to homes and businesses throughout the area.\n\nNorthrop says the concentrated material is a lot different by the time it's added to the water. You may have seen the warning on the tanks and in anti-fluoride campaigns.\n\nNorthrop says, yes, in the concentrated form - fluoride is dangerous. Northrop points out that that is also the case for chlorine and other chemicals used to treat drinking water.\n\n\"As far as a work hazard, the fluoride is minor compared to the chlorine we deal with on a daily basis,\" Northrop said.\n\nOnce those chemicals are diluted, a large majority of doctors, dentists and health professionals say it is safe."

(Pictured at left with a retrofitted water fountain) Creating this access has been a priority for the city and for Zach as he has overseen the installation of over 20 retrofitted water fountains in city facilities. Each water fountain was retrofitted with a bottle filling station. These bottle fillers utilize infrared sensors for hygienic dispensing, track the number of plastic bottles saved from entering a landfill, and dispense refrigerated, clean water at twice the rate of a normal fountain. Each fountain has a sign placed above it that gives a health fact about water and also a fact about how reducing the use of plastic bottles is good for the environment The Pinellas County CPPW program was able to provide ten of the stations to the City of Clearwater for this project. Access to the fountains can be found at any City of Clearwater recreation center or library. Zach is proud of this latest wellness endeavor, estimating that in just one center alone close to 1000 bottles a day are being saved from being thrown into landfills. And the Pinellas CPPW is proud to be a partner in educating visitors and residents in better ways to protect their environment. Way to \"go green\" City of Clearwater!"

However, most water consumers agree that the taste and healthfulness of tap water is not always up to par. Learn here how to treat your tap water for a better-tasting, healthier product.\n\nDecide what you would most like removed from your tap water. Most treatment systems do not remove all undesirable contaminants, and you may need to prioritize your contaminant removal needs. Chlorine is usually the cause of taste and odor in water, but there are likely several other undesirable contaminants present in your water. If your water is fluoridated, you may wish to find a treatment system that removes this disputably harmful contaminant.\n\n2\n\nPlan a budget for your water treatment unit. You can purchase water treatment systems in a variety of different price ranges. When choosing a system, be sure to account for the cost of replacement filters or membranes in addition to the initial cost.\n\n3\n\nChoose a method of treatment that best suits your needs. If chlorine is your major problem, you may wish to choose from one of the variety of different carbon water filters available from Aquasana, Brita, or Pur. If you would rather remove hard water minerals from your water, a Culligan treatment system or other softener brand may be best. For the removal of bacteria, virus, or other microorganisms, you may wish to consider a reverse osmosis system or distiller.\n\n4\n\nOnce you choose a system, install the unit as soon as you receive it and check to see if the quality of your tap water has improved. Remember to follow all of the flushing or other installation procedures before determining whether or not the system is adequate for your needs.\n\n5\n\nAs you use your system, remember to replace any filters or membranes regularly, as recommended by the manufacturer, for optimal treatment and removal of contaminants.\n\nIf you choose to store treated water for later use, be sure to do it in a glass or other type of container that will not leach contaminants back into the water. If it is short term storage such as waiting in the refrigerator, try adding a sliced cucumber to the water. You should not reuse plastic water bottles for storing water.\n\nBefore purchasing a water filter or other treatment device, look for objective information about different water treatment systems from the National Sanitation Foundation or a consumer information publication.\n\nIt is very important to change filters per manufacturer's recommendations. This is especially true for filters that utilize a carbon filter. The filter will become a breeding ground for bacteria after a few weeks"

Cameron, a doctoral student in horticulture who helped develop the biofilter says that more than 90% of the pollutants in the wastewater from a washing machine are removed within a period of three days, including suspended solids. There were also no detectable levels of e. coli in the treated wastewater.\n\nThe water treatment system consists of two seven-foot long plastic corrugated pipes a foot in diameter. The researchers placed these pipes upright three feet apart in a basin containing a foot of potting soil and crushed limestone. The basin is planted with papyrus and horsetail reed and the filtration works much like a wetland does, cleaning the water as it passes through the basin. The culvert pipes are filled with alternating layers of porous rocks, composted cow manure, peat moss, tire crumbs, potting soil and crushed limestone."

      "text": "Common Ultrapure Water Terminology\n\nWhat are Ions? Ions are divided into two groups; cations and anions. Cations have a positive charge and include sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca++), and magnesium (Mg++). Anions have a negative charge and include chloride (Cl-), sulfates (SO4--), and bicarbonates (HCO3-).\n\nHow are ions removed from water? Ions are removed from water through a series of chemical reactions. These reactions take place as the water passes through ion exchange resin beds. Cation resin contains hydrogen (H+) ions on its surface which are exchanged for positively charged ions. Anion resin contains hydroxide (OH-) ions on its surface which are exchanged for negatively charged ions. The final product of these two exchanges, H+ and OH-, form water molecules.\n\nSeparate bed reaction When cation and anion resins are separated, reactions take place independently and are incomplete, thus only moderate ion exchange is achieved.\n\nMixed bed reaction When cation and anion resins are mixed, reactions take place to their completion simultaneously exchanging both cations and anions, providing water that is virtually ion free.\n\nHow are ions measured? Electrical conductance or resistance is measured by two in-line electrodes. Electrical current moves through water using ionic molecules as stepping stones. The fewer stepping stones, the more difficult the passage of electricity. This causes less electrical conductance and more electrical resistance. The temperature of the water also affects its conductivity/resistivity. Thornton electrodes and meters automatically compensate for water temperature to ensure accuracy.\n\nOsmosis To understand reverse osmosis we must first understand osmosis. During natural osmosis, water flows from a less concentrated solution through a semipermeable membrane to a more concentrated saline solution until concentrations on both sides of the membrane are equal (see figure 2).\n\nReverse Osmosis Membrane A reverse osmosis membrane has a thin microporous surface that rejects impurities, but allows water to pass through. The membrane rejects bacteria, pyrogens, and 85%-95% of inorganic solids. Polyvalent ions are rejected easier than monovalent ions. Organic solids with a molecular weight greater than 300 are rejected by the membrane, but dissolved gases pass through. Reverse osmosis is a percent rejection technology. The purity of the product water depends on the purity of the inlet water. The purity of reverse osmosis product water is much higher than the purity of the feedwater (see figure 4).\n\nReject Water A large percentage (50-90%) of the feedwater does not pass through the membrane but flows across the membrane surface, constantly cleaning it and carrying the inorganic and organic solids to drain. This water is called \"reject.\"\n\nFeedwater Factors Feedwater factors affecting membrane performance and life include the following:\n\npH Feedwater pH range is important. It is recommended that you use wider pH range membranes when feedwater is basic, acidic or unstable.\n\nLanglier Saturation Index (LSI) The LSI indicates the tendency for scale to form on a membrane surface. It requires feedwater testing for temperature, total inorganic solids, calcium hardness alkalinity, and pH. If the LSI index calculation is positive, it is recommended that you install a water softener prior to the reverse osmosis system.\n\nFree Chlorine and Bacteria Cellulose acetate membranes require constant free chlorine to prevent bacterial growth and membrane damage. In contrast, polyamide and thin film membranes are damaged by free chlorine. Activated carbon is used to remove free chlorine when polyamide and thin film membranes are chosen.\n\nTemperature Membrane performance is based on feedwater temperature of 25°C. For every 1°C below 25°C product water quantity is reduced by 3%. When feedwater temperature is regularly below 25°C, it is recommended that hot and cold water are mixed to increase the temperature to 25°C. Feedwater which is greater than 35° will damage most membranes.\n\nSilt Density Index The SDI is a measurement of submicron particles and their tendency to block membranes. Flowing water at specific pressure is filtered through a membrane disc and collected for a fixed period of time. The speed of water flow and total volume collected determines the index value.\n\nTurbidity Turbidity is a measurement of suspended submicron particles that obscure light rays.\n\nDistillation differs from other forms of water purification because water is removed from the impurities rather than the impurities from the water. Water undergoes phase changes during the process, changing from liquid to vapor and back to liquid. It is the change from liquid to vapor that prompts a separation of water from its impurities. Impurities with a boiling point higher than water (100°C) remain in the boiler. Water and impurities with a boiling point equal to or lower than water are converted to water vapor. When this vapor is condensed, only water and a few substances that boil at lower temperatures than water remain.\n\nHow well does distillation work? Distillation has the broadest capabilities of any single form of water purification. Distillation effectively removes most inorganic solids, all organics with a boiling point greater than water (100°), all bacteria and pyrogens. Gases and other organics are not removed by distillation. They undergo the same phase changes as the hydrogen and oxygen ions and can be removed before and after distillation using other technologies.\n\nThe information on this page was provided compliments of Barnstead Thermolyne"

      "text": "Getting The Lead Out\n\nAn international study in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives finds that children exposed to lead at levels well below standards of acceptability set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lose as many as seven points off their IQs.\n\nIt's estimated that as many as 15 percent of homes in the United States have lead coming out of their taps.\n\nExperts say everyone is potentially at risk because there is no safe level of lead for kids or adults. But that doesn't mean you should live in fear.\n\nScientists say lead-laden drinking water is relatively easy to combat. A few quick steps, from testing to filtering, can help you get the lead out and keep it out.\n\non The Early Show Tuesday that lead is a neurotoxin, \"so it affects your central nervous system, maybe cognitive development, and physical development. It's stored in your bones. So, it's very tough, especially because children are developing and growing.\"\n\n\"(Lead is) everywhere,\" she says. \"Actually, it's coming from either the pipes, the solder or the fixture. So, even if your well water is very pure, how it's getting to your faucet is where the lead is coming from. And, when the water hangs out in the pipes, it leaches the lead out. So, you don't want to run water right from the tap into the glass and drink it.\"\n\nTo test your drinking water, Heller advises calling your local water company, which would do it for you for $20 to $100.\n\nOne step you can take to reduce the amount of lead in your tap water is to run cold water for 30 to 60 seconds. Heller says that's going to \"take out the water that's been sitting (in pipes) for a while. When you turn your faucet off, the water doesn't just disappear. It sits in the pipes. Run it 30 to 60 seconds and make sure it's cold, because hot water pulls more lead out. Then you can use that water.\n\n\"They say to do that every time you run the water. I don't like wasting water so I would suggest flush your pipes, fill up the pitcher, put it in the fridge.\"\n\nBoiling water doesn't solve lead woes, Heller says. It kills bacteria and other parasites, but if anything, boiling your water can actually concentrate the amount of lead in your water.\n\nSeveral types of water filters are effective in fighting the lead problem, Heller says.\n\nThe style you buy is a matter of personal choice. Some people like carafe-style filters that you just fill up and then put in the fridge, giving you have pure, cold water all the time.\n\nFaucet-mounted types are good because you don't have to remember to keep refilling the pitcher, but they can affect water pressure. You have to remember to change the filter every couple of months, at least. They say they're easy to install. If you have a faucet that doesn't fit they have adapters.\n\nBe sure filters are NSF certified. That shows the filters reduce certain contaminants in the water, including lead, as well as microorganisms, which is important for people with compromised immune systems.\n\nIt's OK, Heller adds, to wash dishes and shower in unfiltered water because lead isn't absorbed through the skin"

      "text": "Water Quality of the Product, Desalinated Water\n\nDesalination used for municipal water does not remove all dissolved solids, and thus, one of the issues to address in desalination is the water quality of the desalted water--the product water . The fraction and character of the constituents left in the product water depends on the process, the feed water quality, and recovery rate of the desalination process.\n\nReverse Osmosis membranes separate dissolved substances from water based on size and charge of the ion or molecule. The membranes used for desalination do not have true pores; ions diffuse through the polymer matrix at a much slower rate than water does. Charged ions are caught up in the surface charge of the polymer and diffuse very slowly – to the extent that only a fraction of a percentage of ions is able to pass through the membrane. Uncharged molecules are able to pass through at approximately the same rate as water molecules. If they are larger than the open spaces in the membrane, they might be retained with the concentrate, but long narrow molecules can still manage to slip through.\n\nElectrodialysis moves charged ions through the membrane rather than water. Therefore, only charged ions are removed from the product stream. All uncharged molecules, particles, and microbes need to be removed through another processes.\n\nThermal processes such as distillation, evaporate water molecules which are then condensed to form \"pure\" water. No dissolved minerals are transported with the vapor, but volatile organic molecules are vaporized with the water. Distillate must be cleansed of organic contaminants through a separate process.\n\nExamples of potential contaminants of desalted water:\n\nArsenic in groundwater is in the form of arsenate (As5+) and arsenite (As3+). In a reducing environment with alkalinity (often found in groundwater) the As3+ form is more soluble and uncharged in the form of Arsenious acid (H2AsO3). Raising the pH above 8.5 will drive the reaction back toward charged molecular species and improve rejection in RO systems. The Safe Drinking Water Maximum Contaminant level limit for arsenic in is 0.010 mg/L.\n\nBoron concentrations in seawater range from 4 – 5 milligrams per liter in the forms B(OH)3 or B(OH)4-. The uncharged form is not highly rejected by reverse osmosis membranes. Boron is not regulated in drinking water by the EPA, but California Department of Public Health has a notification level of 1 mg/L and the World Health Organization guideline is for 0.5 mg/L. Boron can be removed to a lower concentration by treating seawater RO permeate with a second RO pass or by using ion exchange on a portion of the permeate.\n\nBromine concentration in seawater is around 65 mg/L in the form of Bromide, (Br-). Bromine is just below Chlorine on the periodic table, meaning that it has a similar chemical nature. A typical seawater RO membrane should reject most of the bromide for a final concentration below 1 mg/L. However, when seawater is chlorinated before the RO system for disinfection purposes, the bromide reacts with organic molecules in the seawater and the chlorine to form brominated trihalomethanes. Some of these are uncharged, small organic molecules that can pass through the membrane easily. The EPA has not yet set a Maximum Contaminant Limit Goal for Brominated Trihalomethanes, but they have issued a Drinking Water Health Advisory and are gathering data on health effects.\n\nOrganic contaminants can be transported through a membrane process in a manner similar to the above examples of inorganic molecules. If they are uncharged and small enough, or oriented in just the right manner, they will be easily carried through the membrane with water."

It is the size of a deck of cards, needs minimal maintenance and requires little to no training for operation.\n\nOver three millon people die every year from drinking contaminated water. These deaths occur in areas prone to seasonal flooding and areas without stable sanitation infrastructure, but they also occur when disasters put water supplies at risk. The Water Canary can identify contaminated water before people fall sick, outputting a simple green light/red light response.\n\nEach device performs a thousand tests on a single battery, and - with an optional communications module - can upload exact location and raw test data to a central server creating a real-time map to identify contamination sources and predict future outbreaks.\n\nWater Canary's basic hand-held version is currently undergoing testing to ensure compliance with WHO water testing standards. Once testing is complete, a more ruggedized, field-ready version will be finalized for production. Along side the basic hand-held unit will be the communications-enabled model that will serve the needs of humanitarian organizations, and governments seeking real-time water quality data that will enable both preparation and response to water related emergencies."

Many aspects of typography translate only awkwardly to HTML.\nPlease use the page image\nas the authoritative form to ensure accuracy.\n\nUnplanned indirect potable reuse is the unintentional addition of wastewater (treated or not) to a water supply that is subsequently used (usually by downstream communities) as a water source, with additional treatment prior to delivery. As noted earlier, many communities already unintentionally practice such unplanned indirect potable reuse.\n\nDirect potable water reuse is the immediate addition of reclaimed wastewater to the water distribution system. This practice has not been adopted by, or approved for, any water system in the United States.\n\nWith planned or unplanned indirect potable reuse, the storage provided between treatment and consumption allows time for mixing, dilution, and natural physical, chemical, and biological processes to purify the water. In contrast, with direct potable reuse, the water is reused with no intervening environmental buffer.\n\nWith planned indirect potable reuse and direct potable reuse, the wastewater is treated to a much higher degree than it would be were it being discharged directly to a surface water without specific plans for reuse. The wastewater generally is first treated as it would be in a conventional municipal wastewater treatment plant, then subjected to various advanced treatment processes.\n\nConventional wastewater treatment begins with preliminary screening and grit removal to separate sands, solids, and rags that would settle in channels and interfere with treatment processes (Henry and Heinke, 1989). Primary treatment follows this preliminary screening and usually involves gravity sedimentation. Primary treatment removes slightly more than one-half of the suspended solids and about one-third of the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) from decomposable organic matter, as well as some nutrients, pathogenic organisms, trace elements, and potentially toxic organic compounds.\n\nSecondary treatment usually involves a biological process. Microorganisms in suspension (in the \"activated sludge\" process), attached to media (in a \"trickling filter\" or one of its variations), or in ponds or other processes are used to remove biodegradable organic material. Part of the organic material is oxidized by the microorganisms to produce carbon dioxide and other end products, and the remaining organic material provides the energy and materials needed to support the microorganism community. Secondary treatment processes can remove up to 95 percent of the BOD and suspended solids entering the process, as well as significant amounts of heavy metals and certain organic compounds (Water Pollution Control Federation, 1989). Conventional wastewater treatment usually ends with secondary treatment, except in special cases where tertiary treatment is needed to provide additional removal of contaminants such as microbial pathogens, particulates, or nutrients."

      "text": "Bad taste when softener cycles\n\nWe're pretty new to this whole home ownership thing, but I've noticed that when our water softener cycles in the early morning that our water is less than desirable during/shortly after that period of time. Most of the time the water just tastes hard, which I can live with, but the other day I woke up to grab a drink of water from the tap and I almost gagged it was so nasty. I guess I could describe it as salty, but more nasty than anything.\n\nDoes this sound right? I really don't know much about it besides I keep my \"bin\" full of salt. When we bought the house a few months ago there was no mention of whether or not it's our softener or a rental. I guess I could check it for stickers taste when softener cycles\n\nI highly doubt that it's a rental, or you would have heard from the water softener company by now.\nWhenever a water softener regenerates, it automatically goes on bypass, which means that your regular unsoftened untreated water, whatever the source, goes directly into your water lines if anyone or anything runs any water whatsoever during the regeneration cycle.\nThis could be anything from an automatic icemaker coming on, to running a faucet for a drink, to flushing a toilet, etc. during regeneration. Flushing a toilet would bring anywhere from 1.6 gallons to 3-5 gallons of untreated water into your lines for instance.\nIt would be normal for that kind of bypass water to be very slightly \"salty\" and have whatever taste/odor that the water softener system may be removing.\nTo help alleviate this from happening, you can set the softener to regenerate when you're not likely to be awake, say 2 a.m., and decrease the number of times that the system regenerates itself.\nAnother way to prevent it is to simply NOT run any water during regeneration, and turn off your icemaker on regeneration nights with a flip of its on-off lever.\nYou can have the water tested as you go, to help you adjust it.\nGood Luck!\nMike"

You can reasonably assume that most are doing the best they\ncan with the resources available to them - if for no other reason than to keep their\nname out of the evening news.\n\nIn general, though, the larger water\ncompanies (in the US anyway) have greater resources available to treat and distribute the\nwater and maintain the distribution infrastructure. And,\nbecause they serve more people, they are required to meet stricter regulations.\n\nDo you\nreceive and read water quality reports sent out by your water provider?\n\nSome information for well\nowners or people who use surface water for drinking. People with\nprivate water supplies are responsible for the safety of their own drinking\nwater. While all wells, springs, and surface water should be tested\nregularly, there are some situations where it is critical to know what is in\nyour water:\n\nIf you use surface water or water\nfrom an unconfined aquifer and have any sources of pollution nearby, you are at\nrisk for contaminated water.\n\nIf you or members of your\nfamily are at higher risk of health problems from contaminants, you should\nknow what is in your water.\n\nIf the quality of your\nwater suddenly changes - new taste\n\nThe depth of a well is\nnot usually as important as the type of aquifer from which the well draws.\nIn general,\nwell water from an unconfined aquifer is much more prone to contamination than\nwater from a confined\naquifer.Click here to\nlearn more about aquifers and the contaminant risks associated with each\ntype. For the teachers who are visiting: I discovered what\nappears to be a very interesting groundwater\nmodel that demonstrates confined and unconfined aquifers, how water and contaminants move through\naquifers, various soil structures, and watersheds.\n\nPoorly designed or maintained septic systems are a\npotential source\nof contamination for wells or springs mostly in unconfined aquifers. The most common contaminants from septic systems tend to be\nE.\ncoli and nitrates, but if other chemicals are flushed into the septic\nsystem by you or your neighbors,\nthey can become part of the ground or surface water pollutants as well.\nAnother site, and\nanother.\n\nWater\nTesting: If you\nuse municipal water you should be able to obtain a water quality report yearly\nand, except for special circumstances, would probably not need to test your\nwater. If you use well, spring, or surface water, it is important to test your\nwater periodically for contaminants liable to be present in your water.\nAs discussed above, water quality from a water source can change over time -\nparticularly in surface water or shallow, unconfined aquifers. The University of Tennessee Agricultural\nExtension Service article, Safety\nof Private Water Supplies, has important suggestions and information about\ntesting for the safety of your well water.\n\nWhere\nYou Live:\n\nHome\nLocated in an Industrial Area:\nThe range of possible industrial pollutants is extremely large. Important\ncontaminants include heavy metals and many thousands of kinds of manufactured\nchemicals. Water contamination can occur from:\nEmissions into the atmosphere that either settle onto or wash onto the\nearth's surface\nand from there into the surface or ground water.\nWaste dumps that leak into surface or ground water.\nLeakage from storage areas of chemical products or their precursors.\nAccidents and spills during transport of chemicals.\nDirect dumping of contaminants into surface water for disposal.\n\nA recent movie that examines some consequences of\nindustrial pollution is A Civil Action starring John Travolta.\n\nHome\nLocated in an Agricultural Area:\nFarms can have many potential sources of pollution for the underlying water,\nincluding: manure lagoon, feedlot / barn, septic system, earthen silage pit,\nfuel storage tank, chemical storage area, chemical mixing area, dump or\nlandfill, and fields on which fertilizers or pesticides have been applied.\nFor more information on farm wells, go to:\nWell Water Location. In\naddition to the health effects of nitrates on children\nnitrates in drinking water have also been associated with other\nhealth problems.\n\nChlorinated Water and the Risk of Disinfection Byproducts:\n\nIs\nyour water Chlorinated?\n\nMost municipal water treatment plants use chlorine\nto disinfect the water before it leaves the treatment plant and/or keep\nthe water biologically safe during the distribution process. Many well\nusers also use chlorine to disinfect their water.\n\nChlorine, while an excellent disinfectant, reacts with\norganic material in the source water to produce a group of chlorinated\norganic compounds collectively known as Disinfection Byproduct (DBPs).\nAccording to several\nEPAarticles:\n\n\"While\ndisinfectants are effective in controlling many microorganisms, they react with\nnatural organic and inorganic matter in source water and distribution systems to\nform DBPs. Results from toxicology studies have shown several DBPs to be\ncarcinogenic in laboratory animals. Other DBPs have also been shown to cause\nadverse reproductive or developmental effects in laboratory animals. Several\nepidemiology studies have suggested a weak association between certain cancers\n(e.g., bladder) or reproductive and developmental effects, and exposure to\nchlorinated surface water. More than 200 million people consume water that has\nbeen disinfected. Because of the large population exposed, health risks\nassociated with DBPs, even if small, need to be taken seriously.\"\n\nIn 1979, the EPA set an interim Maximum\nContaminant Level (MCL) for TTHMs of 0.10 mg/l (or 100 microgram/l) as an\nannual average. This applies to any community water system serving at least\n10,000 people that adds a disinfectant to the drinking water during any part\nof the treatment process. By 2002 the MCL for TTHMS will be lowered to\n0.08mg/l (or 80 ug/l) and a MCL for HAAs will be set at 0.06mg/l\n\nThe quote from the EPA above tells only\npart of the story. In addition to laboratory studies showing cancers\nand reproductive problems in animals, there some evidence\nbased on epidemiological studies that implicates DBPs as contributing to\nproblems during pregnancy.\n\nThere is also epidemiological evidence\nsuggesting a\nweak association between the consumption of chlorinated drinking water and\nthe occurrence of bladder, colon, and rectal\ncancer (and possibly\neven some brain cancers).\n\nIn epidemiological studies, investigators\ncompare health effects in a population of people who drink water containing\nhigher levels of DBS with a similar group of people who drink water with\nlower levels of DPS. Estimates in the role of DBPs and cancer have\nchanged over the years because it is extremely difficult to determine\nexposure levels to DBPs over decades and determine what the contribution of\nthat exposure might have been to the development of some cancer.\nThis article provides some history of the process. It is a tough\nbalancing act between adding too little chlorine (resulting in more\nmicrobial contaminants and fewer DBPs), and too much chlorine (resulting in\ndead microbes and higher levels of DBPs). The\nWorld Health Organization concluded, the risk of death from pathogens is\nat least 100 to 1000 times greater than risk of cancer from disinfected\nby-products and risk of illness from pathogens at least 10,000 to 1 million\ntimes greater\nMore information about epidemiological studies.\n\nA 1996\nstudy by King and Marrett concluded \"that the risk of bladder\ncancer increases with both duration and concentration of exposure to\nchlorination by-products\". They found that those exposed to\nchlorinated surface water for 35 or more years had a 1.4 times increased\nrisk of bladder cancer compared with those exposed for less than 10 years,\nand those exposed to an estimated THM level greater than 49\nmicrograms/liter for 35 or more years had 1.63 times the risk of those\nexposed for less than 10 years.\n\nAny person who requires water of a specific\nmicrobiological purity should follow the advice of their doctor or\nlocal health officials regarding the use and consumption of tap\nwater treated by ANY purification system.\n\nHome\nAge and the Risk of Lead Contamination:\n\nThe\nage of your home can be an important indicator of\nwhether lead m100%t be a\ncontaminant in your drinking water. Most well or city water does not naturally\ncontain lead. Water usually picks up lead inside\nyour home from household\nplumbing that is made with lead containing materials. Lead-contaminated\ndrinking water is most often a problem in houses that are either\nvery old or very new. Plumbing\ninstalled before 1930 is most likely to contain lead. Lead solder was banned in the US in\n1987, but the ban has not been universally adhered to. New brass faucets and fittings can also leach lead,\neven though they are labeled \"lead-free\". Scientific data indicates the newer the home, the greater the risk of lead contamination. More about lead and your drinking water\nhere.\n\nContaminants and\nSensory Clues:\n\nGreat looking, smelling, and tasting water is no guarantee that you\nhave safe water!

Immediately\nbegin using water filtered with a high quality filter, bottled water, or otherwise purified water until you have determined that your water is safe.\nThat would also be a very good time to consider looking for a permanent\nwater treatment solution.\n\nHave you ever been told that your household water is unsafe and to\neither boil your water before drinking it or to drink bottled water until the\nproblem has been corrected?\n\nHave you or a member of your family ever become ill from your home\ndrinking water?\n\nIf you\nanswer \"yes\" to either question, it would probably be a good\nidea to invest in a high quality water treatment system. According to\nthe National Primary Drinking Water Regulations: Public\nNotification Rule; Final Rule, Section 1414(c)(2)(C),\nThe EPA regulations \"require Public Water\nServices to distribute a notice within 24 hours to persons served for\nviolations with potential to have serious adverse effects on human\nhealth from short-term exposure\".

Our advocacy for salt is science-based and consumer-centered. Typical of our advocacy approach has been our development and promotion of \"Sensible Salting\" for roadways. In North America, use of salt to clear snow and ice from roadways to make them safe and passable began in the 1940s. By the 1960s, enthusiastic but ill-informed use of salt on roads had created water contamination of many roadside wells and damaged or destroyed noticeable amounts of vegetation in roadway rights-of-way and along urban arterial streets. The Institute recognized the problem and created a pro-active program to train its customers, primarily state/provincial and local transportation agencies, on techniques to store salt in a way to prevent it from leaching into groundwater and to apply it in the minimum amounts necessary to complement plowing to restore safe driving conditions. The program won a public service award in 1972.\n\nOf course, the Institute has not rested on its laurels, but rather applied the same strategy as other issues arise: identifying the public concern and pro-actively working with concerned parties to develop industry practices, customer salt use guidelines or government regulatory controls to protect our workers from harmful occupational exposures, guard against environmental discharges or environmentally unsound practices at our production plants, encourage economical all-weather roadway operations, increase the salt efficiency of ion-exchange water softeners, expand the use of iodized salt as the most economical measure to combat mental retardation and provide consumer guidance on dietary salt intake levels to ensure optimal health.

We were able to wash our hands, feet, and clothes with the well water, but never drink it.\n\nMy mother had a daily ritual of boiling our water in two to three pots at a time for at least one hour, then cooling it down for another hour before refrigerating a pitcher of clean water or making \"boricha,\" a roasted corn tea. This went on all day.\n\nSouth Korea was a third-world country with poor infrastructure where municipal water was found only in large cities and on U.S. military bases. When my family immigrated to Monterey, Calif. in the summer of 1975, I was delighted to find out that we could drink water directly out of the faucet without boiling it. I especially enjoyed drinking fresh, cold water from our garden hose on a hot summer day after playing with my new neighborhood friends!\n\nToday, 40 years later, you may believe that municipal water is clean and safe to drink, but too many disturbing studies show otherwise.\n\nOne investigation in the New York Times, for instance, found that American tap water contributes to rashes and skin burns, erodes tooth enamel, and often contains arsenic, lead, barium, and other toxic chemicals.\n\nAn Associated Press investigation found numerous contaminants in every state's school water. Data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revealed 1 out of every 5 schools investigated violated the Safe Drinking Water Act during the past decade.\n\nThe EPA and Congress regulate over 100 pollutants and 91 chemicals through the Safe Drinking Water Act. Even so, EPA administrator Lisa Jackson admits that American water fails to meet public health goals, and water pollution law enforcement is unacceptably low.\n\nThese countless microorganisms and toxins in tap water can contribute to allergy symptoms and disease. Removing these chemicals from your drinking water will significantly reduce your internal toxic load and may improve your body's natural ability to deal with allergy symptoms.\n\nFor day two of my book, The 7 Day Allergy Makeover, I focus on cleaning up your tap water and purifying it into optimal drinkable water. Pure water is an essential nutrient, the basis of fluids of all living organisms, and necessary to sustain life. Water needs to be clean, free of toxins and microbes to prevent disease.\n\nWater is considered a universal solvent, which can aid in reducing your allergy symptoms through cellular hydration. Water ingestion can reduce illnesses by decreasing the concentration of toxin and inflammatory histamines, as well as increasing lymph and bowel movement to flush out contaminants, waste, and microbes.\n\nI invite you to incorporate the following five steps into your lifestyle to safely remove toxins, particulates and microbes from tap water and get adequate amounts of purified water to decrease allergy symptoms and restore your health.\n\nStep 1: Only Drink Purified Water -- Water makes up approximately 60 percent of the human body. Your blood is 93 percent water and your muscles are about 75 percent water. Optimal water intake is an essential for human survival.\n\nTap, carbon filtered, alkaline, and even some bottled water contains chemicals, heavy metals, nuclear material, and potential allergens. By drinking purified water, you will minimize your exposure to contaminants and may potentially reduce your allergy symptoms.\n\nPurified water comes from two methods of filtration: either distillation or reverse osmosis. Many patients ask me, \"Isn't distilled water -- dead water? There are no minerals in it!\"\n\nYes, both distilled and reverse osmosis water are devoid of minerals, but ingesting mineral-free purified water is not harmful to your body. A majority of third-world countries still drink rainwater. Warm, moist air rising up into the sky from evaporation of natural large bodies of water including rivers, lakes, and oceans builds clouds. Condensation of water vapor forms larger water droplets, and when the droplets are heavy enough they will fall from the clouds as rain. This process of water evaporation and condensation is the largest distillation process on Earth!\n\nRainwater is not \"dead water!\" Minerals are essential to our cellular metabolism, growth, and vitality, and we get majority of them from eating food, not drinking water. Eat plenty of vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds, and you will be optimally mineralized and alkalized.\n\nWater bottling companies usually clean water using a triple purification system: carbon filtration (removes chlorine, chemicals and larger particulates), ozonation (eradicates microbes) and reverse osmosis (removes heavy metals, aluminum, nuclear waste.) You can buy purified drinking water in large bottles, preferably glass bottles, from delivery service companies and water service stores/clubs.\n\nStep 2: Drink the Right Amount of Purified Water -- Dehydration slows your metabolism down, as well as the natural healing process of the body. When you drink adequate amounts of water, you can reduce allergenic symptoms and feel more alert and energetic.\n\nForget the eight-glasses-a-day myth. I want you to base the amount of water consumption by your body weight: Drink one-half of your body weight (lbs) in ounces of water. In another words, if you weigh 160 pounds, you should drink 80 ounces of water daily.\n\nIncrease your water intake if you sweat excessively from fever or exercise, or if you consume alcohol, coffee, and other caffeinated drinks, since they are diuretics and will dehydrate your cells and tissues. (And no, these drinks do not count towards your water quota.)\n\nSip purified water -- do not guzzle. Water-guzzlers are always running to the bathroom! Drinking water slowly gives your cells time to absorb it, and reduces how often you need to urinate.\n\nThink of drinking water like pouring a bucket of water on dried-up leather. It won't adequately absorb the water, but if you drip water slowly over the leather, it rehydrates, becomes supple and malleable in no time.\n\nChoose room-temperature over cold or iced water, which is easier on your digestive system.\n\nAmong the toxic chemicals you eliminate with an RO unit is arsenic. A disturbing study in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives found arsenic is prevalent in American drinking water and can contribute to skin cancer.\n\nChlorine is another prevalent toxin in tap water. A study in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives found chlorination disinfection byproducts in drinking water, such as trihalomethanes (THMs), could potentially contribute to low birth weight, preterm birth, birth defects, fetal deaths, and other adverse pregnancy problems.\n\nAn RO unit completely filters all natural and synthetic toxins, microbes, debris, and minerals. When you drink water filtered through an RO unit, you're getting 100 percent pure, high-quality drinking water that tastes great.\n\nUntil you install a reverse osmosis unit (step four), buy purified bottled water, triple-filtered (reverse osmosis, carbon filtered and ozonated) and preferably, in glass (not plastic) bottles. The label should indicate that its water has been filtered and processed through a reverse osmosis (RO) unit.\n\nAnother option: Have a company deliver your water monthly. Just specify reverse osmosis filtered, not spring or fluoridated water.\n\nStep 4: Buy a Whole House Purification System -- \"The best thing you can do for your hair costs less than nine cents a day,\" said Dr. Mehmet Oz on one episode of Oprah. \"Get a charcoal filter and put it in your shower head.\"\n\nYour skin also absorbs water when you wash your hands or shower. Toxins can seep through your skin and into your cells, triggering and exacerbating allergens.\n\nI recommend you buy a whole house water purification system that you attach to the plumbing system at the point of entry into the house that will filter out chlorine, chemicals, particulates, and microorganisms. This water is not to be used for consumption, only for brushing your teeth, washing your hands and body, and washing your laundry.\n\nIf that's not possible, buy a shower filter that attaches to any showerhead. Rather than a poorly functioning small, round filter, I recommend a foot-long shower filter that attaches to your showerhead with an extension. The solid carbon block filters eliminate chlorine, chemicals, and allergens from your water. You should change the filter twice a year.\n\nStep 5: Avoid Fluoridated Water\n\nMost cities in the United States electively fluoridate their municipal water. In addition to your tap water, fluoride lurks in numerous products, including toothpaste, mouthwash, medications, green and black tea leaves, and drinks such as soda and juice.\n\nSome critics argue that fluoridating drinking water prevents dental caries and tooth decay, but no diseases have ever been linked to a case of fluoride deficiency. To prevent tooth decay, fluoride works best when it is applied to the outside surface of the tooth, not when it comes from the inside of the body. So why do we swallow it?\n\nA 2001 article in the Journal of the American Dental Association concludes that fluoride that is swallowed and incorporated into teeth is \"insufficient to have a measurable effect\" on reducing cavities. Oral intake of fluoride may not be necessary and can even be detrimental for your health.\n\nIn The Journal of the American Dental Association, another study showed that fluoride is a toxic substance that destroys teeth in developing young children and babies.\n\nIn short, fluoride is not something you want in your drinking water. If your city adds fluoride to your tap water for drinking purposes, you should filter it with a reverse osmosis unit. You may want to invest in a fluoride whole house filtration system that are available online, but some argue that it may not filter out all of the fluoride and may be a waste of your money.\n\nI have been using water filtration systems for over 15 years, and have both a whole house water purification system and a separate fluoride filtration system. I have installed a five foot fluoride filter last year. I did a before-and-after water analysis by a reputable lab on the fluoride level, and found that the fluoride filter I installed removed more than 95 percent of the fluoride. (For accuracy, I collected the water samples from my facet after running the water for 10 minutes through the filters.)\n\nIt has been about a year now, so it's time to perform a second analysis on the fluoride levels. I will make sure to post the results on my health blog!\n\nNext Time: \"Day 3 -- Clean Up Your Air.\" For more information, you are welcome to a free chapter from my book, The 7 Day Allergy Makeover.The danger to ones health by drinking fluoridated water is well documented. There is such a great volume of documentation that it would be difficult to list on this blog. An observer could start with this one: \n\nThose posters stating otherwise are most likely USA dentists, fluoride companys, or governmment employees whose incomes depend upon the fluoridation of the 50% of Americans who GET it done to them. Are they so naive to believe what the government or FDA tells them. Or perhaps these folks are those who believe in the present Administrations goal of population control, affordable??? health care, and relocation of those in the suburbs into the inner cities. Fluoridation of the population is a graphic example, but only one of many of the Administrations desires to Transform America. To force families to fluoridate their kids is a heinous crime against society - and one more example of the over-reach of government and the erosions of our freedoms. One thing about Dr. Bennett: she has the guts to speak the truth.\n\nCalgary removed the fluoride from their drinking water a few years ago and the cavity rate has increased. The water in my hometown was fluoridated and I have never had a cavity. My dentist knew without me telling him that I was from a small town with fluoride in the water based on how strong my teeth were.\nPerhaps your tinfoil hat is on a little tight.\n\ngardenome: Calgary removed the fluoride from their drinking water a few\n\nLoading comments…\n\nNO, she speaks what she believes is the truth, as do you, as do I. Doesn't make it the real truth.\n\nThe 'danger' to ones health from drinking fluoridated water is up there with vaccinations causing autism.\nMy current dentist knew I grew up in a small town with high fluoride in the water without me telling him because my teeth are very strong and I have never had a cavity.\n\nI have a niece and a nephew that live in Calgary, my nephew was born 5 years ago while they still had fluoride in their water and his teeth are strong and cavity free. My niece was born after they removed the fluoride from their water and her teeth are riddled with cavities, same upbringing, same brushing habits by the parents.\n\nNot definitive proof, but it's interesting.\n\nThis kind of paranoid fearmongering can cause real permanent harm. The myth about vaccines and autism was spread by a single 'doctor' who has since been charged with fraud for falsifying his findings a long time ago, and yet people still buy into it because they want to believe in conspiracies. Now we have eradicated diseases coming back because people think they don't need vaccines. Get real!\nThe government collects no taxes from dead people, they want us to live! To call their effort to prevent our tooth decay a crime is extremely misguided.\n\nI don't wish to get into a debate with you. I will only tell you what I prefer to do with my body. I can tell from your post that you are repeating what the dentists that you trust, and the government is telling you. I have heard your reasoning before, as it is a common utterance from those who trust in government. I don't.\n\nI consider myself a Freeman and well educated in water analysis that spans a career of 50 years. But aside from that it is and has been my decision to determine what goes into my body, and I take personal responsibility for that. Now I wish to kindly give you a couple of ejaculations that you can possibly mull over in your thoughts.\n\nFirst the National Cancer Institute says that there is no harm in floridated water. Well they have certainly done a great job of curing cancer, havent they.\n\nMoving onward, floridation of public drinking water is considered a form of medication. There are numerous other elements that your local water district adds for various reasons, such as taste, control of bacteria, etc., but none of those is considered a medication.\n\nLoading comments…\n\no while your public utility is medicating you, they have no monitoring of floride levels in their customers. Controlling the dose is impossible - why? Because different people drink different quantities of water. For example a farm laborer working in the hot sun will most likely drink more water than an accountant. And their is a dosage level established that is what the government says is safe.\n\nSo what happens to the fluoride once it goes down your throat. Well 60 to 70% of it leaves your body. The remainder goes to your bones - and builds up over your lifetime. So the floride concentrations in your bones increase over time.\n\nOne final example. I don't have the exact ppm in my head right now, but lets for example say a mother breast feeds her baby. Her breast milk contains approximately .004ppm of natural fluoride. Well then if she bottle feeds her baby, she will be giving him or her, 0.6 to 1.4ppm of fluoride (which is the dosage your water utility injects in the supply. So the baby is getting a big shot of medication that will accumulate in his bones at a very early age, and before he has teeth.\n\nLoading comments…\n\nDrink distilled water? Avoid fluoride\"lurking\" everywhere? This sounds like the famous Dr. Stranglovescenario where Col. Jack T. Ripper tells Mandrake that he only drinks vodka and distilled water.\n\nIn your blog you state, \"In The Journal of the American DentalAssociation, another study showed that fluoride is a toxic substance thatdestroys teeth in developing young children and babies.\" This article does NOT say anything about destroying teeth. It talks about reducing the prevalence of mild dental fluorosis, a mild cosmetic condition barely noticable to anyoneother than a trained dental professional. You don't have a clue what dentalfluorosis is.\n\nAnd putting a filter on your shower to avoid the chlorine. Are you kidding me???? Are you afraid to swim in a backyard pool with chlorine in it? Are you afraid to swim in the ocean where the fluoride content is 1.2-1.5 PPMfluoride??\n\n74% of the U.S.citizens on public water supplies enjoy the public health benefit of fluoridation. That is over 204 million people in the U.S. Not to mention that most of Southern California, including Santa Monica is fluoridated.\n\nThere are over 100 medical, dental, scientific research, and public healthorganizations that recognize the public health benefit of fluoridation. Not oneof these organizations have been convinced by the opponents to fluoridation tochange their position and call for an end to fluoridation.\n\nLoading comments…\n\nthis is right up there with Col Jack Ripper's views that fluoride will sap America's vital fluids\n\nRead the Louisiana study which found that 2/3rds of the operations for terrible cavities in little kids are avoided with CWF. If this were the only effect, fluoridation should be demanded by ethical citizens.\n\nA Colorado study showed if this was the only benefit, and it not, there is a 150% return on investment from decreased dental bills.\n\nThe operations require general anesthesia and can include extractions, root canals and stainless steel crowns. Each can cost upwards of $15,000. These cases and will happen more often in your town without CWF.\n\nHere are reviews of safety by well funded organizations who reviewed ALL the science.\n\nCalifornia Carcinogen Identification Committee (2011)\nEuropean Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (2011)\nDepartment of Public Health, Scotland, UK (2008)\nHealth Canada Report on Fluoride and Human Health (2008)\nNational Health and Medical Research Council, Australian Government (2007)\nNational Research Council, U.S.A.

How can you support immunizations and not support fluoridation?\n\nLoading comments…\n\nSusanne Bennett writes: \"...no diseases have ever been linked to a case of fluoride deficiency.\"\n\nWell actually, tooth decay is a disease (infection), and there would be less of it without scare-mongering articles like this one. Susanne Bennett's claims are not at all in line with the science.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine has classified fluoride a \"nutrient,\" and a pretty important one at that for having strong bones and teeth and even good hearing. Like other nutrient minerals, e.g. iron and calcium, fluoride is beneficial ingested in the right amounts.\n\nSusanne Bennett is, indeed, a chiropractor; on her website she claims to use \"muscle testing\" (aka applied kinesiology) to diagnose allergies. This is a very silly practice that uses the patient's body like an oiuja board.\n\nFluoride is not a vitamin or an essential mineral. Scurvy is the disease caused by Vitamin C deficiency. Beriberi is the disease caused by Vitamin B1 deficiency. Ricketts is caused by Calcium deficiency.\n\nInfection is not a disease caused by fluoride deficiency.\n\nDental caries and infection is caused by the most common bacteria in the mouth- Streptococcus Mutans, Eating too much sugar and poor dental hygiene promotes the bacterial growth and decay.\n\nSusanne_Bennett: Fluoride is not a vitamin or an essential mineral. Scurvy\n\nThis argument about the semantics of \"essential\" has nothing to do with the decision for fluoridated water.\n\nIt is certainly true that eating too much sugar and not brushing cause cavities. It is certainly true that low fluoride intake is not associated with a deficiency disease like Ricketts.\n\nIt is also certainly true that community water fluoridation is safe, inexpensive and effective in preventing cavities.\n\nThe National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine publication \"Evolution of Evidence for Selected Nutrient and Disease Relationships\" makes it clear that at the highest level of expertise, fluoride in water is considered a nutrient mineral which prevents disease.\n\nAll ordinary citizens want to know is this: Is fluoridation really going to help protect my teeth and is it safe?\n\nThe crystal clear expert opinion from scientists specializing in public and oral health \"YES\" to both questions.\n\nIt seems to me the American Academy of Pediatrics fairly and correctly represent what is good for kids. The American Public Health Association knows what is the best public health science. Because of these and many other prestigious academic, expert organizations, fluoridation reaches 74% of Americans on public water systems.\n\nWhat the many respected dental, medical, public health and disease prevention organizations say in their own words about fluoridation can be conveniently read at:\n\nLoading comments…\n\nPeople need to start lobbying their own legislators to stop them from adding the fluoride chemicals into the water supply in the first place. Even if you filter your own tap water, fluoridated tap water is used to make most processed foods and drinks and buy in supermarkets and restaurants. Efforts are underway in Milwaukee, New York City, Phoenix, Austin, Washington and Oregon states and elsewhere to stop fluoridation because of citizen involvement. Many communities have stopped already see \n\nStart by educating your circle of friends and relatives. Ask them to sign a petition to end fluoridation. Meeting with one or more of your local council members and find out what it takes to stop fluoridation and then do it.\n\nAbout that petition idea...Anti-fluoridationists recently tried to whip up enthusiasm for a petition to stop fluoridation in Bozeman, Montana. But they were only able to collect 5% of the signatures needed for a referendum. I guess the people of Bozeman appreciate having fewer cavities and lower dentist bills.\n\nLinda_Rosa: About that petition idea...Anti-fluoridationists recently tried to whip up enthusiasm\n\nNo. the person who spearheaded this was unable to continue. Bozeman people will continue to spearhead a campaign to stop fluoridation as residents of other cities are doing e.g. Milwaukee, Austin, Wichita, Phoenix, Eudora KS, Ormond Beach FL, Everett WA, Scapposse OR, Crescent City CA, and many more which are joining all the progressive cities that have already stopped or rejected fluoridation \n\nnyscof: No.  the person who spearheaded this was unable to continue. \n\nLoading comments…\n\nI think people should have a choice of drinking water with fluoride and without. We don't have a say whether we want it in our water or not, it's just added, If you want to drink fluoridated water that's fine, you should add it to your OWN water. NOT force it into everyone else's!\n\npantlesspenguin: I think people should have a choice of drinking water\n\nLoading comments…\n\n\"Some critics argue that fluoridating drinking water prevents dental caries and tooth decay, but no diseases have ever been linked to a case of fluoride deficiency.\"\n\nSome critics?

      "text": "How Fluoride Was Sold To America…And How We Bought It\n\nThe battle on fluoridation continues and is burning through\nthe American southwest. Phoenix, Arizona, the nation's sixth most\npopulous city, is seeking to rid itself of the harmful chemical compound\nknown as fluoride. Come this fall, the Phoenix city council is slated\nto discuss the future of fluoride and it's removal from the municipal\nwater supply, a move that has been a growing trend in cities across the\nUnited States. Just recently, Albuquerque, New Mexico passed a ruling to\nput an end to fluoridation in it's city water system. In 2001,\nresidents of the city of Flagstaff, Arizona, voted by an overwhelming majority to have fluoride removed from their public water system.\n\nThe anti-fluoride movement has been spreading not only in United States but world-wide according to this document from Fluoride Action Network (FAN).\nChina, Germany and France have a full ban on water fluoridation citing\nserious health risks. In China, the World Health Organization has\nestimated that millions people have a crippling form of skeletal fluorosis from the naturally occurring fluoride that exists in the environment.\nSkeletal fluorosis is a painful bone disease and is directly attributed\nto excessive consumption of fluoride. Studies have also shown that even\nsmall increases of fluoride exposes humans to mutagenic damage and destructive changes to their DNA.\n\nEPA official and chemist, Dr. J. William Hirzy, expressed his view on\nfluoride at a Senate subcommittee hearing in 2000, which was contrary\nto very agency he worked for. This is what Hirzy had to say: \"If\nthis stuff gets out into the air, it's a pollutant; if it gets into the\nriver, it's a pollutant; if it gets into the lake, it's a pollutant; but\nif it goes right into your drinking water, it's not a pollutant. That's\namazing… There's got to be a better way to manage this stuff \".\n\nUnder the EPA's own regulatory guidelines fluoride is listed as a chemical neurotoxin with substantial health risks. Sodium silicofluoride and\nhexafluorosilicic acid are the hazardous chemicals that make up the\nfluoridation process and are waste products originally created by the\naluminum and fertilizer industries.\n\nIn 1931 the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) under the direction\nof Andrew Mellon (The Mellon Institute) conducted fluoridation tests\nthrough the Public Health Service (PHS) by dentist H. Trendley Dean, who\ncoincidentally, was the first director of the National Institute of\nDental Research. Dean found that as fluoride levels began to rise, so\ndid percentages of dental fluorosis. Dean claimed his test results\nlowered cavities even though it was just the opposite. Dean promoted the\nfalsified findings and eventually became known as the \"father of\nfluoridation\". Andrew Mellon, who held considerable authority as acting\nU.S. Treasurer, put pressure on (PHS) to push the fraudulent tooth decay agenda.\n\nBy 1939 ALCOA was already facing major lawsuits regarding fluoride\nemissions from factories. Gerald Cox, a Mellon industry researcher who\nwas also financed by ALCOA, began selling the public on the idea of\ncompulsory fluoridation. ALCOA knowingly used false dental research to\ncover up fluoride pollution and avoid damage claims. In 1946 Oscar Ewing\nwas chief counsel for ALCOA and through a devil's bargain headed up the\nFederal Security Agency (FSA) taking charge over (PHS). This was how\nfluoride was sold. Soon cities across the United States purchased the\nfluoridated water and began dripping it into the water supply under the\npropaganda campaigns directed by (PHS) and the American Dental\nAssociation (ADA). To this day, the ADA and Centers for Disease Control\n(CDC) still defend the fluoride test results that were fabricated over sixty five years ago.\n\nHowever, there are even darker origins associated with fluoride and\nfluoridation. To understand the narrative of fluoride, you have to see\nthe duplicitous actions of industry that pushed fluoride for public\nconsumption. Christoper Bryson, an award winning investigative\njournalist and former producer for the BBC, exposed a sinister plot\ninvolving the use of fluoride in an article with Joel Griffiths titled\n\"Fluoride, Teeth and the Atomic Bomb\". Here is an excerpt from the\narticle:\n\n\"Fluoride was the key chemical in atomic bomb production, according\nto documents. Massive quantities of fluoride– millions of tons– were\nessential for the manufacture of bomb-grade uranium and plutonium for\nnuclear weapons throughout the Cold War. One of the most toxic chemicals\nknown, fluoride rapidly emerged as the leading chemical health hazard\nof the U.S. Atomic bomb program-both for workers and nearby communities,\nas documents reveal\".\n\nIt is now known that unsuspecting people of Rochester, NY were\nexposed to uranium hexafluoride under \"Program F\" during The Manhattan\nProject testing years. The Manhattan Project and \"Program F\", were part\nof nuclear testing program funded by the Atomic Energy Commission (ACE).\nHarold Hodge, chief fluoride toxicologist administered these hazardous\nexperiments for the benefit of the military industrial complex. At the\nsame time he was actively praising the fluoridation of drinking water to\nthe public. The face of fluoride and its health concerns were then\nmasked. There are many other stories of communities being savaged by\nvarious forms of fluoride poisoning. One can only conclude that several\nindustries agreed to cover-up the dangers of fluoride for fear of\nmassive litigation and public scrutiny.\n\nIn 2011 the EPA announced a reduction of fluoridation across the U.S. From 1.2 ppm to 0.7 ppm. The agency reassessed fluoride\nafter rising rates of dental fluorosis, a breakdown in tooth enamel.\nFluoride poisoning can occur from 1ppm to 2ppm. There isn't any way to\nknow how high a dosage the average person gets per day because water\nconsumption and absorption varies from person to person.\n\nThe city of Phoenix claims to have a rate of 0.7 ppm of fluoride, according to local government documents. Recent studies have shown that certain areas of the Phoenix valley have much higher levels then those legally allowed by the EPA. In an interview conducted with\nJody Clute, a Phoenix campaign coordinator for Fluoride Action Network\n(FAN) and founding member of Fluoride Free Arizona stated this about\nfluoride: \"It's the same thing with vaccines, if it's so great why do you have to force it on people\". Then adding:\"when you look back in history I think it's going to say that it was one of the worst health blunders\". The\nFluoride Action Network reports that more than two hundred communities\nhave stopped adding fluoride to water supplies in the past ten years.\n\nThe truth is, fluoride is carcinogenic industrial waste. In Dr.\nGeorge Waldbott's seminal work titled, \"Fluoridation, The Great\nDilemma\", published in 1978, Waldbott found that high rates of birth\ndefects, genetic damage and cancer are all linked fluoride accumulation\nfrom long term exposure. There have been many cases proving the terrible\nhealth risks of fluoride and only fabricated evidence to suggest any\nbenefit. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has never approved of\nthe use of fluoride in any form. In 1975 the (FDA) issued a regulatory\nletter to manufacturer's to remove fluoride. This was promptly ignored by the impacted industries.\n\nAfter twenty three years of water fluoridation, Phoenix city\nofficials are now in the process of making the decision whether or not\nto stop adding fluoride to the city water system. In addition to the\nhealth benefits of removing fluoride, Phoenix looks to save over half a\nmillion dollars by not fluoridating the water system . On September 5th 2012, Dr. Paul Connett a leading expert on fluoride, will be discussing the many dangers of fluoride during the Arizona Fluoride Debate at Phoenix College, Bulpitt Auditorium. Will Phoenix rise from the\nashes and make the right choice for future generations to come?\n\nI remember in the mid 50's going to school to have our teeth cleaned with Fluoride.\nThey had a dozen dentist's chairs lined up while we lined up around the school waiting for the dreaded cleaning. I can still smell and taste the Fluoride.\n\nThe tube alone has enough evidence for us all to at least be suspicious of water fluoridation. If the unspecified amount used for brushing is enough to call the poison control center, then I dont think I'd want to drink it. Not to mention we can also start bringing up facts like the fact that Nazi's used it to weaken the interment camp prisoners minds. The active ingredient in Prozac is Sodium Fluoride after all. Or we can bring up the fact that a recent Harvard study linked fluoride to reduced IQ's. It's known for massively increasing your chance of bone cancer. There is the possibility of dental fluorosis that does everything between discolor and destroy the teeth, or even osteo fluorosis. That fluoride ion is one nasty element.\n\nAlso its not just the mercury in CFL's. They also release carcinogens every time you turn them on according to a German study.  Their flicker rate and level of electromagnetic radiation released also is known to cause headaches and people to feel ill; much like the smart meters and even wifi has been linked to interfering with the human body. The only problem is that it wont cause the same illness in every person leaving open plausible deniability to the claim of an individual.\n\nFree thinking men are harder to control than drugged up obedient workers. There is quiet a lot going on that dumbs us down, like the education system using Pavlovian principles, television's flicker rate putting us in states of suspended disbelief combined with propaganda, and we are quite literally drugged. As I recall there are even calls for more additives like lithium (while necessary for bodily functions, higher levels are known to cause passiveness) to the water as well. Overall, the number of methods used to manipulate the people is astounding.\n\nBut as George Carlin said, they dont want people capable of free thinking. They just want obedient workers smart enough to get the job done, but dumb enough to passively accept working at lower wages, a decreasing standard of living, and all their other bulls***."

The container states that the water is distilled and filtered. I have tried a side by side comparison with tap water. The bottled water will do it regularly and the tap water will not. Our local water supply is pumped from underground and is hardened from the limestone.\n\nMy theory is that the purified water can become super cooled. The ice freezes on the outside first, on the top surface and all around the individual cube. The pressure builds up until a crack is formed on the top surface. The water squirts out and instantly freezes.\n\n—Robert Fox, Principle Design Engineer, Gammaflux\n\nVibration, not thermo. I think the answer lies in vibration analysis rather than thermodynamic phenomena. I believe the water in that particular ice cube compartment is subject to a large displacement just at the moment it freezes. What we are seeing is a frozen wave.\n\n—David Coffin\n\nTipsy cubes. I have noticed this phenomenon also, but I use distilled water to make my ice cubes, and I think this happens with nearly every tray. I pour my evening Bourbon over these cubes, and I just figured they were jumping for joy.\n\n—Lanny Reed, Lathe-Mill Resource, Euless, TX\n\nMonkeys didn't do it. Don't worry, there are no ice monkeys in your freezer. The weird ice formation is formed as the freezer's blower blows the air around inside the freezer. The blower pulsates the surface of the water which causes small eddies to smash into the sidewalls of the ice tray. After hitting the walls on opposite sides, these waves travel back to the center where they collide, forming a jet of water ice at the point of collision.\n\nImpurities the culprit. I worked in a biological lab several years ago and witnessed the same phenomenon there. Because of the nature of the lab, the ice trays were filled with filtered deionized water. The occurrence of the \"stalagmites\" was more frequent than mentioned in the article. My theory was that there was an impurity in the water at the point the stalagmite formed. This provided the \"seed\" for the initial crystal formation which eventually grew into the stalagmite. I deduced this theory based upon not seeing the formations at my home using regular tap water (with so many impurities, stalagmite formation was thwarted).\n\n—Bruce Coffey\n\nBlame it on Elvis. There are two possible solutions. The first and most likely is that a little miniature \"Elvis\" is in there creating the best ice sculpture he can with only his bare hands. The second and less likely solution is that the defroster (standard on most units) activates and cause a slight amount of condensation which drips onto the ice cube tray and forms the stalagmite"

Unlike surface water sources, groundwater is not required meet strict standards for quality because the subsurface is assumed to filter out impurities. However, at thousands of hazardous waste sites across the U.S., chemicals have historically been released to the ground, sunk to the water table, and contaminated groundwater supplies."

      "text": "Harmful chemicals are an unfortunate fact of everyday life. We are constantly ingesting toxins by performing the basic life functions of eating, drinking and breathing. This harms our bodies, even if we try to stay healthy. To remove these toxins, a natural body cleanse is a good idea.\n\nBefore you commit to undertaking a cleanse, it is a good idea to discuss it with your doctor to decide if it will be beneficial for you. A cleanse is not for everybody, especially those who are taking medication or are suffering from some illness which causes there immune system to be weak.\n\nAir pollution is a fact of modern life. Industrial processes spew out unimaginable amounts of pollution, and no matter how near or far a factory is, that pollution ultimately reaches us. Even in the absence of factories, the emissions from vehicles are very harmful, and since roads are everywhere we cannot escape this pollution. We breathe these toxins and they enter our lungs. Since blood production is dependent on good air, this also affects our circulatory system, which means that every organ that blood reaches is affected. A body cleanse may be able to undo at least some of this damage.\n\nFood today is highly processed, meaning that many chemicals are used in its production. Animal livestock are fed with derivatives of steroids to make them bigger and more productive. As a result, all meat and even dairy products such as eggs and milk are influenced and may not be entirely natural. Even fruits and vegetables are sprayed with pesticides to keep away parasites, and very likely they have also been genetically modified to make them appear fresher than they would otherwise be. To get rid of these toxins that we ingest, cleansing the body is a very good idea.\n\nMuch of the world does not have access to clean water, but even water that is considered to be clean undergoes chemical treatment. Most people drink water from water filtration plants, where chemicals are used to kill off unwanted germs and bacteria. Bottled water, which many advertise as being cleaner, is not much different since it too undergoes modifications to remove impurities. The only way to remove these contaminants from the body is through a cleanse.\n\nNo matter what we eat, drink or breathe, chemicals enter our bodies. Today's generation is more health-conscious than ever before, paying close attention to diet and getting regular exercise. But the health gains they achieve are offset by the contaminants that they ingest. Many people lack energy, and one of the reasons why is because their bodies are full of bad substances that they have unknowingly absorbed.\n\nAs with any product, once you have chosen a particular brand to use for your body cleanse, you should follow the instructions closely. In particular, before you start your cleanse you should purge your body of toxins such as alcohol, tobacco and bad food. Even after you have completed the cleanse, you should try to stay away from those harmful substances since they undo the effects of the purge.\n\nChemicals enter our bodies in all types of ways and in many different forms. We cannot avoid this fact of life. But a body cleansing can at least mitigate the effects that harmful substances would otherwise have on our bodies. A body cleansing will help get rid of harmful toxins.\n\nAll individuals are likely to have yeast infection. This medical condition does not pick between male or female.

Don't spend a bunch of money and time on something that does not require it. Natural health cures are better for you!\n\nPhytosterols are phytonutrients that occur widely throughout the plant kingdom and are present in many edible fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, cereals, and legumes. The most common phytosterols, B-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol, are health-promoting relatives of cholesterol – the small differences between their chemical structures and the structure of cholesterol make all the difference in the world.\n\nSimilar in form and function to cholesterol in animals and humans, phytosterols function to regulate the fluidity of cell membranes in plants. Phytosterols have received a great deal of attention from researchers seeking safer means of helping people maintain healthy blood cholesterol concentrations, healthy cardiovascular systems and healthy hearts. It appears that phytosterols interfere with the intestinal recycling of the cholesterol produced by the liver, effectively reducing the availability of cholesterol to the body and may also inhibit a percentage of dietary cholesterol absorption. This is likely due to the structural similarity of these compounds with cholesterol. The most effective way of dosing plant sterols seems to be with or near a meal. While some research shows that plant sterols can be effective regardless of when they are taken, other research suggests that taking phytosterols in divided doses increases their beneficial effect.\n\nEssentially all of the research conducted on phytosterols – including mathematical analyses of this research – show strong affiliations between phytosterol intake and the promotion of healthy blood cholesterol concentrations, healthy cardiovascular systerms and healthy hearts.\n\nU.S. FDA: \"Phytosterols Lower LDL-Cholesterol\"\n\nAfter conducting an intensive and extensive detailed review of \"the totality of publicly available scientific evidence,\" the US Food and Drug Administration has concluded that 1) \"there is significant scientific agreement to support a relationship between consumption of plant sterol esters (especially ß-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol) and reduction in the risk of developing heart disease\"; 2) \"plant sterol esters reduce blood total and/or LDL (the \"bad\" cholesterol) levels to a significant degree\"; 3) blood HDL(the \"good\" cholesterol) levels are not decreased by the consumption of plant sterol esters; and 4) these benefits can be obtained by individuals with either elevated blood cholesterol levels or normal healthy blood cholesterol levels.2 In addition, the blood cholesterol-lowering response occurs regardless of the composition of the rest of the diet.\n\nNew Scientific Research: \"Phytosterols Lower LDL-Cholesterol\"\n\nNew research findings have mentioned the conclusions reached by the US Food and Drug Administration, and have been published since the government's decisions. One such example is a study published in the Journal of Nutrition, showing that the cardiovascular health of men and women with blood LDL cholesterol concentrations within the \"normal\" range (blood LDL cholesterol concentration less than 100 mg/dL) received additional support after phytosterols were added to their daily diets, regardless of the nature of their diets. In a study of men and women with initially elevated blood cholesterol concentrations, similar results and benefits were experienced. Studies persistently have shown that phytosterols that are taken in amounts of 2 to 3 grams per day are able to lower LDL (low density lipoprotein) cholesterol levels by approximately 10 percent. Furthermore, besides their beneficial effects on blood lipid levels, phytoserols can also normalize the inflammatory response of the immune system.\n\nA comprehensive meta-analysis published earlier this year (2009) analyzed the results of 84 clinical trials using phytosterols.6 The authors concluded that their rigorous analysis confirmed the ability of phytosterols to significantly lower LDL cholesterol levels. The ability of phytosterols to reduce LDL concentrations was found to be dose-dependent. Again, they concluded that approximately 2 grams of phytosterols taken on a daily basis seemed to reduce LDL cholesterol by nearly 10%.\n\nPhytosterols are found in many types of nuts, oils and seeds. One can either add phytosterols to their diet by ingesting these substances, or by taking a high-quality dietary supplement. These substances are peanut oil, extra virgin olive oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, raw or roasted peanuts, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, flax seed, cashews, almonds, pecans, pistachios, sunflower seeds and walnuts.\n\nAny person that doesn't have any energy even though they've had a full night's sleep is having problems with their body. That weight that crept on you overnight is also another sign that you need a body cleansing. Your body is giving you hints that it isn't working properly. You should heed its call.\n\nEruptions on your skin are usually a clear indicator that you aren't drinking enough water. It is also crying out to be helped. Your other organs are not in prime condition and it is letting you know that when you have scarring, discoloration, and pimples that appear on your face. A total body cleanse will eliminate all these issues.\n\nThe organ that removes the most harmful toxins from your body is your liver. If this quits working and you can't get a liver transplant you will die. It metabolizes the fat and cholesterol and cleans the harmful items in your blood. A partially functioning liver affects your weight. A total body cleanse corrects the problem.\n\nThe pair of organs that rest on each side of your back are your kidneys. They filter the items that you imbibe. All the harmful liquids that you have will exit through your kidneys. If you have too much build up of calcium or uric acid then you will have a high chance of getting a kidney stone. When you get a total body cleanse, it decreases your odds of getting the stones and allows improvement in your kidney function.\n\nIf you've ever suffered from gallstones then you will understand the need for a total body cleanse. Your gallbladder processes the bile that comes from the liver. If you consume too many fatty foods and have gallstones you will experience a lot of pain. Your doctor might suggest surgery as a solution, but this will only impede fixing the symptoms and not the underlying problem. When you cleanse your body, you help it to remove a lot of the build up and waste.\n\nThe colon is where a good percentage of waste is removed. If this organ isn't working then you might experience indigestion, gas, bloating, and constipation. Once the colon is not functioning as it should, your body's ability to process minerals and vitamins is hindered. You can correct this with a total body cleanse. Your food will be processed quicker and the food will exit your body at a faster rate. The weight that you thought you needed to lose could have just been food stuck in your colon.\n\nYou may not think of the job that your lungs do for you every day. They filter the pollutants that you inhale through your nose and mouth. All of the chemicals, gases, and fumes are affecting your body. If you have too much mucus these chemicals get trapped inside and wreck havoc on your system. You could be experiencing allergies, coughing and sinus problems as a result. A total body cleanse will remove the mucus and help you to breathe deeper and clearer.\n\nYou can improve your overall health with a total body cleanse. Your lungs, kidneys, colon, skin, liver, gallbladder with have improved functioning capacity after you get one. You may not have any major health problems and think you are feeling great. But if you get a tune up for your car after so many miles why wouldn't you do the same for yourself? Get a total body cleanse.\n\nSelenium A healthy prostate depends on Selenium consumption. Published results of scientific analysis shows that 100mcg of Selenium daily can adequately maintain the function of a man's prostate. It appears that Selenium \"seeks out\" the cells of the prostate and balances oxidant/antioxidant ratios to promote sustained health of all these cells. According to the US Food and Drug Administration, as of February 21, 2003, \"Selenium may reduce the risk of certain cancers. Some scientific evidence suggests that consumption of selenium may reduce the risk of certain forms of cancer\" and \"Selenium may produce anti-carcinogenic effects in the body. Some scientific evidence suggests that consumption of selenium may produce anti-carcinogenic effects in the body.\" These statements reinforce why Selenium is of great importance for a man's prostate.\n\nVitamin E In addition to Selenium protecting the inner workings of prostate cells, their cell membranes need protection against oxidative attacks. This is where vitamin E comes into play. According to recent scientific evidence, Vitamin E is imperative to maintaining prostate health due to its antioxidant effects on the prostate cells.\n\nZinc Prostate health isn't just a matter of antioxidants. It also depends on proper metabolic control of energy processing within the gland. Even early loss of a small part of regulatory control can decrease prostate health. Although the regulation of energy processing is a complex process in any cell, a few quirks in the way prostate cells handle this challenge have placed the mineral, zinc, in a pivotal position. Recently published research illustrates the role of zinc in prostate function and highlights the special needs of the prostate for zinc. The prostate needs zinc for health – so all men need zinc for prostate health.\n\nTo read more information please check out the benefits of prostate, you can also research omega-3.\n\nThis is a continuation of Healthy Aging spotlight. Every day we will post some of the noteworthy information that is packed into our book.\n\nDisclaimer – This article is not meant to constitute medical advice. If you need medical advice consult with your physician.\n\nWith a lot of information regarding vitamin additions on the web, you can easily get flooded by them without actually finding what you\"re trying to find.\n\nThat is the reason why we have this list of Frequently-Asked-Questions ( FAQs ) which gives you all you need to know about vitamin additions.\n\nWhat are vitamin additions?\n\nThey are drugs that supply people with the vitamins that their body needs . The things that we eat can only give us enough vitamins and we get the rest from these additions.\n\nAre they safe to take?\n\nYes but you have to ensure first you're getting one made by a reputable manufacturer. Keep under consideration the product is only as good as the one producing it.\n\nAre natural vitamin additions better than synthetic ones?\n\na large amount of folks claim that natural ones are better, but unless they can provide hard systematic explanation to back up that claim then be at liberty to make your decision.\n\nI take vitamin additions but I still feel feeble, what am I doing wrong?\n\nTaking vitamin additions is only one step in the direction of a good life. Routine exercise and the right nutrition also help in making you healthier and stronger, whether it's basic fish oil nutrition or taking vitamins\n\nI am taking X medication, is it safe to take with a vitamin supplement?\n\nOnly your health practitioner can say. It's therefore critical that you talk to your physician first before taking a vitamin supplement.\n\nI'm convinced my supplement's not working. Should I up the dosage?\n\nThat will be a really bad idea. Rather than doing that, see your doctor first. He / she's the one that can tell you what to do. Also try and eat healthy and exercise constantly.\n\nA detox will remove toxins and poisons that have built up in your body over time. Our modern diet, as well as our bad habits, puts strain on the lymphatic system, kidneys and liver. If you do a body detox on a regular basis, you will free your body of harmful toxins that affect many of your body functions and the way you feel physically. Your health and general wellbeing can be improved.\n\nIt is recommended that every few months you should embark on a detox diet. The aim is to rid your body of the build up of toxins, which can lead to problems with digestion, fatigue and even illnesses. The benefits are well worth it. You will feel renewed energy, better digestion and clear-headed after the diet.\n\nCheck with your doctor before going on a detox regime. Set a date and be mentally prepared for the detox. It is best to start your program when you not likely to have any great demand on yourself physically or emotionally. You can look forward to feeling healthier and have more energy.\n\nKick start your cleanse by cutting out all foods that contain caffeine, preservatives and flavorings. Salt and sugar should also be reduced. You should also stock up on good quality fruit, vegetables, nuts and seeds. Have a liquidizer to make your own fruit and vegetable juice.\n\nTo avoid unpleasant side effects, step up your fluid intake to help flush out the toxins. You will soon start to enjoy eating raw foods! The first 2 to 3 days can be difficult as your body learns to adjust to your new eating regime, so keep busy to avoid temptation.\n\nYou can enjoy fresh fruit salads, mixed salads with sprouts, carrots, brussel sprouts, cabbage and other vegetables. Also, nibble on almonds, sunflower and pumpkin seeds, which are all low in fat. Naturally dried fruit is also recommended in small portions.\n\nPrepare snacks beforehand so they are ready when the hunger pangs strike. Cut up different fruits and vegetables into julienne strips and keep them in the fridge. Make a soup with grated vegetables and add vegetable juice for a different twist.\n\nTo aid the elimination of toxins, you need to exercise every day. Walking, swimming and cycling are recommended. Many people swear by a good massage to get the lymph system functioning to aid elimination.\n\nNot every detox diet requires you to use supplements or vitamins. You can take herbal supplements, such as milk thistle, which helps cleanse the gallbladder and liver. You can also get powdered vegetable supplements that contain different vitamins if you feel you need them.\n\nWhen you have completed your body cleanse, the major benefit is that all your bodily functions will work more efficiently. Your digestive and renal system will also function well and your circulatory system will be on top form. You will also lose weight, which will further improve your health. In addition, you will be emotionally recharged and ready to put an end to all your previous bad habits thank to the full body cleanse.\n\nSeen the news? Coffee has antioxidants! Antioxidants have been studied to a large degree. The research suggests that antioxidants could very well delay the aging process along with defend the body against the introduction of age-related ailments.\n\nIf you examine any medical articles that correspond with these studies and you really are not in the field of medicine, most likely you're going to get lost within the facts. This is when a problem in thinking that particular foods containing antioxidants are healthy for you starts.\n\nAn extremely important study was conducted concerning coffee beans and the antioxidant advantages that could be obtained when consumed.\n\nThe article was extremely long and had a lot of medical phrases and references in it. What the outcome demonstrated was that despite the fact that antioxidants did exist in coffee, once the beans were heated up and processed, the advantages that may be acquired when drinking it are reduced. However, for people who enjoy that early morning cup of coffee and will drink it regardless of the outcome here are a few kroger coupons to buy all your favored coffee brands.\n\nThis is easier to understand when you can think about how the testing was accomplished.\n\nUsing lab rats to examine the effects of the antioxidants in coffee is unreliable. Particularly when the coffee had not been ground up and prepared in the regular human style where we place the grounds right into a coffee pot and run sizzling water over it producing a pot of hot liquid which happens to be coffee.\n\nThe testing within the labs required breaking down the actual coffee bean directly into different parts. For instance, the skin was pulled from the coffee bean and tested as to the amount of antioxidants it contained.\n\nWhy might they do this you might ask?\n\nWell, the skin is where the greatest number of antioxidants is available. Yet, we must ask the question, \"Exactly who drinks only the skin of the coffee bean?\"\n\nAnother problem with considering any beneficial results meant that coffee is wonderful for us is the fact that after coffee is prepared, it looses a lot of the antioxidants through the heating process.\n\nAfter testing coffee in numerous forms and breaking it up into several different pieces, at the very end of an exceptionally long examination of medically demanding terms and data, it became apparent that the laboratory experiment didn't in fact prove coffee to obtain any antioxidant benefits when ingested as a hot stimulating beverage.\n\nIn actual fact at the end of this article tha harsh truth was that there seemed to be no facts at all that coffee is beneficial to us due to any substantive level of antioxidants following the brewing process.\n\nSo, the bottom line here is…\n\nRumors can begin rapidly and become often considered as fact if we do not perform our own study."

      "text": "NEER - a simple water purifier that combines nano technology with indigenous materials to make clean drinking water available and easily accessible to all; with an intent to build a ecosystem of clean water users.\n\n0\n\nOur proposed product addresses problems related to water in India. According to World Bank, out of the population of 1.2 billion people in India, 81% of people lack safe water. The health burden of poor water quality is enormous. A research study on pollution levels in UP indicate that water consumed contains dissolvable solids and metals beyond acceptable levels prescribed by WHO.\n\nOur product - a water filter 'NEER', provides indigenous solutions to problems related with polluted water in India. Main constituents of the filter are: Coconut Coir, Carbon Nanotube and Mesh Filter. Coconut coir filters the dirt particles and small sand grains from impure water. Carbon Nanotube is the main component of the filter. Water molecules can pass through its interiors, while toxic metal ions, viruses, and bacteria cannot. Hence, it leads to the filtration of bacterial contaminants such as the nanometer-sized poliovirus from water. Mesh filter can also be used for screening ionic impurities, if any and it can be customized to suit the local conditions. The filters are known to achieve 99.9% purity.\n\nThere are many filters available in the market. The distinctiveness of our product is its use of indigenous technologies (coconut coir), ease of manufacturing, cheap price and easy availability of components. The targeted audience is mainly the people living in rural areas of India who cannot afford to spend much on these products.\n\nFor marketing we plan to build on the existing microfinance networks with focus on states of Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh initially and scale up by building a ecosystem of clean water users. Publicity will be through rural coordinators/self help workers/anganwadi workers and sales force to visit districts every week. We target the price of the filter to be INR 500/USD 10. We are considering a initial funding from 'Technology Entrepreneurship Promotion Program' of Government of India/NGOs of INR 10 lakh/USD 20,000 and plan to collaborate with village local administration to rollout our products in villages. We plan to break-even in 3-4 years with a projected sales of 1.2 million units in five years.\n\nNEER is a self-sustainable water purifier that combines the latest technology with indigenous materials. By making it affordable for all we plan to earn smiles.\n\nFIVE PROJECT QUESTIONS Required(60 - 90 minutes)\n\n1. What is your innovation?\n\nNEER's innovation is technology re positioning. Through NEER we intend to bring the technology used in NASA and researched in worlds top universities like MIT, CMU and IITs to the doorsteps of the people who will benefit the most from it. NEER is a mobile water purifier which is cheap, light, maintenance free and has the potential to achieve 99.9% purity. It has the potential to make pure drinking water available to everyone around the world. We plan to start it out by implementing in India.\n\n2. Who gains the most?\n\nNEER has the potential to transform the clean water needs across the world, particularly in developing nations. NEER will make clean drinking water accessible to population across all socio economic groups, especially below poverty line and lower middle class families. NEER benefits the most to people with limited access to clean drinking water by aiming to provide safe drinking water at a affordable cost and also ensuring sustainability of the drinking water purification systems.\n\n3. Who pays?\n\nNEER is a response to a social need and the social enterprise model for NEER is developed based on the market dynamics.The below poverty line and middle income group families who are the target segment for NEER will pay for the filters. The sale price for NEER is estimated to be INR 500/USD 10 and the filters have a life span of one year. NEER is developed as a self sustaining model with a break even period of 3-4 years and a target to sell 1.2 million units in 5 years in two states in India.\n\n4. What is your success?\n\nNEER is a social enterprise model and is envisioned to address the clean water needs of the society. NEER's immediate success factors will be purity of water consumed and and increase in clean water consumption. On a long term NEER aims to decrease in number of hospital cases due to communicable disease, increase in employment rate and increase in expanded reach. NEER will continually focus on monitoring product usage and development through R&D and collaboration with the research universities.\n\n5.

For example, a number of water systems in Texas saw\ntheir first episodes of nitrification during the rainy summer of\n2007.\n\nOptimize Your\nChloramination Process\n\nBefore you calculate how much ammonia to add in chloramination,\nbe sure you know whether your treated water already contains some\nFAA (free available ammonia). If it does, take this concentration\nFAA into account when you consider how much ammonia to add to\nbalance the chlorine.\n\nRemember: One key to preventing nitrification\nis to ensure that the biofilm has no ammonia to work with. So keep\nFAA levels low in your post-chloramination water:\n\nIn many areas, this means you should make sure FAA leaving the\nplant is less than 0.1 mg/L—preferably, less than 0.05\nmg/L.\n\nIn some areas, particularly in East Texas, you can allow FAA\nlevels of up to 0.2 mg/L due to competition in the water for the\nammonium ion.\n\nSystems with pH levels in higher ranges (> 9.0) will be\nless susceptible to nitrification and might be able to safely\noperate with higher FAA levels.\n\nThese are guidelines. No two water systems are alike. Know\nyour water and make adjustments accordingly. If you need help,\nconsider our direct assistance to water\nsystems.\n\nReduce Water Age\n\nDisinfectant levels fall when water stands still in your system.\nIf usage falls, flush your mains to keep new water moving into your\nsystem.\n\nWhen usage is low for extended periods, consider whether to\nreduce the holding volume of water in your reservoirs to ensure low\nresidence times.\n\nDo Preventive\nMaintenance\n\nBe sure to include measures to reduce biofilms and tuberculation\nin your regularly scheduled maintenance:\n\nSome systems have found that a hard flush once a year helps to\nkeep nitrification in check.\n\nEspecially if your system has cast iron pipes, mechanical\npigging can remove deposits and tuberculation where nitrifying\nbacteria can set up shop.\n\nWhen usage is low, consider rotating reservoirs out of service\nto clean their interiors vigorously.\n\nReplace Aging\nInfrastructure\n\nCorroding pipes and equipment provide plenty of crevices for\nnitrifying bacteria to escape your residual disinfectant. If you\nfind your system having to do excessive maintenance to keep your\ninfrastructure clean, consider replacing the problematic components\nwith newer, less corrodible equipment.\n\nHow Can I Detect\nNitrification?\n\nNitrification will usually show up first in areas where\nresidence time (or \"water age\") is highest—for\nexample, dead-end mains, storage tanks, and areas where pressure\nplanes overlap. Watch these areas especially carefully.\n\nTo be sure nitrification is not happening, watch these\nindicators well enough to know your system's baseline for each:\n\nResidual disinfectant. Low levels of residual\ndisinfectant can allow bacteria in the biofilm to multiply. When\nresidual disinfectant drops below your normal baseline,\nnitrification may soon follow. So monitoring and mapping levels of\nresidual disinfectant proves to be a quick and inexpensive tool you\ncan use to pinpoint affected areas and focus your mitigation\nefforts.\n\nNitrite and nitrate levels in distribution.\nNot all systems routinely monitor for these contaminants in\ndistribution. But one variety of nitrifying bacteria oxidize\nammonia to produce nitrite, and another will oxidize nitrite to\nproduce nitrate. By monitoring nitrite and nitrate levels, you can\nknow when action is needed.\n\nFAA levels. FAA is food to nitrifying\nbacteria. So if FAA levels are low in at least part of your\ndistribution system, nitrification could be the cause. Look more\nclosely at the data from any location that shows FAA levels below\nthose of either the water leaving your treatment plant or other\nlocations in your distribution system.\n\nFrequently, but not always, systems that have nitrification\noccurring also have coliform-positive test results, increases in\nheterotrophic plate counts (HPC), or both.\n\nIf you see symptoms of nitrification, first check to be sure\nthey aren't masking other problems. For example, check the\nnitrogen balance in your system. With all values in mg/L, the\nnitrogen balance of your system is:\n\nThis number will fluctuate somewhat under normal\noperating conditions. If you find that certain areas in your\ndistribution system have high nitrate + nitrite levels and\nan increased nitrogen balance, then you should check for and rule\nout cross connections, line breaks, and other sources of\ncontamination before you determine that nitrification is the\nculprit.\n\nHow Can I Stop\nNitrification Once It Has Begun?\n\nThe key to stopping nitrification is to starve the nitrifying\nbacteria of nitrogen. The most effective way to do this is to\nswitch disinfectant from chloramine to free chlorine. When you take\nthis step, keep these key points in mind:\n\nAs a courtesy, notify your customers before the change occurs.\nBe sure to mention these points:\n\nA temporary change has been made to the treatment process to\nimprove the quality of water being served to our customers.\n\nSome taste and odor changes may briefly occur, but there are no\nassociated health risks.\n\nThe name and phone number of the person customers can contact\nat your water system if they have any questions.\n\nIt is fairly common for customers to notice (and complain\nabout) changes in odor whenever you change disinfectants. Some\ncustomers will notice the different taste of free chlorine; others\nmay notice when you switch back and the chloramine wavefront hits\nthe chlorinated water in the distribution system. To minimize\nnoticeable changes in odor, increase flushing of your distribution\nlines following each change. To determine where odors are most\nlikely to be noticeable, monitor your distribution for both free\nand total chlorine until levels stabilize.\n\nWhere Can I Get More Help?\n\nOur Financial, Managerial, and Technical (FMT) Assistance\nProgram helps public water systems stay informed of the best ways\nto deal with today's problems. There is no cost to water\nsystems for the training itself, although each system is\nresponsible for having the appropriate materials and equipment on\nhand."

      "text": "Best Water Source During Emergencies\n\nWater contamination is a lot more common than most people realize. There are frequent contamination scares all across the country and those living in such communities are encouraged to boil their water.\n\nOne of the most common contaminants in times like this is E. coli. Results from one water source come back positive so officials fear all the water could be harmful. Hence, a boiling advisory is put into effect. Even if most of the water sources are perfectly fine, no one wants to take chances.\n\nCity officials sometimes put out the warning before they even know the source of the contamination. It is good that they are being safe and looking out for the community.\n\nWith towns that are home to more than 30,000, it's not likely that everyone boils their water. Boiling is a good idea because it kills bacteria, but it also takes effort, time and can be a real hassle for big families.\n\nA lot of people in this situation will choose to buy bottled water instead of boil. And then others will rely on their home water filtration systems to keep them safe.\n\nThere is a better option for emergency water situations and that is to have a dependable portable water filter. With a filter like this, you don't need electricity and they require very little maintenance. They also guarantee the removal of E. coli and other harmful contaminants. If you own a filter like this, you won't have to think twice if a boil-water advisory is issued in your area.\n\nDon't wait until there's an emergency in your area to think about a portable water filter. Start planning now and if something like this ever happens, you won't have to worry about getting sick. You'll also be able to avoid the hassle of boiling water or spending a lot on bottled water. Put forth the effort and money up front and you'll feel safe knowing you're drinking clean water no matter what."

At first glance, waters may not seem to have the individual characteristics that distinguish wines, but distinct differences become apparent when the attention is focused on water.\n\nLike wine water has terroir and it is a natural product that originates from a particular place with unique properties. That is of course if you drink premium bottled water. About 40% of the bottled water sold in the US is purified tap water and available from brands like Aquafina, Dasani and many others. If it says municipal source on the label it's not premium water and highly processed.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with tap water and in most places its save to drink and in some instances it actually does not taste too bad. Tap water is for hydration while premium bottled water deserves a place at the table in an epicurean context.\n\nEnjoying bottled water is not a new trend as many belief. In the Roman Empire earthen jars filled with naturally carbonated water from Northern Germany (today's Apollinaris) whas transported to Rome at great expense and the 11 aqueducts streaming water into the city were rated according to the taste and quality of the water.\n\nAll these waters have special characteristics and we can now think of integrating it into the epicurean context similar to wine in what I like to call the Bottled Water Etiquette.\n\nOurs is the blue planet, and the hallmark of life on Earth is water. But where did this colorless, odorless liquid first come from?\n\nRecent discoveries in astrophysics suggest that water is not native to Earth but rather was imported from the edges of our solar system as ice trapped in comets. Scientists think this water was first delivered here more than four billion years ago. During the meteor shower that gave the Moon most of its craters, Earth received five hundred times more \"hits\" than its moon did; since the planet has a greater critical mass than its satellite, Earth was also able to hold on to much of the water from the ice.\n\nWhen you open a bottle of Fiji Water today you drink the rain water that fell around 450 years ago at the time Balboa discovered the Pacific. Carbon dating tells that the what we drink today from a bottle of Fiji Water is rain that fell more than 450 years ago, and it has been percolating ever since through layers of silica, basalt and sandstone."

      "text": "Do water filtration devices need to be registered?\n\nSome units have an EPA registration number and an EPA establishment number. EPA registration (unlike that of NSF, WQA, or UL) is not intended to guide consumers in selecting a water treatment device, and is not an endorsement of the product. EPA registers any product that contains an antimicrobial (germ-killing) or bacteriostatic (slowing or inhibiting growth of germs) agent. EPA registers these products because consumers cannot independently verify whether the germ-related claims they make are true.\n\nFor most units, an EPA registration number means that the filter uses a bacteriostatic agent to slow the growth of microbes within the filter, the unit does not pose a human health threat, and EPA has verified all bacteriostatic claims on the label. Registration is not an endorsement of the filter or its performance. The most commonly used bacteriostatic agent is silver.\n\nEPA also registers a type of water treatment device known as a purifier. A purifier must remove, kill, or inactivate all types of disease-causing organisms from the water, including viruses. Few water treatment devices can meet these criteria. These units typically work using a disinfectant within the filter to kill or inactivate microbes. Most purifiers are used by hikers or campers and are not generally needed in homes served by public water systems unless there is a water emergency.\n\nThe EPA's National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC), Water Infrastructure Protection Division (WIPD), headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, is responsible for evaluating ways to protect drinking water supplies. As part of this responsibility, researchers at NHSRC are evaluating Point of Use/Point of Entry (POU/POE) devices. Both POU and POE devices treat water coming from the distribution system to a home or facility. POU treats water at only the tap to which it is connected, while POE treats all the water coming into the building. Testing of the POU/POE devices takes place as part of NHSRC's Technology Testing Evaluation Program (TTEP). TTEP was formerly part of EPA's Environmental Technology Verification Program (ETV).\n\nThe Safe Drinking Water Hotline provides information about local drinking water quality; drinking water standards; public drinking water systems; source water protection; large capacity residential septic systems; commercial and industrial septic systems; injection wells; and drainage wells.

      "text": "Fluoridation issue alive again in Wichita\n\nBruce Northup, Topeka's water treatment plant manager, stands next to a holding pool at the plant. Northup said he rarely gets calls inquiring about fluoridation in Topeka, which has added fluoride to public drinking water since 1957. Wichita is one of the four largest cities in the U.S. that does not fluoridate its water. There is a new petition asking the city council to begin doing so.\n\nWICHITA — By the time it reaches the tap, most drinking water in Kansas has been treated with all kinds of chemicals.\n\nChlorine, ammonia, alum, phosphates and polymers are among the most commonly used.\n\nBut of the hundreds of chemicals certified for use at water treatment plants, only one seems to excite public attention and controversy: fluoride.\n\nAnd the clamor this year over the additive probably is as loud in Wichita as it is anywhere else in the U.S.\n\nKansas' largest city for many years has been among the minority of American cities that do not fluoridate the drinking water. As is, Wichita's water, drawn from Cheney Lake and aquifers, has a naturally occurring or \"background\" fluoride level of about 0.3 parts per million. One ppm is equivalent to 1 milligram per liter of water.\n\nA group of residents — Wichitans for Healthy Teeth — has been circulating a petition asking city officials to boost the level of fluoride in the city's water to 0.7 ppm as a way to combat tooth decay, especially among low-income persons who might not have regular access to dentists. About 8,300 signatures have been collected so far.\n\n\"Fluoridated water can reduce decay by about 25 percent,\" said Dr. Sara Meng, chair of Wichitans for Health Teeth. \"A very conservative estimate of how much can be saved is $4.5 million annually, in preventing fillings and basic services. That does not count all the crowns, root canals and other major services.\"\n\nRelated story\n\nIf the group were successful, the city's residents would experience no tactile differences in their water. It takes about 600 milligrams to equal a quarter teaspoon of salt, so 0.7 ppm of fluoride in the water would be nothing a normal person could taste or feel.\n\nBut that's not what bothers the opponents of fluoridation in Wichita who have organized under the banners of Wichitans for Pure Water, a new group, and Fluoride Free Kansas, which launched its website in the late 1990s to fight an earlier effort to fluoridate the water.\n\nSpokespersons for the opponents say the potential health hazards of fluoride, added at treatment plants in industrial quantities, aren't fully understood. Some argue that government has no right to put what they consider medication in the drinking water.\n\nMichael Hicks, executive director of Wichitans for Pure Water, on Wichita's PBS station discussing why he opposes adding fluoride to public drinking water.\n\n\"Fluoride is not the end-all, be-all to preventing cavities that we once thought it was, and there are potential side effects. We need to be investigating these,\" said Michael Hicks, volunteer executive director of Wichitans for Pure Water.\n\nHealth experts, however, say long-experience and research have shown the benefits of fluoridation far outweigh potential risks, which are inconsequential if the fluoride is used appropriately.\n\n\"The fact is, scientists involved in this have a very detailed and deliberate knowledge of (fluoridation),\" said Kip Duchon, a fluoridation engineer at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"We struggle because it's difficult for us to explain very complex things in lay terms.\"\n\nThat makes it relatively easy, he said, for people to stir up doubts and stoke fears about fluoridation based on misinformation.\n\nChemist dissent\n\nPeer-reviewed research on the subject has convinced public health experts that fluoridation is safe and effective. But there are a few scientists who say their research suggests otherwise, and that their findings have been marginalized.\n\nOne of those is Albert Burgstahler, University of Kansas emeritus professor of chemistry and editor of the journal \"Fluoride.\"\n\nThe journal focuses on the potential problems of fluoride, providing a venue for the \"marginalized\" researchers. For example, a report by a New Zealand scientist published in the journal in July 2011 concluded that the additive could cause cognitive impairment and that \"the only assuredly safe level is zero\" fluoride in drinking water.\n\nBurgstahler declined requests to be interviewed, citing unfair treatment by the media in the past, but offered some information to KHI News Service via email.\n\n\"The public needs to have access to the best available evidence to make wise decisions. Asking the public to have faith in endorsements and opinions is not the same as seeing actual evidence,\" Burgstahler wrote via email, attaching several articles included here.\n\nHe said his journal has been published since 1968, \"but has been deliberately excluded from coverage by Medline,\" for reasons he said were outlined here.\n\nMedline is the index of medical journals maintained by the National Institutes of Health.\n\n'Poison is the concentration, not the substance'\n\nAmong the concerns fluoride opponents commonly cite is the way most large water treatment plants add it in the treatment process, by pumping in hydrofluosilicic acid.\n\nThe acid is a byproduct of phosphate production. The opponents generally describe it as a \"toxic waste,\" added to drinking water despite the fact that no studies have been done on its possible health effects.\n\nTypes of fluoride used in water treatment\n\nMost of the studies have been done on a different fluoride compound, sodium fluoride, the white powder used when fluoridation started in the 1940s, but which today is only used in the smallest treatment plants.\n\nDuchon, the CDC's fluoridation engineer, said his office fields calls from the media across the country about once per month, asking about the health risks of hydrofluosilicic acid.\n\n\"What are the health risks of fluorosilicates? The answer is there have never been health studies on fluorosilicates. When they hear that, they say that's horrible ... we should be concerned,\" Duchon said.\n\nBut he said that's a bogus argument because fluorosilicates can only exist in a highly concentrated acid form.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Kip Duchon.\n\nKip Duchon, the National Fluoridation Engineer at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"When you neutralize the water to the pH that people drink and you dilute it to the level that's in water, fluorosilicates cease to exist,\" Duchon said. \"But have we done studies on fluoride? Absolutely — there have been decades of study.\"\n\nDuchon said the acid is no different than the other additives used to treat water. At high concentrations it would be toxic, but not at 0.7 parts per million (ppm), the optimal fluoride level recommended by the CDC.\n\n\"Poison is the concentration, not the substance,\" said Duchon.\n\nIn Ottawa, water treatment plant superintendent David Buehler said hydrofluosilicic acid, or HFS, is cheaper and much easier to apply than powdered sodium fluoride, allowing treatment engineers to keep a constant, precise fluoride level in the water.\n\n\"At one time we did feed the sacked, powdered chemical into a fluoridation tank. But getting a consistent level of treatment out of it was kind of an art form. With the HFS, you just hook it up to a pump and adjust your flow, so it's much easier and more consistent to apply,\" Buehler said.\n\nFluorosis and changing fluoride recommendations\n\nAnother concern cited by fluoridation opponents has to do with a once-common cosmetic side effect of fluoride.\n\nFluorosis, a condition that permanently stains teeth, can be caused by relatively low levels of fluoride — as low as 2 ppm, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Water treatment plants must notify customers any time the fluoride level rises above 2 ppm.\n\nIn January 2011, the CDC lowered the recommended level of fluoride from 1 ppm to 0.7 ppm, said Linda Orgain, spokeswoman for the CDC's Division of Oral Health.\n\n\"Why the change now? Because, unlike when water fluoridation was first implemented back in the 1940s, we only had that as our main source of fluoride. People didn't have toothpaste. But now there's many different sources of fluoride,\" she said.\n\nOrgain said that — despite the current prevalence of toothpaste and other sources of fluoride — the CDC still recommends the lower amount be added to drinking water because, among other things, children in families with lower incomes are less likely to be taught good oral hygiene habits. Oral health experts say complications from tooth decay can lead to problems beyond bad teeth and emergency room visits, such as poor nutrition and difficulty concentrating in school.\n\nAccording to Wichitans for Healthy Teeth, the cost to fluoridate the water would be about $2 million initially and then about $150,000 annually"

      "text": "Water Purification Technologies\n\nFeatured Articles\n\nThere are many methods used to remove impurities and contaminants from water. Each of the water purification technologies is best at removing one type of contaminant from water, and may not be effective at all for others.\n\nFact: People drawing water from private wells are responsible for assuring that their water is safe for consumption.\n\nFact: The Environmental Protection Agency only requires testing of municipal water sources for about 80 of more than 75,000 known contaminants.\n\nFact: The standards for safe drinking water are safe for a 175 pound healthy adult. Those standards may not be safe for children, pregnant and nursing mothers and adults with compromised immune systems.\n\nFact: Municipal water supplies do not need to test for or eliminate many known contaminants that 'do not present a health threat'. These 'secondary contaminants' DO make your water taste and smell bad, corrode your pipes, stain your sinks and tubs – and may stain your teeth or alter the color of your skin.\n\nBelow is a short list of common water purification technologies and the contaminants that they remove.\n\nDistillation\n\nDescription Water is heated to boiling, then cooled to condense the water vapor. Impurities are filtered out by the evaporation, and condensed water is stored and collected in glass-lined container. Distillation is one of the oldest methods of removing contaminants from water, but is seldom used for drinking water, as distilled water has little oxygen and tastes 'flat'\n\nCarbon Filtration\n\nCarbon absorption is one of the most widely used water filtration systems. There are two kinds of carbon filter systems – granulated carbon and solid carbon. A process of heat treating creates 'activated' carbon with microscopic pores and fissures that trap chemical and organic impurities in a process that mimics the filtering properties of the earth.\n\nThe effectiveness of a carbon filter system depends on many factors, including the type and amount of carbon used, the way the filter is designed and the length of time that the filter has been in use.\n\nAdvantages: Removes dissolved organic compounds and some chemicals effectively. Works well in conjunction with other filtration systems. Removes objectionable odors and flavors\n\nDisadvantages: Most will not remove heavy metals. Filters must be changed or filtering capacity will be compromised\n\nIon Exchange\n\nDescription Water is percolated through a layer of resin beads that have a sodium exchange coating. As the water passes through the layer, ions in the water are exchanged for ions on the beads. The method is often used to 'soften' water before other treatment methods by removing metals and minerals. It's particularly effective in conjunction with reverse osmosis and carbon filtration.\n\nDisadvantages: Does not effectively remove bacteria. Beads can trap bacteria and become breeding grounds\n\nMicro Filtration\n\nDescription Micro filtration removes sediments and suspended materials from water by passing it through a porous filtering material. They do not remove very fine particles or dissolved substances and are often used before or after other filtration systems.\n\nThere are three types of mechanical microporous filtration systems: depth, surface and screen filters. Depth filters are often used to pre-treat water by removing up to 98% of the suspended impurities in water that might foul or clog other parts of the filter system. Surface filters remove up to 99.9% of suspended contaminants and may be used as a pre-filter or a final clarifying filter. Screen filters are placed at the end of the filtration system to remove the last remaining traces of resin, carbon and microorganisms.\n\nRemoves: Sediment\n\nAdvantages: Remove all suspended impurities larger than pore size\n\nDisadvantages: Does not remove dissolved\n\nUltra Micro Filtration\n\nDescription Like Micro-filtration systems, the ultra filtration systems remove impurities from water by passing it through a 'screen'. The screen in this case is a semi-permeable membrane that effectively separates molecules in water, allowing certain molecules to pass through it while retaining others.\n\nRemoves: Sediments and extremely fine particles, microorganisms\n\nAdvantages: Highest quality water for lowest energy investment\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nReverse Osmosis\n\nDescription Reverse osmosis works on the same principle as the body's cells – by filtering water through a semi-permeable membrane placed between a concentrated and a dilute solution. The diagram at left should help explain the process.\n\nThe simplest explanation is this: When two solutions with differing concentrations are separated by a semi-permeable membrane, the solution with the higher concentration will infiltrate the solution with the lower concentration. That process may be reversed by applying pressure of some sort to the side that holds the more concentrated solution, forcing it through a membrane that will remove the impurities from the water.\n\nThe success of reverse osmosis is dependent on the quality of the permeable membrane. Those used in RO water filtration systems are capable of trapping salts, inorganic solutes and many organic compounds.\n\nReverse osmosis delivers high quality drinking and cooking water, but the volume of water needed to produce a usable amount makes it impractical to use for whole-house filtering. It's often combined with other types of water filtration for a complete water filtration solution.\n\nAdvantages: Removes nearly all contaminants of all types to some extent. Requires little maintenance\n\nDisadvantages: Requires large volumes of water – it may take as much as 90 gallons of water to recover 5 gallons of usable water. Flow rate is limited to a certain amount of gallons per day\n\nUltraviolet Radiation\n\nDescription Low level ultraviolet light kills bacterial and viral pathogens. The amount of radiation produced is negligible, and it leaves no trace.\n\nRemoves: Bacteria, Viruses\n\nAdvantages: Sanitizes water\n\nDisadvantages: Does not remove suspended particles or ions\n\nAs the chart above makes obvious, there is not a single water purification method that removes ALL contaminants from drinking and tap water. Most home purification systems will have a number of the above methods to filter out all possible contaminants before delivering fresh, good-tasting, safe water to the tap for cooking and drinking."

It signals what many Christians would call a \"rebirth.\" In some circles, this rite is performed by sprinkling a tiny amount of water on a baby's head. In other circles, people of all ages are dunked in water before a crowd of witnesses as a testimony that they have been reborn – called to experience a new kind of life. No matter how the baptismal ceremony is conducted, it always involves one thing: water.\n\nWater is essential to life. The average person cannot survive more than a few days without it. Water makes up 90 percent of the human body. More than two-thirds of the earth is covered by it. If baptism signals new life and water is life, it follows, then, that water is essential for baptism.\n\nBottled water is not exactly in the business of preserving life. Bottled water companies make millions of dollars packaging and selling a naturally-occurring resource that is otherwise, basically free. Yes, water is essential to baptism and to life, but for every bottle of water that's made, twice as much is used in the production process. Eighty percent of plastic bottles end up in landfills or oceans, polluting the environment. And contrary to popular belief, bottled water is no more pure than tap. Plastic bottles contain toxic chemicals that often leach into water.\n\nIt seems contradictory to perform a baptismal ceremony – a sign of new life – using a product that is anti-life in so many ways. What do you think?\n\nThankfully, the church recently acquired a water line. Attendance has improved since then. I must say, I'm not surprised."

These test results do not include any lead that may enter your plumbing system (like from lead solder, faucet parts, etc.).\n\nThere are many entry points for lead before it comes out of your kitchen tap. There can be lead in the ground water, lead contamination from your local municipal water supply (this is unusual), lead contamination from building water supply piping or fixtures, well contamination by lead from surface contamination due to lead paint chips, and lead contamination in well pumps or faucet parts. Also lead is a mineral found in soil, and that may also be a source of lead contamination.\n\nDepending on how long the water is next to lead in the water source piping, will determine the amount of actual lead to which the water is being eposed. So water that sits in a lead water entry main overnight has a fairly high lead content while water that enters a building after the lines have been flushed usually has a lower lead content.\n\nThe chemistry of the water and disinfectants added to that water can affect the corrosive level of the water. More corrosive or aggressive water picks up more of whatever with which it comes in contact.\n\nThe most common lead water testing that American Air Testing is requested to perform is from the faucet. In older urban homes and office buildings it is very common to find lead above threshold limits in drinking water, unless a filtration system is used. Lead solder was, and remains, a common solder for plumbers to use.\n\nLead, above threshold limits, in drinking water is a particular hazard to children. If you have additional concerns for your children, please discuss this issue with your pediatrician or other health care professional.\n\nThere is significant additional information on the CDC's website regarding health and children."

The stored water could accumulate not only body oils and debris but also disease causing organisms like bacteria and virus. Left untreated, the water will soon become unfit for relaxing in but also unpleasant to look at.\n\nThe standard treatment to keep the water in good condition is to use chlorine and bromine for disinfectation and also chemicals that clears the water. Chemicals typically leave a chemical smell and can also cause skin and eye irritation. It is in this context that ozone proves a superior solution.\n\nOzone is active oxygen with three atoms (as against two atoms in Oxygen proper). It is created in nature by the action of ultraviolet rays from the sun or corona discharges during a lightning storm on Oxygen. Ozonators copy this natural process and create Ozone using UV light or corona discharges.\n\nOzone is a natural purifier with the highest safe oxidation power. It destroys bacteria, viruses, mold and mildew, breaks up body oils and other contaminants, and also eliminates unpleasant smells. It keeps the water sparkling and clean, and can leave a clean and fresh scent.\n\nOzone does not irritate skin and eyes, nor leave chemical by-products. It has no effect on hair or clothes and will not affect their color. While the use of chlorine or bromine cannot be completely eliminated, ozone does most of the purification and only low quantities of chlorine or bromine needs to be used when ozone is injected into the water.\n\nThe water in the hot tub is usually drained and replenished three or four times a year. This is a laborious exercise that hot tub users typically do not enjoy. With Ozone, the exercise need be done every two years.\n\nWith all these benefits, Ozonators that generate and inject Ozone into the hot tub water is coming into increasing use."

Then gas and water can be treated separately, which simplifies the equipment and processes needed for the\nfollowing steps.\n\n2.\n\nOnce the gas is removed the water is filtered like coffee in a coffee filter. All particles with a diameter larger than 0.5 micron are trapped in the filter, like the\ngrinded coffee in the coffee filter. (For comparison: the average thickness of a human hair is about 10 micron.)\n\n3.\n\nAfter this step the water is forced across a surface containing sorbent and ion exchange material. In this step most of the\ncontaminants are removed from the water.\n\n4.\n\nThen, there are only some tiny molecules left that need to be removed before the astronauts can re-use the water. These molecules are removed by heating the water\nto more than 100ºC and then flown across a catalyst.\n\nIf there are still particles left after having been through this filtering process, the water goes through it again after\ncooling down. When the water gets out of the water processor on board the ISS, it is cleaner than the water most of us drink\non Earth!\n\nThe sorbent material takes in (absorbs) the molecules we want to remove (it works like a sponge).\n\nIon exchange material attracts unwanted ions (in the same way a magnet attracts metal) and releases the wanted ions.\n\nA catalyst is a chemical that promotes certain chemical reactions in a way so that less energy is needed to gain the wanted\nreaction.\n\nIf a catalyst is present, it can split a chemical reaction into two partial reactions that will need lower activation energy.\nIn other occasions reactions occur only if a catalyst is present. A common example of this is the catalyst in every modern\ncar. It reduces the amount of exhaust gases by breaking the fuel leftovers down to mostly water and carbon dioxide."

      "text": "The government is poised to reignite one of the most vexed medical issues of the past 50 years. Early next month, parliament will debate clauses of the water bill which will give indemnity against legal action to water companies that add fluoride to their supplies, paving the way for the extension of fluoridation schemes throughout this country.\n\nFluoridation is the addition of silicofluorides (hexafluorosilicic acid or, less commonly, sodium hexafluorosilicate) at the level of one part per million to public water supplies. The adversaries could not be more starkly opposed. Proponents believe that fluoridation brings about a reduction of caries in children's teeth, and that this is especially beneficial for children in socially deprived areas. They insist that there are no detrimental public health consequences, whether short- or long-term. Opponents argue that silicofluorides are a class 2 poison under the Poisons Act, have serious adverse health effects, and in any case do nothing to benefit children's teeth.\n\nFluoridation schemes were first introduced in the United States in 1946. Since the late 1960s, about 10% of the UK population has received fluoridated water supplies – primarily, those in areas served by the Severn Trent, Northumbrian and Anglian water\ncompanies. During the postwar decades, the benefits of fluoride were held to be incontestable as dental health rapidly improved. However, with better diet and treatment, it was improving across the western world. As far back as 1986, Nature published an article showing that rates of tooth decay were coming down as quickly in unfluoridated communities as in fluoridated ones.\n\nMore recent studies published in 2000-01 of communities in Finland, Cuba, Canada and east Germany, which abandoned fluoridation, found that rates of dental decay did not rise (and, indeed, continued to decline) afterwards. The city of Basle in Switzerland recently stopped fluoridation, partly because there was no evidence that rates of tooth decay were lower there than in non-fluoridated Swiss cities. In Western Europe, only England, Ireland and a tiny part of Spain retain fluoridation programmes.\n\nIn December 2002, four members of the government's last major study of the effects of water fluoridation (the York review, published September 2000) – Professor Jos Kleijnen and Professor Trevor Sheldon of York University, Professor George Davey-Smith of Bristol University and Sir Iain Chalmers of the Cochrane Centre – wrote to Hazel Blears, the public health minister, about the effectiveness of fluoridation in reducing caries: \"We could discover no reliable, good quality evidence in the fluoridation literature worldwide. What we found suggested that fluoridation was likely to have a beneficial effect, but in fact the range could be anywhere from a substantial benefit to a slight disbenefit to children's teeth.\"\n\nThe prime area of international controversy surrounds fluoride's possible adverse health effects. According to the British Fluoridation Society, one of the ways in which fluoride is supposed to work is by \"inhibiting the function of enzymes\" which cause the build-up of acid that leads to tooth decay.\n\nHowever, it seems scientifically illogical that fluoride would inhibit some enzymes but not others. Moreover, it is known that fluoride accumulates in calcifying tissue, such as teeth and bones. The pineal gland in the brain (where seratonin and melatonin are produced) is a calcifying tissue. Research by Dr Jennifer Luke established that fluoride accumulated to high levels in the pineal gland. In animal studies, she showed that this led to the reduced production of melatonin (because the fluoride inhibited the enzymes needed to produce it), and that, in turn, caused the earlier onset of puberty. This work dovetailed with studies which have shown that girls in the US – the world's most heavily fluoridated country – are reaching puberty earlier and earlier.\n\nThere are also concerns about fluoride's effect on the thyroid gland. The thyroid regulates body temperature and energy levels. It needs iodine to function properly, yet iodine will be displaced by fluorides. Hypothyroidism (an under-active thyroid) is a significant and growing problem in the US.\n\nEarlier this month, Sam Epstein, the chairman of the Cancer Prevention Coalition and professor emeritus of environmental and occupational medicine at the University of Illinois, pointed to the epidemiological studies linking fluoride and bone cancer, and\nsaid that \"the imposition of fluoridation on the UK public [would] present a significant public health hazard\".\n\nOther studies have linked fluoride with higher incidences of miscarriages and Down's syndrome births, and decreased IQ levels.\n\nThose already affected by dietary deficiencies, who are low in calcium, magnesium and essential nutrients – in other words the poor and those in ill-health – will be more vulnerable to fluoride toxicity. For this reason, opponents of fluoridation argue that it should certainly not be considered in inner-city areas.\n\nPerhaps the main finding to emerge from the York review was the weakness of the research base: \"Little high quality research has been undertaken in the area of fluoride and health.\" One would have expected the government to remedy this before legislating to put fluoride into the country's public water supplies.\n\n· Bob Woffinden is a journalist specialising in legal and environmental issues"

More than half of these chemicals aren't subject to government health and safety recommendations and can legally be present in any amount.\n\nSo how clean is the tap water where you live? Well, it depends. Water quality can vary from state to state-and even from city to city.

Ideally cold water temperatures should be kept below 20°C and hot water temperatures shouldn't drop below 45°C at any point in the system. It is also important to avoid low oxygen level areas, such as deadlegs and low flow areas, in order to maintain a well balanced water hygiene regime.\n\nIn the majority of buildings optimum water temperatures cannot be achieved – cold water cannot be kept cold enough and hot water cannot be circulated and maintained hot enough (without the risk of scalding) to prevent opportunist pathogens from proliferating the system.\n\nLegionella and other water borne pathogens have found a particular ecological niche in engineered water systems. The systems that are most at risk include; cooling towers, showers, taps, wash basins, horticultural misting systems, dental equipment, spa baths and vehicle washes, to quote just a few.\n\nOverwhelming evidence denotes a strong requirement for a regime tailored to the specific needs of building services.\n\nThe recommended temperature for effective Legionella control is 60°C. This presents a scalding hazard to users. Constant dosing of chlorine dioxide allows the temperature of the hot water supply to be lowered; removing the potential for scalding and offering SIGNIFICANT savings from the cost of heating the water.\n\nConventional biocides, such as chlorine, are distributed around a water system by the flow of the water. When a water outlet is left unused for long periods, no water flows through the associated piping. This means that micro-organisms are left free to proliferate. When the outlet is eventually used, the user receives a dose of infected water. These circumstances often lead to the development of Legionnaires disease.\n\nChlorine dioxide has been described as the \"ideal biocide\". It is effective against pathogenic species over a wide range of temperature and pH. It also acts as a true gas in solution. This means that it can move against the current in a water system and into low flow areas such as deadlegs.\n\nCatalytic Chlorine Dioxide generation provides all the benefits of traditional chlorine dioxide generation, without the downsides. Ultra-pure chlorine dioxide is produced with zero residual chlorite. This can be simply and effectively delivered anywhere within water systems.\n\nAs with all water treatment regimes, a good monitoring programme is required. The Clearwater Total Management Package provides a comprehensive regime including regular reviews to ensure compliance with statutory requirements.\n\nCatalytic Chlorine Dioxide generation produces zero residual chlorite.

      "text": "am looking for documentation from the resin manufacturers. Purolite, Sybron, etc, Ohio Pure Water is a great group, but it is also nothing more than an internet company that has other companies drop ship product for them.\n\nIf the documentation exists, great, but regardless, GE, Culligan, Rayne, Puronics, Seimens, and virtually all other companies that do portable exchange, which is nothing more than regenerating the resin off site, all try to run 30 day routes. That being said, there are also many protocols for regeneration plants, including water reuse, brine reclamation, etc, so it is not a true apple to apples comparison.\n\nMy real question is, assuming a decent iron free water supply, what is going to happen if the resin does not regenerate every 14 days or more? And using my earlier example, what is the proper way around the massive salt waste that would occur if you forced a system to regenerate every 14 days if it only needs to regenerate every 30?\n\nWith over 25 years of commercial, industrial, and residential experience, dealing with water and systems from all over the world, I will give you the simple answer. Nothing. It is fine to regenerate less frequently than every 14 days. The original 14 day idea is an old idea, written many years ago that has been cut and pasted for decades into companies literature. I have some great old literature that goes over the proper method of installing a softener, basically mandating that toilets must be bypassed. That old idea was finally abandoned a little over 20 years ago, although it still pops up from time to time. Most internet websites simply copy other websites literature, change a few words and voila, they are a \"knowledgable\" water treatment company. Sort of the same way some people try to take credit for the sodium in water to white bread analogy, or a can of baked beans. I heard those my first day of training, and to this day, people use those examples like it were their own.\n\nI have searched for a long tim e for the resin manufacturers to make any recommendations on regeneration frequency. It does exist on certain other medias, KDF, Pyrolox, Filox, Birm, etc, but resin, and most other medias do not. They have pages of information on regeneration capacities, flow rates, pressure curves, temperature ratings, pH ranges, freeboards, expansion rates, regenerant capacities based on regenerant, etc.\n\nAll that being said, I think what is missing in this conversation is some guidelines. If you have water with turbidity issues, regenration frequency will be more important. Iron in the water... salt quantity and regeneration frequency are important, no water flow at all, (vacation home), regenerations should be done to prevent the stagnent water issues. For my vacation home, I have it set to regenerate every 14 days, but I change the salt setting to almost nothing unless it is occupied. A good clean water supply, why would frequent regeneration be necessary? What would happen if you went past 14 days?\n\nThis idea is similar to the flow controls on RO debate. The old idea of a 4 or 5 to 1 ratio is still practiced, even though membranes now cost 1/5 of what they used too. Is the extra water waste worth trying to eek out another 6 months from a membrane? Your membrane will last 4 years instead of 4-1/2. If you have a softener, is it really necessary to have that bad of a ratio. Sorry, going off into a different area but I think the ideas from this industry that are still hanging in there from 25 years ago need to be addressed.\n\n25 years ago, meters were a \"neat but expensive\" item, and were rarely used, and the salt settings were 10-15 pounds per cu. ft. Now we are pushing 3-8 pounds of salt per cu. ft., and very few companies would even consider not using a meter, and in many states, it is not even legal to install a residential timeclock softener. Reputable distributors wont even sell single tank large commercial systems if they know that is improperly designed and highly wasteful in order to save a few dollars up front.\n\nThe most recent article from Purolite written over a decade ago I have read that discussed resin regeneration frequency went both ways on the idea. Frequent regeneration leads to shorter resin life due to osmotic shock, lowering salt amounts and not allowing the resin to become completely depleted could protect the resin from the damaging affects of this problem, later in the same article it recommends increasing the regeneration frequency if fouling is a problem, iron, sediment etc.\nThe article never did set what the frequency should be."

If there are not properly treated before being discharged into waterways, serious pollution is the result.\n\nWater pollution also occurs when rainwater runoff from urban and industrial and agricultural land and mining operation makes its way back to receiving waters (river, lake or ocean) and into the ground.\n\nThere are a few different types of water pollution. Microbiological water pollution happens when disease causing (pathogenic) microorganisms like bacteria, viruses or protozoa can cause swimmers to get sick. Chemicals that are disposed by factories can also pollute the environment. These chemicals can cause acid rain. Aquatic life may also consume the chemicals which might kill them or else be passed up the food chain.\n\nOxygen depleting substances which may be present in polluted water is another problem. When oxygen depleting substances are present in water, the amount of oxygen in the water will decrease until a point where there is not enough oxygen for aquatic..."

      "text": "Legionella Testing\n\nLegionella is a bacterium species that are the causative agent of the human Legionnaires' disease and the lesser form, Pontiac fever. Legionella transmission is via aerosols — the inhalation of mist droplets containing the bacteria. Common sources include cooling towers, swimming pools, domestic hot-water systems, fountains, and similar disseminators that tap into a public water supply.\n\nThe simple truth is that Legionella and other harmful bacteria can thrive in your facility's water system if left untreated. And a bacterial outbreak like Legionnaires' disease can be devastating.\n\nDisease from Legionella tends to lead to harmful symptoms, especially in those with a compromised immune system and the elderly. Once inside a host, incubation may take up to two weeks. Initial symptoms are flu-like, including fever, chills, and dry cough. Advanced stages of the disease cause problems with the gastrointestinal tract and the nervous system and lead to diarrhea and nausea. Other advanced symptoms of pneumonia may also present.\n\n\"In the United States alone, Legionnaires' Disease affects between 8,000 to 18,000 individuals every year.\"\n\nTesting is the First Step in Prevention\n\nLiquitech can help you protect your facility's water system from Legionella and other harmful pathogens. We will develop a comprehensive plan to keep your water, and therefore your cllients, employees, and guests, safe.\n\nIt all begins with testing your water to determine the presence of bacteria in the system as well as identifying future risks. We will help facilitate the testing of your water so that we can design a safe, effective water disinfection and prevention system to meet your specific needs.\n\nContact us today to learn how Liquitech can help in the testing and treatment of your water system."

Russian cosmonauts have been collecting and recycling moisture out of cabin air systems since the Salyut 1 and Mir space stations, which launched in 1971 and 1986, respectively. The Russians also did some work developing electrolyzers that can convert water, via electrolysis, into gaseous hydrogen and oxygen. \"They've incorporated these technologies into their side of the [International] Space Station,\" he says.\n\nWhile none of this conjures up thirst-quenching images of cold, clear water flowing down a mountain stream, NASA did conduct some blind taste tests that compared the recycled drinking water with plain tap water as well as with tap water that had iodine added to it. On a scale of one to nine, none of the waters scored higher than five. The most typical reaction after drinking the recycled water was to notice the taste of the iodine. The version of the water-recovery system that will be installed on the ISS next year will feature an added step that scrubs the iodine out of the finished product.\n\nIn the end, the goal is to simulate the way nature recycles urine and other human by-products. \"The difference is,\" Roman says, \"in a station on the moon, you'll know whose urine you're drinking"

A few drops of bleach kill any bacteria that may be in the water, and the filters remove dirt particles and parasites.\n\nThe villagers don't have filters, but they do add bleach directly to the well from time to time. While their water may appear clean, it often contains parasites that can cause stomach problems and diarrhea.\n\nWell water is cleaner than the tap water in the cities of Senegal. If a well is not providing fresh or clean water, a new well is dug. Old wells may be deepened if there is not enough water, or if there is too much sediment in the well.\n\nby Catherine Guillard, Samba Diarry, Senegal\n\nMy drinking water is not clean. I have to filter and then chlorinate the water before I can drink it. My neighbors just drink the well water straight, which works fine most of the time, but can cause problems, such as outbreaks of diarrhea. Although some households in the community are starting to chlorinate the water, this is a relatively new concept. It is also a difficult one to explain, because there is no word for \"germ\" in Pulaar and you can't exactly show germs to people to prove that they exist. Still, people now see the connection between stomach pains and unclean water, and this convinces them that they should chlorinate.\n\nby Enid Abrahami, Missirah Tabadian, Senegal\n\nJust as water is a main source of life, it is also a common cause of illness and death. Our water is often infested with parasites, amoebas, and bacteria. Rarely do villagers filter their water. Only a select few purify their water with bleach. Hence, severe cases of dysentery and diarrhea occur frequently. Due to the lack of money and education, all too often the sick are not taken to the health center for treatment. And in many cases, this results in death.\n\nI have seen the tragedy with my own eyes. Eight children from my village between the ages of one and five died from dysentery within the span of three weeks—all from drinking unclean water. I tried to help. I visited the families, urged them to go to the health post, and made Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT) formula for them (8 spoonfuls of sugar, 2 pinches of salt, and 2 liters of water). But ultimately there was nothing I could do. I will always remember them.\n\nby Kathleen Rucker, Louga, Senegal\n\nFamilies store drinking water in large clay pots that keep the water cool and fresh. Most families clean these pots regularly. Fresh water is always available from the community running water faucet. Each family replenishes their water supply with fresh water every morning. Because I am not accustomed to the bacteria found in our water supply—as the villagers who have lived here their whole lives are—I filter my water through a ceramic filter. This method removes particles and certain bacteria from the water. Then I add a couple of drops of bleach to kill any other bacteria, giardia, or amoebas.\n\n.\n\nby Jamie Schehl, Sokone, Senegal\n\nOur drinking water appears fresh because it is clear and cool. But I wouldn't describe it as clean. Dead frogs are often seen floating in the water. Even worse, during the rainy season, I have seen as many as three different kinds of worms in the water. I was unable to tell whether they were parasites or larvae, but there were a lot of them! My host family does not filter, boil, or bleach their water. As a result, they often have diarrhea."

Have you ever considered how many pounds of cleaning powders and soaps you have flushed or drained from your house alone?\n\nBecause the Hydrologic Cycle cannot be stopped, water that should be clean and cleanse the air and ground is now polluted and contaminates our natural resources.\n\nOur water supplies are contaminated, as well as the water supply of plants, and of the animals which eat these plants. Not only are you drinking these toxins in your water, but you are eating plants grown on polluted water, and eating animals that ingest these plants that also drink the polluted water themselves.

After more than a year of study and public testimony, the group of local scientists and health care professionals said fluoride should no longer be added to the public water supply.\n\nEliminating the added fluoride should reduce the risk of fluorosis, a type of tooth discoloration, the group said.\n\nThe city began adding fluoride to the water in 1959, part of a national movement designed to fight tooth decay. Removing the added chemical could have a small effect upon dental health, but what that might be is unpredictable, the task force said.\n\nThe task force said removing fluoride would end ethical concerns raised by the addition of the chemical to local water.\n\nThe group said its conclusion runs counter to the recommendations of the American Dental Association, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Alaska Department of Public Health.\n\nThe chemical might be useful in some communities, the group said. However, \"the majority of members are not convinced that it is necessary in Fairbanks because of the fluoride content of the city's ground water and the alternate sources of fluoride available in the community,\" the task force said.\n\nRecently in Georgia, former U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young and Gerald Durley, pastor of Atlanta's Providence Baptist Church, called for an end to that state's mandatory fluoridation law. Durley said the chemical could disproportionately harm black Americans because they have higher rates of kidney disease and diabetes, maladies that a National Academy of Sciences report said make people more susceptible to fluoride-related problems. Young also said poor families are less able to obtain unfluoridated water to mix with baby formula. Such infants have a higher rate of fluorosis, a concern cited by the Fairbanks task force as well.\n\nThe local task force also recommended the Fairbanks North Star Borough government be involved in any decision-making process because about 25 percent of people on the Golden Heart Utilities water system live outside city limits.\n\nCleworth said earlier this month he had notified borough officials of his intent to introduce the ordinance\n\nThe comment has been submitted for review.

      "text": "Olympia's New Water Source\n\nThe City of Olympia is committed to providing safe and reliable drinking water to its customers — now and into the future. In order to meet this commitment, the City is actively developing a new water source that will replace McAllister Springs as the City's primary supply of drinking water. The new water source, named the McAllister Wellfield, will be significantly more protected, more productive, and will meet water supply needs for generations.\n\nThe City has relied on McAllister Springs for more than 60 years. Located at the headwaters of McAllister Creek, McAllister Springs, while continually providing high-quality water, is vulnerable to potential contamination, and will require extensive treatment if it is not retired within the next few years.\n\nThe City began working on its plan to address this situation in the 1990s and, after extensive research, identified and purchased the McAllister Wellfield site which is located a little less than a mile southeast of the springs. Studies of the site showed that the wellfield site taps a large sustainable aquifer with high quality water. With the purchase of the site, as well as 100 acres of adjacent development rights, the City began the long-term process of developing the wellfield into its primary source of drinking water.\n\nThis project consists of constructing and testing a series of wells, installing associated pumping equipment, chlorination, motor control equipment, and a generator, all housed in buildings on the 20-acre McAllister Wellfield site.\n\nSchedule: Fall 2013 - Summer 2014\n\nCost: $6.6 Million\n\nFunding: Drinking Water Utility, largely with low-interest loans from the Washington Drinking Water State Revolving Fund.\n\nThis project will construct a Corrosion Control Facility which uses aeration (a non-chemical treatment approach using blown air) to raise the pH of water and reduce potential pipe corrosion. Corrosion of household piping can cause lead and copper to leach into the water. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act requires the City to take action to raise the system pH to an optimum level to prevent pipe corrosion.\n\nSchedule: Fall 2013 - Summer 2014\n\nCost: $3.4 Million\n\nFunding: Drinking Water Utility Capital Fund\n\nA Historic Partnership\n\nWater is a vital, shared resource. For years, the City has been working closely with other agencies and municipalities to plan for development of the McAllister Wellfield. Through these efforts, the City and the Nisqually Indian Tribe, located northwest of the wellfield site, were able to identify not only a shared need but, more importantly, a shared solution.\n\nIn May 2008, they entered into a historic agreement - the first such agreement between a tribe and a municipality in the country - to jointly develop a new regional water source at McAllister Wellfield. Once the project is complete and operational, the wellfield will provide a secure supply of water for both communities for generations to come.\n\nThe Nisqually Indian Tribe currently relies on shallow, low-producing wells next to the Nisqually River, and has for years been working to identify and secure a long-term, sustainable water source for its growing community.\n\nTransfer of Water Rights\n\nOn January 3, 2012, after working together for many years to gather data, refine computer models and predict potential impacts, the Department of Ecology presented the Olympia City Council with the final approval for transferring water rights to the new wellfield. This approval allows the City and Tribe to to move forward with development of the McAllister Wellfield.\n\nEnvironmental Benefits\n\nThe City and Tribe have jointly developed the McAllister Wellfield Mitigation Plan that identifies the results of extensive studies, as well as mitigation actions. Under the Department of Ecology's final approval, the City and Tribe are required to complete the mitigation plan in order to address any predicted impacts of pumping at McAllister Wellfield.\n\nThese mitigation actions include habitat restoration, enhancing stream flows with reclaimed water, and acquiring and retiring water rights. These actions will occur in the Nisqually, Deschutes, and Woodland Creek basins as well as at Lake St. Clair. Both the City and the Tribe, along with other regional partners, are committed to sustainability and resource stewardship that will benefit the entire region for many years to come.

The hypothesis that potable water was the source for the outbreak was further supported by isolation of Legionella pneumophila (the agent of legionnaires' disease) from the hospital water supply, observation that a sudden upsurge had occurred in the number of cases following a peculiar manipulation of the hospital water system, and documentation of a 30-fold increase in concentration of organisms in the water when this manipulation was artificially recreated. Thus, potable water may be an important source of epidemic legionnaires' disease and continuous hyperchlorination a method of"

Your body smells after bathing in it. The clothes smell after being washed in it,\" said Steven McClain, a Franklin resident.\n\nOn Monday, Franklin city leaders held an information session with residents, to hear their concerns. Officials said when that when temperatures rise, it causes a chemical reaction that increases in blue-green algae blooms in the water, causing the water to stink. They say, though it's not pleasant to smell, it's completely safe to drink.\n\n\"The water is safe to drink,\" said Eric Stucky, Franklin City Administrator.\n\nFranklin gets its water supply from the Harpeth River.\n\nOne resident at the meeting said the water smelled so bad their dog wouldn't drink it.\n\nLast year Franklin endured the same problem. Last July, a half dozen Franklin city leaders gathered around a table and several computers to answer questions about foul-tasting water.

Run your water to flush out lead.\n\nRun water for 30 seconds to 2 minutes or until it becomes cold or reaches a steady temperature before using it for drinking or cooking, if it hasn't been used for several hours. This flushes lead-containing water from the pipes.Flushing usually uses less than one or two gallons of water and costs less than 30 cents per month.\n\n2.Use cold water for cooking and preparing baby formula.\n\nDo not cook with or drink water from the hot water tap; lead dissolves more easily into hot water. Do not use water from the hot water tap to make baby formula.\n\n3. Do not boil water to remove lead.\n\nBoiling water will not reduce lead.\n\n4. Look for alternative sources or treatment of water.\n\nYou may want to consider purchasing bottled water or a water filter. Read the package to be sure the filter is approved to reduce lead or contact NSF International at 800-NSF-8010 or  for information on performance standards for water filters. Be sure to maintain and replace a filter device in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions to protect water quality.\n\n5. Test your water for lead.\n\nCall PVWC at 973-340-4300 to find out how to get your water tested for lead and for a list of local laboratories that have been certified for testing water quality. The following is a list of some State approved laboratories in your area that you can call to have your water tested for lead:\n\nContact your local health department or healthcare provider to find out how you can get your child tested for lead if you are concerned about exposure.\n\n7. Identify if your plumbing fixtures contain lead.\n\nNew brass faucets, fittings, and valves, including those advertised as \"lead-free,\" may contribute lead to drinking water. The law currently allows end-use brass fixtures, such as faucets, with up to 8% lead to be labeled as \"lead-free.\" Visit the National Sanitation Foundation Web site at  to learn more about lead-containing plumbing fixtures.\n\nHere is the full notice.

      "text": "Chemicals on demand\n\nTransporting and storing disinfectants and biocides can be dangerous and expensive – the best way to avoid this, says Mel Berman, is to make them at the point of use. Here we learn how this is now a viable option due to new power supplies\n\nMany municipal water, food processing, and wastewater treatment plants are switching over from the use of chlorine disinfectants and biocides to safer and more environmentally friendly point-of-use and on-demand generated chemicals. The primary reasons for this change are that conventional chlorine agents require transport by tankers on accident-prone highways or railroads, ever increasing safety and environmental regulations regarding toxic gases and chemical spills, and the required bulk storage of these hazardous materials at the sites where they are used. Safer and in many cases more effective chemicals have been developed that can replace chlorine. For example, after many trial and error attempts to find a way to effectively control Legionnaires' disease, it was found that chlorine dioxide (CIO2) was one the few chemical agents that could consistently and safely disinfect Legionella bacteria. Add to this the ability to manufacture these safer chemicals at the locations that use them, and only when needed, and the advantages in total become obvious.\n\nTwo popular substitute chemicals for chlorine are chlorine dioxide (CIO2) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCI) both of which can be manufactured via mini-plants (generators) that are delivered to the end users' site as a complete package and provide the disinfectants on-demand and as needed. In many cases, these mini-plants operate automatically and can be employed in unmanned locations such as municipal water treatment sites.\n\nThese electrochemical generators use the process of electrolysis as the basis for the production of these disinfecting and biocide chemicals. Recalling our science classes, electrolysis is a common method of separating bonded elements and compounds by passing an electric current through them. It involves applying a voltage between two electrodes (anode and cathode) which are submerged in a conductive solution (electrolyte). When a voltage is applied to the electrodes, electric current flows and in turn breaks down the molecules within the solution into its components (Figure 1).\n\nInstead of a static vessel as shown in Figure 1, modern electrochemical generators pump the electrolyte solution continuously through one or more tubes that have the electrodes mounted within them. As the electrolytic solution flows through these tubes (electrolytic cells), the electrolysis process continuously separates the molecular components. In some instances, the solution is run through the dual-electrode electrolytic cells more than once to further refine and separate the resulting chemicals (Figure 2). (Note: Batteries operate by a reverse process from electrolysis; they generate electricity by means of galvanic or voltaic cells that contain anode and cathode electrodes that are in contact with an electrolyte solution or gel.)\n\nHistorically, the power supplies that provide the driving force for electrochemical generators have evolved from basic transformer and diode rectifiers, to transformer and SCR (silicon-controlled-rectifier) power sources, to modern and more sophisticated power sources. The development of the switchmode power supply greatly reduced the size and substantially improved the efficiency of these power sources. In addition, switchmode power supplies have the ability to provide electronic signals for status information (volts, amps, temperature, etc.), remote control, and communications to and from a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) or a local/remote computerised controller.\n\nThe vast majority of switchmode power supplies are designed to operate as regulated voltage power sources. These supplies regulate the output voltage very precisely regardless of the amount of current drawn from the supply, up to its design limit. For example, a 1500-watt supply can provide a 12-volts output while providing from 0 to 125 amperes of current. Once the maximum current of 125-amps is reached, the supply is designed to go into a current-limit mode, where the output voltage is automatically reduced or the supply shuts down.\n\nIt has been found that in many electrochemical processes, including the production of disinfecting agents, that standard voltage-regulated power supplies do not always provide the ideal power profile for these processes. In fact, in many instances, the power supplies are being forced to operate at a fixed voltage and at their maximum current rating. If these operating conditions are maintained for long periods of time, the supply will internally heat-up and prematurely fail, thus shutting down the production of the disinfecting agents.\n\nWhy does this happen and how can it be avoided? As described above, during the electrochemical process, in order to keep up with the continuous electrolysis process with constantly flowing electrolyte solutions, the power supply must provide a high enough voltage to overcome the impedance between the two electrodes and the solution surrounding them, and, more importantly, to provide a high enough current density (amperes) to effectively separate the molecules during the short time (determined by the flow rate) that the solution comes in contact with the electrodes. By using a switchmode power supply that is designed to operate in a \"constant-current\" mode (instead of constant-voltage, as is the norm) the electrochemical process has been found to produce chemicals much faster, with consistent high quality, without forcing the power supply into an overload state.\n\nThere are a number of ways of providing current-mode power supplies for enhanced electrochemical applications. One method is to use programmable power supplies. These supplies are designed to be manually or remotely programmed to operate in a voltage-mode and/or a current mode, at a specific voltage and current range, along with other specified parameters. As an added bonus these supplies usually include a serial digital communications port that allows it \"talk\" to local or remote computer controllers. Additionally, these supplies can be connected in parallel to the electrodes, or to groups of electrodes, when an electrochemical process requires more current than one supply can provide. For example, Lambda Americas' model ZUP10-80/U programmable power supplies is adjustable from 0 to 10-volts with 0 to 80-amps (800 watts total). This type of supply is being used in its \"constant-current\" mode to efficiently produce disinfectant and biocide chemicals at many unmanned and non-air-conditioned municipal water treatment sites. In some applications, two or more ZUP supplies are connected in parallel to provide the necessary amount of current for the electrochemical process.\n\nAnother method of providing a \"constant-current\" mode power supply is to modify the design of a voltage regulated supply. This can be done by adding circuits that monitor the supply's output current to prevent an overload, yet maintain a \"constant-current\" profile from the supply. For example, Lambda Americas has produced modified versions its HWS-CC 1500-watt supply to do exactly this. In electrochemical applications that produce disinfectant and biocide chemicals, a number of these \"current-mode\" supplies are connected to different sets of electrodes, and/or, in parallel, to support different output current requirements for various models of electrochemical generators. Obviously, generators that produce higher output rates of chemicals require higher current levels.\n\nThis paper has focused on the techniques and benefits related to advanced switchmode power supplies for mini-electrochemical generators (self-contained plants) that produce disinfecting and biocide chemicals on-site. It should be noted that electrolysis processes are used extensively in many other chemical and industrial areas, some of which are listed below.\n\n• Production of aluminum, copper, sodium • Anodising • Production of hydrogen (e.g., for the cars and fuel cells of the future) • Electroplating and polishing • Factory and power plant cooling towers – recirculating water treatments\n\nMany of these electrochemical processes require power levels that far exceed the range of the switchmode power supplies described above. These high-power rectifier systems, ranging from 300 kilowatts to 10 megawatts, are very specialised, large, heavy and are usually comprised of huge transformers, rectifiers, thyristors, SCRs, capacitors, regulating controllers and water cooling systems. Some of these high-power sources are as large as a typical kitchen or even a house. There is no doubt that as technologies advance these huge power sources will see reductions in size and improvements in efficiencies.\n\nIn summary, the application of modern switchmode power supplies operating in a \"constant-current\" mode has been shown to provide significant improvements in electrochemical self contained mini-plant generators that are used to produce disinfecting and biocide chemicals. These benefits include:\n\n• Improved current-density control for consistent electrolysis • Enhanced quality of the resulting chemicals • Higher efficiencies and improved regulation of the power sources • Reduced space and weight • Power Supplies meet international Safety and Power Factor Correction (PFC) standards • Availability of digital communications, remote control and status signals • Substantial reduction of downtime"

      "text": "Sources of fluoride in drinking water\n\nFluoride, a negatively charged ion (anionic) form of the halide element fluorine, is the 17th most abundant element in the Earth's crust. This stable form of fluorine binds with the positively charged calcium ion (cation) to form hard minerals resistant to weathering; such fluorapatite makes teeth and bones stronger and less likely to break. Most calcium and fluoride-based minerals are insoluble in water. (They don't dissolve in water.) Thus, naturally occurring concentrations of fluoride in water are typically less than 1 mg/L (part per million). However, hot spring waters with alkaline pH and low-dissolved calcium have exhibited concentrations as high as 32 mg/L. Most surface waters that range from mildly alkaline to acidic pH values usually have enough calcium to keep free fluoride concentrations in check. It is unusual, therefore, to find fluoride concentrations in rivers or oceans above 1 mg/L. Volcanic rock, ash, and ash interbedded in sedimentary rock, account for the most prevalent sources of fluoride in groundwater. An unusual source of fluoride in groundwater was reported in a coastal aquifer in South Carolina where fossil shark's teeth were dissolving within the aquifer, releasing fluoride to the groundwater.\n\nThe levels of fluoride commonly found in drinking water cannot be detected by taste, sight or smell. Testing is the only way to determine the fluoride concentration.\n\nPotential health effects of fluoride in drinking water\n\nAs with many substances, potential health effects are directly related to the concentration present. The U.S. Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Dental Association recommend an optimum level of fluoride in drinking water of 1.0 mg/l to ensure potential benefits while minimizing or eliminating potential risks.\n\nAtFluIngesting excessive quantities of fluoride can result in acute toxicity. Consuming 300 to 750 milligrams (depending on body weight) in a single dose can produce nausea or vomitingTesting for fluoride in drinking water\n\nFluoride guidelines for dental health benefits were established by the U.S. Public Health Service in the 1960s. The recommended level of fluoride in drinking water for dental benefits is 0.7 to 1.2 mg/l.\n\nThe quality of water supplied by public water systems is regulated by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. EPA standards restrict the total amount of a substance allowed in drinking water and are designed to prevent undesirable effects that could result from exposure to a substance at concentrations above those allowed. Drinking water standards fall into two categories: secondary standards and primary standards. Secondary standards are based on aesthetic factors such as taste, odor, color, corrosivity, foaming and staining properties of water that may affect water's suitability for drinking and other domestic uses. Primary standards are based on health considerations and are designed to protect human health.\n\nThe EPA established a recommended secondary standard and an enforceable primary standard for fluoride in 1986. The Secondary Maximum Contaminant Level (SMCL) for fluoride is 2.0 mg/l, which is equal to 2.0 parts per million (ppm). Water with a fluoride concentration at or below 2.0 mg/l does not present a health risk and should not cause appreciable fluorosis. The Primary Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for fluoride in drinking water is 4.0 mg/l, which is equivalent to 4.0 ppm. Daily consumption of water with a fluoride concentration at 4.0 mg/l was not believed to present a health risk based on best available science at the time of the MCL enactment. A National Research Council report (2006) concluded that exposure at the current MCL puts children at risk for developing severe fluorosis that may compromise tooth function, and could put adults at increased risk of bone fracture, as bones can become brittle due to excessive levels of fluoride.\n\nAll water sources contain some naturally occurring fluoride. If users want to know the concentration of naturally occurring fluoride in a private water supply, they will need to have the water tested by a state-certified laboratory.\n\nOptions for fluoride in drinking water\n\nAdding fluoride to water supplies\n\nSome public water supplies add fluoride to achieve an optimal concentration for dental health. It is not practical to fluorinate Unfortunately, bottled water regulations in the U.S. do not require a detailed list of minerals on the label (except for sodium). Contact the manufacturer for information on fluoride concentration in the product selected.\n\nRemoving fluoride at the tap\n\nIf naturally occurring fluoride or the presence of fluoride through fluoridation is not desired, an alternative drinking water source or water treatment are viable options. Four treatment methods are suitable for reducing the levels of fluoride from drinking water, including activated alumina filters, distillation, reverse osmosis, and anion exchange.\n\nReview of Fluoride: Benefits and Risks; U.S. Public Health Service: February 1991; Report of the Ad Hoc Subcommittee to Coordinate Environmental Health and Related Programs; Washington, D.C.

      "text": "RO water in all cases is better. But, depending on your tap water conditions you may just be able to use that. Remember there is chlorine and fluoride in your tap unless you have well water. So all those chemicals hurt things and minerals could build up if ppm of water is high. I buy 20 gallons of poland spring a week and that works well.\n\nyea, use RO, if your tap water is \"bad\" other wise use the Tap water, that or make a rain collector if possible, plant love it and PH is perfect, with Tap you will have some micro/trace elements in it like Calcium (I have a lot and a high PH Bc. of it) so need to adjust your nutrients according to it, but not a big deal in a good soil, another thing is if your water plant (look up there home pages most have it all posted there) add chlorin, then you need to let it stand out for a day or two in the Can to make it evaporates, let it stand out a day anyway to make it room temperated, roots don't like ice cold water\n\non a side note, if your in good organic soil with lot of micro life, the soil will take care of the PH in most cases if its not totally off and that would possible mean your Tap water is`t the best choice ..\n\nI've been looking into this and so far can't find a significant difference between rain water and RO water. Assuming you are not getting rain with dissolved pollutants, both RO and rain are nearly pure water, with a few ions, etc.\n\nRain water? Well water? Tap water? Tap water and well water can have a pretty broad range of things in there or pH depending on the source.\n\nSpecifically, tap water \"can\" have chlorine, chloramines, fluoride and other things in there that in high concentrations may not be so good for your plants, but with the exception of chlorine (which will dissipate on standing), most of these things \"should\" be in pretty low levels and not particularly harmful. Remember, people water their lawns, gardens, drink and bathe in this water every day. In many cases commercial crops are grown using the equivalent of public water (or in many cases LOWER quality water).\n\nBluntly, if your tap water is of decent quality, you let it sit a day before watering your plants with it, and you're using a decent quality soil I doubt you're ever going to notice a difference of tap water vs distilled or R/O water.\n\nOn Ph-ing water, some people make a big deal of this, but again, I think its a lot more relevant to hydro where the medium IS water and the plant has to get all its nutrients from there. In that case, the plant is sitting in a chemical solution (which may or may not be buffered or pH-balanced to begin with), and its own metabolism is eventually going to change the pH of the medium.\n\nIn most places, ordinary water from the tap is going to be in a plant-acceptable pH range. More important, soil itself acts as a buffer to normalize pH, and you're constantly adding new water.\n\nI like distilled water to insure there isn't any buildup of minerals over time. Sparklets makes a decent distilled water that is supposed to be at the 6.0 range, so if you add nutrients to the water it will most likely bring that ph up higher, especially if there is nitrogen, but then adding some epsom salt should combat that, no more than 1 tablespoon per gallon. While I don't ph my mix, I haven't had any deficiencies that I have noticed. I'm also using Miracle Grow soil and that's really why I'm adding the epsom salt to the water, cause miracle grow lacks magnesium that is necessary for N-P-K uptake. For nutrients I'm feeding it regular old miracle grow water soluble nutrients. I suppose you can spend more and get fancy soil and fancy nutrients, but I've found you just need miracle grow soil, the correct water, and miracle grow nutrients, and you can do it just as well. Now some tell me you'll want a higher ph for flushing, but I think with the MG soil it'll put the ph too high if you start with a higher ph water and then the plant won't be able to process all the excess nutrients properly and actually flush itself. All you really have to do is keep in mind that MG soil is a little on the acidic side and you'll should be fine. I suppose if you're scared you can go buy a ph meter and strips and go through all that to fine tune everything, but I never do.\n\nTotally incorrect and an opinion - not fact. In fact, most RO systems stay busy and waste membranes removing calcium and magnesium for most municipal water systems. Then those users are back on here \"help!Is my baby burned or starving\" and being advised to add cal/mag. RO is totally an unneeded expense and hassle for 99% of growers.\n\nRain water is very good but totally lacking in any nutrient content. In that case it makes sense to be prepared to add nutrients. I was simply saying it seems a fool's errand to remove calcium and magnesium and then run to the store to buy cal/mag.\n\nI run straight tap water in my soil and in my DWC units. I do adjust pH for both but with less concern about it in soil. Why people think pot is so vastly different than any other plant is beyond me."

These are three of the most dangerous waters you can possibly drink, Asia and European countries have banned these waters, and they call them dead water. 1. Reverse osmosis water (RO water), 2. Distilled water, 3. Soft water. Question is why are these water so bad for you? Natural water from streams, or even coming out of your facet has natural trace minerals. These trace minerals are alkaline minerals\n\nthat your body needs to neutralize the toxins your body has.\n\nYour blood has to always be at 7.35 to 7.45 ph (alkaline) if you do not have a reserve of these minerals the body will steal them from another organ and that is not a good thing( chronic acidosis). What they have done is taken out all the trace minerals in these waters; research has now but soft water along with these other waters (distilled water is extremely soft).\n\nThose of you drinking Aquafina, Dasani bottled water you need to stop right now do not let your kids drink these waters, highly acidic to the body. Water has a memory, so by you drinking these waters it will absorb the minerals in your body to get it back to its natural state, then you pee out or sweat those good minerals. That will put your body into a chronic acidosis environment, and we all know degenerative diseases breed in, an acidic environment like cancer. There is research on this; one researcher said early death comes from drinking distilled water. Zoltan P. Rona MD MSc these waters are potentially dangerous. In 1970 a researcher by the name of Paavo Airola the more of these waters a person drinks, the higher the body acidity becomes, if someone you know has cancer stop him or her from drinking these waters, there bodies Ph needs to be 8.0 to8.5 alkaline to fight the cancer. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, these waters being essentially mineral-free, is very aggressive, in that it tends to dissolve substances with which it is in contact. Most toxic commercial beverages the people consume (cola beverages and other soft drinks) are made from distilled water. There is a correlation between the consumption of soft water and the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Cells, tissues and organs do not like to be dipped in acid.

Typically a bag of sodium fluoride will carry the warning: \"Danger! Poison-Toxic by Ingestion; Targets Organs- Heart, Kidneys, Bones, Central Nervous System, Gastrointestinal and Teeth. Do not get in eyes or on skin-Do not ingest or inhale. Wear proper respirator\" Do you really think this is good for your overall health even if it did help to stop a few cavities?\n\nBoth proponents for and against water fluoridation are almost religious fanatics when it comes to explaining their position. The problem arises in that there are few published scientific studies proving either side. That is not to say that the studies don't exist but rather are either (1) classified for National Security reasons or (2) the controlling parties in the aluminum and fertilize industry makes it nearly impossible for them to be published. In reality those studies classified for National Security reasons are actually classified in order to cover up the crime of poisoning not only our drinking water but the air around the aluminum and fertilizers plants. In the past the fluorine gas killed farm animals, destroyed crops and even cost the lives of several humans. All of this had to be covered up to protect the government, industry leaders who were and are still polluting our environment, medical doctors, dentists and water companies from lawsuits.\n\nHarvard University researchers recently published a long term analysis that linked fluoridated water to lower IQ scores in children. The results were released in \"Environmental Health Perspective\" which is a publication of the \"National Institute of Health.\" There are several sources that claim that Hitler and Stalin put fluoride in the prison camps water system to make the prisoners more docile and therefore easier to control. Here in the United States, we are putting fluoride in the drinking water of everyday citizens. Maybe that is why there is a problem with our students low test scores and why the average adult today is so apathetic to how our government is completely destroying our country. The Patriot Act and the National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA, with the inaction of our Congress, has completely destroyed our Bill Of Rights and who cares, besides a few right wing conservative patriots?\n\nEven if adding fluoride to our water systems reduces tooth decay, which it most likely does not, is it constitutional or for that matter ethical to medicate the entire population with the same medicine or dose? Have you ever heard of a medication that is beneficial for everyone disregarding the person's age, weight, other health issues, the amount of water he drinks every day or how much of that medicine (fluoride) he receives from other sources like processed food, soft drinks, etc. This is ridiculous.\n\nThe so called expert dentists and medical doctors that continue to endorse water fluoridation most likely solidified their opinions on this issue 25-30 years ago and have not updated their knowledge of what has been revealed the last few years. They will proudly show you a list of all the government agencies and professional organizations that approve of water fluoridation. Most of these have not done any research of their own but rather are only endor- sing the other endorsements. Also some of these same government agencies were the same that remained quiet a few years ago when doctors from all over the country were endorsing Camel Cigarettes because they were kinder to your T Zone, whatever that is. They already knew cigarettes caused cancer but failed to warn the public. Same thing happened with the government protecting those companies that had their employees breathing asbestos.\n\nNo, I don't trust the various government agencies who tell us that adding poisonous fluoride to our drinking water is safe. Even fluoride tooth paste says,\" Do not Swallow, if swallowed call poison control immediately\""

The ban was imposed two months ago to prevent the spread of foot-and-mouth disease, which is generally harmless to humans but devastating to livestock herds. Since 1929, the U.S. has been free of the highly contagious disease, which is easily transmitted by the wind, by people, or through contaminated water.\n\nThe spread of animal and human disease is an issue on many fronts. In the U.S., those concerns often focus on food and water quality, as consumers seek assurance that what they eat and drink is safe.\n\nDespite perceptions that it may be healthier, a recent study found there is little difference between water from a bottle and municipal water from the tap.\n\nThe research, commissioned by the World Wildlife Fund, revealed bottled water may be no safer, or healthier, than tap water in many countries while selling for up to 1,000 times the price. According to the Fund, regulatory standards for U.S. municipal tap water are tougher than those applied to bottled water.\n\nRandy Beavers, the Assistant General Manager of Des Moines, Iowa Water Works agrees.\n\nRandy Beavers: \"The problem with bottled water is that they're not regulated by the same EPA that we do.

      "text": "Activated carbon is well-known for its ability to remove organic\ncompounds from water through a process known as adsorption, remove chlorine and\nchloramine through various chemical reactions, and serve as a general filter\nmedium. However, its use for reduction of bromate is unclear. Various authors\nhave studied the use of activated carbon and for the most part have concluded\nactivated carbon is not a cost-effective solution. However, these authors have\nfailed to realize the limitations of carbon validation methods or the fact that\nnot all carbons are alike, especially when chemical reactions control the\nprocess.\n\nRegulations and Reactions\n\nBromate (BrO3-) is a disinfection byproduct formed by the\nreaction of ozone and naturally occurring bromine in drinking water. Although\nbromate is unlikely to be formed using standard chlorination disinfection,\nthere is some evidence that commercially available sodium hypochlorite\nsolutions may contain bromate as a contaminant.1 Bromate is a highly toxic\nsubstance that causes irreversible renal failure, deafness and death and has been\nlinked to renal tumors in rats. As such, the American, Canadian and European\nenvironmental protection agencies have designated 10 µg/L as the maximum\nacceptable concentration or maximum contaminant level (MCL) in drinking water.\n\nThe important precursor to bromate formation in drinking\nwater is bromide. In the United States, the average bromide concentration in\ndrinking water is approximately 100 µg/L. Since bromate is 63 percent\nbromide, only 6.3 µg/L of bromide needs to be converted to bromate upon\nozonation to exceed the MCL. Natural sources of bromine in groundwater are\nsaltwater intrusion and bromide dissolution from sedimentary rocks. Bromine\nusually is present in drinking water as either hypobromous acid (HOBr-) or\nhypobromite (OBr-). When exposed to ozonation, the bromide ion readily is\noxidized to aqueous bromine. In addition to bromate, aqueous bromine can cause\nvarious types of brominated disinfection byproducts such as bromoform and\nbrominated haloacetic acids.\n\nIn order to understand the formation of aqueous bromate, a\ncorollary understanding of ozone decomposition is needed. Ozone can play a\ndirect (molecular ozone pathway) or indirect (hydroxyl radical pathway)\noxidative role in forming byproducts. Ozone reacts directly with the bromide ion\nto form hypobromite and oxygen.\n\nO3 + Br- ? O2 + OBr-\n\nTwo ozone molecules then react directly with the hypobromite\nto form bromate and oxygen. Alternatively, the hypobromite can react with\nmultiple hydroxyl radicals created by the destruction of ozone.\n\n2O3 (or OH*) + OBr- ? 2 O2 + BrO3\n\nThese reactions are generalized and not necessarily\nbalanced, but they give a good overview of the mechanisms at work in bromate\nformation.\n\nWhile the 10 µg/L MCL is anticipated to impact a\nlimited number of utilities currently using ozone as the primary disinfectant\nto inactivate Giardia and viruses, a greater number of utilities will be\nimpacted by this MCL when compliance with the Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface\nWater Treatment Rule (LT2ESWTR) is required. Compliance will mean continuance\nof meeting filtration avoidance criteria of two-log Cryptosporidium\ninactivation and overall inactivation requirements (three-log Giardia, four-log\nviruses and two-log Cryptosporidium) using a minimum of two disinfectants.\n\nActivated Carbon Research for Bromate Reduction\n\nThe use of activated carbon has been investigated by various\nauthors for the removal or reduction of bromate.2,3,4 The data to date have\nbeen inconsistent and, in some cases, misleading due to the techniques used to\ndetermine the applicability of activated carbon.5,6 It also is apparent that\nthe carbon selection process was overlooked, which has lead to generalizations\nconcerning the use of activated carbon for this application.\n\nOne paper however has focused on the effect of surface\nproperties on bromate removal.7 The data shows surface properties can and do\naffect bromate removal performance. Other applications such as chloramine\nremoval in the liquid phase and hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide oxidation\nin the vapor phase also have been shown to be affected by surface properties.\nCommercially available activated carbons produced for catalytic properties as\nwell as adsorptive properties do exist and have been investigated for bromate\nreduction. However, the data is misleading due to testing conditions.\n\nActivated Carbon for Bromate Reduction--Reaction Kinetics\n\nTesting was conducted using a differential reactor to\ndetermine the reaction rate for a standard bituminous coal-based granular\ncarbon and a catalytically enhanced carbon. Typical carbon properties are shown\nin Table 1. Reaction rate data (Figure 1) show the reaction follows a first\norder reaction and, more importantly, data show the reaction rate for the\ncatalytically enhanced carbon is 3.4 times faster than the standard carbon.\n\nAnalysis of the water confirms the reaction product from\nbromate destruction is bromide (Figure 2). The faster reaction rate for the\ncatalytically enhanced carbon would allow shorter contact time systems to be\ndesigned for full-scale use. Experimental design studies show typical\nproperties such as iodine number cannot be used to predict bromate reduction\nperformance, however, catalytic activity as measured by the peroxide number is\nuseful in determining the more applicable carbon.\n\nActivated Carbon--Real World Application\n\nDifferential reactor studies are useful for the\ndetermination of reaction rates. However, full scale testing is required to\nverify the data. Studies published concerning the reduction of bromate have\nutilized the Rapid Small Scale Column Test (RSSCT) procedure, which was\ndesigned for adsorption applications and may not translate well to applications\nwhere a different removal mechanism such as oxidation/reduction or ion exchange\nexists. Data from the literature as well as the differential reactor work\nconducted for this paper show the reaction to be a reduction of bromate;\ntherefore, the RSSCT column study procedure may not be accurate.\n\nColumn studies were conducted using actual particle size\ncarbons and full-scale contact times to verify performance. A column study\nusing a 30-minute contact time and catalytically enhanced 8¥30 mesh carbon\nshowed bromate could be successfully reduced from an average of 110 ppb bromate\nto an average of less than 5 ppb (see Figure 3).\n\nConclusions\n\n* Differential\nreactor studies indicate the bromate reduction reaction to bromide to be first\norder.\n\n* Data\nshow standard carbon properties such as iodine number cannot be used to\nindicate bromate reduction performance.\n\n* Catalytic\nactivity as measured by the peroxide number does give some indication of\nbromate reduction performance.\n\n* Column\nstudy data show activated carbon can be utilized to reduce bromate to\nacceptable levels.\n\nKimberly Thompson is an inside technical sales representative at Calgon Carbon Corp.

      "text": "Pure natural water is formed mainly by evaporation from seas and lakes. As warm water vapor rises it meets cooler air and condenses into water droplets (just like hot water vapor rising from a bath and condensing into droplets on the cool bathroom walls). The water droplets begin to dissolve a whole range of substances in the atmosphere, such as gases, airborne dust particles and salt from sea spray. When this water eventually falls to earth as rain it acquires other substances from rock weathering and by drainage through fields and woods. Unfortunately, man's misuse of the waterways to dispose of industrial wastes and sewage also allows other, often undesirable, substances to affect the composition of the water.\n\nAtmospheric Gases\n\nMany atmospheric gases dissolve in water to some extent and carbon dioxide is one of the most important. It dissolves readily to form carbonic acid, giving a weakly acidic solution. This chemical reaction has important consequences, not only for the eventual chemical content of water, but also for other chemical and biological reactions that occur in the aquatic environment. The naturally acidic nature of rain allows it to bring other, less reactive, substances into solution. (The pH of naturally formed rainwater is about 5.6 but, as we shall see, local atmospheric and landscape variations can alter it significantly before it reaches our tap.) The affinity between carbon dioxide and water has many far-reaching effects on water quality, playing a major role in plant and animal respiration and pH buffering.\n\nSea spray and local dust particles can have a major influence on the composition of rain. Coastal areas may have quite high levels of dissolved sea salt, with substantially higher levels of sodium and chloride ions than inland areas. Likewise, dusty land surfaces can affect rain. For instance, rain from chalky areas near the coast often have higher than normal levels of calcium caused by the chalky soils in these areas. Indeed, during long dry spells the amount of calcium is often sufficient to neutralize the naturally acidic rain, leading, unusually, to slightly alkaline rain!\n\nAs we are all aware, atmospheric pollution can have a major effect on the composition of rainwater, typically caused by heavy metals such as lead, zinc or chromium from industrial processes, although such effects are more likely to be local, not widespread. Fossil-fuel burning is a more global cause of atmospheric pollution, the two most important gases being sulphur dioxide (mainly from coal burning) and nitrous oxides from vehicle exhausts and oil-burning power stations. These gases can react with rain to form strongly acidic solutions, giving acid rain. Some parts of the world, including the UK have recorded pH values as low as 2.1, due to acid rain.\n\nRain picks up significant amounts of nitrogen, sulphur and sodium in the atmosphere. At this stage it is likely to be very soft. So we see that rain - which we like to think of as pure water - is already a complex chemical mixture before it hits the earth.\n\nRock Weathering\n\nMost of the inorganic substances in tap water come from rock weathering. As the nature of the local rock varies, so does the content of the local water. The degree and rate of rock weathering depends on several factors. There are broadly speaking two types of rock of interest -igneous and sedimentary. (Metamorphic rock is not mentioned, as it weathers in much the same way as igneous rock.)\n\nIgneous rocks have been formed by volcanic action and are common in mountainous regions. They are extremely hard and dissolve slowly, helped by the slight acidity of naturally occurring rain. Water draining from igneous rock will contain most of the common metals, such as magnesium, calcium, sodium and potassium, but usually only in small amounts. The degree or amount of rock weathering that occurs has two important effects on the character of the drainage water.\n\nWater hardness is determined mainly by the amount of dissolved magnesium and calcium ions there are. Soft water is described as such because of the small amounts of dissolved \"water hardness\" forming ions. When these ions are dissolved they tend to neutralize the acidity of rain. If only small amounts of rock are dissolved (as with igneous rocks), the drainage water tends to still be acidic -although the local water board may well adjust this at the water purification plant.\n\nSedimentary rocks, on the other hand, are built from a jumble of rocks and some organic debris. Chalk or limestone are common examples. These rocks usually dissolve fairly easily so drainage waters contain high concentrations of the major ions, such as calcium and magnesium. Again, the slight acidity of rain is important in this process. Most of these types of rock have an abundance of calcium carbonate which, being alkaline, raises the pH of the water. The water draining from such rocks is usually neutral or alkaline. The high level of dissolved ions thus makes the water 'hard'.\n\nThe action of rain on natural rock and the subsequent weathering plays a major role in determining the over­all content or chemistry of the water. Rock weathering is an important factor in determining both the pH (acidity /alkalinity) and 'hardness' of water.\n\nDrainage Water\n\nWater dissolves many more substances as it drains from land to river or reservoir, the number and type of substances depending on the land usage. In an agricultural area there will be run-off from fields. Often, water draining from such areas is high in\nnitrates and phosphates from fertilizers and may contain man-made pesticides and herbicides. Intensive stock-rearing units may yield 'slurry' which penetrates the streams and ground waters. Water treatment plants often release treated sewage into streams and rivers. A typical effluent will contain high levels of ammonia, nitrate and phosphate. Stream flora usually oxidize most of the ammonia, but significant amounts of nitrate and phosphate will remain. Industry still releases many wastes into fresh waters, the nature and amount of which depend on the industry. Unbelievably, we are still pumping toxic substances such as cyanide, oil, heavy metals and formaldehyde into our waters\n\nThe Final Cocktail We Call Water\n\nThe final cocktail we call water is complex and, as we have seen, varies with atmospheric and local land conditions. In general, water from our tap will contain:\n\nMajor ions such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, sulphates, chlorides and hydrogen carbonate. These are usually present in quantities of at least 1 mg/l. All of these ions play a major role in our chemistry and that of the water. They help determine both pH and water hardness.\n\nKey nutrient ions, such as phosphates and nitrate. The concentrations of these are generally lower than those of the major ions and play a major role in algae growth.\n\nDissolved gases, which include oxygen and carbon dioxide.\n\nTrace ions, such as copper, iron zinc, fluoride, cobalt and molybdenum, which are important in minute amounts, but can be toxic to fish at higher levels\n\nThe important message is that tap water is not a simple substance. What we call water is really a weak solution of several dozen dissolved substances, some beneficial to us, some not. (Water Boards everywhere devote a lot of effort to ensuring that water is fit for human consumption.) When we talk about water chemistry or water quality, what we are really talking about is the variety and quantities of these various substances, the reactions between them and their combined effect on our health and well being.\n\nSo water is variable. We have seen that tap water is complex. Whether the water coming out of the tap is of poor or good quality depends largely on your geographical location and your municipal treatment facility.\n\nConsider a mountain stream. Often such streams near their source can be crystal-clear but devoid of life. Further downstream the water can be green and often muddy - yet such waters are usually highly productive and teeming with all forms of aquatic life. So, in natural conditions the clearest water is not always best for aquatic life. However, it is possible to have good quality water that is also clear.\n\nWhy is water so important?\n\nWater is the most common substance on earth, covering 70% of the planet's surface. Plants and animals are mostly water - our brain is 85% water! Because of this abundance we often take it for granted and overlook what a remarkable substance it is. Water is a major part of all biological systems and there is almost no activity of a living organism that can take place without it."

The EPA also initiated its own study and found no significant environmental risks as a result of proper hydraulic fracturing. In fact, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson testified that she was \"…not aware of any proven case where the fracking process itself has affected water.\"\n\nHydraulic fracturing wells are drilled below underground aquifers where groundwater is found. Fracking wells reach approximately 6,000 feet under the earth's surface—almost the distance of four Empire State buildings stacked on top of each other. The industry also sets standards for 10-inch, vault-thick steel and concrete casing, or shielding, for the explicit purpose of protecting groundwater. The primary method used for protecting groundwater during drilling operations consists of drilling the wellbore through the groundwater aquifers, immediately installing the steel pipe or casing, and cementing this steel pipe into place. Additional protection is offered by the impermeable rock formations that lie between the oil and natural gas formations and the groundwater—formations that have isolated the groundwater over millions of years.\n\nThe most important factor of wastewater management is working with state, regional and local regulators to develop a wastewater plan that ensures surface and groundwater quality. This includes establishing a water quality baseline before drilling operations are initiated. America's oil and natural gas producers remain committed to protecting the environment and groundwater. No one is more committed to safe and responsible operations. It is what we do every day.\n\nWater used in the hydraulic fracturing process is usually managed and disposed of in one of three ways: 1) injected in permitted disposal wells in accordance with Underground Injection Control regulations; 2) delivered to water treatment facilities depending on permitting; 3) reused/recycled"

      "text": "Water Softeners\n\nA water softener system is a unit that is used to soften water, by removing the minerals that cause the water to be hard.\n\nWater softening is an important process, because the hardness of water in different applications is reduced during this process. When water is hard, it can clog pipes, damage boilers, heat exchangers, and many other devices. Water softening can prevent these negative effects. Hard water causes a higher risk of lime scale deposits in industrial, commercial and household water systems. Due to this lime scale build-up, pipes are blocked and the efficiency of hot boilers and tanks is reduced. This increases the cost of domestic water heating by about fifteen to twenty percent. Another negative effect of lime scale is that it has damaging effects on household machinery, such as laundry machines. Water softening using Pure Aqua water softener system expands the life span of each household machine, such as laundry machines, and the life span of pipelines. It also contributes to the improved working, and longer lifespan of solar heating systems, air conditioning units and many other water-based applications.\n\nResidential Water Softeners\n\nFiberglass Tank - Top Mounted Valve\n\nIndustrial water softeners are specific ion exchangers that are designed to remove ions, which are positively charged.\n\nSofteners mainly remove calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are often referred to as 'hardness minerals'.Softeners are sometimes even applied to remove iron. The softening devices are able to remove up to five milligrams per liter (5 mg/L) of dissolved iron.Softeners can operate automatic, semi-automatic, or manual. Each type is rated on the amount of hardness it can remove before regeneration is necessary.Commercial water softeners collect hardness minerals within its conditioning tank and from time to time flushes them away to drain.\n\nIon exchangers are often used for water softening. When an ion exchanger is applied for water softening, it will replace the calcium and magnesium ions in the water with other ions, for instance sodium or potassium. The exchanger ions are added to the ion exchanger reservoir as sodium and potassium salts (NaCl and KCl).\n\nHow long does a water softener last?\n\nA good water softener system will last many years. Water softeners that were supplied in the 1980's may still work, and many need little maintenance, besides filling them with salt occasionally"

In the presence of ultraviolet rays of the sun, titanium dioxide becomes chemically active and kills bacteria.\n\nThe device consists of a steel plate (about 1 square metre) coated with titanium dioxide and a plastic tray of similar size. The steel plate can be fixed to the bottom of the plastic tray, which holds the water meant for treatment. A glass plate works as a dust cover.\n\nThough powdered titanium dioxide is used in remediation of wastewater, it is not considered desirable for purifying drinking water as its separation from water is not easy. The barc scientists, led by chemist Arvind Belapurkar, overcame this problem by coating the inside surface of the tray which is meant to hold the water with titanium dioxide. When water in the tray was exposed to sunlight for about four hours, the concentration of Escherichia coli, a common bacteria that causes diarrhoea, dropped from 100,000 bacteria per millilitre to almost zero level, the scientists reported in the July 10 issue of the journal Current Science (Vol 91, No 1). E coli is the toughest of disease-causing microbes found in raw water.\n\nThe scientists say that inorganic impurities such as common salt present in the water do not affect the efficiency of the device. But water with organic impurities should be first treated with activated charcoal to reduce concentration of organic compounds to six parts per million for the device to be effective, they add.\n\nThe scientists say that the photocatalyst maintained its bactericidal activity at the same level for almost a year. According to Belapurkar, the system is ideal for rural areas that lack electricity and chemicals required for water treatment. \"If mass-produced, the price of our water purification system could be less than Rs 1,000 and also there is no recurring cost involved,\" he adds."

The artesian spring was discovered in the Mossø Conservation area in a remote part of the Danish lake highlands in 2001 by a retired insurance broker and his wife.\n\nThe aquifer from which the spring flows is lies 150 -180 ft below the surface and it is covered by alternating layers of quartz-sand and hard clay. The exact age of the water is not known, but it is believed to be rather old, possibly dating back to the latest ice-age according to a geologist familiar with the area.\n\nWith a temperature of below 8 degrees, the spring is unusually cold spring.\n\nAdd this page to your favorite Social Bookmarking websites\n\nWhere to Buy Iskilde:\n\nFineH2O\nFine H2O is the premiere importer and distributor of luxury bottled waters from around the globe.\n\nAquadeli\nAquadeli is New Zealand's first water concept store, with a large range of mineral and spring waters.\n\nWawali\nMás que solo agua. Los mejores y\nmás innovadoras aguas embotelladas de todo el mundo. More than just water. The best and most innovative bottled waters from around the world.\n\nInterview with Jan Bender, founder of Iskilde:\n\nHow did Iskilde get started? When I first heard of Iskilde, this was in 2002, I was immediately fascinated. The spring is located less than 2000 meters from my farm, and I had no idea that there could be water of this quality in our area. I went to see the spring and taste the water, and the sensation was fantastic! The water is quite cold – as implied by the name – it has a silky texture which I found exciting, and the taste was characteristic for the waters in our area - when they are best.\n\nHow would you describe the flavor of the water? Waters from the lake highland region have a fairly high content of minerals, but contrary to most other waters with a similar mineral content, they are neutral, almost sweet in their taste, a little bit as a glacial water, but with much more body.\n\nThis is due to the influence of the many different layers of soil and moraine in the area.\n\nThe soils consist of billions of tiny pieces of different minerals, bonded together by organic particles. So by sieving through these layers, the water is exposed to a huge surface, compared to the area encountered when penetrating rock through a crevasse – and it is exposed not just to one type of rock, but to numerous different types of rock.\n\nDuring this process the water absorbs a wide variety of minerals, many of them rare from the soil – and each of them in fairly small quantities. So the apparent sweetness of the water is really a result of many different tastes balancing each other out. This is the reason why the water has more \"body\" then the glacial waters which it might resemble at a first impression.\n\nWhat's your goal with Iskilde? My goal for Iskilde was to transport the sensation of drinking the water at the spring to wherever you decided to open your bottle.\n\nHow do you archive this? This seemingly humble ambition proved fairly difficult to implement in real life, however, and we performed a series of tests to see why the water changed character during the bottling process. It turned out that the answer was \"air\". At the spring, when the water leaves the ground (today through a rather unromantic pipe), it has a very high content of air. The air is sucked into the water when it sprouts from the spring, just like air is sucked into the water when you let the water run quickly from a tap. This air changes the texture of the water and makes it soft and silky. Hardly surprising, when you think of it, but still it came as a revelation to us.\n\nDuring a traditional bottling process, all air is taken out of the water. We had to find a way of putting it back in. We did a lot of experiments. Plain atmospheric air contains too many germs – even one germ is too many. Using pure gases was a challenge too, because many types of air have a distinct taste. Just think of how much adding CO2 will change the taste of a water. The only gas we could find, that didn't change the taste, yet restored the life and silkiness of the water at the spring – was oxygen.\n\nStill today, we like to take people to the spring, serve them a glass of Iskilde in one glass and a glass of water taken directly from the spring in another – and ask them to compare. There is a difference of course. But I am proud to say that it is so small, that only an expert will detect it.\n\nWho designed the bottle, what was the idea here? An excellent and renowned Danish designer, Jesper Mathiesen, created the packaging for me. The design goal was to make a packaging that was discreet, elegant, and functional. It should be as much at home on the table of a three star restaurant as in a ragged willow basket. It was very important for me, that focus was maintained on the contents, the water, rather than the packaging. Iskilde was to be a gourmet product, not a luxury product, if you understand what I mean.\n\nThe neck of the bottle is narrow, in order to minimize the waters exposure to the air over the bottle. We have covered the two-component screw cap with a capsule in order to obtain a completely tight closure, oxygen molecules are tiny and agile. And we wanted boxes that were good for handling.\n\nLabor unions have recommended a maximum weight of 13 kgs for packages that are to be handled manually. Our cube cardboard boxes contain 16 bottles of 0,5 litre or 9 bottles of 1,0 litre – both of them optimized for manual handling, in respect for all the people who help us move the boxes around."

The method is twice more efficient than current ones, and will offer a much-needed production boost at sea, for Marine Corps expeditionary forces, as well as for humanitarian missions ashore.\n\n\"Saving energy and producing clean water is a tactical issue for the Navy. We plan to build prototype desalination units that will use 65 percent less energy and be 40 percent smaller by weight and by volume relative to current Navy reverse osmosis systems. They should require roughly 75 percent less maintenance,\" says ONR program officer Dr J. Paul Armistead, who has a deep interest in water purification technologies. The new research was done under the Expeditionary Unit Water Purification Program (EUWP), which was initiated back in 2004.\n\nMost US Navy ships and sailors currently benefit from high-tech, Reverse Osmosis (RO) desalinization plant, as opposed to having to refuel for freshwater in ports, or to collect it from rain and then store it. However, the process of making seawater drinkable is very energy-consuming, and the EUWP was initiated precisely to find solutions around this problem. There are numerous advantages to having more efficient water-production capabilities, including extended ship ranges, reduced fuel consumption, and a smaller environmental footprint, the ONR argues.\n\n\"Several of the projects we have funded have turned into patents for commercially available products and processes that are available for use in water desalination systems for communities where freshwater sources are not available,\" says US Bureau of Reclamation physical scientist Michelle Chapman, who is also a member of the ONR team managing the research program. She notes that the ONR's efforts have also been set to good use for civilian applications as well.\n\n\"Any sort of technology advancements we find for ships are directly applicable ashore and can be utilized by ever-increasing drought ridden areas,\" adds Navy Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division, Ship Systems Engineering Station (NSWCCD-SSES) mechanical engineer Dave Nordham. Key partners in the EUWP program include NSWCCD-Philadelphia, the US Army Tank Automotive Research Development and Engineering Command, the US Bureau of Reclamation, and the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center's Seawater Desalination Test Facility, in Port Hueneme, California."

      "text": "The most important factor in choosing a water filtration system will be what the filter removes. It is also important to choose the right type of system for your needs.\n\nFirst off, there are three basic systems:\n\nCOUNTER TOP: The largest type, also containing the largest filter, making it the longest lasting option. It is connected directly to your faucet and sits right on the counter or mounts on the wall. A bypass feature allows you to turn the filter off when not needed.\n\nFAUCET MOUNT: This attaches directly to your kitchen faucet and includes a bypass feature, so the water doesn't always have to go through the filter. Most models come with a replace the filter indicator light.\n\nPITCHER: With this system, you pour water from the faucet into the pitcher where it is filtered and ready for refrigerator storage. These also have an indicator to let you know when to change the filter.\n\nFILTERS: All water filtration systems rely on the effectiveness of the filter. Replacement of the filter will depend on how many gallons of water you run through it. Many faucet mount and counter top units have an auto shut-off feature that will stop the water flow when the filter needs replacement. This is helpful when you forget to change the filter. It's important to remember to replace your filter when needed.\n\nEach filter will remove different contaminants and bacteria, and these are listed on each model's label. The simplest filter system will remove odor, color, bad taste, lead, chlorine and copper. Keep in mind that the smaller the particle the filter will remove, the better it is. Your choice should be based on what you want to remove, but we will all benefit from the best performing filters"

The new proposal from HHS would set the recommended level at just 0.7. Meanwhile, the EPA said it is reviewing whether to lower the maximum allowable level of fluoride in drinking water from the current 4 parts per million.\n\n\"EPA's new analysis will help us make sure that people benefit from tooth decay prevention while at the same time avoiding the unwanted health effects from too much fluoride,\" said Peter Silva, an EPA assistant administrator.\n\nFluoride is a mineral that exists in water and soil. About 70 years ago, scientists discovered that people whose supplies naturally had more fluoride also had fewer cavities.\n\nIn 1945, Grand Rapids, Mich., became the world's first city to add fluoride to its drinking water. Six years later a study found a dramatic decline in tooth decay among children there, and the surgeon general endorsed water fluoridation.\n\nAnd in 1955, Procter & Gamble Co. marketed the first fluoride toothpaste, Crest, with the slogan \"Look, Mom, no cavities!\"\n\nBut that same year, The New York Times called fluoridation of public water one of the country's \"fiercest controversies.\" The story said some opponents called the campaign for fluoridation \"the work of Communists who want to soften the brains of the American people.\"\n\nThe battles continue for a variety of reasons today.\n\nIn New York, the village of Cobleskill outside Albany stopped adding fluoride to its drinking water in 2007 after the longtime water superintendent became convinced the additive was contributing to his knee problems. Two years later, the village reversed the move after dentists and doctors complained.\n\nAccording to a recent CDC report, nearly 23 percent of children ages 12 to 15 had fluorosis in a study done in 1986-87. That rose to 41 percent in a study that covered 1999 through 2004.\n\n\"The report of discoloration has been going up over the years,\" said Dr. Robert Barsley, a professor at the LSU Health Sciences Center School of Dentistry. \"It is not the water that's causing this by any means. It's the extra fluoride products - toothpaste, mouthwash - that people are using. And people want nice white teeth so they brush three times a day.\"\n\nSusan Jeansonne, oral health program manager for Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, said one reason for the problem is children swallowing fluoride toothpaste or eating it.\n\nToothpaste labels have long recommended that parents supervise children under 6 when they are brushing their teeth; give them only a pea-size amount; and make sure they spit it out. Toddlers under 2 shouldn't use toothpaste with fluoride.\n\nIn 2006, the National Academy of Sciences released a report recommending that the EPA lower its maximum allowable level of fluoride in drinking water. The report warned severe fluorosis could occur at 2 parts per million. Also, a majority of the report's authors said a lifetime of drinking water with fluoride at 4 parts per million or higher could raise the risk of broken bones."

      "text": "From Source To Tap - The Multi-Barrier Approach To Safe Drinking Water\n\nPublic Involvement & Awareness\n\nAs mentioned above, it is essential to maintain appropriate levels of partnership and communication among stakeholders. In addition, the public has expectations of government transparency and the availability of public health information. It is important that the public be aware that they can report concerns to the appropriate authority.\n\nDrinking water programs can involve the public and increase awareness of drinking water quality issues by:\n\nInforming the public about its impact on source water quality and about available pollution mitigation measures.\n\nInforming the public about health risks and providing educational materials on issues such as water disinfection, guidelines, conservation issues, and costs of providing service.\n\nMaking monitoring results or summaries available and relaying information about what the authority is doing to address the risks.\n\nIssuing regular reports about drinking water systems, including improvements and areas that need further attention.\n\nIncorporating public consultations into decision-making processes that have an effect on public health, such as the development of new guidelines and regulations.\n\nProviding additional information to owners of private drinking water systems (groundwater or surface water) is very important as they are responsible for regularly testing the quality of their water. Owners need to know what to do in case of microbiological or chemical contamination of their drinking water. Well-owners need to know how to maintain their wells and how to arrange to decommission wells that are no longer safe or needed.\n\nAll landowners should be encouraged through community awareness programs to implement best management practices such as protecting stream banks, providing buffer strips, and subsidizing tree planting and fencing works."

      "text": "Basic Information\n\nEPA has developed the Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (LT2 rule) to improve your drinking water quality and provide additional protection from disease-causing microorganisms and contaminants that can form during drinking water treatment.\n\nYour drinking water comes from source water locations such as:\n\nLakes\n\nRivers\n\nReservoirs\n\nGround water aquifers\n\nPathogens, such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium, are often found in water, and can cause gastrointestinal illness (e.g., diarrhea, vomiting, cramps) and other health risks. In many cases, this water needs to be disinfected through the use of additives such as chlorine to inactivate (or kill) microbial pathogens.\n\nCryptosporidium is a significant concern in drinking water because it contaminates surface waters used as drinking water sources, it is resistant to chlorine and other disinfectants, and it has caused waterborne disease outbreaks. Consuming water with Cryptosporidium, a contaminant in drinking water sources, can cause gastrointestinal illness, which may be severe in people with weakened immune systems (e.g., infants and the elderly) and sometimes fatal in people with severely compromised immune systems (e.g., cancer and AIDS patients).\n\nThe purpose of the LT2 rule is to reduce disease incidence associated with Cryptosporidium and other pathogenic microorganisms in your drinking water. The rule applies to all public water systems that use surface water or ground water that is under the direct influence of surface water. The rule will bolster existing regulations and provide a higher level of protection of your drinking water supply by:\n\nProviding provisions to ensure that systems maintain microbial protection as they take steps to reduce the formation of disinfection byproducts\n\nThis combination of steps, combined with the existing regulations, is designed to provide protection from microbial pathogens while simultaneously minimizing health risks to the population from disinfection byproducts.\n\nWhy is EPA concerned about Cryptosporidium? Cryptosporidium is a significant concern in drinking water because it contaminates most drinking water sources, it is resistant to chlorine and other disinfectants, and it has caused waterborne disease outbreaks. Consuming water with Cryptosporidium can cause gastrointestinal illness, which may be severe and sometimes fatal for people with weakened immune systems (which may include infants, the elderly, and people who have AIDS).\n\nCurrent regulations require filtered water systems to reduce source water Cryptosporidium levels by 99 percent (2-log). Recent data on Cryptosporidium indicate that this treatment is sufficient for most systems, but additional treatment is necessary for certain higher risk systems. These higher risk systems include filtered water systems with high levels of Cryptosporidium in their water sources and all unfiltered water systems, which do not treat for Cryptosporidium.\n\nWho does this rule apply to? The LT2ESWTR applies to all public water systems (systems) that use surface water or ground water under the direct influence of surface water. This includes about 14,000 systems serving approximately 180 million people.\n\nSystems initially monitor their water sources to determine treatment requirements. This monitoring involves two years of monthly sampling for Cryptosporidium. To reduce monitoring costs, small filtered water systems will first monitor for E. coli–a bacterium that is less expensive to analyze than Cryptosporidium–and will be monitor for Cryptosporidium only if their E. coli results exceed specified concentration levels.\n\nTreatment: Filtered water systems will be classified in one of four treatment categories (bins) based on their monitoring results. Most systems are expected to be classified in the lowest bin and will face no additional requirements. Systems classified in higher bins must provide additional water treatment to further reduce Cryptosporidium levels by 90 to 99.7 percent (1.0 to 2.5-log), depending on the bin. Systems will select from different treatment and management options in a \"microbial toolbox\" to meet their additional treatment requirements. All unfiltered water systems must provide at least 99 or 99.9 percent (2 or 3-log) inactivation of Cryptosporidium, depending on the results of their monitoring.\n\nUncovered Finished Water Reservoirs: Systems that store treated water in open reservoirs must either cover the reservoir or treat the reservoir discharge to inactivate 4-log virus, 3-log Giardia lamblia, and 2-log Cryptosporidium. These requirements are necessary to protect against the contamination of water that occurs in open reservoirs.\n\nDisinfection Benchmarking: Systems must review their current level of microbial treatment before making a significant change in their disinfection practice. This review will assist systems in maintaining protection against microbial pathogens as they take steps to reduce the formation of disinfection byproducts under the Stage 2 Disinfection Byproducts Rule, which EPA is finalizing along with the LT2ESWTR.\n\nHow soon after publishing the final rule will the changes take effect? Monitoring starting dates are staggered by system size. The largest systems (serving at least 100,000 people) will begin monitoring in October 2006 and the smallest systems (serving fewer than 10,000 people) will not begin monitoring until October 2008. After completing monitoring and determining their treatment bin, systems generally have three years to comply with any additional treatment requirements. Systems must conduct a second round of monitoring six years after completing the initial round to determine if source water conditions have changed significantly.\n\nThe LT2ESWTR will improve the control of Cryptosporidium and other microbiological pathogens in drinking water systems with the highest risk levels. EPA estimates that full compliance with the LT2ESWTR will reduce the incidence of cryptosporidiosis - the gastrointestinal illness caused by ingestion of Cryptosporidium - by 89,000 to 1,459,000 cases per year, with an associated reduction of 20 to 314 premature deaths. The additional Cryptosporidium treatment requirements of the LT2ESWTR will also reduce exposure to other microbial pathogens, such as Giardia, that co-occur with Cryptosporidium. Additional protection from microbial pathogens will come from provisions in this rule for reviewing disinfection practices and for covering or treating uncovered finished water reservoirs, though EPA has not quantified these benefits.\n\nHow much will this rule cost? The LT2ESWTR will result in increased costs to public water systems and States. The average annualized present value costs of the LT2ESWTR are estimated to range from $92 to $133 million (using a three percent discount rate). Public water systems will bear approximately 99 percent of this total cost, with States incurring the remaining 1 percent. The average annual household cost is estimated to be $1.67 to $2.59 per year, with 96 to 98 percent of households experiencing annual costs of less than $12 per year.\n\nIs funding associated with this rule? Funding may be available from programs administered by EPA and other Federal agencies to assist systems in complying with the LT2ESWTR. The Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) assists systems with financing the costs of infrastructure needed to achieve or maintain compliance with SDWA requirements. Through the DWSRF, EPA awards capitalization grants to States, which in turn can provide low-cost loans and other types of assistance to eligible systems.\n\nIn addition to the DWSRF, money is available from the Department of Agriculture's Rural Utility Service (RUS) and Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. RUS provides loans, guaranteed loans, and grants to improve, repair, or construct water supply and distribution systems in rural areas and towns of up to 10,000 people. The CDBG program includes direct grants to States, which in turn are awarded to smaller communities, rural areas, and colonias in Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas and direct grants to U.S. territories and trusts.\n\nHow did EPA develop this rule? The Cryptosporidium monitoring and treatment requirements in the LT2ESWTR reflect a consensus Agreement in Principle of the Stage 2 M-DBP Federal Advisory Committee. This Committee consisted of organizational members representing EPA, state and local public health and regulatory agencies, local elected officials, tribes, drinking water suppliers, chemical and equipment manufacturers, and public interest groups. EPA published the Agreement in a December 29, 2000, Federal Register notice.\n\nEPA proposed the LT2ESWTR on August 11, 2003. Approximately 200 organizations and individuals submitted comments on the proposal. In the final LT2ESWTR, we made a number of changes from the proposal to address these comments. In response to concerns with both laboratory capacity and the implementation schedule, we have moved back the dates when many systems will begin monitoring. This approach will provide sufficient time for Cryptosporidium laboratories to develop adequate laboratory to support monitoring under the rule. Further, it will allow states the time to play a greater role in providing oversight for monitoring by their systems.\n\nExisting regulations did not require unfiltered systems to provide any treatment for Cryptosporidium. Although unfiltered systems maintain watershed control programs to protect water quality, recent surveys have shown Cryptosporidium to be present in the sources of unfiltered systems. Without treatment, these Cryptosporidium will pass into the water distributed to consumers. Available data indicate that the average risk from Cryptosporidium in unfiltered systems is higher than in filtered systems, so that treatment by unfiltered systems is required to achieve comparable public health protection. Further, with available technologies like UV and ozone, treatment for Cryptosporidium is feasible for all unfiltered systems. Consequently, EPA is establishing requirements under the LT2ESWTR for all unfiltered systems to treat for Cryptosporidium, with the required degree of treatment depending on the source water contamination level."

The large majority however tend to be young singles and couples, in particular females aged between 14-35 years.\n\nGenerally bottled water consumers can be described as being more health conscious, contemporary and socially aware.\n\nSO WHY DO PEOPLE DRINK BOTTLED WATER?\n\nYOU NEED IT\n\nRegardless of the seasons and the weather, your need for water remains the same. Remember that 95% of human blood is water.\n\nHEALTHY CONCIOUS LIVING\n\nIn these health conscious days water makes a great contribution to overall hydration.It is fat and kilojoule free and a great thirst quencher, which makes it a great choice for the health conscious consumer. Many people wish to get back to basics and drink something that is refreshing and pure.\n\nSome people also wish to avoid certain chemicals used in the treatment of public water supplies, such as chlorine and fluoride, and are therefore turning to the chemical free alternative.\n\nCONVENIENCE\n\nWith the development of more widespread leisure and activities and the expansion of travel, for business and pleasure, consumers are increasingly turning to the convenience of bottled water for their refreshment.\n\nTASTE\n\nOne of the main reasons why people buy bottle water is its taste! With the variation in tastes of the different local water supplies across the country, more people prefer the consistent refreshing taste of bottled water.\n\nMORE FACTS ON BOTTLED WATER...\n\nBOTTLED WATER REGULATIONS & SAFETY\n\nThe bottled water industry is comprehensively regulated as a packaged food product by Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ), which mandates stringent standards to help ensure bottled water's consistent safety, quality and good taste. It is important to note that FSANZ bottled water standards are law and not guidelines and therefore must be met by all water bottlers without exception. FSANZ requires bottled water to comply with not only bottled water-specific standards as well as regulations required of all food products.\n\nAs with other food products, bottled water is subject in addition to food law, to the stringent labelling requirements of the Australian Consumer & Competition Commission (ACCC). As with other food products, bottled water may be recalled from the marketplace.\n\nIn addition to federal and state regulations, ABWI members are required to adhere to standards in the ABWI Bottled Water \"Model Code\", which in most cases are stricter than FSANZ regulations. The ABWI \"Model Code\" is enforced through a mandatory, annual, plant inspection by an independent, third-party registered food audit organization.\n\nWith much attention focused on the safety and security of the nation's food supply, the bottled water industry has elevated its efforts to provide consumers with a safe, high quality product. The numerous federal and state regulations and standards already in place, coupled with the bottled water industry's use of enhanced learning systems help ensure the safety and security of our products. It also means that consumers can trust and rely upon their bottled water.\n\nConsumers across the world choose bottled water as an alternative to other packaged beverages when consumers want to moderate their calories intake and look for an unsweetened, clean tasting, natural product.\n\nThey sometimes also choose bottled water because they are not always satisfied with the aesthetic qualities (e.g., taste, odor, color) of their tap water. We are fortunate in Australia and New Zealand to have a safe water supply but natural events may cause service difficulties or interruptions. Many consumers drink both depending on the circumstances.\n\nBOTTLED WATER & THE ENVIRONMENT\n\nWhen it comes to environmental stewardship and container safety, the bottled water industry is part of the solution. We partner with other beverage producers, and environment authorities to encourage and build upon the kerbside recycling infrastructure. Consumers need to be further educated about recycling and have access to recycling points for collection of all beverage containers and other recyclable goods. To single out bottled water packaging is to ignore the fact that today's society demands and relies upon packaged food and drinks.\n\nAnnual bottled water production accounts for less than 1/100 of a percent (0.01%) of the total ground water withdrawn in Australia & New Zealand each year. The bottled water industry uses minimal amounts of ground water to produce this important consumer product-and does so with great efficiency. To single out the bottled water industry - from among the thousands of food, beverage and commercial water users - is unfair and just plain wrong. Misinformed focus of criticism on the bottled water industry does nothing to protect and sustain the nation's renewable ground water resources. Visit the web site of the Drinking Water Research Foundation ( for a study summary of the report, \"Bottled Water Production in the United States: How Much Ground Water is Actually Being Used?\" as an example of the impact of bottled water on ground water supplies in a western society.\n\nBOTTLED WATER CONTAINER SAFETY\n\nBottled water is but one of thousands of food products packaged in plastic containers. Australian Standards are in place and adhered to, ensuring the safety of all packaging used for food and beverages.\n\nBOTTLED WATER & EMERGENCY REPSONSE\n\nABWI and its members stand ready to participate in the development of solutions to better enable federal, state and local emergency response agencies to act with greater efficiency and speed with regard to bottled water distribution and coordination in emergency relief operations. The bottled water industry has provided millions of bottled water servings in response to Asian Tsunami emergency, events such as the cyclones in Queensland, and countless other emergencies that have interrupted the delivery of safe drinking water.\n\nBOTTLED WATER IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AROUND THE WORLD\n\nWhile governments and the private sector work to find solutions for the provision of clean drinking water in underserved communities around the world, bottled water is sometimes the most efficient and cost effective means of delivering clean, sanitary drinking water to communities in need.\n\nBOTTLED WATER & FLUORIDE\n\nThe regulations in Australia and New Zealand permit the voluntary addition of Fluoride to still, packaged water at a range of 0.6-1mg/L(total of added and naturally occurring fluoride)which reflects that of the municipal water supply in Australia and New Zealand. As a legal requirement, any bottled water sold in Australia and New Zealand which has added Fluoride must state clearly on the label that the product 'contains added fluoride'.\n\nThe addition of Fluoride to bottled water was made legal in July 2009. Prior to this date, bottled water was criticised for not containing fluoride and correlations were made between bottled water and increased cavities , which was only ever speculation. There is no correlation between the increased consumption of bottled water and an increase in cavities. In fact, bottled water does not contain ingredients that cause cavities and is often a replacement for beverages and foods that may contribute to poor dental health. The availability of fluoridated and non fluoridated bottled water products on the market increases choice for consumers to meet daily hydration requirements.\n\nThere are many sources of fluoride, and the amount of fluoride exposure varies greatly by community and individual. Consumers should look at how much fluoride they are receiving as part of an overall diet and should contact their health care provider or dental care provider for their recommendation.\n\nFURTHER INFORMATION\n\nMore facts about bottled water regulations, safety and other reasons for consumer bottled water choice, are available on this web site. Consumers have a right to information that may help them make balanced decisions about their drinking water and beverage choices.\n\nThe Australasian Bottled Water Institute (ABWI) is the authoritative source of information about all types of bottled waters. Founded in 1996, ABWI's membership includes Australia, New Zealand and South Pacific bottlers, distributors and suppliers.\n\nABWI is committed to working with the Australia New Zealand Food Authority (FSANZ), which regulates bottled water as a packaged food product, and state governments to set stringent standards for safe, high quality bottled water products. Additionally, ABWI requires member bottlers to adhere to the ABWI Bottled Water Model Code, which mandates additional standards and practices that, in some cases, are more stringent than federal and state regulations. A key feature of the ABWI Model Code is an annual plant inspection by an independent, third party organization. For more information about ABWI, bottled water and a list of members, please contact ABWI on +61 2 9662 4822 orabwi@bottledwater.org.au."

      "text": "Wednesday, August 8, 2007\n\nIs the Tide Turning Against Bottled Water?\n\nAmericans have long been sold on the idea that bottled water is healthier than tap water. I remember back in the mid-'80s there was a scare about lead water in Boston's drinking water, and despite the fact that you'd have to drink something like 10 gallons of tap water a day to have gotten lead poisoning from it, The Green Mom sent The Green Miles to the doctor for a blood test (I was fine). But isolated incidents aside, our tap water is just as healthy for us as bottled water. In fact, more and more bottled water companies are admitting their bottled water is tap water:\n\nPepsiCo Inc. is the latest company to offer some clarity about the source of its top-selling bottled water as it announced on Friday it would change the label on Aquafina water bottles to spell out that the drink comes from the same source as tap water.\n\nLast month alone, a barrage of news hit the industry: San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom banned city-funded purchases of bottled water; New York City launched an ad campaign called \"Get Your Fill\" to promote the benefits of tap water; and the U.S. Conference of Mayors adopted a resolution to bring attention to the importance of public water systems and the negative impact of bottled water.\n\nWhy the sudden swing against bottled water? Because while tap water and bottled water are a wash (no pun intended) when it comes to our health, bottled water is vastly worse for our environment. Think about it -- there's environmental damage at every step of the way:\n\n- The bottles themselves are made out of plastic -- a petroleum product - The bottles are then placed on ships or trucks and hauled thousands of miles to your local store, burning gasoline all along the way - Once the water is consumed, 90% of the bottles end up in a landfill\n\nYou can read more about the environmental impact of bottled water here.\n\nSo what should you do? Drink bottled water as little as possible. It's not hard. At home, fill your glass from the tap or use a filtered pitcher. If you're heading to the coffee shop, bring a reusable mug. At work, drink from the fountain (if your office cooler has a big plastic jug on the top, it's bottled water -- ask your boss to switch to a filtered cooler). If you're heading to a softball game, fill a reusable bottle.\n\nYou won't just be saving the environment, you'll be saving yourself money, too. Considering how much joy I get over saving 50 cents here and there at the grocery store, you can imagine how satisfying it is to save $4 on bottled water every time I go to a Nats game by bringing my own bottle and filling it up at the fountain.\n\nAnd if you're out and about and you need to buy a bottle of water, that's fine. Just make sure the bottle gets recycled, even if you have to throw the flattened empty in your briefcase, backpack, or purse until you find a bin.\n\n6 comments:\n\nAnnie\nsaid...\n\nI definitely agree that environment is a strong factor in choosing which products to support. I've started drinking water from a filter at home, although I do continue to drink bottled water on the go- and I still drink Aquafina- although it's true their water originates from a public source, it then goes through 7 additional steps of purification, which is outlined pretty clearly on their website. I do think it's unfortunate that more people don't recycle however- I think it would really help to install recycling bins for plastic alongside trashcans and in office buildings.\n\nI would like someone from the Arlington County health department (if there is such a thing ;) to recommend a type of bottle for reusing as a water bottle. By someone, I mean an expert, of course. Why do I ask that? I've heard that it's bad to reuse the plastic bottles that water is sold in because the plastic breaks down over time, especially after washing. I like to be able to clean drinking cups, etc. in very hot sudsy water from time to time. Now I do have a Rubbermaid type water bottle, but it has a disgusting taste and smell.\n\nDo you take a nalgene to Nats games? Has security ever given you a hard time about it? A few games ago I was passing through security, and the \"guard\" said that next time I shouldn't bring it because it's not technically allowed. I checked with Guest Services and they said it's banned under the \"no hard containers\" rule. But of course I see a dozen or more other nalgenes all night.\n\nIf they're committed to making the new stadium green, I hope the team/Lerners will permit empty nalgenes next year."

But a glimpse into the history and a stroll around the campus unravels the heritage that it embodies.\n\nDating back to 1914 during the days of J.W.Madley, the then special engineer who pioneered the existing protected water supply system, the Kilpauk Water Works holds several historical monuments and systems that were in use until a year ago. Inaugurated in 1914, Kilpauk Water Works was the first treatment plant for the city with 80 million litres a day capacity then. It was increased to the existing 270 mld capacity in phases.\n\nThe massive 60ft steel tank at the entrance is as old as the red-bricked buildings in the premises. The astonishing fact is that the 6.8 million litre overhead tank was used for city water distribution until a year ago. It was rendered redundant due to structural instability. The second overhead tank was built in 1966.\n\nA high-tension pump installed in 1936 still runs tirelessly to distribute treated water to the residents. A Metrowater official said that the 5 ml capacity pump has had only minor repairs.\n\nThe 14 slow sand filter structures still stand testimony to the treatment technology introduced by Mr. Madley for the protected water supply. The technology used fine sand, pebbles and bricks to purify the water, which was followed till 2000. It functioned along with rapid sand filter technology that used chemicals to filter water. This treatment method took over to meet to the increased demand.\n\nA 177ft chimney that stands near the sand filter structures is yet another prestigious monument of the treatment plant. As electricity was yet to come to the city, the early technology used coal fed steam engines to filter the water and the smoke would escape through the chimney.\n\nConstructed in 1914, the chimney was part of Mr. Madley's scheme and was actively in use till 1955. Now, a light fixed to it puts it to a different use by illuminating the area.\n\nSeveral buildings have come up during the course of years. But they have been built with care to resemble the heritage buildings, which add beauty to the Kilpauk treatment plant."

      "text": "Report points to inadequacy of school water-quality testing\n\nAccording to a recent AP study, many of the country's schools are serving up drinking water contaminated with bacteria, lead, pesticides and other toxins. But the study was as interesting for what it couldn't report as for what it did report: Only districts that have their own water supplies are required to test their water, noted the AP–so many schools don't even know if their water contains contaminants.\n\nScientist pointed out that the ominous mix of children (who are more susceptible to toxins than adults) and aging school pipes makes a strong argument for overhauling the regulatory system.\n\nIn schools with lead-soldered pipes, the metal sometimes flakes off into drinking water. Lead levels can also build up as water sits stagnant over weekends and holidays.\n\nSchools that get water from local utilities are not required to test for toxins because the EPA already regulates water providers. That means there is no way to ensure detection of contaminants caused by schools' own plumbing.\n\nBut voluntary tests in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Seattle and Los Angeles have found dangerous levels of lead in recent years. And experts warn the real risk to schoolchildren is going unreported.\n\n\"I really suspect the level of exposure to lead and other metals at schools is underestimated,\" said Michael Schock, a corrosion expert with the EPA in Cincinnati. \"You just don't know what is going on in the places you don't sample.\"\n\nSeveral of the Colorado violations occurred repeatedly at the same schools or districts, according to the EPA data. The Lowell Whiteman School, a boarding and day school in Steamboat Springs, for example, shows eight violations of the surface water treatment rule in the last 10 years. The surface water treatment rule requires disinfection and filtration for drinking water that comes from surface water sources such as rives and lakes.\n\nReached by phone, Heidi Nunnikhoven, the school's business and building manager explained that the school's filtration system has been overhauled since its seven violations in 2000-2001. She attributed the school's one violation in 2008 to lack of chlorine. Nunnikhoven explained that a leak in the system can let more water in, throwing off the water-chlorine balance. The school now tests its spring-fed water system four times a day.\n\n\"I do think we have the best water that any school has,\" she said.\n\nOther Colorado school violations, according to EPA data published by the AP, were at the Edison School District in Golden, the Mountain Phoenix Community School in Golden, the Waldorf School in Carbondale, the Briggsdale School in Briggsdale, and the Cardinal Community Academy in Keenesburg. More information about these violations can be found here."

      "text": "No more draught…\n\nNorth eastern Australia scarce much in water and many projects were launched to improve the water level of this area but non was fruitful.Of this the importance was given to a mechanical process called reverse osmosis. What this process does is the desalination of salt water which is much abundantly available in those areas.But this process requires the cleaning, replacement etc of the semi permeable membrane through which the salinated water has to be passed under high pressure.Another method uses electric field to drive ions across membranes.But all this measures didn't worth much and owing to its high cost couldn't make an impact on water scarce areas.\n\nSo resembling the latter technology a new technology was introduced named CDIs technology ie the Capacitive Deionization Technology,here there is no need of membrane for the desalination process.It works on the principle that,in salt water the salt exists as positive and negative ions and the water is made to pass through oppositely charged porous electrodes,then the positive charges get drifted into the pores of negative electrode and negative to pores of positive electrode leaving behind a deionized desalinated water.Once the pores of the the electrodes get fully filled with ions the process is stopped and the polarity of the electrodes are reversed,then the ions get repelled and is flushed out using a stream water a real super salty brine.\n\nThe method was effective but the rapid saturation of electrodes make this process little inconvenient so researches began to increase the capacity of the electrodes.As a result , Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory made an electrode from conductive carbon aerogel,a material with surface area of about 260 million times its volume.Can you imagine how huge is that ie a grape size piece of that object has the surface area of two basketball court..really awesome..so that kind of electrode was able to work with out saturation for a longer period but these electrodes are prone to bacterial infections in water.\n\nSuper porus cabon aerogel secret of CDIs technology\n\nBOb Campbell CEO of California based Campbell applied physics was able to rectify this problem.His team developed an ozone based technology which could kill bacterias before entering it into the pores of the electrode.\n\nThe main reason that this method was not noticed was the high domination of reverse osmosis process in the market.Though the reverse osmosis process is much cost effective and efficient for water with high salt content like sea water,CDi technology is more suitable for inland desalination purposes that is needed more in many countries.Many countries have only started experiencing the problem of inland water salination so the technology is not emerged much.Australia is the country which is experiencing it much severely and they are going to implement this project soon.Will followed by many countries in near future.\n\nThough reverse osmosis is effective for sea water desalination it cannot remove Boron ions from salt water but this could be effectively done using CDIs technology.This technology will be a great boon to the world where pure water is depleting very rapidly."

The only way to be certain is to have your water tested.\n\nOptions for Cleaner Water\n\nThe good news is that there are a number of options available for improving your drinking water:\n\nBottled Water\n\nAlthough it's no longer the most popular drinking water alternative (41 percent of WQA survey respondents use home water treatment devices while 39 percent use bottled water), bottled water remains a strong second. Unfortunately, the variety of bottled waters (spring, purified, distilled, etc.) can make it difficult to make a decision. And bottled water is expensive, often costing more than $1 per gallon, and cumbersome to carry home from the store.\n\nCarbon Filters\n\nActivated carbon is used in a number of devices, including filter carafes, faucet-mounted filters, countertop units, and under-the-sink systems to reduce chlorine, VOCs, tastes, odors and, in some cases, lead, MTBE, and cysts. Systems of this type normally treat only your drinking water and don't filter the water used for washing dishes, hands, etc., at the kitchen sink. Filter cartridges must be changed regularly to ensure continued contaminant reduction. Choose a system that measures your water usage and shuts off to prevent filter overuse and alert you when a filter change is necessary. Most systems can be installed by a do-it-yourselfer.\n\nReverse Osmosis (RO) Systems\n\nReverse osmosis systems are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and the EPA as one of the most effective ways of protecting residential drinking water. These very popular, professionally installed systems utilize a semipermeable membrane to reduce contaminants. When water is forced against the membrane, a portion of it passes through, while impurities are left behind to be carried away.\n\nReverse osmosis is effective against dissolved salts, suspended solids, dissolved chemicals, and other contaminants invisible to the naked eye. When choosing an RO system, look for a unit with a high efficiency rating. Certain systems also employ a membrane rinse feature that cleans the membrane with the high-quality water produced by the system to prolong its life and ensure that it continues to produce only the best-quality water. Systems that do not clean themselves or that only clean themselves with untreated water are not as effective.\n\nOne of the most important considerations and one of the best indicators of overall system quality is the RO membrane warranty. Look for a system that offers a full membrane replacement warranty (not just a pro-rated warranty) that covers membrane performance for several years.\n\nLook for Certified Products\n\nNSF International and WQA certify water treatment devices and ensure that they perform according to manufacturers' claims. Look for the NSF and WQA seals on the products you're considering and review the list of contaminants the systems are certified to remove as well as the system performance data. Use the information from several products, as well as the product warranties and features to make an educated purchase decision."

(Photo: quinn.anya/Flickr)\n\nBottled water is healthy water — or so marketers would have us believe. Just look at the labels or the bottled water ads: deep, pristine pools of spring water; majestic alpine peaks; healthy, active people gulping down icy bottled water between biking in the park and a trip to the yoga studio.\n\nIn reality, bottled water is just water. That fact isn't stopping people from buying a lot of it. Estimates variously place worldwide bottled water sales at between $50 and $100 billion each year, with the market expanding at the startling annual rate of 7 percent.\n\nBottled water is big business. But in terms of sustainability, bottled water is a dry well. It's costly, wasteful and distracts from the brass ring of public health: the construction and maintenance of safe municipal water systems.\n\nWant some solid reasons to kick the bottled water habit? We've rounded up five to get you started.\n\n1) Bottled water isn't a good value\n\nTake municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.\n\nNow consider another widely sold liquid: gasoline. It has to be pumped out of the ground in the form of crude oil, shipped to a refinery (often halfway across the world), and shipped again to your local filling station.\n\nIn the U.S., the average price per gallon is hovering around $3. There are 128 ounces in a gallon, which puts the current price of gasoline at a fraction over 2 cents an ounce.\n\nAnd that's why there's no shortage of companies that want to get into the business. In terms of price versus production cost, bottled water puts Big Oil to shame.\n\n2) No healthier than tap water\n\nIn theory, bottled water in the United States falls under the regulatory authority of the Food and Drug Administration. In practice, about 70 percent of bottled water never crosses state lines for sale, making it exempt from FDA oversight.\n\nOn the other hand, water systems in the developed world are well-regulated. In the U.S., for instance, municipal water falls under the purview of the Environmental Protection Agency, and is regularly inspected for bacteria and toxic chemicals. Want to know how your community scores? Check out the Environmental Working Group's National Tap Water Database.\n\nWhile public safety groups correctly point out that many municipal water systems are aging and there remain hundreds of chemical contaminants for which no standards have been established, there's very little empirical evidence that suggests bottled water is any cleaner or better for you than its tap equivalent.\n\n3) Bottled water means garbage\n\nBottThat\n\nThanks to its slow decay rate, the vast majority of all plastics ever produced still exist — somewhere.\n\n4) Bottled water means less attention to public systems\n\nMany people drink bottled water because they don't like the taste of their local tap water, or because they question its safety.\n\nThis is like running around with a slow leak in your tire, topping it off every few days rather than taking it to be patched. Only the very affluent can afford to switch their water consumption to bottled sources. Once distanced from public systems, these consumers have little incentive to support bond issues and other methods of upgrading municipal water treatment.\n\nThere's plenty of need. In California, for example, the American Society of Civil Engineers estimated the requirement of $17.5 billion in improvements to the state's drinking water infrastructure as recently as 2005. In the same year, the state lost 222 million gallons of drinkable water to leaky pipes.\n\n5) The corporatization of water\n\nIn the documentary film Thirst, authors Alan Snitow and Deborah Kaufman demonstrated the rapid worldwide privatization of municipal water supplies, and the effect these purchases are having on local economies.\n\nWater is being called the \"Blue Gold\" of the 21st century. Thanks to increasing urbanization and population, shifting climates and industrial pollution, fresh water is becoming humanity's most precious resource.\n\nMultinational corporations are stepping in to purchase groundwater and distribution rights wherever they can, and the bottled water industry is an important component in their drive to commoditize what many feel is a basic human right: the access to safe and affordable water.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nThere's a simple alternative to bottled water: buy a stainless steel thermos, and use it. Don't like the way your local tap water tastes? Inexpensive carbon filters will turn most tap water sparkling fresh at a fraction of bottled water's cost.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nJoin the conversation\n\nThe three most common reasons given by bottled-water drinkers are healthiness, purity and taste. As we'll get into later on, the first two reasons are somewhat misguided, and the third is open for debate. For a seemingly basic food product, bottled water has generated its share of controversy.\n\nA bunch of tree huggers. How about all the people you put out of jobs by not drinking bottled water. By the way, bottled water is very FDA regulated and is much heathier and better tasting than most city water.\n\nActually the FDA is FEDERAL (DUH) and it only regulates bottled water that crosses OUTSIDE of state lines. Most bottled water is bottled and sold within state line. Most states especially in the northeastern US have at least 2 or 3 major bottling companies run by Pepsi, Coke, etc. So NO the FDA does not regulate bottled water. Read up on what the FDA does.....then you will learn. Municipal water has to be tested at least 300 times per month and more depending on population. I love bottled water for\n\nyes, very little regulation...and if every time something bad needs to change and people make the argument that people will lose their jobs, then nothing will EVER change and we will keep digging ourselves into a pit of pollution and disease\n\nIs it one lady? I know that they are HIGHLY underrepresented and are overwhelmed to cover everything. For more information on where your bottled water comes from, how people living near the bottling plants are dying and unable to leave the hazards teh plants create, and about the FDA, watch the startling documentary \"Tapped\" it's quite good and well done and has been what turned me away from bottled water!\n\nbottled water espensive?? I drink three gallons of water each week,that's 2€ (less than 2 dollars)\nI use more tap water than bottled water, at least 4 gallons each day ( shower, toilet, cleaning)\nwhat's the problem, sickness?? where I live the municipal water supply filters broke so people started drinking tap water that contained feces in it, it caused a lot people to be sick, and the municipal council had to give bottled water to everyone untill they fix it.\nif the problem is plastics or cans\n\nI don't care if my water comes from the same source of the tap water, tap water tastes awfull, in my country water is cheap, a dollar for 2 gallons of water, I idon't see the problem the water infrastucture sustains by home consume, bath,cooking, cleaning etc.\n\nthe plastic can be a problem since, they are not talking about soda drinks, or canned drinks that are more dangerous than plastic.\n\nMaybe it's because I grew up drinking well water, but I have always found drinking straight from the faucet to be perfectly fine. When I'm on the go, I sometimes will buy a bottle of water, but I usually feel guilty afterward(after all, I have a personal canteen I could use). My goal in 2012 is to continue improving on sustainable living, and totally abstaining from bottled water is going to join revamping my wardrobe(hoping to add vegan shoes/clothing, for example) as part of that overall goal.\n\nbottled water is a great alternative to tap water and the toxic chemicals tap water contains such as fluoride and chlorine two of the most deadly chemicals in the world\nchlorine by product are caused when chlorine mixes with organics such as leaves,dirt,etc and can produce such dangerous chemicals such as trihalomethanes chloroform is one of this family and mx both of these cause genetic changes in cells and may be carcinogenic, the treatment of municipal water does not remove these chemicals\nmishandling (\n\ntoo much/too little) chemicals at the treatment site simply put the chlorine,ammonia and fluoride added to municipal water during treatment are very toxic poisons and they pose aserious health risk if a human or computer error should under or over dose the water supply, ill take my chances with purified bottled water thanks ,i dont mind the cost at all if it rids me of these nasty chemicals\n\nWater itself is very deadly, don't forget! More than a dozen people in human history have died from consuming too much water, mainly into their lungs - the same way chlorine kills them. But, you can swim in chlorine without dying, and if you are very very careful, you can swim in water without dying. Also, next time you pass gas, don't forget to grab a gas mask and make sure all flames are covered or out since methane is extremely flammable. Nitrogen in the air around you could also kill you in\n\nhigh enough concentrations!\nThe fluoride and chlorine argument is null. It doesn't build up in your system over time and even if it did, there is no way to consume enough \"fluoride tainted\" water in your life time to kill you. There's simply not enough there. As a matter of fact, swimming in a chlorinated pool, you inevitably take in water whether or not you intend to, and the amount of chlorine in that tiny bit of pool water is over 30 times as concentrated as it is in tap water.\nPlease pay more attention to the information you glean from third and fourth hand sources, a lot of rumors aren't true.\n\nYou should read more on flouride. Qhile yes, flouride does help prevent tooth decay, flouride is poisonous to the body. Wonder why your tooth paste warns to not swallow, and to contact a poison control center if more than a pea sized amount is swallowed? There are numerous dangers associated with flouride, but it is in our water and tooth paste. Keep in mind tooth decay is an unfortunate result of age and dental health. Proper oral hygiene can help prevent some of the nastier effects of tooth decay;\n\nbut, it wont stop it. Now, i am not inherintley oppossed to flouride in water as its parts per million ratio is so small it is not likely to cause damage; I just don't want you to buy into this idea of \"flouride deficiency.\" Our bodies aren't designed to metabolize flouride. A small amount in tooth paste is really enough to help prolong or reduce the effects of tooth decay. I would rather people promote better dental hygiene than adding flouride to water.\n\nThough this information is true when it comes to most bottled waters, there are companies out there who are trying to change the industry when it comes to bottled water. Most bottled waters ARE just filtered tap waters, but not all of them. There are companies who offer a spring water, which (if you have a high quality spring) is a far superior alternative to tap water. No man-made pollutants, no chemicals, and no wasteful treatment techniques. And it still has all the nutrients and minerals that\n\nyou need.\nAnd for all the people who are talking about the testing that is done on city tap water, you need to realize that there are many things that are NOT tested for and that most states follow only the federally regulated tests (which the standards are pretty low). California has very high requirements, but they are the only state with such high standards. Hexavalent chromium is a pollutant found in many tap waters throughout the country, yet CA is the only state to require testing. Just because the test are saying it is clean, doesn't mean they have tested for EVERYTHING, just what is required by law. Most tap waters are from surface water sources, which all have high levels of contaminants and many ways to become contaminated.\nSo before you go and bash the bottled water industry as a whole and praise the tap water, know what it is about the industry that needs to change and work to fix those things. Bottled water isn't going to go away, but with the proper support, we can work to change it. Earth2O is doing so in a little town in Central Oregon. Check them out at earth2o.com\n\nNo don't bother finding out what the industry can do to improve, corporations don't have a conscience. Just make your municipality live up to higher standards. Buying water should be rare not what it has turned into today. We The People are really asking for trouble if we continue on this path.\n\nJH, you still can't argue that bottled water is a bad for the environment. To run a factory, make the bottle, distill it, put it in a bottle, ship it out to stores, run the stores that need it. A 1 liter bottle uses up 5 liters of water to make it. If it were just tap water that were bottled and shipped it would be 3. Plastic Bottles accounted for 2.5 million tons of CO2 emissions, and more than 17 million barrels of trash. So please even if water makers are trying to make better water, they use\n\nMany of the comments I read below people talk about their tap water being \"bad\" as the reason they will still buy bottled water. But most bottled water comes from local sources, i.e., it is tap water. You're just paying exhorbitant prices to an evil corporation for the same water you can get from your tap. If you want to have the convenience of a bottle to travel with, buy a nalgene or stainless steel or aluminum bottle and fill it before you go. That way, you're not supporting this horrible\n\nI love the way those with an agenda seem to try and steer us away from one unhealthful thing, by replacing it with another unhealthful thing. Stainless steel and aluminum leaches metal into the water, so how can that be any better for us? Glass is a much wiser option and the hell with any transportation/weight issues. More priority should be placed on saving the environment and our health at the same time.\n\nAnyone wanting to know more about the bottled water industry and how nuts it is, watch the movie \"Tapped\"..you will be amazed at what you find out. It is much like \"Food Inc\" for water...very informative and you will probably never buy bottled water again!\n\nAnyone buying bottled water is being scammed. The money spent is ridiculous. The resulting pollution is even worse. We have used a filter for a long time now on our faucet and the water tastes amazing. We used to use bottled water. I admit it. It is not easy to convert to tap but you can do it and think of the money you will save. We keep a pitcher in the fridge and I fill my camelbak with it for the gym and just to take with me when I go..simple as that. Save yourself some money and cut down on\n\nI dsagree that tap water is safer. The water has all kinds of toxins in it. Read the article/information sheet that is sent to your home from the municipal water plant. The fine print says it all. People with compromised immune systems, the elderly and very young should talk to their physician about alternate water source. I WONDER WHY? Fluoride added to our water for your teeth, REALLY!!!! read your tooth paste directions, should not be swallowed and young children should only use a pea\n\nsize amount with supervision. Why, because it toxic to the body so why in the world would you put it in your body. Western Europe has banned Fluoride in the drinking water because it's toxic to the body. Guess what, their childrens' teeth have not shown any increase of cavities. Each time I receive the municipal water's pamphlet they are allowing more toxins in the water. I saved quite a few of them and compared what toxin level is allowed and it's slowly increasing. What they think we can't read or compare. No I will never drink tap water only distilled water or purified water. I even give my pets distilled water and their health has improved especially the birds. The vet said do not give them tap water it's toxic to them, you shouldn't be drinking it either. Do your own research and you will be shocked as I was.\n\nBottled water is probably often not the best but drinking water is so important to health that I wouldn't not drink because only bottled water is available. The rule of thumb I have heard is: take your weight in lbs, divide by 2 and the result is the number of ounces you should drink in a day. For example, for a person weighing 160 lb: 160 lb/2 = 80 80 oz = 10 glasses (at 8 oz (250 ml)/glass)"

      "text": "waste and wastewater treatment\n\nAfter nearly ten years of legal wrangling, the Arizona Snowbowl Ski Resort was given the green light to use reclaimed wastewater to make artificial snow for the first time this winter. It is also the first ski resort in the world to do so, taking its water from treatment facilities in nearby Flagstaff, AZ. It's definitely a novel use for wastewater and, if it proves successful, it may help combat the stigma against the use of reclaimed wastewater in other applications where human contact may occur.\n\nUnfortunately, the first run of snow sprayed onto the slopes was yellow.\n\nFace-planting into a pile of yellow snow made from reclaimed wastewater is an icky proposition. Joking aside, the discolored snow raises serious questions about the potential health and environmental impact of spraying wastewater effluent onto the slopes. Some studies have shown that the effluent contains traces of pharmaceuticals, hormones and other chemicals which are not regulated by current water quality laws. The controversy is also complicated by the fact that the resort sits on a mountain that is considered sacred by 13 Native American tribes.\n\nThe managers of the Arizona Snowbowl assert that their artificial snow does not pose a risk to skiers' health. They claim that the discoloration snow was a result of rusty residue from the actual snow-making equipment. The snow guns have since been cleaned to prevent further discoloration of the snow.\n\nSki resorts have been making artificial snow for decades. In the face of a changing climate and increasing demand for fresh water, using reclaimed wastewater to powder the slopes may just become a standard practice at resorts around the world. Let's hope they keep it white.\n\nBacteria is something of a dirty word. They're everywhere, invisible and insidious, waiting for their chance to climb into your body and wreak havoc. But before you reach for your hand sanitizer and start counting your sick days, take a moment to consider the many uses that people have found for bacteria. Bacteria are essential in making yogurt and cheese, fixing nitrogen for our crops, and they help us digest our food. In the near future, Damian Palin would like to add mining the ocean to the list of things bacteria do for us.\n\nDamian Palin, a geomicrobiologist working in Singapore, has been developing bacteria strains that can be used to precipitate useful minerals out of the briny effluent produced by desalination plants. If he is successful, he would be killing two birds with one stone: useful minerals that would otherwise go to waste could be extracted, and the highly concentrated brine could be treated before it is pumped back into the ocean.\n\nBiomining is already used to extract gold, copper, iron and uranium from low grade ores that were once thought to be worthless. Using bacteria to mine for useful metals is less destructive and less energy intensive than traditional mining methods. As the global demand for metals increases, bacteria's ability to mine metals from unusual sources will become increasingly important.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency announced last week that they are planning to develop standards for wastewater discharges produced by natural gas extraction from underground coalbed and shale formations (a process commonly referred to as \"Fracking\"). This method of extraction involves fracturing rock formations by injecting them with a pressurized fluid consisting mostly of water, a little bit of sand, and some chemical additives as well. The debate over the possible environmental consequences of fracking is a hot button issue right now, and since its popularity has grown to the point where it now accounts for about 15% of all natural gas production in the US, it is understandable that the EPA wants to look into setting some uniform regulations.\n\nAny potential EPA standards in this area can be broken down into two areas: shale gas standards and coalbed methane standards. In shale gas extraction, wastewater is prohibited from being discharged into waterways. Instead, it is either recycled back into use or sent to a treatment plant. Unfortunately, many of these treatment plants are not properly equipped to handle shale gas wastewater so the EPA will look into standards that could be implemented on wastewater before it reaches the treatment plant.\n\nCreating a coalbed methane standard for wastewater treatment is a little bit trickier, since there aren't any national standards for it yet. Currently it is up to individual states to regulate where the wastewater is discharged and what pre-treatment standards to follow. The EPA is hoping to address the matter by creating a uniform standard for the whole nation.\n\nBased on the current EPA schedule, a proposed rule should come in 2013 for coalbed methane and 2014 for shale gas. This is to allow the EPA time to consult with stakeholders and allow for public comment.\n\nThe simple act of machine washing our clothes may be causing serious environmental damage, according to a new study from University College Dublin. A research team led by Dr. Mark Browne has traced a path from washing machine wastewater to abnormally high concentrations of microplastic debris found all over the world. The problem arises because the synthetic fibers that many of today's clothes are made of, polyester and acrylic, get rinsed by the machine. While we may not notice it, one cycle can strip as much 1,900 fibers off each piece of synthetic clothing! These dangerous fibers eventually make their way to the ocean and wash up on our beaches. Research also shows that the pollutants are eaten by mussels and locusts, which can then work their way up the food chain to humans.\n\nAs a part of this study Dr. Browne's team investigated 18 sites on six continents and through forensic analysis was able to match the proportions of polyester and acrylic fiber present in these sites with their proportions in clothing. They also found a correlation between sites with greater-than-average concentrations of microplastics and their exposure to washing machine wastewater.\n\nMicroplastic debris doesn't get a lot of attention now in the environmental community, but as the human population grows and synthetic fibers become more commonplace, they have the potential to be a major concern in the future. Since it is likely that any solution to the problem will include standard or experimental methods of wastewater treatment, including filtration (see Flat Sheet Membranes), we'll continue to look out for possible cures.\n\nWestern Biodiesel Inc. was fined $160,000 (Canadian dollars) yesterday by the Provincial Court of Alberta for releasing wastewater that contained methanol into the environment and for providing false or misleading statements to investigators. The fine is the outcome of an incident in October 2008 in which Western Biodiesel dumped around 16,000 liters of methanol-laced water onto its property.\n\nProblems arose for Western Biodiesel the day after this release occurred when an unsuspecting welder accidentally ignited the wastewater with his torch, causing a fire that luckily yielded no injuries. In what had to be an incredibly gutsy and foolish move, the (now former) plant manager denied the release occurred when investigators showed up. He was later sentenced to four months house arrest.\n\nSo besides dumping it in a river and hoping nobody lights a match, what are the actual proper methods of methanol disposal? Methods for extracting methanol from biodiesel include: Vacuum stripping, flash evaporation, distillation, and water washing. Methanol and especially glycerol are high-value byproducts of biodiesel production, so facilities try to reclaim as much as possible for resale. Membrane separation is also used as an effective biodiesel purification method, particularly for removing glycerol particles.\n\nMethanol is routinely used in biodiesel production during the transesterification reaction to turn plant or animal fats into fatty acids and glycerol. (Fun fact: Methanol is also a byproduct in liquor distillation and can cause blindness if ingested in large enough quantities!). European Standard 14214 specifies that biodiesel should contain no more than 0.2% methanol.\n\nBiogas, a form of renewable energy this is produced through, among other things, animal and human waste (hey, it's not like you were using it) is one of several developing energy sources whose proponents are exploring membrane separation techniques to improve their purification process. A recent study published in the \"Applied Chemistry – A Journal of the Society of German Chemists\" experimented with a new method of membrane separation called the \"condensing-liquid membrane\" (or CLM) in an effort to enrich raw biogas, which typically contains between 50-80% methane, to natural gas quality (at least 95% methane content), with favorable results.\n\nCommon membrane materials like Cellulose Acetate and Polyimide have been tried for this application with some success, but the problem is that they can be ruined by the aggressive gases that are present in raw biogas, such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. The CLM is a liquid (water in this case) layer that condenses on a porous hydrophilic membrane which then gets regenerated to allow for continuous operation. This support, made from PTFE, gathers water vapor from the biogas on the feed side of the membrane and is partially removed from the permeate side by nitrogen gas, thus allowing for separation to occur in one step as the water is constantly refreshed. One of the more brilliant aspects of the CLM method is that the presence of water in biogas, usually regarded as a disadvantage, suddenly becomes a key component in the process.\n\nSince the membranes are being preserved and not destroyed, the potential exists for this process to be a cost-efficient method of purifying biogas in the future. Researchers will continue to investigate the CLM method in order to find the optimal conditions that will make it even more efficient.\n\nVisit here to read the full report \"Effective Purification of Biogas by a Condensing-Liquid Membrane.\"\n\nTo learn more about biogas, try this site from Alternative Fuels and Advanced Vehicles Data Center and the U.S. Dept. of Energy.\n\nHow does a biogas plant work? Watch this animated video to get an idea\n\nThe Department of Energy and Savannah River National Laboratory recently published a study regarding their efforts to improve performance on cross-flow filtration for high level waste treatment. Even though the waste being treated in this case is actually radioactive material from nuclear power plants, the process they describe, along with the issues they raise and recommendations for improvement, can be applied to the more common uses for cross-flow filtration.\n\nThe stated goal of this DOE research was to improve filter fluxes in their existing cross-flow equipment, a common request of many customers. The study examines the problem of increasing cross-flow filtration efficiency from a number of different approaches: Backpulsing, cake development, scouring, and cleaning were all taken into consideration.\n\nAt the end of the study SRNL was able to draw some conclusions to take into consideration when evaluating your own setup."

To keep maintenance to a minimum and insure high effluent quality, the following items should not be permitted to enter the plant: Effluent is the discharge water from the plant that is applied to your land via sprinklers. 1. Strong disinfectants or bleaches, other than small amounts used in day to day house cleaning and laundries. Recommended cleaning products are non-chlorine, non-toxin, non-corrosive and biodegradable. Anti-bacterial soaps are strongly discouraged. 2. Backwash discharge from any type of water softener. Water softeners will cause an offensive odor and are discouraged with the use of aerobic septic systems unless the discharge is into the pump tank.. 3. Citrus products, coffee grounds, chemical wastes, paint or paint thinners, oils or grease (such as used cooking grease), pet shampoo, pet dip disinfectant, pesticides, herbicides, automotive fluids or any other toxins. Even in small quantities these substances can be very harmful to your treatment plant. Do not use commercial septic tank additives. These products usually do not help and some may harm your system in the long run. 4. Disposable diapers, tampons, sanitary napkins, large quantities of paper products, tobacco products, or similar items. Home brewery waste, strong medicines and antibiotics. If your doctor has prescribed you antibiotics the residual amount in your waste might harm the bacteria in the system. You might notice a foul odor while using the antibiotics. The system should restore itself in a few weeks after the medication is no longer taken. 5. Waste material from a garbage disposal is not recommended. Food waste represents additional loading the aerobic treatment unit would have to digest, increasing the intervals you will need the system pumped out. The food particles will also eventually clog your water pump, causing it to fail and need to be replaced. 6. Don't allow hair to flow down your drains into your septic system. The hair will eventually find its way to your pump and clog it. Clogging will cause your pump motor to burn up and a costly new pump will be needed."

      "text": "History of water disinfection\n\nHistory of drinking water disinfection The link between water quality and health has been known since the early ages. Clear water was considered clean water. Swamp areas were associated with fever. Disinfection has been applied for centuries. Two basic rules dating back to 2000 B.C. state that water must be exposed to sunlight and filtered with charcoal and that impure water must be purified by boiling the water and than dipping a piece of copper in the water seven times, before filtering the water. Descriptions of ancient civilisations were found about boiling water and water storage in silver jugs. To realize water purification copper, silver and electrolysis were applied.\n\nDisinfection has been applied for several decades. However, the mechanism has been known for only one hundred years. In 1680 Anthony van Leeuwenhoek developed the microscope. His discovery of microorganisms was considered a curiosity. It took scientists another two hundred years before they started using the microscope to distinguish microorganisms and other pathogens. The first multiple filter was developed in 1685 by the Italian physician Lu Antonio Porzo. The filter consisted of a settling unit and a sandfiltration unit. In 1746 the French scientist Joseph Amy received the first patent for a filter design, which was applied in households by 1750. The filters consisted of wool, sponges and charcoal.\n\nFigure 1: John Snow Figure 2: contaminated water pump spreads cholera\n\nFor the past centuries humans have suffered from diseases such as cholera and the plague. The origin of these diseases was misinterpreted. It was said that the diseases were a devine punishment or were caused by impure air or the alignment of the planets. In 1854 a cholera epidemic caused many deaths in the city of Londen. John Snow, an English doctor (figure 1), discovered that the cholera epidemic was caused by a contaminated water pump (figure 2). He prevented a spread of the epidemic by closing down the contaminated water pump. After that scientists have performed bacteriological studies to research the development, existence and identification of microorganisms and the removal of microorganisms from drinking water.\n\nIn the nineteenth century the effect of disinfectants, such as chlorine, was discovered. Since 1900 disinfectants are largely applied by drinking water companies to prevent the distribution of diseases and to improve water quality."

      "text": "The Only Treatment in the World Capable of Eliminating Scale\nand Biological Fouling Problems in Industrial Humidifiers.\n\nHumidifiers are designed to increase humidity by evaporating water at a specific rate, allowing the water vapor to be absorbed into the air. The concept is simple, controlling the effects are much more difficult. When heat is applied to water, evaporation occurs. The water vapor that escapes is virtually pure leaving behind the hardness elements that were present in the water. To make up for the water lost in evaporation, fresh water enters the system carrying additional hardness. This on-going process builds increasingly higher cycles of hardness concentration in the system water. Since water can only hold small amounts of hardness, fallout quickly occurs, causing scale to form in the humidifier.\n\nAnother common humidifier problem is biological fouling. Bacteria and spores are present in all buildings. These are microscopic air-born particles that are generally harmless. However, when air is filtered through the humidifier, bacteria and spores become trapped in the water. This can cause serious problems. Humidifiers act as incubators, they provide heat, moisture, and nutrients allowing bacteria and spores to colonize. In many cases this is identified by musty odors in the humidifier pan or vapor. If excessive algae and fungi growth can be seen in the pan. This can cause potential health problems to people prone to respiratory ailments.\n\nVAPURE is a single feed treatment program that will virtually eliminate the problems of scale, biological fouling, and odors in all types of humidifiers. The incredibly high bonding strength of this advanced technology treatment enables it to sequester 100% of the hardness elements in water and hold them in solution. These properties give VAPURE the ability to remove existing scale deposits while preventing new scale from forming, even at very high cycles of concentration.\n\nVAPURE will also control biological fouling without pesticides. Biological fouling requires a controlled environment of heat, moisture, oxygen, nutrients, and specific pH. Alter this environment enough and bio-fouling cannot occur. VAPURE works by altering two of these parameters. First, it bonds so tightly with calcium, magnesium, and iron (biological nutrients) that they are no longer available as a food source. Second, VAPURE does not effect alkalinity, allowing it to cycle up naturally with the system water. This increases pH and again alters the system environment. These changes in the system water make it almost impossible for biological fouling to occur.\n\nVAPURE is the most advanced humidifier water treatment in the world. It is easy to apply, very safe to handle, and will not leave the humidifier with the vapor. No other humidifier treatment can offer the advantages and performance of VAPURE, guaranteed."

      "text": "Running water Ultimate Study Guide\n\nTap water\n\nIndoor Tap – commonly found in the bathroom or kitchen. This tap is a single-handle, double-spout tap (one spout for hot water, one spout for cold water).\n\nTap water (running water, city water, municipal water, etc.) is potable water supplied to a tap (valve) inside the household or workplace. It is a principal component of \"outdoor plumbing\", which became available in suburban areas of the developed world during the last half of the 19th century, and common during the mid-20th century. The application of technologies involved in providing clean (potable) water to homes, businesses and public buildings is a major subfield of sanitary engineering. Calling potable water \"tap water\" distinguishes it from the other main types of potable water, such as water from rainwater-collecting cisterns, from village pumps (town pumps), or from streams, rivers, or lakes (whose potability varies).\n\nBackground\n\nPublicly available treated water has historically been associated with major increases in life expectancy and improved public health. Water-borne diseases are vastly reduced by proper sewage and fresh water availability. Providing tap water to large urban or suburban populations requires a complex and carefully designed system of collection, storage, treatment and distribution, and is commonly the responsibility of a government agency, often the same agency responsible for the removal and treatment of clean water.\n\nTap water remains susceptible to biological or chemical contamination. In the event of contamination deemed dangerous to public health, government officials typically issue an advisory regarding water consumption. In the case of biological contamination, residents are usually advised to boil their water before consumption or to use bottled water as an alternative. In the case of chemical contamination, residents may be advised to refrain from consuming tap water entirely until the matter is resolved.\n\nPotable water supply\n\nDomestic water systems have been evolving since people first located their homes near a running water supply, e.g., a stream or river. The water flow also allowed sending waste water away from the domiciles.\n\nModern indoor plumbing delivers clean, safe, potable water to each service point in the distribution system. It is imperative that the clean water not be contaminated by the waste water (disposal) side of the process system. Historically, this contamination of drinking water has been the largest killer of humans.1\n\nHot water supply\n\nDomestic hot water is provided by means of water heater appliances, or through district heating. The hot water from these units is then piped to the various fixtures and appliances that require hot water, such as lavatories, sinks, bathtubs, showers, washing machines, and dishwashers.\n\nFixtures and appliances\n\nEverything in a building that uses water falls under one of two categories; Fixture or Appliance. As the consumption points above perform their function, most produce waste/sewage components that will require removal by the waste/sewage side of the system. The minimum is an air gap. See cross connection control & backflow prevention for an overview of backflow prevention methods and devices currently in use, both through the use of mechanical and physical principles.\n\nFixtures are devices that use water without an additional source of power.\n\nPipe materials\n\nHistory\n\nThe earliest known evidence of drain tile being used for plumbing was found in Mesopotamia and is estimated to have been made around 3000 BC. The tiles were made from clay mixed with short lengths of straw. Both brass and copper pipes have been found in Egypt believed to have been made close to 2500 BC. The Romans made extensive use of lead pipe by joining sheets of lead into piping to carry their water supply and waste.\n\nDuring the Dark Ages following the fall of the Roman Empire, plumbing development virtually ceased for centuries except for isolated cases of plumbing installed in palaces and castles. In the 13th century, blacksmiths formed sheets of iron and lap welded the seam to create iron pipe. Though it is unclear as to when galvanized iron pipe was first used, a French chemist named Melouin is credited with developing the process in 1742. The earliest known use for cast iron pipe is for the water supply to a fountain in Langensalza, Germany, built around 1560. In 1819 the first cast iron pipe constructed in the US, was manufactured in Weymouth, New Jersey. Before that time, cast iron pipe and fittings had to be imported from Europe. It was not until the 1960s that the hubless cast iron pipe was brought to the U.S. from Europe by way of Canada.\n\nDuring the early 1900s, heavy-walled copper joined with threaded fittings was in use, but limited to public buildings because of its high cost. However, during the 1930s light-gauge Copper tube and fittings were developed which made copper economically feasible and increased its popularity. Copper plumbing is bacteriostatic, which means that bacteria can't easily grow in copper pipes.\n\nPolyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not become practical to manufacture until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. developed a method to plasticize PVC, making it easier to process. PVC pipe began to be manufactured in the 1940s and was in wide use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping during the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics manufacturers in Western Europe and Japan began producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The method for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was also developed in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have become increasingly common, with a variety of materials and fittings employed.\n\nPlumbing codes define which materials may be used, and all materials used in the US must be proven by ASTM, UL, and/or NFPA testing.\n\nSteel\n\nGalvanized steel potable water supply and distribution pipes are commonly found with nominal pipe sizes from 3/8 to 2. It is rarely used today for new construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (often known simply as \"galv\" or \"iron\" in the plumbing trade) is relatively expensive, and difficult to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader. It remains in common use for repair of existing \"galv\" systems and to satisfy building code non-combustibility requirements typically found in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications. It is also extremely durable and resistant to mechanical abuse. Black lacquered steel pipe is the most widely used pipe material for fire sprinklers and natural gas.\n\nMost single family homes' systems typically won't require supply piping larger than 3/4\". In addition to expense, another downside is that steel pipe suffers from a tendency to become obstructed due to internal rusting and mineral deposits forming on the inside of the pipe over time, once the internal galvanizing zinc coating has degraded. In potable water distribution service, galvanized steel pipe has a service life of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not uncommon for it to be less in geographic areas with corrosive water contaminants.\n\nCopper\n\nCopper pipe and tubing was widely used for domestic water systems in the later half of the twentieth century. In the early twenty-first century, the rising price of copper drove a shift to plastic pipes for new construction.\n\nPVC/CPVC - rigid plastic pipes similar to PVC drain pipes but with thicker walls to deal with municipal water pressure, introduced around 1970. PVC should be used only for cold water, or for venting. CPVC can be used for hot and cold potable water supply. Connections are made with primers and solvent cements as required by code.\n\nPP - The material is used primarily in housewares, food packaging, and clinical equipment,2 but since the early 1970s has seen increasing use worldwide for both domestic hot and cold water. PP pipes are heat fused, being unsuitable for the use of glues, solvents, or mechanical fittings. PP pipe is often used in green building projects.34\n\nPBT - flexible (usually gray or black) plastic pipe which is attached to barbed fittings and secured in place with a copper crimp ring. The primary manufacturer of PBT tubing and fittings was driven into bankruptcy by a class-action lawsuit over failures of this system. However, PB and PBT tubing has since returned to the market and codes, typically first for \"exposed locations\" such as risers.\n\nPolytanks - plastic polyethylene cisterns, underground water tanks, above ground water tanks, are usually made of linear polyethylene suitable as a potable water storage tank, provided in white, black or green, approved by NSF and made of FDA approved materials.\n\nAqua - known as PEX-Al-PEX, for its PEX/aluminum sandwich, consisting of aluminum pipe sandwiched between layers of PEX, and connected with modified brass compression fittings. In 2005, a large number of these fittings were recalled.further explanation needed\n\nFittings and valves\n\nPotable water supply systems require not only pipe, but also many fittings and valves which add considerably to their functionality as well as cost. The Piping and plumbing fittings and Valves articles discuss them further.\n\nRegulation and compliance\n\nBefore a water supply system is constructed or modified, the designer and contractor need to consult the local plumbing code and obtain a building permits prior to construction.56 Even replacing an existing water heater may require a permit and inspection of the work. NSF 61 is the U.S. national standard for potable water piping guidelines. National and local fire codes should be integrated in the design phase of the water system too to prevent \"failure comply with regulations\" notices. Some areas of the United States require on-site water reserves of potable and fire water by law.\n\nWaste water\n\nThe waste water from the various appliances, fixtures, and taps is transferred to the waste and sewage removal system via the sewage drain system. This system consists of larger diameter piping, water traps, and is well vented to prevent toxic gases from entering the living space. The plumbing drains and vents article discusses the topic further, and introduces sewage treatment.\n\nWater flow reduction/saving water\n\nThe amount of water that is running though the tap can easily reduced by help of small plastic water flow reducers (reduction between 15 - 50%). These flow reducers are cheap, they save money and reduce the amount of fresh water that is lost into the sink.\n\nComparison to bottled water\n\nIn modern Western society, levels of contaminants found in tap water vary for every household and plumbing system. A general conception regarding water is that bottled water is designed to be 'cleaner' than conventional tap water. However, in 1999, The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) released controversial findings from a four year study on bottled water. The results of this study claimed that one-third of the waters tested contained levels of contamination—including synthetic organic chemicals, bacteria, and arsenic—in at least one sample that exceeded allowable limits under either state or bottled water industry standards or guidelines.7 However, the bottled water industry was quick to dispute the claim saying bottled water is one the most highly regulated food products under the FDA regulatory authority and that the FDA system worked extremely well when coupled with the International Bottled Water Association's Model Code and unannounced inspections.8\n\nSome municipalities in the United States are making an effort to use tap water over bottled water on government properties and events. However, others voted the idea down, including voters in the state of Washington who repealed a bottled water tax via citizen initiative.9\n\nJames Workman, author of the book Heart of Dryness: How the Last Bushmen Can Help Us Endure the Coming Age of Permanent Drought and co-founder of SmartMarkets says that he doesn't believe that \"tap water is bad and bottled water is good\". Rather he cites differences in quality regulations and standards. \"Bottled water is often tap water put through another filter and not held to the same quality regulations as public utility water is.\"10\n\nChlorine is a disinfectant which is added to tap water in the United States. Chlorine can leave organic material like trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids in the water.citation needed The level of chlorine found is small, 1L of chlorinated water gives 0.2 mg of chlorine, which is too small to cause any health problems.11\n\nWhile most U.S. cities have what is considered safe tap water, contaminants ranging from bacteria to heavy metals are present in some tap water and violations of tap water standards have been well-publicized, such as the severe 1993 Cryptosporidium outbreak in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which led to several deaths and around 400,000 illnesses (see: Milwaukee Cryptosporidium outbreak). The University of Cincinnati recently completed a Tap Water Quality Analysis, funded by PUR, for major US cities.12\n\nCloudiness due to dissolved gases\n\nTap water can sometimes appear cloudy, and this is often mistaken for a mineral impurity in the water. Cloudy water is usually caused by air bubbles coming out of solution in the water. Because cold water holds more air than warm water, small bubbles will appear in water. It has a high dissolved oxygen content that is heated or depressurized, which reduces how much dissolved gas the water can hold. The harmless cloudiness of the water disappears quickly as the gas is released from the water.13"

However, RO also removes most minerals and\ntends to leave water more\nacidic.\n\nCLICK HERE for information on\nthe\nnatural \"Corrected\nWater\" remineralizing alkalizer\ncartridge that we have available to correct RO water if needed.\n\nThere are\ntwo basic styles of home reverse osmosis units to choose from:\ncounter top, which is popular\nwith apartment dwellers, and under counter (which could\nalso be housed in the basement).\n\nMore About RO\n\n\"Osmosis\" is\na term you may remember from biology referring to the passage of a substance\nthrough a membrane from a solution of greater concentration to one of lesser\nconcentration.\n\nReverse osmosis is forcing water under pressure through a\nmembrane, which excludes substances with a molecular structure larger than the\npores of the membrane. A home reverse osmosis unit operates from the\nsource water pressure.\n\nA unique feature of reverse osmosis, compared to standard water filter methods, is\nthat the molecules of water actually enter and become part of the membrane as\nthey pass through.\n\nThe membrane also allows oxygen through, as well as\nsome other elements with a very small molecular size, including some colloidal\nand subcolloidal minerals.\n\nThe pores are small\nenough to screen out radioactive minerals, fluoride, bacteria and even some viruses. Still, some\nextremely small\nmolecule contaminants can make it through, so a reverse osmosis unit should\nalways include other types of media such as redox media to eliminate chlorine,\nbiologicals and metals, and carbon to catch any organic\nchemicals.\n\nPrices on quality RO\nunits run from $170 to $800, depending on style and features.\n\nMost reverse osmosis membranes\nare of the Thin Film Composite (TFC) type. A Cellulose Acetate\n(CA) membrane may be used in special situations.\n\nSince\nsediment can clog a membrane, a sediment pre-filter is often included.\n\nChlorine\ncan also harm membranes. With chlorinated water, reverse osmosis requires a carbon\nor redox pre-filter to protect the membrane's longevity.\n\nReverse osmosis units are\nsusceptible to the growth of bacteria and mold within them when\nnot in regular use. These agents can attack and ruin a membrane,\nresulting in contaminated water coming through.\n\nRedox media preceding the\nmembrane will help prevent these microbes from getting to it.\nFrequent use of the unit will reduce the potential for bacteria\nor mold to get a colony started. A low bacterial count\nin the source water is also important.\n\nCorrected Reverse Osmosis\n\nReverse\nosmosis water actually has an increased oxygen concentration, as O2\nhas a small enough molecule to cross the membrane. RO water also contains\nsmall quantities of colloidal and subcolloidal minerals.\n\nHowever the reverse osmosis process\nremoves most of the minerals from the water.\n\nMineral devalued water if too\nacidic will draw\nminerals from the body when consumed regularly. The pH of\nRO water is often too acid for the human body. If this is the case, it is\nrecommended that a remineralizing alkalizer unit\nbe added to correct these problems.\n\nWe believe that reverse osmosis is\nthe best choice in home water purification. When the source\nwater has a pH of 7 or less, \"Corrected Reverse Osmosis\" is the\nway to go. It is recommended that you test your water with pH\ntape or strips (litmus paper) to or another method to determine\nif the remineralizing alkalizer is needed to correct the water.\n\nNOTE:\nThese RO\nunits are assembled upon placement of the order, and tested before shipping\na few days after an order is placed.\n\nFeatures of\nCounter Top Reverse Osmosis System(see description of TFC membrane\nbelow)\n\nThis portable\n3-cartridge Counter Top Reverse Osmosis System provides safe,\npure high quality drinking water with capacity of up\nto 50 gallons per day using reverse osmosis\ntechnology. (NOTE: Production depends on source\nwater pressure, which can vary.)\nA\nCounter Top RO is great\nfor homes, apartments, office,\nrecreational vehicles, motels, and laboratory use.\nOur\nCounter Top RO has 9 stages of filtration:•\nStage\n1:\nWater passes through Granular\nActivated Carbon (GAC) cartridge.\nGAC is universally\nrecognized and widely used as an effective adsorbent\nfor a wide variety of organic contaminants, such as\nchlorine• Stages 2 through 8:\nWater travels through a multi-stage cartridge with\nsix stages\nconsisting of a one micron sediment filter pad, Eagle Redox Alloy\n6500,\nEagle Redox Alloy 9500, ceramic ball resin,\nGranular Activated Carbon (GAC), and another 1\nmicron Sediment Filter Pad. This cartridge removes particulate\nmatter, heavy metals, chemicals, and residual\nchorine, and destroys bacteria, algae and parasites.•\nStage 9:\nWater\npasses through 50 GPD TFC Reverse Osmosis membrane, which\nremoves•\nWith our \"corrected\" counter\ntop RO, a \"Corrected Water\" sealed\nremineralizing alkalizer is\nadded as a final stage continue\nfunctioning well, it is necessary to have the\ncontaminants that are screened out flushed away. The\nflush water is only fit as work water, such as scrubbing\nthe floor or washing the car. This waste water should\nNOT BE CONSUMED or used to water plants.\nMost of the time, it should just run down the drain.\n\nNOTE:\nThese RO\nunits are assembled upon placement of the order, and tested before shipping\na few days after an order is placed.\n\nFeatures of\nUnder Counter Reverse Osmosis System(see description of TFC membrane\nbelow)\nThis thorough Under\nCounterReverse Osmosis System provides safe, pure\nhigh quality drinking water with capacity of up to\n50 gallons per day using reverse osmosis technology.\n(NOTE: Production depends on source water pressure,\nwhich can vary.)\nAn under counter\nRO unit is more appropriate for long term\ninstallation in a home or business that you own.•\nIn\nstage 1,\nwater travels through a 5 micron pleated\nsediment cartridge for removing dirt, sediment, silt,\nsand and scale particles. This reduces bad taste\nand odor and extends the life of the\nrest of the system.•\nIn\nstage 2, Water\nflows through pre one-micron filter pads (1 micron\nequals 3,water\npasses through granulated\nactivated carbon (GAC). GAC is universally\nrecognized and widely used as an effective adsorbent\nfor a wide variety of organic contaminants, such as chlorineCarbon\nis extremely porous and provides a large surface\narea for contaminants to collect. Carbon-only\nfilters must also use their capacity for chlorine\nremoval, resulting in a shortened life. They also\nmay use a bituminous coal carbon, which is good at\nremoving chlorine, but not as effective at removing\nchemicals. We use a high-grade coconut shell carbon\nthat is most effective at removing chemicals.\nCoconut shell carbon provides a significantly higher\nvolume of micro-pores than either coal, wood or\nlignite- based carbon. As a result, it is more\neffective than other carbon types in removing trihalomethanes (THM's) and other chemicals from\nmunicipally supplied water. Since\nour REDOX media removes the chlorine before it\nreaches the carbon, the carbon capacity is not\nwasted on chlorine and is free to concentrate more\neffectively on organic contaminants.•\nIn stage 4,Water flows through\nthe ion exchange resin, reducing heavy metals such\nas lead, copper, aluminum, and water hardness.•\nIn stages 5 and\n6, Water flows through a bed of redox media made of a special high-purity alloy blend of\ntwo dissimilar metals - copper and zinc. it is a\nmajor advancement in water treatment technology that\nworks on the electro-chemical and\nspontaneous-oxidation-reduction (redox) principles.\nChlorine is instantaneously and almost inexhaustibly\noxidized. Tests\non the cartridge have shown 99+% chlorine removal\npast 20,000 gallons of water. In comparison, carbon\ncartridges of comparable volumes drop below 90%\neffectiveness after only 4,000 gallons.Iron\nand hydrogen sulfide are oxidized into insoluble\nmatter and attach to the surface of the media. Heavy\nmetals such as lead, mercury, copper, nickel,\nchromium,\ncadmium, aluminum, and\nother\ndissolved metals are removed from the water by the\nelectrochemical process. They are attracted to the\nsurface of the media, much like a magnet.This\nmedia also inhibits bacterial growth throughout the\nentire unit. In fact, it has been shown to be\nreduced up to 90%, eliminating the need for silver,\nwhich is commonly used in carbon-only filters\n(silver is considered a pesticide by the EPA and, as\nsuch, must be registered with them).Is\ncopper or zinc added to the water in any significant\namount? On 2.3 ppm chlorinated water, <0.05 mg/l\ncopper and only 0.46 mg/l zinc were measured. The\nEPA aesthetic levels are 1.0 mg/l for copper and 5.0\nmg/l for zinc. Both zinc and copper are essential\nminerals for good health - the FDA recommends a\ndaily intake of 15 mg of zinc and 2 mg of copper.\n\n•\n\nIn stage 7,Water\nflows through another one-micron filtration pad for\nfurther reduction of undesirable particles.

      "text": "If you're dedicated to organic living and conservation, look for the WaterSense logo when purchasing or replacing a toilet. NSF International, a nonprofit certification agency, is working with the Environmental Protection Agency to verify toilets' water efficiency and performance.\n\nThe EPA launched the WaterSense program last year to highlight high-efficiency products and services designed to conserve water, one of our most precious natural resources. This voluntary labeling program is available to all companies that partner with the EPA and manufacture, sell or distribute household plumbing fixtures.\n\nThe certification process consists of product testing, which ensures high-efficiency toilets consume no more than 1.28 gallons per flush, while successfully meeting all required performance testing. According to the EPA, the average household could save enough water to supply a year's worth of drinking water to 150 of its neighbors.\n\nCertified products will be included on an EPA product registry and will bear the WaterSense label. Ongoing annual inspections will ensure continued compliance. A more detailed list of requirements can be found here (PDF file).\n\nThe WaterSense program is expected to extend to high-efficiency bathroom sink faucets in the future, with possible expansion to showerheads, irrigation control equipment and other commercial equipment.\n\nAdditional water conservation tips for consumers can be found on NSF's website.\n\nDid you know that children lose proportionally more fluids through sweat than adults do?\n\nAs a parent who embraces organic living, one of your top health priorities this summer is proper hydration, which affects children both physically and mentally.\n\nThe following hydration tips have been provided by Dr. Jennifer Trachtenberg, a board-certified pediatrician in New York City and clinical instructor of pediatrics at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine:\n\nEncourage your children to drink water at the age of 6 months.\n\nHold off on juices until after age 1 to help encourage the taste for water as a thirst quencher.\n\nTry giving your children water with or after meals, as they will be thirstier after eating. Today, bottled water comes in many convenient shapes and sizes for easy portability for families on the go.\n\nServe as a role model for your children by drinking water in front of them. Try to change your habits when it comes to drinking sugary or caffeinated beverages.\n\nDepending on their age, children need approximately 18 to 32 oz. of fluid daily, including water, 2–3 cups of low-fat milk and 4–6 oz. of 100% juice"

      "text": "This technology was invented back in 1996 as a simple biological battery charger. It is not a detox device and it never was, it is much more than that, if done correctly. It is not an ionic device and cannot cause detoxification through your skin, despite the numerous copies of the technology around the world claiming to do so.\n\nI am an electronic engineer and I can easily turn water black in a few minutes, especially if I add enough salt to the water. I can then say that the black scum (and every other colour under the sun) and precipitation came out of your body, but I would be wrong. You see the dirt in the water comes from the water itself and the water module and very little if any, from you.\n\nWater...\n\nWater is a very interesting substance, almost an element in it own right. When you apply electricity to the water, then the water through a process known as electrophoresis or dielectrophoresis will eject foreign substances within its structure. If you have ever seen your local dam, then you will have seen just how dark the water is. Your council then filters it, but it is still dirty, so they use chemicals to hide the unwanted colours in the water so that the water comes out of your tap at home, crystal clear, giving you the impression that the water is clean.\n\nThe Water Module...\n\nThe water module consists of steel rings and some modules, fence wire coils. The metals used in these water modules contain various quantities of Iron, Silica, Cadmium, Zinc, Carbon, Manganese, Chromium, Vanadium, Tungsten and some copper, brass, aluminium and if soldered, then also Lead and Tin and many other compounds. When you apply electricity to the water module within the water, the metals will break down causing a precipitation into the water and this is what the so called detoxification is based upon. By saying that the water contains heavy metals and other compounds after a session with the technology which came from you, plain simply is a hoax. The organic compounds in the water after a session would have also been there without the technology. A simple warm water foot bath would leave the same compounds in the water.\n\nThe Human Skin...\n\nIt is common knowledge that the human skin is NOT responsible for detoxification of the body, but that it does through the process of sweating, push out anything deposited in the outer dermal layers or sweat glands. The human skin is therefore known to be responsible for less than 10% of all bodily detoxification. What does this mean? It means that you would have to sweat continuously through your feet alone for over 200 days straight, day and night in order to detoxify as much through your feet as your would in ONE urination. So you see, you would be better of taking a kidney tonic and take a trip to the toilet.\n\nThe Many Water Colours...\n\nThe many colours produced within the water, although interesting, is irrelevant. Because there are far too many factors that affect the outcome in the water, such as temperature, humidity, altitude, barometric pressure and the lunar cycle, but even though the colours do not come from you, your body is immersed within the water, the outcome may be altered and depends upon other factors from your genetics, to your life's exposures, food and even your emotions. So it is interesting to note that the outcome in the water may change with each person, with every session and over time. But do run a session without a person in the water and you will get almost the same outcome. Does that not ring some alarm bells for you.\n\nThe Technology...\n\nThe original technology was invented in 1995-1996 and its ONLY function was to enhance the energy already present within the water itself. Hence the title \"Bio-Electric Field Enhancement\" or B.E.F.E. When your body is then exposed to the water, your body will absorb the energy much like a domino effect from cell to cell throughout the entire body like charging a battery or many batteries. It is based upon a bio-charge and has little to do with electrolysis or ionisation.\n\nSo here is my personal opinion on the difference between the original B.E.F.E. technology and the many attempted copied technologies and I am afraid that it includes most, if not all the copies.\n\n The B.E.F.E. technology enhances the energy within the water through what is termed a bio-charge achieved through resonance within the water.\n\n The copied technology alters the energy within the water, through ionisation.\n\nIf radiation and ionisation can alter food chemistry as is currently in use, what is to say that it does not alter your body, when exposed? Can ionisation of living tissue cause cellular damage through excessive free radicals created by the ionisation? If so, then the few articles printed below from various sources should cause you concern.\n\nWhy…\n\nWhy am I telling you this? Because I believe in helping people for the right reasons and I believe that you need to know.\n\nWe have seen one particular company at an expo using the copied technology and then we saw them six months later and we are afraid that it scared us. The appearance of the same people had become visibly pale and sick. One of the people with us at the time classified them as walking corpses. If as per the research listed below, the additional free radicals can cause genetic damage to your cells, this is something that must be addressed immediately."

      "text": "Obtaining Drinking Water From Springs\n\nA spring is a place where ground water emerges naturally from the earth's surface, usually along hillsides, at the base of slopes, or in low areas. The following should be considered when developing or improving a spring.\n\nLocation\n\nIt is easy for springs to become contaminated if they are located downhill from a source of contamination. For this reason, all sewage systems, barnyards, livestock pastures, fuel tanks, and other sources of pollution must be located at least 100 feet away from springs. Depending on the soils, geology, and slope of the land, an even greater distance may be needed. Also avoid extremely wet areas when locating a new spring, because saturated soil can't filter out bacteria.\n\nConstruction\n\nSprings should be constructed in a way that protects against surface water contamination and prevents rodents and insects from entering. If the property around the spring is sloped so that rain water can pool around or enter the spring, consider regrading or constructing a diversion ditch so that surface water runoff is kept away from the spring.\n\nDisinfection\n\nAll newly constructed or repaired springs should be disinfected, because the handling of construction material can contaminate the spring water. See Disinfection for instructions on how to disinfect your spring.\n\nGenerally, one gallon of household bleach is enough to disinfect a 10-foot spring. For overflowing springs, consider using calcium hypochlorite tablets as an alternative to bleach. Tablets can be purchased at a pool supply store. Be sure to follow manufacturers' directions.\n\nTesting\n\nThe spring water should be tested for bacteria several days after the chlorine odor disappears. Springs that are newly constructed or have persistent problems with bacteria should also have a complete chemical analysis. You may purchase test kits at the Vermont Department of Health Laboratory or by calling the laboratory at 802-863-7335 or 800-660-9997 (from within Vermont).\n\nBacteriological Contamination\n\nThe most common way to determine drinking water quality is to test for total coliform bacteria, which includes E. coli bacteria. These organisms are found in plants, soil, surface water, and in some cases, the intestines of warm-blooded animals. They do not naturally inhabit springs.\n\nThe presence of coliform bacteria in ground water (wells and springs) does not necessarily mean that disease-causing organisms (pathogens) are present. However, the presence of coliform bacteria means there is a pathway for disease-causing organisms to enter the spring.\n\nIf a water test results show that bacteria are present, construction of the spring should be thoroughly checked. In addition, the surrounding area should be checked for likely sources of contamination.\n\nDo not drink the water from a spring that has been contaminated until the problem is corrected, the system is disinfected, and a follow-up test shows that no coliform bacteria are present—or unless the water is boiled for one minute."

With the public becoming increasingly aware of the environmental damage that drinking bottled water is causing, there has been a high demand for clean alternatives for home use. Some communities, such as Rockland, Maryland, are even considering banning bottled water completely.\n\nOne factor that has helped influence this is the rise of home filters. These transform your plain tap water into a fountain of freshness, providing a valuable alternative to bottled water. If you are not convinced that it's necessary to start looking for home filtration systems, it's a good idea to examine the cost of bottled water.\n\nNearly half of all bottled water originates from municipal water sources in the United States, yet it costs 500 times as much as tap water that comes from the same source. The high price associated with this industry also includes plastic's environmental impact. It takes approximately 1000 years for each plastic bottle to biodegrade, with millions tossed into landfills each day. In addition, a large amount of oil is used for every bottle's production and distribution.\n\nThere are now a number of choices that you can make when it comes to providing clean, pure water for your home – without the environmental damage. This is an easy and cost-effective way to make your home a little greener.\n\n1. Home Water Coolers – One of today's top choices is a filter that attaches directly to your water mains. These automatically filter your water, and can also act as an instant boiling water tap.\n\n2. Pitcher Filters – If you're on a budget you can invest in a filter jug that can be refilled with water and left in your refrigerator. Another benefit of choosing this option is that it is portable, so you can have distilled water on the go.\n\n3. Faucet Filters – This option is similar to a home water cooler system, because it attaches directly to your sink for clean water on demand. You must change the filters more frequently, however.\n\nWith a wealth of options on the market, there's no reason not to enjoy fresh filtered water from your own home without the wasteful impact of using plastic bottles.\n\nGuest Post by Robbie Reddy.\n\nI think this little product is pretty cool. Just give it a gander and make your puchase soon!\n\nWhen Too Much Plastic is Way Too Much Plastic\n\nFact: 20-25% of landfill weight is plastics. Landfills are one of the most common waste disposal methods in the United States today, with an overall increase in Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) consistent with population increase. (more…)\n\nIf you do not think that there is a movement beginning, you are wrong!\n\nA little town very close to me here in deep East Texas, Lindale, has decided\nthey need to develop some opportunities to grow the city. They are now working\nwith Decker Energy International, Inc., a Florida based privately held company,\nto assist them in building a 35-50 megawatt wood-fired biomass power plant.\nThis plant will have 25 full time jobs. Along with more jobs to build it. Yeah!\n\nThe proposed site is 43 acres that is currently owned by the Lindale Economic\nDevelopment Corporation (LEDC) which will also be part of the Lindale\nIndustrial Park. This project will cost the city about $130 million. (more…)"

When this stable, non-seasonal, freshwater source is disposed to the ocean or to deep saltwater aquifers, impurities are increased by a factor of almost 100. Most of this material is salt, which requires extremely high energy to remove, by either reverse osmosis or distillation, if the water is then withdrawn for water supply. Why not save that energy and reuse the treated water, which has approximately the required volume and quality needed to supply urban demand. In addition, several percent of total energy consumption in California is used for water conveyance, and this energy can be saved through low-energy, on-site water reuse. In fact, doing so would:\n\nAlleviate the need to treat for 11 billion lbs. of pesticides and toxic chemicals that are released to the environment each year in the US;\n\nAllow treatment to focus on permanently destroying the pharmaceuticals and cleaning chemicals that go down our drains, removing them from the environment where they cause endocrine disruption in animals and humans throughout the world. In fact, studies indicate that 20% of male black bass in the US are feminized by such chemicals (Journal of Environmental Monitoring, 10, 1499-1518, 2008), and girls in the US now often reach puberty by age 7 (Environmental Health Perspectives, 108, 2000); and\n\nSave energy used for conveyance and desalination, and replace water rationing and low-flow fixtures.\n\nHow can we achieve this? Here you will find information on a project to rethink the way we handle wastewater and water. We are developing the technology to take buildings off the water grid without raising the cost of high quality water. With modern communications, routine maintenance can be performed remotely and by mobile service personnel annually and in response to system monitors.\n\nThis project, funded by the National Science Foundation for 4 years, will demonstrate the approach at a 20-bed unit in Eaton Residential College at the University of Miami. The unique low-energy treatment system under development will incorporate a biological trreatment, iron-mediated aeration/ ultrafiltration, and advanced oxidation with rainwater makeup, avoiding the use of high-energy membrane treatment. In two further research thrusts we are (a) studying social motivations for adoption of net-zero water technology, and (b) developing real-time risk detection technology using machine learning and evidence processing techniques.\n\nPlease browse our site to learn more about the project, our academic, industrial, and government partners, and future events including radio shows and tours.

      "text": "Answer: Inorganic compounds, synthetic organic compounds and volatile organic contaminants are every 3 years. Bacteria samples are taken monthly. There are 90 monthly sampling locations based on population criteria set by DEQ .\n\nQuestion: What is the fluoride content of the water?\n\nAnswer: Less than 1mg/L (1 milligram per liter is equivalent to 1 part per million parts). We do not add fluoride to our water; any fluoride detected occurs naturally.\n\nQuestion: What is the iron content in the water?\n\nAnswer: The well with the highest iron content has 1.34mg/L. The well with the lowest iron content is less than 0.01 mg/L. The average is 0.178 mg/L.\n\nQuestion: What variables may cause water discoloration?\n\nAnswer: Excessive Iron (Fe) and Manganese (Mn).Both of these elements in raw water generally occur in the dissolved state, the water is clear and the substances are not noticeable except for taste in high enough concentrations. Oxidation through either chemical addition or mixing with the atmosphere will result in a gradual color change. Without disinfection this may not occur until the water reaches the tap and is dispensed. The water can become unpalatable, stain laundry and stain porcelain fixtures. Tannic acids found in tea and coffee can darken the color to a point it looks like ink. If a disinfectant (chlorine oxidizes the elements) is added, or if either element is partially oxidized, the oxidized particles will precipitate out in the distribution. This creates the brown sediment that accumulates inside our distribution mains during the low flow periods of winter. Sudden flows by fire hydrant activity will dislodge this matter and brown water calls soon follow. The secondary MCL for iron is 0.3 mg/l. At concentrations above 0.5 mg/l, the taste is noticable and disagreeable to most people, and staining of fixtures is quite serious. Manganese creates brown spotting in laundry. A maximum of 0.05 mg/l is desirable. 5.0 mg/l creates undesirable taste.Source: American Water Works Association\n\nQuestion: Does Meridian chlorinate the municipal water system?\n\nAnswer: Yes, chlorination occurs just prior to water entering the distribution system. The well water is bacteria free when it enters the municipal distribution system. Chlorine is added to ensure that it continues to remain bacteria free from the time it leaves the well sites until it is discharged from the consumers tap. The following technical summary explains how the addition of chlorine helps assure that the water remains bacteria free until it is discharged from the tap. Destruction of pathogens is directly related to contact time. There are two types of chlorine residual: combined residual and free residual. The first amount of chlorine (example 1mg/L) is reduced during oxidation of compounds like iron and manganese. If the dosage is higher (example 2.5 mg/L) the chlorine reacts with organic substances and the ammonia in the water forming chlororganics and chloramines. These are called combined residual. Because it is combined with other chemicals in the water, it has lost most of its disinfection capability. At this point the water may resemble the taste and odor of a swimming pool. As the dosage is increased further, the chloramines and some chlororganics are oxidized. This process reduces the combined chlorine residual changes from combined to free available. As dosage increases further, free chlorine becomes available to kill pathogens in the water. Free residual is 25 times more effective at disinfecting than combined chlorine and without the swimming pool odor. The desirable minimum residual at the customer tap is 0.2 mg/L. Source - American Water Works Association.\n\nQuestion: How many customer accounts do we serve?\n\nAnswer: We operate two water systems. City of Meridian PWS # 4010097 provides service to approximately 26,000 water accounts. The Bittercreek Water System PW #4010200 provides service to 13 customers."

      "text": "Drink to your health.\n\nWater quality is a persistent problem for New England residents, and can be especially frustrating when the quality varies from street to street and season to season. A reverse osmosis water filtration system can correct most common water quality problems. Drinking water purification systems can be installed as point of entry systems or point of use, under-sink systems. Whether you currently have town-supplied or private well water, a reverse osmosis water filtration system can vastly improve the quality of your drinking water.\n\nMunicipal Water Supply\n\nCity and town water departments are monitored by the U.S. EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) and required to test and provide safe drinking water to its customers. The quality levels, in terms of aesthetics and mineral content, vary from town to town. While municipal supplies are generally safe, there are limitations as to what your town can do to provide you with the level of water quality that you personally desire. Quality can also vary substantially from season to season, which is why many customers with municipal water supply opt for reverse osmosis water treatment, at least for drinking water.\n\nPrivate Well Water\n\nHomeowners with private well water are their own water utility. We highly recommend that you get an annual comprehensive water quality test from a state certified water laboratory. Additionally, because of the uncertainty associated with well water due to rain and changing ground water, we recommend a reverse osmosis water filtration system for customers with well water. Utilizing reverse osmosis (RO) technology for drinking water is a viable option for purifying well water and a safeguard against many potential contaminants.\n\nHow a Reverse Osmosis Water Filtration System Works\n\nReverse osmosis water treatment intentionally forces unpurified source water against a synthetic membrane using line water pressure. The pores of a RO membrane are approx. .0005 micron in size, which is smaller than a bacteria or virus (a typical virus ranges from .02 to .4 micron in size). Only molecules of water dissolve and diffuse through the unique membrane material, forming pure water on the other side of the membrane. This purified water is held in the storage tank where the system is installed.\n\nPoint of Use or Remotely Located Point of Use\n\nThe reverse osmosis water treatment system can be installed either under the kitchen sink (point of use) or in a remote location like a basement. A remotely located reverse osmosis water purification system will have a line running up to the kitchen sink that feeds a separate faucet. A line can also be run to the refrigerator, feeding purified water to the ice maker, and/or automatic water dispenser. View our residential water systems diagram for more information\n\nPre Construction: Central System Option.\n\nDuring pre-construction, Atlas Waterstems can design a central reverse osmosis system capable of feeding multiple points of use throughout your home, including kitchen sinks, bathroom sinks, wet bars, refrigerator water and ice dispensers, etc…"

Liquid household bleach also contains sodium hypochlorite, and is widely available.\n\nChlorine forms hydrochloric acid when added to water which causes chemical reactions which deactivate contaminants and reacts through oxidization with micro-organisms, organic matter, manganese, iron and hydrogen sulphideUnlimited amounts of water can be processed at a time, depending on the amount of active chlorine.\n\nSome users complain about the taste and odour that chlorine may cause in water. Chlorine reacts with organic matter naturally present in water to form by-products such as trihalomethanes (THMs), which are potentially cancer-causing. Lantagne et al. (2008)[1] indicate that THM levels produced during household chlorination may fall below World Health Organization (WHO) guideline values.\n\nThe use of household bleach products for household water treatment is not recommended in the absence of ongoing quality control testing, due to poor quality control of most sodium hypochlorite bleaches. If household bleach is used, the concentration should be regularly tested and an appropriate dosage strategy (2 mg/l for waters of turbidity 0-10 NTU, 4 mg/L for water of turbidity 10-100 NTU) should be developed by the recommending organization.\n\n- May not be effective at killing parasites\n- Taste and odor are unacceptable to some\n- Chlorine forms complex compounds with organic material which may be detrimental to health over time.\n- Chlorine degrades over time.\n- Contact time is required.\n- Most users cannot determine the dosing quantity themselves; proper use requires simple instructions from the manufacturer\n- Chemical dosage required varies with water quality\n- Chlorine needs to be purchased continuously\n- Chlorine can be hazardous if used improperly. Requires quality control process to ensure product reliability\n- Chlorine fumes and contact with skin are hazardous\n- Concern about the potential long-term carcinogenic effects chlorination by-products\n- Relatively short shelf life\n- Uncertain concentration and shelf life, susceptibility to gaps in supply chain, high transportation costs, and difficulty in dispensing precise quantities\n\nThere are several different brands of chlorine products that have been manufactured specifically for household water treatment. Each product should have its own instructions for correct dosing and contact time.\n\nLiquid household bleach products are also commonly used to disinfect drinking water. The strength of the product must be known to calculate how much bleach is needed to disinfect a given amount of water. Commercial bleach from the United States requires users to add 3-5 drops to 5 gallons of water. Some bleach bottles come with a top that dispenses by drops\n\nThe effectiveness of chlorine is affected by turbidity, organic matter, temperature and pH.\n\nFor high turbidity levels, the water should first be strained through a cloth or FRCIt can be manufactured in most locations since it can be obtained through the electrolysis of brine. Bottles can be purchased for household water treatment from many manufacturers in various sizes\n\nHypochlorite solution for household water treatment can be manufactured in four ways, in order of decreasing quality control: 1) chlorine gas injection into a stream of water, 2) dilution of higher concentration sodium hypochlorite solution, 3) dilution of calcium hypochlorite powder; and, 4) electrolytic generation of sodium hypochlorite from salt, water, and electricity. In all cases: 1) distilled or deionized water should be used for manufacturing; 2) the solution should be stabilized to pH over 11,9 to ensure adequate shelf- life of a minimum of 12 months; and, 3) each batch should be tested for chlorine concentration and pH. For national scale programs, it is recommended to work with a local company to manufacture the solution using high-quality processes\n\nSkin and eye protection should be used when handling chlorine solutions. Work should be conducted in a well ventilated area or in the open air. Trained workers needed to produce and test the sodium hypochlorite.\n\nWith the appropriate dose, disinfection with chlorine will kill 100% of bacteria and viruses, but is not efficient enough to inactivate pathogenic parasites (e.g. Giardia, Cryptosporidium and helminths eggs).\n\nA recent meta-analysis showed that chlorine reduces the risk of child diarrhea by 29%\n\nFree residual chlorine protects against recontamination. Most users cannot determine the dosing quantity themselves; proper use requires simple instructions from the manufacturer. Users often use less than the recommended dose to save money.\n\nChlorine requires a supply chain, market availability and regular purchase. It also requires quality control process to ensure product reliability. Sourcing suitable plastic containers to manufacture chlorine solutions can sometimes be a challenge.\n\nChlorine should be stored in a cool, dark place in a closed container"

It stayed green while the other one started wilting and turning white. I believe that plants have the ability to convert certain minerals and sustain better on it.\n\nYou can try this experiment with your sprouts, or do the same as me with the celery stalk - or even try putting your herbs in different kinds of water - just make sure you are only soaking the bottom and not the leaves.\n\nSharon, I read an article somewhere that confirmed what you found in your celery experiment. It was talking about all the controversies of Distilled and Reverse Osmosis water removing the minerals in water and whether our bodies needed those minerals. What it said was that the minerals in water were NOT what humans can absorb, but what PLANTS thrive on. They are minerals for plants to \"eat\" and not humans. So Distilled or Reverse Osmosis water (I use RO water for drinking and preparing food to eat) is the best water for humans to drink, but not for plants, because plants need the minerals in unfiltered water. Unfortunately they don't need all the other junk that the cities add to our water, but I think RP's suggestion is great, to remove the chlorine. I've heard this should be done for cut flowers as well, let the water sit to remove chlorine and your cut flowers will last longer.\n\nThanks for sharing your celery experiment.

      "text": "Septic Tank must be among the most vital factors in building or purchasing a dwelling. It's built to split up solids from liquids and also to process the solids to transform into natural matter and release the processed water in the drain area. The septic tank is the valuable aspect in the collection and process of wastewater. Septic tank is commonly utilized in household areas. Aside from its role as a storage collection the procedure given by the septic tank is significant in discarding a strained clear liquid prior to it being released to the drain area. The treated fluid discarded from the septic tank is gentle and could be easily processed by aerobic and anaerobic bacteria when it's released from the drain area. In this era in which there are more higher technology available septic tank is still commonly used simply because it is effective and is usually the most economical way of processing wastewater.\n\nThe success of treating wastewater in the septic tank is based on its watertight structure and construction. In case this will not be installed successfully there will be infiltration or leaks and malfunction of the system. The septic tank in itself is anaerobic digesters due to the organic bacteria present in the system. This organic bacteria help perform the process of digestions of solids that goes into the septic tank. As the clear water leaves the system when there are new inbound wastewaters there's usually no mixing of fluids that goes in and exit in the tank. The sewage that gets in and goes out is in a developing sequence. For this reason, the septic tank should have a sufficient dimension for its potential in order to guarantee its continuing utilization. The absorption procedure that happens in the septic tank is usually performed by the organic bacteria. Nevertheless, with the too much amounts of deadly toxins and also heavy metals use in houses and if mixed with the wastewater that comes into the septic tank these organic bacteria perishes and will delay the efficiency of digestion method. You may possibly not know about these but taking preventive options to lower too much use of household solutions incorporating major levels of substances can help in the maintenance and in ensuring the organic digestion processes. Select items with organic or conservative elements for your home use. These products are not hazardous to bacterial population in the septic system.\n\nSeptic tank which is effectively designed and built will offer an extremely effective process. Correct measurement is important to assure sufficient volume is accessible for the wastewater and also for the multiplication of sufficient population of natural bacteria. Also crucial in the operation of the septic tank is its structural layout and water tightness. They are crucial in the success of the septic system and should be done accordingly. One more essential element in extending your septic tank is the cleaning that needs to be accomplished continuously. However, septic tank upkeep is not sufficient. You should also be concerned with septic system protection as there is a chance of future collapse which might be fatal. A septic tank is a system to throw away and store household wastewater. Septic tank is installed underground and is effective self-contained sewage solution system. They are required to be installed in every home when they are not linked to the centralized sewer system. To prevent this from transpiring it's an obligation on your behalf to do it right in the first place and maintain a Septic Tank. To maintain Septic Tanks you need to avoid excessive use of water by spacing your water consumption evenly during the entire week.\n\nA Septic Tank is a system to dispose and store household wastewater. Septic tank is constructed underground and is also very effective self-contained waste treatment system. They are required to be placed in every home if they are not connected to the centralized sewer system. Septic tank is often affordable due to the uncomplicated design and more cost effective installation and straightforward repair. Septic tank system won't need installation of long sewer pipes that means it is more affordable and much less disruptive to the environment. Septic tank system is a natural means to deal with sewage because of the natural germs present in the system that break down the solids. The septic tank is a concrete box which includes an inlet and an outlet line. From the residence where the wastewater flows through the sewer pipe and into the septic tank. Once the wastewater enters into the septic tank it forms three tiers that splits the solids from the water. The upper layer is where the solids are including oil and grease that are lighter than the liquids. The middle level is the liquid clear water and the bottom level is the solids that are heavier than the liquid. The liquid is what travels to the drain field. The solids are going to be decayed easily by the bacteria existing in the septic system where it will be liquefied until such period that the liquefied form will go into the middle layer and also disposed to the drain area. From the drain area the water will be filtered by the rocks and soil which is natural filters until it passes to the deeper terrain as a clean water.\n\nAs time passed eventually your septic tank may reach its full potential that would need you to have it emptied and pumped. There are many solutions however that can help speed the digestion process in your septic system especially in case the septic tank is overly used as a result of excessive wastewater that is disposed. These biological products if applied on a regular basis will definitely prolong the life of your septic tank and minimize the draining process. Nevertheless, in the event that there are critical circumstances that even after application of these enhancing solutions are completed and still the problem was not treated in that case your septic tank has to be pumped out and drained. To stop this from occurring it is a responsibility on your behalf to get it done in the first place and protect it. Make certain that the design and also the construction of the septic tank is successfully done. The size of the septic tank must correspond on the amount of wastewater that it can cater for the size of the household. At some circumstances the design plan should be authorized by the government and should be built by a professional registered installer.\n\nTo maintain your septic tank you need to avoid too much use of water by spacing your water usage evenly through the entire week. Stop putting products with heavy compounds, as well as unhealthy substances such as paint thinner, pesticides and do not use too much amount of detergents or cleaners that can disrupt the organic biological approach to decaying solids inside the septic tank. Sewage treatment plants including septic tank eliminate those characteristics and constituents that are objectionable and present a threat to public health, safety, and the environment. Disinfection is a final treatment in the sewage treatment plants including Septic Tanks before the discharge of treated sewage and wastewater into the natural environment.\n\nA Septic Tank is a concrete storage space built below terrain where human waste is stored. As the solids are disintegrated, they dissolve and send out fumes. The septic system is provided by a vent usually found at the roof of the houses where the emitted gases goes out and the liquid goes to the drain field. Septic tanks are designed to last for a very long time. They are made to function appropriately without human intervention. They work as a storage space for the unending supply of sewages from the households. Septic tanks are the primary option of officials and regulators because they have worked so well alongside centralized public wastewater system in which commercial businesses are connected.\n\nIn the future septic tank might face problems. This could be that the soil where the septic tank was built is not best for the system. In case the septic tank was created on a moistened ground this might result in failure to operate during the stormy weather that might poison the groundwater. In the long run the groundwater will then pollute the community rivers, canals, creeks, wells and nearby beds. One more issue is in case the installer might not have built it properly. The incorrect construction including incorrect leveling of the lateral pipe lines that sends the circulation of water to the drain field. The shallow setting of the drain across the septic tank particularly if it had been positioned on a moist ground could empty the water to the channels and ditches that can be a cause of smog. The contaminated wastewater may lead to the groundwater. Another issue is due to the use of too much anti microbial cleaning products by the families that destroys the microorganisms that decompose the organic solids. Fats, natural oils and greases being disposed to septic system may also contribute to eliminate these natural killing bacteria. The solids which are not liquefied might go into the drain area in the form of bio-mat or black like materials that might cause clogging of the drain area. This might also create bad smell and pollute the oxygen. However, your septic tank system might be recovered and could run perfectly again by using treatment method that consists of enzymes that will help in the decay of the solids. Septic tank usually is made of cement, dug up into the ground and that acts as the storage area for family's dirt. Wastes from your bathrooms, sinks, showers, and often from your washing machines are disposed in septic tank. In making the proportions of your septic tank it will depend on the place it is serving that's why it can vary. The typical dimensions of septic tank is ranging from a thousand gallons to 30,000 gallons in size. You can find 3 layers of septic tank. As soon as dirts get into the septic tank it is split up between the primary level, the center layer as well as the base layer. The main level is known as the scum layer, the middle level is known as the effluent layer and the bottom layer is recognized as the sludge layer. The middle effluent layer is also the clear layer will be going to the leaching location. Because the liquid go through the draining field the aerobic bacteria and anaerobic germs turn the liquid into non-toxic water as well as carbon dioxide so it will make the fluid nontoxic before it's going through the deeper water area. One other treatment for Septic Tank that might be used if your septic tank fails is the high bacteria count shock treatments. By natural methods Septic Tanks structure processes alone.\n\nA Septic Tank is a concrete storage space built below terrain where waste is placed. In this system the solids and liquids are divided.

In the future the groundwater will then pollute the community rivers, waterways, creeks, wells and also nearby beds. One more issue is in case the installer might not have built it properly. The incorrect construction such as incorrect leveling of the lateral drain lines that directs the flow of water to the drain field. The low position of the drain across the septic tank particularly if it had been positioned on a moist ground could empty the liquid to the streams and also ditches that can be a reason for pollution. The polluted wastewater may lead to the groundwater. One other issue is due to the use of too much anti microbial cleaning products by the families that destroys the germs that decompose the organic solids. Fats, oils and greases being disposed to septic system might also contribute to eliminate these natural killing bacteria. The solids which are not liquefied may go into the drain area by means of bio-mat or black like materials that might cause clogging of the drain area. This might also create foul odor and contaminate the atmosphere. However, your septic tank system may be recovered and could run perfectly again by using treatment method that consists of enzymes that will help in the decay of the solids. Regular monthly use of these kinds of solutions will assure that your septic system will be back in its original objective.\n\nIt is a requirement that each and every home should have septic tank for sanitary uses specifically in places where there aren't any integrated wastewater sewage services. Septic tank normally is made out of concrete, excavated into the surface and which serves as the storage space for family's sewage. Wastes from your lavatories, kitchen sinks, showers, and in most cases from your washing machines are disposed in septic tank. In establishing the dimensions of your septic tank it would depend on the area it is serving hence it varies. The regular proportions of septic tank is anywhere from one thousand gallons to 30,000 gallons in size. There are three levels of septic tank. Once wastes enter into the septic tank it's separated between the top layer, the middle level and the bottom layer. Another solution for Septic Tank that could be utilized if the septic tank breaks down is the high bacteria count shock treatment methods. By natural means Septic Tanks system operates on its own.\n\nA Septic Tank is a solid storage situated below ground where sewage is kept. Septic tank in general is constructed from solid, dug up into the terrain and which functions as the storage for household wastes. Wastes from your toilets, sinks, showers, and sometimes from your washers are disposed in septic tank. In building the size of your septic tank it depends on the room it is serving that is why it will vary. The average size of septic tank is between 1000 gallons to 30,000 gallons in size. There are also about three layers of septic tank. If sewage get into the septic tank it's segregated between the top layer, the center level and also the end level. The main layer is recognized as the scum layer, the center layer is called the effluent layer and the base level is referred to as the sludge layer. The center effluent layer is usually the clear layer will lead to the leaching field. Since the fluid move through the leaching area the aerobic germs and anaerobic germs turn the fluid into non-toxic water and also carbon dioxide therefore causing the water safe before it goes through the much deeper water table. The water becomes filtered and therefore it is not going to infect the groundwater.\n\nWith regards to the scum layer and the sludge layer of the septic tank the organic biological bacteria which is found in all septic tank system and will convert this into the effluent layer and thereby will also lead to the draining location. When new wastewater enters into the septic tank system, the sewage that's already in the septic tank is pushed to be released into the leaching area therefore enabling these new wastes to have space for storage and the process keeps going. Septic tank is built to operate and process by itself and with gravity which means that you'll be assured that it's odor less and back-up free function. Septic tanks structure are likewise designed to have bends referred to as P-Trap where water that is clean is preserved to prevent the gases and also smell from backing out of your house. Those gases are actually harmful and very hazardous that produce bad odor. The septic tanks system is also provided by vent pipes running through a lot of the roof of the homes. These vent tubes work as the passageway of gases and released in the air.\n\nAnother treatment for Septic Tank that may be utilized in case your septic tank fails is the high bacteria count shock solutions. Using this method it will make the digestion process to reactivate and break down the solids and bio-mat. Your septic tank will be restored to its previous condition together with the unclogging of the drain field lateral lines. The bacterial septic system method continues to grow and multiply creating a normal functioning septic tank system and is an inexpensive method instead of upgrading the septic tank which may cost you plenty of money. By natural means Septic Tanks system functions on its own. The microorganisms present in human trash referred to as coli-form helps in the breaking down of wastes. However, due to the numerous anti-bacterial agents that household apply that kills those natural unhealthy bacteria that should be good in the decaying procedure for these sewages. This can lead to problems of undigested system and may result in damaged septic tanks structure. But before it went to the whole failure of the septic structure that may cost much there are now powerful bacterial solutions on the market that has the power to rapidly break down and decay the mud."

For years, variants of the following alleged statement have circulated verbally: \"FDA doesn't allow filters because it considers them to be band-aids on a badly designed system.\" As a result, many systems were designed without filters, rooted in a fear that the US Food and Drug Administration would disapprove.

However, there is not enough evidence to categorize it as a stand-alone treatment plan.\n\nCan you imagine the number of law suits if fluoride was recognized as a health hazard?\n\nIndependent research studies have shown that fluoride has been directly linked to: kidney and bladder disorders; bone malformation; arthritis; skin disease; calcified deposits in the aorta; interference with thyroid function, causing hypothyroidism; and weakening of the immune system; damage to connective-tissue collagen, to ligaments, tendons, bones, arteries and even DNA.\n\nIn 1990 a 10 year study was completed by the federal government National Toxicology Program (a part of the Department of Health and Human Services) to rule out any possibility that fluoride causes cancer. Much to their surprise, bone tumors found in laboratory animals were found to be the direct result of fluoride ingestion. Even before the study was complete, the NTP contacted the Environmental Protection Agency to inform them that fluoride was carcinogenic.\n\nJohn Yiamouyiannis, Ph.D is a world authority on the effects of fluoridation and provides a wealth of information about the background and dangers of fluoride. He points out that fluoride at 1 part per million or less (the amount added to drinking water) inhibits the operation of over 100 different enzymes in the cells of people living in fluoridated areas.\n\nThe National Academy of Sciences, the World Health Organization, and others have published lists of enzymes that are seriously inhibited at 1 part per million fluoride or even less. At levels of more than 1 part per million, fluoride accumulates in body tissues. Constant exposure to fluoridated water will literally cause premature aging!\n\nIs Dr. Yiamouyiannis alone in his findings? Not by a long shot! He and Dr. Dean Burke (Chief Chemist at the National Cancer Institute) did studies demonstrating that fluoride added to the nation's water supplies was responsible for 10,000 additional deaths from cancer per year. Other scientists attempted to refute these studies but Drs. Burke and Yiamouyiannis were able to prove them in court more than once.\n\nDr William Marcus was Chief Toxicologist for the Office of Drinking Water of the Environmental Protection Agency. His opinion that fluoride in drinking water was hazardous did not coincide with the official position of the EPA. He was fired from his job. He sued for reinstatement and won!\n\nDr. Phyllis Mullenix of Harvard University's Forsyth Research Institute (a dental research institute) published a study pointing out that fluoride was more effective than lead in reducing IQ levels in children!\n\nA citizens' petition to prevent fluoridation of all of California's waters was co-sponsored by scientists of the EPA. In a letter of support from J. William Hirzy, Ph.D., we find the blunt statement that that the EPA scientists unanimously agree that fluoridation has \"virtually no evidence of significant benefits\", including tooth decay, but there is \"substantial evidence of adverse health effects!!\"\n\nIf you really want to find out how the fluoride fiasco got started and the power politics behind it, I would suggest you read the book \"Fluoride: the Aging Factor\", available from Safe Water Foundation, 6439 Taggart Road, Delaware, Ohio, 43015, The cost is $15.00 including postage.\n\nIt's a sad state of affairs when we have to worry about the very basics of sustenance, food and water, that we commonly give to our animal companions. However, it does teach us that if we truly want good health it has now become necessary to learn how to \"think for ourselves\" about the fundamentals of our modern lifestyle.\n\nChlorine is a halogen that damages enzymes. It does not belong in our bodies!\n\nChlorine potentiates magnesium deficiency, which can cause almost any symptom you can think of from high blood pressure, to chemical sensitivity or even sudden death. Furthermore it also decreases the absorption while increasing the excretion of calcium and phosphorus. The increased loss of calcium into the urine, promotes osteoporosis. On top of this some people still use plastic water bowls. These absorb and retain numerous toxic materials. Most breeders are aware of the chlorine problem in drinking water, but often overlooked is the fact that bathing in it can have the same effect!! Because skin absorbs it is just like drinking it!!\n\nIn some cities the chlorine level is so high, that taking 3 showers a day puts you over the government standard for exposure.\n\nAs always, the Europeans are ahead of us in promoting natural health by the use of OZONE treatment. It does a wonderful job, with none of the free radical damage to the body that is common with chlorine. There are many fantastic benefits of ozone to be derived from its interaction with the body! It sure would be nice if we could get our cities to also consider this!\n\nYou know that chlorinated drinking water is directly responsible for several problems including cancer in humans. What about our animals?\n\nAnimal studies by the Environmental Protection Agency have shown that drinking chlorinated water caused blood cholesterol to switch from high-density lipoproteins (the good guys) to low-density lipoproteins (the bad guys). Why the EPA doesn't inform the public that our drinking water is contributing to the number one killer in our country, I can't begin to understand.\n\nWay back in the May/June 1992 issue of Chemical Research In Toxicology, there is a report that ingested chlorinated water alters and destroys essential unsaturated fatty acids. When water is treated with chlorine the compound \"hypochlorite\" is created. This compound creates free radicals which oxidize these essential fatty acids and cause them to turn rancid!\n\nThese free radicals being created by chlorinated water not only decrease the body's ability to get essential fatty acids from food, but they also create dangerous toxins directly linked to liver malfunction, weakening of the immune system, changes in the arteries and even actually altering the cellular DNA.\n\nKeep in mind that the fatty acids that are being destroyed are \"essential\" fatty acids, meaning that the body must have them to survive and they're not something the body can make. They have to come from food! Of course if you are still feeding a typical commercial pet food to your animal you're probably not concerned with this anyway, since there's little (if any) unsaturated fatty acids in pet foods. They go rancid so quickly they decrease the shelf life and to solve this problem, most pet food manufacturers use either saturated fats or hydrogenated fats—both of which cause even more health problems.\n\nBut for those of you feeding a human grade, natural diet while providing a good source of essential fatty acids, please remember to avoid chlorinated water in your feeding program. *LacyGameDog.com"

The reservoirs will now be drained of their entire 600 million gallons of water. Because Southern California is currently undergoing a drought, the department says that the water will be used for irrigation, firefighting or other non-potable uses whenever possible. The contaminated water that cannot be used will be dumped into the Los Angeles River and will flow from there into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nA total of 107 tanks and reservoirs compose the water storage system for the city of Los Angeles. LADWP officials say that the city's water supplies will not be affected by the temporary unavailability of two of these. In addition to water use being reduced for the winter, LADWP says that the two reservoirs contain only one day's worth of water use for the city.\n\nWater suppliers are not required to test for bromate in drinking water, except in cases where ozone treatment is used.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency says that it is investigation the incident to determine if similar contamination could occur in other reservoirs, posing a public safety threat."

Water serves as the body's transportation system, it is a lubricant, it is vital to the body's biochemical reactions, it helps defend the body against shock, and it regulates body temperature. Maintaining a healthy water balance is critical.\n\nAll water from natural sources contains dissolved substances. But drinking water does not need to be pure to be safe. The only way to know if drinking water quality is acceptable is through water testing. Water from a public or municipal supply is tested regularly and must meet federal and state guidelines for quality. Private drinking water testing and quality are not regulated by federal or state guidelines, but local county or city requirements may exist.\n\nSituations in Nebraska such as tornadoes, floods, and winter storms can reduce or eliminate the availability of safe drinking water.

Luckily, you can treat hard waterquite easily.\n\nWhat is hard water?\n\nWater that has high mineral content is called hard water. Hard water is not dangerous to your health, but leaves chalky white residue in fixtures and pipes that, if not cleaned out, could damage your water system and hinder your water flow.\n\nHow do I treat hard water?\n\nTreating hard water is simply solved through the installation of a water softener – whether salt, chemical or magnetic. Although you have a number of options in regards to a method of softening, many of these involve salt and chemicals.\n\nThe water magnet method, on the other hand, is salt and chemical free, leaving your water feeling fresher and tasting cleaner.\n\nThe water magnet\n\nThe water magnet is a popular way to treat hard water. In fact, over 10 major industries across North America, from agriculture to local governments to hospitals, are benefiting from the services of Aqua Magna'smagnetic water softeners.\n\nIt works like this: as water flows through the magnetic field produced by the magnet, the natural bonding of the molecules that cause hard water is obstructed.

The biosand filter is smaller (about 1 m tall, 0.3 m wide on each side) and adapted so that it does not flow continuously, making it suitable for use in people's homes. The filter container can be made of concrete or plastic. It is filled with layers of specially selected and prepared sand and gravel. The sand removes pathogens and suspended solids from contaminated drinking water. A biological community of bacteria and other micro-organisms grows in the top 2 cm of sand. This is called the biolayer. The micro-organisms in the biolayer eat many of the pathogens in the water, improving the water treatment.\n\nPathogens – micro-organisms in water that make us sick\n\nSuspended Solids – dirt and other small pieces in the water (may also be called \"turbidity\")\n\nHow Does the Biosand Filter Work?\n\nYou can use any kind of water in the biosand filter – well water, borehole water, pond or river water, tap-stand water, or rainwater. This makes it very convenient for people because they can use whichever water source is closest to home, make it safe to drink. The water must not have been chlorinated though, or the chlorine will kill the biolayer. The water should also not contain any dangerous chemicals, because the biosand filter cannot remove most chemicals from water.\n\nContaminated water is poured into the top of the biosand filter at least once per day (but not continuously). The water poured into the top of the filter slowly drips through the holes in the diffuser, and flows down through the sand and gravel. Treated water flows out of the outlet tube. No power is required - the filter works by gravity. It should take about 1 hour to get 12-18 litres of filtered drinking water.\n\nPathogens and suspended solids are removed through biological and physical processes that take place in the sand. These processes include: mechanical trapping, predation, adsorption, and natural death.\n\nWhat can the biosand filter remove from water?\n\nThe biosand filter has been studied in the field and in labs. It has been shown to remove the following from contaminated water:\n\nUp to 100% of helminths (worms)\n\nUp to 100% of protozoa\n\nUp to 98.5% of bacteria\n\n70-99% of viruses\n\nThe filter can also remove up to 95% of turbidity (dirt and cloudiness), and up to 95% or iron (which people often don't like because it turns water, laundry and food red!). Like other filters, the biosand filter cannot remove dissolved contaminants or chemicals, such as salt, arsenic or fluoride. There is an adaptation of the biosand filter using rusty nails, called the Kanchan Filter, which can remove arsenic from water. CAWST has prepared a summary of laboratory and field studies for the biosand filter: Biosand Filter Studies – Literature Summary.\n\nThe biosand filter is best used as one step in a multi-barrier approach to safe drinking water. Different treatment methods remove different things from contaminated water. Although the water may look clear after filtration, there may still be some bacteria and viruses in the water. It is necessary to also disinfect the filtered water to ensure the safest drinking water possible. The most common low-cost methods used around the world to disinfect drinking water are:\n\nChlorine (liquid or tablet) Solar disinfection (SODIS) Boiling\n\nFor more information about the biosand filter and other household water treatment options, please see the following documents:\n\nDr. David Manz developed the household biosand filter in the 1990s at the University of Calgary, Canada. In 2001, CAWST was founded to provide the professional services needed for the humanitarian distribution of the filter in developing countries. As new research becomes available, CAWST periodically updates the biosand filter design and recommended operating conditions to provide better water treatment. The current recommended filter is Version 10.\n\nAs of June 2012,CAWST estimates that well over 430,000 biosand filters have been implemented in more than 63 countries around the world.\n\nTraining is essential to ensure the proper and consistent use of the filters in diverse regions of the world. CAWST offers workshops around the world to train individuals, organizations, and government agencies on how to implement biosand filter projects. Workshops will help prepare you to promote, construct, install, and monitor biosand filters, as well as how to educate users about filter operation and maintenance. CAWST's workshops are delivered in a participatory way, so that you will remember what you learn and come away with the hands-on knowledge you need to implement a biosand filter project in a developing country.\n\nCAWST also serves as a centre of expertise, providing technical and implementation support in project development, troubleshooting, education resources, network building, and project management for household water treatment, sanitation and hygiene.

There are straightforward, simple steps called protocols that you must learn to follow.

A dry run is important because people do make mistakes and the last thing you want is to have to re-sample after learning that someone improperly collected a sample for which you've already paid several hundred dollars for analysis (a professional lab will often send you sample containers after you pay up front for the analysis; sometimes they contain preservatives and can't be re-used).\n\nCourtesy of USGS Courtesy of U.S. Air Force Tap Water Sampling\n\nSampling water from your tap is the simplest way to test the quality of your drinking water. The basic procedure recommended for sampling water from a tap may seem somewhat wasteful, but is important to ensure an accurate sample.

      "text": "The taste of your water\n\nMy water tastes odd, what do I do?\n\nCustomers occasionally report taste and odour issues, there could be several causes for a change in the taste. If you get a sudden or unusual change in the taste or smell of your drinking water then you should contact us on us on 0800 389 1011 so that we can investigate.\n\nWhy does my water sometimes taste earthy?\n\nEarthy tastes can sometimes occur in water supplied from a surface water source such as a reservoir. It may also occur if the water has been standing in the pipe work for a long period of time. These tastes pose no risk to health.\n\nHow can I reduce the earthy taste in my water supply?\n\nIf you have been away from your home for a long period of time, flushing your taps for two to three minutes should help improve the taste of your water.\n\nWhat causes metallic or medicinal tastes in the water supply?\n\nMetallic or medicinal tastes can be caused as a result of a reaction between the water and the copper pipework in your plumbing system. The taste may be particularly noticeable after the water has been standing in the pipework for some hours. Back syphonage from hoses and fittings associated with washing machines and dishwashers can also result in a medicinal taste to the supply.\n\nHow can I reduce the metallic or medicinal taste in my water supply?\n\nFlushing the tap to waste for a minute or two prior to using the water for drinking or cooking can usually alleviate the problem. Boiling the water more that once can make any tastes more apparent, so it is advisable to use fresh water each time you boil the kettle. Also isolating appliances such as washing machines and dishwashers for a period, may also help to establish if they are contributing to the problem.\n\nHow can I determine the cause of a metallic or medicinal taste problem?\n\nThere are a number ways that can help you to establish the cause of the problem. Run the tap for a minute or two, before using the water for drinking or cooking to see if this makes a difference to the taste. If the taste is only apparent after the water is boiled, the kettle may be the cause. This can be confirmed by boiling a sample of water in a saucepan or in a cup in a microwave. If no taste is apparent, it suggests the kettle is the problem. You can also check with your neighbours to see if they are experiencing the same problem. If they aren't then the most probable source of the problem will lie within your property as the same water is supplied to all properties in the road.\n\nWhy is chlorine added to my water supply?\n\nChlorine is added during water treatment to maintain the water's bacteriological quality during its journey to your tap, ensuring that it is safe to drink. The very low concentrations of chlorine involved in this process are entirely harmless and continually monitored to ensure that the quality of water is maintained.\n\nWhy does the water appear to have more chlorine in it at certain times of the day and not others?\n\nOver a period of time, the concentration of chlorine in the water will reduce. At certain times of the day, such as first thing in the morning and late in the afternoon, more water is used. This can mean that the water may exhibit a slight chlorinous taste or odour because the water is reaching you quicker and therefore has more chlorine in than when it has been standing in the pipes for longer.\n\nHow can I reduce the levels of chlorine in my water supply?\n\nA good solution is to store tap water in the refrigerator over night as this will reduce the chlorine taste and odour. It is recommended that the water is not stored for longer than 24 hours as the quality of the water may deteriorate over time."

      "text": "Reverse Osmosis System\n\nPeople living in developed parts of the world are very lucky in that they often live in municipalities that feature wonderful luxuries such as clean air, green space and pure, clean and great tasting drinking water. Unfortunately, many people in big cities or rural areas of the developed world, and all over much of the developing world do not have the luxury of clean drinking water. They are often forced to boil water from the tap before using it, or, in the very worst cases, draw and treat water from a contaminated source. Lack of access to clean, pure drinking water is one of the biggest problems facing the world today. After all, people need 8 full glasses of water every day in order to thrive in the healthiest way possible. Luckily for people all over the world, scientists and engineers have harnessed the power of a natural process and created reverse osmosis systems to purify drinking water.\n\nEvery school child has heard of osmosis, often to the tune of a teacher or parent saying \"You need to study! Or do you think you can just sleep on your school books and learn everything you need to know by osmosis?\" Osmosis is, of course, the process by which a solvent moves from an area of low liquid (or solute) concentration to an area of high liquid concentration by passing through a membrane. The reverse osmosis system works exactly the opposite, allowing the liquid – in this case, drinking water – to pass through a membrane while the impurities remain on the other side. And that is how a reverse osmosis system creates clean, pure drinking water for people in developing and developed countries alike.\n\nReverse osmosis systems used to purify drinking water are a matter of fairly simple science. And important part of a reverse osmosis system is the filter. The filter, which works just like the membrane most school children learn about in biology class, traps particles such as dirt, rust, lead and calcium carbonate, that usually make water unfit to drink. Sometimes a reverse osmosis system features not one filter, but two. The second filter features smaller pores. This allows for even finer filtering of contaminants from the drinking water.\n\nOne type of filter found in reverse osmosis systems is an activated carbon filter. This filter is used to trap organic chemicals (hence, \"carbon\") and also chlorine. This filter is extremely important because organic chemicals and chlorine often attack reverse osmosis membranes and would degrade the functionality of the reverse osmosis system filter.\n\nYou might not think about the need for a lamp when filtering drinking water, but many reverse osmosis systems do indeed come equipped with a lamp. In this case, an ultra-violet lamp. These lamps are used for disinfecting the device and killing any microbes that may have escaped filtering by the reverse osmosis membrane.\n\nIf you are in the market for a reverse osmosis system, it is a very good idea to contact a water filtration professional. For one, water problems in every area are different. If you draw water from a well, for example, you may be dealing with a very isolated water problem, such as contaminants from an industrial site or a mineral deposit. A water filtration expert will be able to run scientific tests on your water and make a recommendation about what type of water filtration system you need. Reverse osmosis systems can break down under certain circumstances, so for the sake of you and your family's safety, be sure to ask a water filtration expert before you drink up after installing a reverse osmosis system.\n\nThis Reverse Osmosis System Review is Written/Updated\non Nov 27th, 2011 and filed under Home Appliances.\nYou can write your reviews and recommendations by filling following comment form to tell people about the best price and high quality Reverse Osmosis System."

If a family has a hard water supply, then they will probably end up using a lot more of it. Hard water is a term that means that the water has too much calcium and magnesium in it. While some people might just think they'll have stronger teeth and bones for drinking this water, what really happens is that they end up using more of it to do the same jobs. A better solution would be to contact a Water Conditioning Waterford MI company for help.\n\nIf your faucet water tastes metallic or has visible tiny particulates floating in it you would not feel too confident about ingesting it. Many homes in the United States have water that picks up contaminants and pollutants, despite the standard of drinking water the EPA—Environmental Protection Agency—places on it. These contaminants can enter the water during the time it travels from the treatment center to your home.\n\nWater treatment refers to the different methods used to clean water, improve its taste and make it more suitable for its intended use. This means that water meant for washing is made softer and easier by mixing with detergents while water for drinking is made tastier removing any unwanted particles or germs. Treatment methods differ depending on the intended use of water."

Thus, the plastic and glass containers that are used for bottled water products have undergone FDA scrutiny prior to being available for use in the market place. FDA has determined that the containers used by the bottled water industry are safe for use with food and beverage products, including bottled water, and that they do not pose a health risk to consumers.\n\nBottled water's popularity with consumers for everyday personal hydration and its leading role in emergency preparedness gives it an important place in society.

      "text": "The Terminox™ Iron Filter removes iron.\n\nHow does iron get into well water?\n\nIron (which is the \"I\" in Terminox™ ISM.) makes up around 5% of the earth's crust. When it rains the rain seeps through the ground and dissolves iron. The dissolved iron is then carried down into underground wells or aquifers. These aquifers are a very common source of ground water which is then used in people's homes. The dissolved iron can be in two forms: soluble ferrous iron or the insoluble ferric iron.\n\nDoes Terminox™ remove iron? Does it remove both types of iron?\n\nTerminox™ removes both forms, soluble ferrous iron (clear water iron) and insoluble ferric iron. The Terminox™ media removes the insoluble ferrous iron or clear water iron by oxidizing it immediately upon contact and then trapping it, thus pulling it out of your water. The insoluble ferric iron is removed in the same way, except it doesn't need to be oxidized as it's already gone through that process.\n\nHow much iron in my water is too much?\n\n0.3mg/l of iron in your water is where staining starts and where we recommend treatment. It's also the MCL (Maximum Contaminant Level) set by the EPA.\n\nWhat are the effects of iron in my water?\n\nHaving iron in your water can cause the water to have a rusty color and will also cause reddish or orange staining on your water using appliances (bathtub, toilet, sink, etc). Sediment can also be present from iron in water. There can be a metallic taste present when drinking water that has iron in it.\n\nHow can I remove iron from my water?\n\nThe last and most important of all questions. The Terminox™ Iron Filter is the BEST way to remove iron from your water. Check out some testimonials from actual Terminox™ customers.

Please advise what we need to do to correct this problem. Thank you,\n\nYou are overdosing the sodium sulfite in your water. It will exhibit an oxygen demand of its own.

      "text": "10 American Cities with the Most TOXIC Tap Water\n\nWhen you turn on the tap for water, like most people you probably assume the water that comes out is pure. Or, even if you know it's not as clean as fresh water from an uninhabited mountain spring … you at least assume it's safe.\n\nBut the Environmental Working Group (EWG) has analyzed nearly 20 million records of water utility testing, and revealed that there are 315 pollutants in U.S. tap water.[i]More than half of these can be present in any amount, as they are not subject to safety regulations. This doesn't mean they're innocuous … only that regulators probably haven't gotten around to researching them just yet.\n\nMany of the chemicals are regulated, of course, but they still sometimes show up at dangerously excessive levels. This was the case for 49 contaminants detected by EWG, which resulted in polluted tap water for nearly 54 million Americans.\n\nWhich Cities Have the Worst Tap Water?\n\nTo answer the question everyone wants to know … the cities with the worst tap water according to EWG analysis … are below. In case you're wondering, the ratings are based on:\n\nThe total number of chemicals detected since 2004\n\nThe percentage of chemicals found of those tested\n\nThe highest average level for an individual pollutant, relative to legal limits or national average amounts\n\n10. Jacksonville, Florida\n\nTwenty-three chemicals were found, 12 of which exceeded health guidelines and one of which exceeded health standards. Industrial pollutants, agricultural pollutants, and sprawl and urban pollutants were all detected, among others.\n\n9. San Diego, California\n\nTwenty chemicals were detected, eight of which exceeded health guidelines and two that exceeded health standards. Water treatment chemicals and byproducts, such as chloroform, trihalomethanes (TTHMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs), and industrial pollutants were the most common.\n\nForty-two chemicals were found, with 20 exceeding health guidelines and 4 exceeding health standards. This included agricultural pollutants like nitrate and nitrite, industrial pollutants like arsenic, water treatment and distribution byproducts and more.\n\n6. Houston, Texas\n\nForty-six chemicals were detected in all, 18 of them exceeded health guidelines and 3 exceeded health standards. Chloroform, arsenic, radium-226, lead and methylene chloride were all detected at potentially harmful levels.\n\n5. Reno, Nevada\n\nTwenty-one pollutants were found, 8 of which exceeded health guidelines and 3 of which exceeded health standards (compared to a national average of 0.5). Industrial pollutants were particularly problematic, followed by naturally occurring contaminants that are often increased in areas affected by sprawl, agriculture or industrial development.\n\n4. Riverside County, California\n\nTwenty-two pollutants were detected, 13 of which exceeded health guidelines and 1 that exceeded health standards. Treatment chemicals and their byproducts, followed by industrial pollutants, were the most common offenders.\n\n3. Las Vegas, Nevada\n\nThirty pollutants detected, 12 of which exceed health guidelines (the national average is 4). Industrial pollutants, such as aluminum, foaming agents, phthalates, and barium were especially prevalent.\n\n2. Riverside, California\n\nThirty pollutants were detected, including 15 in levels that exceeded health guidelines established by federal and state health agencies (such as radon, perchlorate, arsenic, and combined uranium) and 1 that exceeded health standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\n1. Pensacola, Florida\n\nForty-five chemicals were discovered in this Florida panhandle city's water (compared to a national average of 8), including radium-228 and -228, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, alpha particles, benzine and lead, cyanide and chloroform. Twenty-one of the chemicals occurred in unhealthy levels.\n\nIf Your Water Doesn't Kill You, It's… Um…\"Safe\"\n\nThis is, thankfully, an exaggeration, but it's not too far off from the truth because Americans, and that probably includes you, regularly drink water that contains 20, 30 or even 40+ chemical and other contaminants. They may linger at levels that are legal, that is, they are present in low enough concentrations that they won't make you clutch your heart and fall to the ground when you take a sip … but year after year, day after day, drinking all of those chemicals cannot be good.\n\nNow, we suspect you'll find this to be as outrageous as we did, but the federal government does not actually require that your water be safe for long-term consumption – even though we all drink it long-term … what other choice do we have?\n\n\"Federal law does not require tap water to be safe for long-term consumption; the long-term risks of cancer and other health threats are balanced against the cost and feasibility of purification. As a result, health officials acknowledge that legally binding contamination limits typically allow exposure to levels of pollutants that present real health risks.

Tap's good enough, they say.\n\nOrganizations like conservation group WWF have long campaigned against bottled water, saying resources are wasted in packaging and transporting a product which may be no safer or healthier than tap water while selling for up to a thousand times the price.\n\nBut the industry, not surprisingly, disagrees. A ban would reduce consumer choice and possibly tempt the thirsty masses to start drinking less healthy alternatives if all they could buy in the chilled cabinet of their local shop was sugary stuff like colas.\n\n\"The environmental footprint of one bottle of locally produced water is much smaller than a tin of canned tomatoes imported from overseas, some imported cheese, or French champagne,\" says a spokesman. \"We need to keep it in perspective.\"\n\nGood example of where does one and who should decide to stop manufacturing, packaging and distribution of any product given its CO2 emissions?\n\nBefore anyone adopts the moral high ground on bottled water, just take a look round your house and indeed at your house, the construction of which used and wasted immense amount of energy, causing high CO2 emissions.\n\nLooks as though Nanny is alive and well and living in Australia. It must be her ugly sister who keeps bugging us in the UK.\n\nBanning things is the way of little Hitlers and we need no more of them than we've already got. But what WOULD be a good idea would be to put a refundable charge on all recycable packaging such as plastic bottles, then kids and environmentally-minded people can earn themselves a few pennies and the country won't be suffocating under piles of rubbish. I suspect that this is more in line with what the citizens of Bundadoon are trying to achieve.\n\nThe subject is now a waste of time. Climate change may only be agreed with, and not challenged.\n\nIts more of a matter of faith then science now, how else can the mindless acceptance of the ice core samples be explained. Temperatures rose, 80 years afterwards so the the carbon levels. Cause and effect reversed without any explanation! Carbon was the result, not cause of temperature increases.\n\nEven if tap water is good enough, surely it'd set a better example to ban unhealthy fizzy soda drinks (which also come in bottles) rather than water. I'd guess they're not up for the legal battle against global giants like Coca Cola though.\n\nTap water isn't good enough! It may not have any living bugs in it, but it has in it every chemical known to man, including bleach and disinfectant, which cannot be removed because of the prohibitive cost. It is diluted poison.\n\nWell done people of Bundanoon, I agree 100% with your decision.\nI have never understood the type of people who buy expensive bottled water, as tap water tastes the same as bottled water. Maybe its a snob thing, maybe these people are unaware the bottled water manufacturers are scamming them, I just can't fathom them out.\nThe people of Bundanoon are not trying to make the whole world right, with regards to fizzy soda drinks, that statement was brought up by the bottled water companies who are worried more towns will follow suit.\nThe decision to ban bottled water was decided by the citizens of Bundanoon and not the (Nanny)\nPerhaps a compromise would be to continue offering this product but to also arrange an advertising campaign discouraging bottled water.\n\nWITHOUT DOUBT BOTTLED WATER SHOULD BE BANNED! Often the water is drawn from un-sustainable sources and denies other – essential use – of a vital resource. The packaging consumes energy we cannot afford to waste on such consumeristic notions and further contributes to atmospheric pollution of our planet. The discarded waste packaging also contributes to pollution. Mass transport is the only way to provide water for those who NEED it. Bottled water only provides profit for the seller and false comfort for those selfish few who can to afford to deny those who need it!\n\nTap water isn't good enough – sometimes not even if boiled. I know of a place not far away in Europe where you have to use bottled water for anything involving human consumption.\n\nAnyway surely the logic of the \"sustainability\", \"waste\" and \"pollution\" arguments is that tap water should be banned, not bottled water? In fact, surely it follows that mains water should be banned? If we all had to go to standpipes in the road with buckets in order to flush our loos or wash ourselves or our clothes there'd be more water around than you could shake a stick at. Buying a few bottles of water a day is a drop in the ocean compared to mains water use.\n\nWith fluoridation in the pipeline in many of our towns (and on the enforced increase), surely there ought to be an alternative to tap water. But, as with all of those drinks quoted above, this does not need to be distributed in plastic bottles. In Germany, most drinks are still in glass bottles which are distributed with a deposit that is handed back when the bottles are returned.\nGlass bottles can be re-used!"

In order to meet required standards of air quality, sewage-treatment plants use toxic and expensive chemicals to fight the stench.\n\nUnlike the left tower, which uses chemicals, the tower on the right at this wastewater-treatment plant now uses bacteria-covered foam blocks (inset) to eliminate the hydrogen sulfide bubbling from treated sewage.\n\nDeshusses/PNAS\n\nNow, researchers say they've found a better, cheaper, more natural way to subdue foul sewage smells. The secret? Bacteria and water.\n\nThe horrible rotten-egg smell of sewage is caused by a gas called hydrogen sulfide. To get rid of it, most treatment plants use devices called chemical scrubbers, which filter the gas through a cocktail of dangerous chemicals. Chemical scrubbers work, but they are expensive and often dangerous.\n\nTwo researchers tried something different. In a sewage treatment plant in California, they replaced chemical scrubbers with bacteria that break down hydrogen sulfide.\n\nThe scientists loaded a container with little foam blocks full of the bacteria. Then, they pumped hydrogen gas through the chamber. Finally, they let water constantly trickle over the foam. The system worked so well that the California plant converted several chemical scrubbers to the new kind.\n\nIf the technique catches on, sewage rot might become equally kind to the earth and to your nose.—E.

Since that time we have seen a fifty percent drop in the number of cavities. There is no doubt that the use of fluoride has helped children and adults from numerous visits to the dentist. Whereas a little fluoride goes a long way in preventing decay, we also know that the adage \"everything in moderation\" also applies to it.\n\nRecently, the government has started reviewing fluoride in an attempt to lower the amount in water. Studies have shown that the amount of tooth fluorosis have increased since the addition of fluoride. Most cities have known about these studies years before and have since lowered their fluoride levels, especially in the summer months when water consumption goes up.\n\nAmarillo and its surrounding areas have never had to add fluoride to its water supply. The substance is found naturally in the city and well water. While the governments recommendation will fall, the city water in Amarillo is higher than the new recommendation levels.\n\nBut what if I am outside the city? Well water can vary in its fluoride levels. Many wells outside the city show fluoride levels that are higher than recommended. While that may seem like a good thing, children are still growing, and their adult teeth that you cannot see are taking in minerals as they form. When children's fluoride levels get too high as their permanent teeth are developing you can have what is known as fluorosis.\n\nFluorosis can affect the teeth by causing pitting and spotting. While fluorosis makes the teeth harder to decay it can greatly effect their look.\n\nFor many children in the area we recommend bottled water during their young age. Don't be afraid to turn on the tap water, just use it in moderation. This way kids will get the fluoride they need for their teeth and prevent them from developing fluorosis.\n\nIf you have any questions about fluoride just ask your childs pediatric dentist. You can also contact the City of Amarillo Utilities Division about obtaining a fluoride testing kit for your water."

Freshwater pollution is a serious issue for about half the world's population, leading to about 250 million cases of water-related diseases and between 5 and 10 million deaths each year. According to UNICEF, nearly 900 million people lack access to clean water and 2.5 billion lack decent sanitation. Likewise, 2 million children die each year from pneumonia and diarrhea, illnesses UNICEF says can be prevented with improvements in water and sanitation. For a novel holiday gift idea, consider giving the gift of clean water to an impoverished child or family on the other side of the world.\n\nMany not-for-profit organizations in the U.S. and abroad are stridently working to improve global water quality. WaterAid is one such group. It recognizes the worldwide need for water and sanitation as 2.5 billion people don't have a safe and clean place to use the toilet. As a result, 3,000 children die each day from preventable diseases related to unsafe water or lack of basic sanitation. WaterAid works with both individuals and families to help set up, operate and manage water projects in order to provide safe water and effective sanitation for the poorest people in developing countries. Working in partnership with local communities, the organization uses low-cost technologies suitable to local conditions that can be maintained by the communities. Since 1981, WaterAid has provided 15.89 million people with safe water, as well as 11.02 million people with safe sanitation since 2004.\n\nThe 2012 UNICEF Tap Project is aimed at providing clean water for millions of children all over the world. Since it began in 2007, the program has raised almost $2.5 million in the U.S. alone and has become an important movement in ensuring the world's children have safe, clean in which to drink and bathe. UNICEF invites volunteers to donate funds, volunteer time or donate water to make a different for an impoverished child. The 2012 UNICEF Tap Project funds will be donated to support water programs in Togo, Cameroon, Mauritania and Vietnam.\n\nGlobal Water is another international, non-profit organization, founded in 1982. Its mission is to create safe water supplies and hygiene facilities for those in developing countries. Global Water is a volunteer-based organization, so the majority of donations are sent to facility projects in rural villages and schools. Some of those projects include surface water supply and distribution systems, rain harvesting supply systems, water-well drilling activities, hand pump installations, water treatment equipment, latrines, hand-washing stations and community laundry washing and bathing facilities. Plus, Global Water is currently developing a \"Technology Push\" program to implement filtration and disinfection equipment in developing countries' rural areas.\n\nSurge is a U.S.-based nonprofit which helps provide clean water to undeveloped nations. Its projects have built fresh water wells, manufactured filters and built sanitation systems for communities in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Dominican Republic, Ethiopia, Haiti, Pakistan and Tanzania. Since its inception in 2008, Surge has provided clean water to 44,260 individuals. A donation of just $25 provides $25 people clean water for five years. One-hundred percent of all public donations are used to fund Surge's sustainable water projects.\n\nCharity: Water is determined to lower water-related fatalities in the world. According to the organization, unsafe water and lack of sanitation kills more people each year than all forms of violence, including war. In Africa, people spend 40 billion hours each year walking to reach water. Thus far, Charity: Water has funded 6,994 water projects, giving 2.7 million people access to clean water in 20 nations. Since private donors cover its administrative costs, 100 percent of public donations made to the organizations are used to fund clean water projects. Charity: Water not only accepts individuals' direct donations, but it also offers gift donation opportunities, perfect for the holidays or a special occasion. Donations may be made in a friend or loved one's name, and a greeting card will can be printed or sent via email to \"deliver\" the gift. Donors who wish to contribute $5,000 or more can sponsor a water project for a village, school or clinic in a developing nation. When the project is completed, the donor will see proof of the project with GPS coordinates and photos in Google Maps.\n\nDroughts have threatened human welfare since prehistoric times. But in today's world of rapid population growth, increased demand for food and cash crops and rising urbanization, water scarcity is a growing problem even in non-arid regions. Water demand is expected to increase 40 percent in the next 20 years, and although water is a renewable resource, quantities of freshwater are limited. Several new studies, however, have identified new strategies to aid the imbalance of water usage to freshwater supply.\n\nColorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study\n\nThe results of a Congressional-authorized study, funded by the Bureau of Reclamation and seven Colorado River Basin states, were released Dec. 12, according to Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar. The study projects water supply and demand imbalances throughout the Colorado River Basin throughout the next 50 years, and includes a variety of strategies to address the imbalances.\n\nThe Colorado River Basin spans portions of seven states, and is one of the most important sources of water in the western United States. In addition to the 40 million people who receive municipal water from the Colorado River and its tributaries, the basin supplies water for 22 Native American tribes, seven national wildlife refuges, four national recreation areas, and 11 national parks. The water supply is also used to irrigate about four million acres of land, while the Colorado River provides more than 4,200 megawatts of electricity through hydro-power facilities.\n\n\"There's no silver bullet to solve the imbalance between the demand for water and the supply in the Colorado River Basin over the next 50 years – rather, it's going to take diligent planning and collaboration from all stakeholders to identify and move forward with practical solutions,\" Salazar said. \"Water is the lifeblood of our communities, and this study provides a solid platform to explore actions we can take toward a sustainable water future. Although not all of the proposals included in the study are feasible, they underscore the broad interest in finding a comprehensive set of solutions.\"\n\nThe study found future imbalance in water supply and demand will average to more than 3.2 million-acre-feet by 2060, with one acre-foot of water equal to the amount used by a single household in one year. The study also projects the largest demand increase will originate from municipal and industrial users. Currently, the Colorado River Basin provides water to about 40 million people, but the study projects the number may increase to about 76.5 million residents by 2060.\n\nThe study, which began in January 2010, offers more than 150 proposals from study participants, as well as stakeholders and the public. Suggestions include increasing water supply importing water from neighboring rivers or desalinization or Pacific Ocean water; or reducing demand through increased industrial and agricultural water conservation and efficiency plans, as well as reducing evaporation from lakes and canals.\n\n\"This study is one of a number of ongoing basin studies that Reclamation is undertaking through Interior's WaterSMART Program,\" said Anne Castle, Assistant Sec. for Water and Science. \"These analyses pave the way for stakeholders in each basin to come together and determine their own water destiny. This study is a call to action, and we look forward to continuing this collaborative approach as we discuss next steps.\"\n\nHumble Pie\n\nThe toilet is considered one of the most vital household fixtures, for obvious reasons. But it also accounts for about 30 percent of home water usage—more than showers, dishwashers or washing machines. Even water-efficient toilets use an average of more than 7,400 gallons of water per year, while traditional models can easily exceed 32,000 gallons of water-usage for an average US household of 3.2 people.\n\n\"It's easy to think that we have this enormous indispensable water supply, that we do have about 20 percent of the world's supply of surface fresh water right here at the Great Lakes,\" Nancy Tuchman, an aquatic ecology researcher and director of the Institute of Urban Environmental Sustainability at Loyal University, recently told the Northwest Indiana Times. \"We have the biggest supply on the continent, but it doesn't mean that it's going to be there forever—and especially with global climate change and all this evaporation and little precipitation that could build the water back up. So we need to conserve.\"\n\nChicago's Nancy Klehm, founder of Social Ecologies, has devised an unorthodox solution to commode water consumption. Her \"dry toilet\" is nothing more than a bucket filled with a layer of carbon-rich material such as dried leaves, sawdust or newspaper. After depositing waste into a dry toilet, a user simply covers the matter with a new layer of carbon-rich material. When the bucket is full, the contents can be dumped out or composted.\n\n\"For five bucks, or if I find a bucket and have some carbon material, I can actually build out a solution really fast,\" Klehm told the Times. \"It takes hardly any capital; it just takes some ingenuity and knowing what to do with it.\"\n\nIn 2008, Klehm organized a trial, called \"Humble Pie,\" with 22 Chicago residents who tested the dry toilet process. She collected participants' waste over a three-month period, then composed it with carbon-rich material for two years. The compost is now as nutrient-rich as \"fertilizer\" found at municipal sewage plants.\n\n\"Good soil is so hard to have in the city. I'm concerned about the state of our soil—they're affecting our health, they're depleted, or they're contaminated or poisonous,\" Klehm told Arthur Magazine.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency categorizes the sludge as a fertilizer, and it will now be used in Chicago gardens, including a 5,000-sqaure-foot greenhouse at a homeless shelter. Her study's participants were not turned off by the process as one might presume, either.\n\n\"I was interested in this as an experiment,\" Lora Lode, whose family placed a bucket in the bathroom and two storage drums on the back porch, told Arthur. Her 19-year-old son Charlie was eager to try the experiment. \"I just think that if I didn't have a house, this is what I would do,\" he said.\n\nStill, Klehm said a dry toilet must be done properly to be successful.\n\n\"Composting human waste should not be taken on unless someone is a very skilled composter,\" Klehm told the Times.\n\nAlthough the \"yuck\" factor will probably discourage most people from ever trying a dry toilet, water experts see it as an important innovation in water conservation.\n\n\"It's a larger issue than just how much water we're using,\" sustainable water expert Wendy Pabich, who holds a Ph.D. in environmental engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told the Times. \"When you buy a dry compost toilet, that's all about recycling the nutrients and carbon in our waste, rather than sending them to rivers where the organic and nutrient load drive putrefaction – algal groves, fish kills and ecosystem changes.\"\n\nEvapo-transpiration\n\nResearchers with Texas A&M's AgriLife Research program are trying to promote water conservation for those who water their lawns. They are using the principle of evapo-transpiration—the amount of water a plant actively pulls from soil—to develop simple watering formulas.\n\nAgriLife Research associates Charles Fontanier and Richard White are looking to history to determine if evapo-transpiration data can be used to predict watering needs in St. Augustine.\n\n\"The goal is to try to create a message that is easy to understand for both homeowners and landscape contractors that will also promote water conservation and healthy turf grasses,\" Fontanier said in a Texas A&M release.\n\nThe researchers use various weather data to estimate daily evapo-transpiration, then relate that data to the grass or plant being grown.\n\n\"From the reference ET, we can adjust it to the different types of grasses we are growing, as well as perhaps a micro-climate: If it is a sunny spot or a shady spot,\" Fontanier said. \"So we can adjust the number accordingly. If the number for a warm-season turfgrass in Texas is 0.6, then 60 percent of the weather station output is what we should be applying to our grasses.\"\n\nThe scientists used historical averages to set run times for a sprinkler system during the last two growing seasons. If, for example, St. Augustine grass has needed 4.25 inches of water each July during the past 45 years, they used that number to irrigate the grass in July.\n\n\"Ideally, we should be adjusting irrigation amounts based on what the weather station is telling us on a daily or weekly basis,\" Fontanier said. \"But keeping up with real-time ET data can be too time consuming. So our goal for this study was to demonstrate and quantify the effects of using historical average water needs as a predictor of actual plant water needs.\"\n\nThe study examined four treatments, including: Reference evapo-transpiration from the weather station or 100 percent, which would equal an over-watering scenario; turf coefficient—the theorized amount of watering the turf grass actually needs; 40 percent of the turf coefficient and 60 percent of the coefficient.\n\n\"Looking at the two years we've had recently and comparing the differences, in 2011 when we really had severe conditions, our main goal with any irrigation was really just bud and crown survival,\" Fontanier said. \"If we kept enough plants alive, we could get regrowth once rains did come. In fact that is what we found. Even though we lost a tremendous amount of density in our deficit irrigation treatments, the grass survived and by March, we had close to 100 percent stands.\"\n\nAt a glance, all of the study plots looked the same. Fontanier believes that shows grasses can survive seasonal reductions in irrigation.\n\n\"If you look at 2012, where we did get occasional rains, our water conservation treatments or deficit irrigation treatments not only survived, they actually look pretty good,\" he said. \"So what we did using historical ET, we were probably under-irrigating in 2011 by maybe 20 percent and over-irrigating in 2012 by about 10 percent.\n\n\"But if you look at the long haul, we think we will be right on the money or at least promoting some level of conservation utilizing historical ET as a base for irrigation,\" Fontanier explained. \"Historical and real-time ET data for locations across Texas are readily available online at the Texas ET Network. If these data are not available to your region, a general rule of thumb is that Texas lawns need about 1 inch of water a week from June through August. Sticking with these easy-to-remember strategies should, in the long run, help homeowners conserve water.\n\n\"And if you bring it down to a deficit from that, we can still have water conservation and the grass will stay alive,\" Fontanier said. \"The key is to make sure you have some moisture in the ground to maintain bud survival.\"\n\nGlobally, one out of every five people does not have access to clean water, and water demand is expected to rise 40 percent over the next 20 years. As water use continues to outweigh water resources, water conservation plays a vital role in everyday life. But new tools are available to assist consumers and communities in reducing water stress and conserving the valuable resource.\n\nAgricultural Radar and Scanning Techniques\n\nA Texas AgriLife Research team is applying two tools to its small grains breeding program in order to identify drought-resistant traits in wheat. Researchers are attempting to use ground-penetrating radar and terrestrial laser-scanning to search for traits that give the wheat's breeding line a drought-resistance advantage.\n\n\"What we are trying to do is apply technology that allows us to see further into characteristic traits than we have been able to with the human eye,\" said Sean Thompson, a doctoral student at Texas A&M University working on the Texas AgriLife Research project.\n\nIn the past, ground-penetrating radar—designed for the construction industry to detect objects such as electrical lines and pipes below ground—has been used to look at crop-water availability, but never to examine plant populations. The research team hopes it can adapt the technology to look at the roots of wheat as it grows in the field.\n\nThe radar can estimate the biomass of roots and differentiate between root systems from various crops. Mapping roots at varying depths helps researchers detect plants with deeper roots or roots that spread further.\n\n\"We think these root systems will provide the plant with more water during a drought situation,\" Thompson said. \"Our idea is if we can identify those plants in a population or be able to characterize the roots below ground, we could adapt our varieties to make them more drought-resistant or drought-tolerant.\"\n\nLikewise, researchers plan to use a terrestrial laser scanner to take quick, accurate measurements in wheat fields.\n\n\"That's a much more accurate measurement than we've had in the past using a yardstick or ruler,\" Thompson said. \"Typically we walk through our nurseries looking for characteristics or traits in a plant that give it an advantage over others. We take plant height measurements which can be related to yield or performance, or we take an overall agronomic score.\"\n\nDrought tolerant plants help conserve water during dry seasons because farmers can produce crops without relying on irrigation. They also aid farmers in coping with droughts such as the one that gripped much of the United States during the past growing season.\n\nRainwater Harvesting System\n\nThe Texas AgriLife Research and Extension Center has also developed a project that might someday aid communities in conserving water used for landscape irrigation. In the project, researchers collect rainwater from roof space using an internal-pipe rain gutter system. The water is then forced into 3,600-gallon tanks through a gravity-flow system. The collected rainwater is later used to water various types of gardening plots and turf-grass demonstration plots.\n\n\"Ultimately, we want to develop a comprehensive small-acreage landowner system where we can show some fruit and nut trees and ways to manage all of that off the natural systems here,\" Texas AgriLife irrigation specialist Nich Kenny said. \"This year in the midst of a drought, we filled three of these tanks—approximately 9,000 gallons of water— on 6 inches of rainfall. That's a pretty effective way to capture water.\"\n\nKenny estimates that for every one-inch rainstorm, each square foot of rooftop can collect about .6 gallons of water.\n\n\"You can start to add that up on a standard house and basically what you end up with is a whole lot of water that can be stored,\" he said. \"Next you have to figure out what to do with it.\"\n\nConservation Tools for the Home\n\nConsumers who want to save money on their water bills and promote water conservation can save rainwater without an elaborate rooftop system. Rain barrels not only help conserve water, but promote healthier plants and soil, as well as reduce storm water runoff.\n\nCatching and storing roof water for use in landscaping projects takes advantage of a free source of water while simultaneously reducing sewer overflows and flooding. It also helps recharge the groundwater supply with pure, unpolluted water. Plus, the water collected in the rain barrel provides non-chlorinated water for use lawns and gardens.\n\nConsumers using rain barrels and other conservation methods at home can examine and compare their water usage using an online water calculator. The calculator allows users to compare their water use to a similar average and efficient homes in their regions. It also shows users which home water sources are efficient and which may be wasteful. Plus, it offers other simple conservation tips to help save water and energy.\n\nAt Seametrics, we believe that a product sold needs to be a product supported. We want those using our technology to be able to get live help with the questions they have. Unfortunately, the fact that our flow meters are sold across the US and internationally means there are a lot of questions to answer…too many for the staff we have at the factory.\n\nEnter the Distributor business model. Seametrics Distributors are our \"feet on the street\" to fulfill our philosophy, and the best way to equip them to support the Seametrics products they sell is to be sure that they themselves understand the technology.

They provide our Distributors with hands on, face-to-face product training (as shown in the photo below), help facilitate the development of new tools and documentation to assist customers in the field (like the the technical bulletins, product bulletins, installation bulletins, and wiring diagrams posted on our website), and even join our Distributors on field calls to help with application support. They employ the effective mentoring mentality of:\n\n\"I Do…You watch. You Do…I watch.

She will be greatly missed.\n\nThe need for innovations in water conservation has never been greater. According to the World Water Council, although the world's population tripled in the 20th century, the use of renewable water resources grew six-fold. The increased industrialization and the added demand for water will have somber consequences on water supply.\n\nStill, an increasing awareness that freshwater resources need protected is prompting companies, individuals and communities to seek innovative solutions in water conservation. The US Environmental Protection Agency has endorsed a program called WaterSense which, since it began in 2006, aims to decrease nonagricultural water consumption through efficiency and innovation. The program claims to have saved over 46 billion gallons of water through its work with manufacturers, government and consumers.\n\nToto One-Gallon Double Cyclone Toilet\n\nConsumers can make an impact in the water conservation effort by choosing efficient plumbing products. WaterSense has even set water conservation goals for various products, including toilets, shower heads and faucets. In fact, according to the American Water Works Association Research Foundation, if all US households installed water-saving features, water use could drop by as much as 30 percent, saving about 5.4 billion gallons of water each day\n\nThe largest household user of water each day is the toilet. In fact, the commode uses an average of 26.7 percent of the average American household's daily indoor water. The WaterSense goal for toilets is a 20-percent reduction, to no more than 1.28 gallons-per-flush. Consumers have historically been hesitant to install water-saving toilets. Contractor Leigh Marymor says when the first generation of 1.6-gallon-per-flush toilets hit the market in 1994, people despised them. It often took two flushes instead of one, which defeated the purpose.\n\nNow that WaterSense has recommended an even higher efficiency level, and states such as California and Texas have passed laws requiring the 1.28 gallons-per-flush efficiency-level beginning in 2014, manufacturers have rushed to market new toilet technology. According to Japanese toilet manufacturer Toto, if an average American household—consisting of 3.2 people—changed from a 5.5 gallons-per-flush toilet to a 1.28 gallons-per-flush model, it would save 24,665 gallons of water in one year.\n\nIn fact, it is Toto's ultra-high-efficiency toilet, which uses only one gallon of water per flush that is being called a great achievement in terms of toilet-engineering evolution and water conservation efforts. Roto-Rooter Atlanta, one of the largest plumbing repair services in North America, called the Toto 1G impressive in a company statement.\n\n\"Less than 20 years ago, people were used to toilets that used 3.5 gallons per flush, while today's Ultra-Efficient models only require 1.28 gallons per flush,\" the Roto-Rooter statement said. \"With the same innovation and problem solving that these Japanese engineers put forth, manufacturers were able to greatly improve flushing power using less water and show that research and development can lead to great improvements in the world, step by step.\"\n\nIn fact, the new Toto toilet is said to be capable of shooting a soccer ball at 160 kilometers-per-hour. The toilet utilizes Toto's Double Cyclone flushing system, which uses both water and gravity to create its powerful one-gallon flush.\n\nNorth China Plain Water Conservation Project\n\nWater scarcity is a growing problem in the North China Plain. One of the most densely-populated regions in the world – it encompasses Beijing – the area has fertile soil for farming but an arid climate. In fact, in many areas agricultural demands far exceed the availability of ground water and can no longer be met with additional hydraulic infrastructure. Likewise, water pollution from heavy urbanization and industrialization has compounded the water scarcity. But industry in China uses between 4 and 10 times the water as industry in more developed nations.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, scientists say aquifers below the North China Plain may be drained within 30 years without change.\n\n\"There's no uncertainty,\" hydrologist Richard Evans, who has worked in China for the past two decades, told the Times. \"The rate of decline is very clear, very well documented. They will run out of groundwater if the current rate continues.\"\n\nA major source of water depletion in China is its agriculture. The Community Party insists on feeding the country's massive population with its own grain. But massive agricultural efforts require huge amounts of groundwater in the North China Plain, which produces half the country's wheat, according to the Times.\n\nThe North China Plain Water Conservation Project — financed for $74 million by the World Bank — is directed at increasing the water efficiency of China's agriculture. The project has already supported improvements to more than 257,000 farms on the North China Plain. The major components of the project include: Irrigation and drainage works, such as canal lining, low-pressure pipe, drains, wells and sprinklers; agricultural support including land leveling, tilling schedules, soil fertility improvements, crop pattern adjustments and mulching; forestry and environmental monitoring; and institutional development and capacity building for water and soil conservation.\n\nSince the project's implementation, agricultural productivity in the area has increased by 60 to 80 percent per unit of water. Agricultural production has tripled and the increase of farmer per capita has ranged from 10 to 554 percent.\n\nThe reduction of agricultural water consumption has had a huge impact on the North Plain's groundwater reserves. In fact, across most of the project area, groundwater depletion has been reduced to negligible levels or eliminated entirely.\n\nFurthermore, the project strengthened arrangements for irrigation system operation and maintenance. The project originally hoped to establish 100 water user associations, but ultimately more than 500 were created—the first time WUAs took large-scale responsibility for financing and operating irrigation systems in China. The existence of the WUAs promotes water measuring with corresponding water charges on a volumetric basis.\n\nSouth Korea 's Rainwater Recycling System\n\nThe Chinese may have shown how redeveloping an area's water system can help conserve water sources, but Korea is demonstrating innovative ways to conserve water by building an eco-friendly city from the ground up. A project that began 12 years ago, Songdo is built on an artificial island just west of Seoul and is set to cost about $35 billion. Media has labeled Songdo the city of the future. Cisco is wiring every inch of the city with fiber-optic broadband and, and TelePresence screens will be installed in all homes, offices, hospitals and shopping centers—allowing residents to place video calls from all over the city. Plus, the city's streets and buildings will be equipped with sensors to monitor everything from temperature to road conditions—ensuring the city runs lightning-speed efficiency.\n\nAbout 40 percent of Songdo will be dedicated to green space, such as rooftop vegetation that reduces storm water and takes advantage of sunshine on hot days—helping to cool the city. Rainwater traps will capture \"grey water,\" which will be recycled for use in sinks, toilets and dishwashers, dramatically decreasing the need for fresh water.\n\n\"We didn't just look 10 years ahead, we looked at 50 years, a hundred years from now,\" Sustainable Design Specialist Peter Lee said in a Cisco release. \"And saving water is one of the key elements that we tried to pursue, in terms of sustainability.\"\n\nCity designers found many uses for the grey water stored in containers after rainfalls. In addition to household fixtures, it is recycled for irrigation, as well as in parks and industrial facilities. The innovations help Songdo reach its goal of reducing commercial water use by 30 percent. The city also has a nearly two-mile canal which circulates millions of gallons in ocean water.\n\n\"We're building an environmentally friendly system that is unique to any other in the world,\" Incheon Free Economic Zone's Commissioner Lee Jong-Cheol said in the Cisco release.\n\nIf you are looking for an alternative gift for a friend or family member who cares about conserving the world's freshwater resources, you might consider a donation to a water conservation organization this holiday. According to the Nature Conservancy, two-thirds of the world's population could face water shortages by 2025.\n\nHere are five organizations that are doing great work to help the cause.\n\nThe Soil and Water Conservation Society\nThe Soil and Water Conservation Society has advocated science-based conservation since 1943. The nonprofit group organizes conservation forums and makes local recommendations on land and water conservation. Its more than 5,000 members include researchers, administrators, planners, policymakers, teachers, students, farmers, ranchers and administrators—all dedicated to preserving water as a natural resource. Its many activities are designed to develop state-of-the-art conservation systems, improve policy, and sustain ethics among conservationists through networking and mutual support.\n\nConservation Minnesota\nMinnesota is known as the Land O' Lakes, and Conservation Minnesota is dedicated to protecting the state's invaluable lakes and rivers. After merging with Minnesota Waters earlier this year, the combined not-for-profit group is focused on helping citizen volunteers build grassroots networks of local lake, river and watershed associations to collect and use data for water policy advocacy. It provides water quality monitoring workshops, lake and river management training, funding resources, legislative forums, regional citizen summits and many other avenues of training and support. Conservation Minnesota also led a successful campaign to launch CheckMyLake.org, which has informed Minnesotans that 40 percent of their lakes do not currently meet water standards. Based on its research, the organization played a major role in the passage of the state's Legacy Amendment, which is the largest state conservation measure in US history.\n\nThe Meramec River Project (The Nature Conservancy)\nThe Meramec River is one of Missourians most-loved locations for floating, boating, fishing and swimming. The river is also an important tributary to the Mississippi River, supporting 31 species that hold global significance, including several species found nowhere else on Earth. The Meramec also supplies drinking water to about 250,000 Missourians. Unfortunately, decades of abuse have threatened the river's wellbeing. Its water quality has diminished and important habitats have been destroyed. The Meramec River Project is focused on restoring the health of the river. It leads conservation projects to restore habitats, stream banks and flood plains. The Meramec River Project partners with 25 other organizations to develop a conservation plan that includes watershed conservation education, volunteer projects such as river clean ups and tree planting, and assistance in implementing sustainable ranching practices to not only keep cattle out of the river, but also dig wells to provide alternate water sources and build fence lines.\n\nThe Partnership for Water Conservation\nThe Partnership for Water Conservation is a nonprofit organization actively engaged in protecting watersheds through sustaining river and stream flows. Its current focus is promoting water resource efficiency in landscape irrigation, but it also works to educate residents in Washington's Puget Sound area on water conservation. According to the partnership, the region ranks 56th of 100 major US cities in average rainfall, and some water suppliers are already predicting insufficient supply to meet demand as the area's population increases in the next 10 years. In addition to publishing a variety of water conservation reports and other information for individuals, businesses and conservation specialists, the partnership holds forums to discuss water issues and advocate policy change, develop public education campaigns, and grant conservation awards to individuals who contribute toward water conservation efforts in the Puget Sound Region.\n\nThe Alliance for The Great Lakes\nNot only are The Great Lakes a major geographic marker, but each year 65 million pounds of fish are harvested from their waters, more than 200 million tons of cargo are shipped through its waters. For years, however, Americans thought nothing of filling them with pollutants. That is, until 1969 when the Cuyahoga River caught on fire because of extreme pollution.\n\nThe Alliance for The Great Lakes is dedicated to conservation and restoration of the world's largest freshwater lakes through policy, education, and citizen action. The Alliance is dedicated to protecting the health of the Great Lakes Basin's people, fish, and other wildlife by reducing sewage overflows and other pollution. The group also works closely with scientists, citizens, government officials, and businesses on strategies to protect fresh water supplies and eliminate waste. Furthermore, it addresses the challenge of invasive species that have arrived via cargo ships from the Atlantic Ocean. Discovering ways to prevent future transfer of the invasive species into the lakes would save the area billions of dollars in damage and control costs.\n\nSince its inception in 1970, the Alliance for The Great Lakes has enrolled 10,000 volunteers in six states in its Adopt-a-Beach program, received the American Bar Association's Distinguished Achievement Award in Environmental Law and Policy, and lobbied for the historic Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact, passed by Great Lakes state legislatures and the US Congress.\n\n]]> Things You Should Know About the Global Water Crisis\n 09 Nov 2012 13:54:31 +0000admin\n\nUnbeknownst to many of the millions who enjoy unfettered access to clean drinking water, much of the world's population does not enjoy the same luxury.\n\nOf course, having reliable access to clean water is not a luxury. It's an absolute necessity, and according to the World Health Organization's 2012 assessment there are 884 million people who have no regular access to clean water. Put another way, nearly 1 out of 8 people on the planet live without a reliable source of fresh water.\n\nBluntly speaking, though, they don't live long. It's a hard fact that deserves honest treatment, which the issue often does not get. There are many other facts tied to this global catastrophe that also do not get the attention they deserve, and so are listed below for your review.\n\n1. Diarrhea Kills 1 Child Every 20 Seconds\n\nA lack of clean drinking water is a severe problem, but thirst is hardly the most common cause of demise. Waterborne diseases are by far the most lethal killers on the planet, and illnesses like diarrhea, cholera, malaria and typhoid result in literally millions of deaths per year, with 1.6 million of them being children.\n\nSanitation rather than water availability is the issue when considering problems with waterborne illnesses. Standing water in populated areas is a drainage issue that creates breeding grounds for mosquitoes that carry malaria, while the lack of proper waste disposal is responsible for a host of other ailments.\n\n2. Most Wastewater Goes Untreated\n\nPeople usually don't think too much about what happens to water after it goes down the drain. The fact is that only a small fraction of U.S. municipalities recycle their water back into local supplies. The question is, if just 1% of one-tenth of America's wastewater is treated and used to replenish reservoirs and groundwater, how much is this practiced elsewhere?\n\nThe answer is not much. A generous estimate is that only 10% of global wastewater gets treated at all, which means the majority of it is pushed back into natural bodies of water where it can be consumed downstream and make people sick.\n\n3. U.S. Resources Are Not Immune\n\nFive years ago U.S. news media reported that in five years many U.S. cities would be facing water shortages, and now that prediction has come to pass. In 2012 the U.S. experienced the worst drought in more than four decades and while resources dwindled it became apparent how scarce fresh water was in some areas of the country.\n\nThe next prediction is that states will begin to battle over water rights and that rationing will be the only solution. The frightening truth, though, is that these battles have already been raging and that the only thing left to follow is the restrictions placed on water use.\n\n4. Women Spend Their Lives Carrying Water\n\nWater scarcity creates drastic situations for survival, and in areas where a lack of water has become a part of life certain traditions have taken root that are damaging entire generations of women.\n\nAll across Africa and other developing nations, women spend their entire day – every day for much of their lives – carrying water to their families. The jerry cans commonly used for this task can hold up to 50 pounds of water and are carried on the head or the hips of countless African women for miles. This causes myriad health problems that often go untreated, and this is not to mention the time spent carrying water cannot be spent with family or learning new skills.\n\n5. Toilets Can Be Dangerous\n\nA recent study by the Bill & Melinda Foundation found that 2.5 billion people on the planet use unsafe toilets or don't use a toilet. This problem, which ties into the wastewater treatment issue, is exacerbated by a lack of education about things like hand washing and knowing how to identify an unsafe source of drinking water.\n\nMany of these hurdles are overcome by education and there are numerous nonprofit organizations that make it their aim to provide developing communities with the learning tools they need to make a difference – even if they can't help get them more water (see our Top 50 Water Non-Profit Blogs)."

No access to good quality drinking water leads to a high risk of water-borne diseases such as diarrhoea, cholera, typhoid fever, hepatitis A, dysentery and other diseases. One sixth of the world's population has no access to safe water today. Bottle utilizes a water treatment method named SODIS (Solar Disinfection System) a simple, environmentally sustainable, low-cost solution for drinking water treatment at household level for people consuming microbiologically contaminated raw water. Contaminated water is filled into transparent plastic bottles and exposed to full sunlight for six hours. During the exposure to the sun the pathogens are destroyed. The SODIS system has been used in South America, Africa and the Far East with good results, with the new Bottle design the results and the diffusion of the system can increase."

We all know this is not avoidable. We need to wash, cook, we need lighting and heating as well in our homes. However there are ways to reduce the costs of these. It worth the effort as the money you save adds up nicely over time. Many people is using high efficiency machines nowadays, (dishwashers, washing machines, energy saving lightbulbs…etc.) saving a lot of money each year. On the other hand, many of [...]\n\nIf you own a house or rent an apartment, you are probably familiar with what a water softener salt, is. In layman's terms, a water softener acts to turn the hard water from the city or from your well into soft water that can be used in everyday applications such as bathing, cooking, and drinking. Hard water is any water that contains too much calcium or magnesium. Hard water can cause a variety of problems inside your home, but the main two problems are as follows:\n\nWe often hear and use the terms hard water solution, soft water, and water softener systems, but what do they actually mean? How can a liquid be hard anyway??? These terms refer to the levels of dissolved calcium and magnesium positive ions in the water. Hard water has higher than ordinary level of these minerals, soft water is the opposite. Units like mg/l or grains/gallon is being used to express this. These minerals dissolve into the water from soft rocks containing calcium and magnesium and other mineral deposits."

      "text": "Is Bottled Water Better?\n\nGreentips: June 2007\n\nBottled water manufacturers' marketing campaigns capitalize on isolated instances of contaminated public drinking water supplies by encouraging the perception that their products are purer and safer than tap water. But the reality is that tap water is actually held to more stringent quality standards than bottled water, and some brands of bottled water are just tap water in disguise. What's more, our increasing consumption of bottled water—more than 22 gallons per U.S. citizen in 2004 according to the Earth Policy Institute—fuels an unsustainable industry that takes a heavy toll on the environment.\n\nEnvironmental Impact\n\nFossil fuel consumption. Approximately 17 million barrels of oil—enough to run 1 million cars for a whole year—are used to make plastic water bottles, according to the Pacific Institute. The burning of oil and other fossil fuels (which are also used to generate the energy that powers the manufacturing process) emits global warming pollution into the atmosphere.\n\nWater consumption. The growth in bottled water production has increased water extraction in areas near bottling plants, leading to water shortages that affect nearby consumers and farmers. In addition to the millions of gallons of water used in the plastic-making process, two gallons of water are wasted in the purification process for every gallon that goes into the bottles.\n\nWaste. Only about 10 percent of water bottles are recycled, leaving the rest in landfills where it takes thousands of years for the plastic to decompose.\n\nThe Simple (and Cheaper) Solution\n\nThe next time you feel thirsty, forgo the bottle and turn to the tap. You'll not only lower your environmental impact but also save money—bottled water can cost up to 10,000 times more per gallon than tap water. And because the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's standards for tap water are more stringent than the Food and Drug Administration's standards for bottled water, you'll be drinking water that is just as safe as, or safer than, bottled.\n\nIf, however, you don't like the taste of your tap water or are unsure of its quality, you can buy a filter pitcher or install an inexpensive faucet filter to remove trace chemicals and bacteria. If you will be away from home, fill a reusable bottle from your tap and refill it along the way; travel bottles with built-in filters are also available. Finally, limit your bottled water purchases for those times when you're traveling in countries where water quality is questionable."

Improperly treated water can also be a source of\ncontamination.\n\nWhat needs to\nbe done\n\nTo protect the safety of food, livestock or poultry, treat water\nas required to maintain its quality or use an alternative source.\n\nDid\nyou know?\n\nIf needed, an example\nof a written practice for continuous chlorination water treatment can be found\nin the Training and Support Tools section (refer to Sample D).\n\nHow\nto do it\n\nChoose the Right Method of Water Treatment\n\nMake sure the\ntype of water treatment chosen is the right one for the particular situation.\nConsult water quality professionals for more information on water treatment options.\n\nA\nnumber of water treatment methods are available and can be used alone or in combination\nwith several other treatment processes.\n\nPhysical water treatment\n\nFiltration is the process of treating water contaminated\nwith substances such as dirt or organic matter. For example, sand filters will\nremove large particles from the water. Granular activated carbon (GAC) filters,\ncommonly known as charcoal filters, will filter particulate matter from the water\nand will also adsorb (soak up) dissolved organic matter and other contaminants.\nMembrane filtration is the most effective method for removing parasites such as\nGiardia and Cryptosporidium.\n\nUltraviolet (UV) light is\na non-chemical method for killing micro-organisms such as bacteria, viruses (not\nretroviruses and rotaviruses), spores and cysts.\n\nCoagulating water is the process of adding chemicals to water\nto make dissolved or suspended particles bind together and settle out. This process\nreduces the level of organic compounds, dissolved phosphorus, colour, iron and\nsuspended particles.\n\nChlorination is the process of adding\nchlorine to water to kill bacteria and viruses but not parasites such as Giardia\nand Cryptosporidium. Two types of water chlorination-shock chlorination and continuous\nchlorination-are used in water treatment. Shock chlorination (used for treatment\nof wells) is the process of flushing a well and water system with a chlorine solution.\nContinuous chlorination (used for treating dump tank water) is a process of adding\nchlorine to water continuously to maintain a certain level of free chlorine in\nthe water at all times.\n\nOzonation is the process of adding\nozone to water to kill bacteria, viruses, parasites, mould and yeast spores. Ozone\ncompletely breaks down in water.\n\nHydrogen peroxide is\na chemical added to water to kill bacteria, viruses and fungi. It is not as effective\nas chlorine.\n\nBiological water treatment\n\nBiological water treatment is ideally suited to treat water that is highly\ncoloured and has high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrient levels. It uses\na natural ecosystem that removes colour and dissolved organic matter, but not\nmicro-organisms.\n\nMonitor and Maintain Water Quality\n\nAt pre-determined frequencies, water should be tested to ensure quality:\n\nTreating with shock chlorination Two to five days after shock\ntreatment, sample the water for total coliform and E. coli to confirm that water\nis safe to use. Continue to regularly monitor your water source for quality.\n\nTreating\nwith continuous chlorination A continuous chlorination method (e.g. dump tank)\nmust be regularly monitored at pre-determined intervals for free chlorine and\npH levels (e.g. testing water hourly). The recommended chlorine and pH levels\nfor a produce dump tank are 100 to 150 ppm and 6.0 to 7.5, respectively.\n\nAn alternative method to regular monitoring of chlorine levels is using an oxidative\nreduction potential system.\n\nAll other water treatments Take\na water sample and test for coliform bacteria and E. coli after the treatment\nmethod or system has been used or installed to ensure it is working effectively.\n\nRecords to keep\n\nWater Treatment Record.\nWe have provided a record\ntemplate for your use in the Training and Support Tools section. A printable\nversion is also available. Or keep your own record that includes:\n\nDid you know?\n\nChemical treatment\nitself can also present a source of contamination if it is incorrectly performed.\nFor example, if the chemical residue that remains in the treated water is over\na certain limit, it becomes a food safety hazard.\n\nIf you need an audit\n\nBe\nprepared for the auditor to review:\n\nWater Treatment Records\n\nLab\nwater quality test results\n\nLaws and regulations that apply\n\nThere\nare few laws that impact on food safety regulating the treatment of water to be\nused in agricultural production. Generally, these requirements are laid out in\nlaws regarding the processing of meat, fish and other food products, which are\noutside the scope of this document.\n\nThe Safe Drinking Water Act,\n2002 and Regulations, including the Ontario Drinking Water Quality Standards,\nO. Reg. 169/03, set out requirements for water treatment. Approved\ndisinfection methods are listed in \"Procedure for Disinfection of Drinking\nWater in Ontario,\" 2nd Revision, June 14, 2006, adopted by reference by Ontario\nReg. 170/03 under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Check with your local\nhealth inspector for recommended or required water treatment procedures.\n\nDid you know?\n\nIn the fall of 1998, over 500 people across the United\nStates and Canada became sick from eating contaminated chopped, uncooked parsley.\nThe source of contamination was traced to a lack of water treatment to maintain\nwater quality in a hydrocooler on the farm. The municipal water that supplied\nthe hydrocooler was used to immediately chill the parsley after harvest; however,\nthe water was recycled and no water treatment aid was added to maintain the water\nquality. Because the water was recirculated and untreated, pathogenic bacteria\nthat may have been on some of the parsley were now washed off into the water and\nsurvived in the absence of a sanitizer (e.g. chlorine).

We are located on the Durance fault zone which is open down to a depth of 1000m. This fault is still active and micro-earthquakes are a common occurrence.\n\nWhy is the water hot? The water runs down the neighbouring Combe Chave and Risoul mountainsides. It seeps into the fault where it is heated ( 1° centigrade every 33m), and then rises back to the surface.\nThe water is rich in mineral salts dissolved during this journey and the hydraulic action is that of an Artesian well.\nAnalysis reveals that the water is rich in iron (brown colour of deposits) in magnesium (laxative effect) sodium, chloride and sulfate. The water is modified by surface water flows that reduce the temperature and density of the salts. When the water spurts out of the spring, a large amount of carbon dioxide is also released.\n\nThe Swiss or vine spring beyond the greenhouses has a flow rate of 300 litres per minute at 26°. The Rotonde spring has a flow rate of 70 litres per minute at 28°.\n\nThe area is covered with a layer of hard tufa formed by the salts.\nThe flowing of salt water constitutes an ecosystem that can be described as Atlantic marshland (salt meadows) with distinctive vegetation.\nWhat are the biological properties of the waters ?\n- The action on skin diseases, atopic eczema in infants, Leiner moussus disease, skin allergies or infections is impressive. The latest plans to exploit the waters included making cosmetics with mineral salts from the water.\n- soaking in the waters, as in any hot saline water, is extremely beneficial for joint problems, post traumatic disorders and rehabilitation of limbs.\nTaken orally the taste is off-putting but it seems there are certain effects:-\n- it stimulates the intestines, and was taken by the village elders for seasonal purges.\n- diuretic action.\n\nLA ROTONDE\n\nThe Rotonde was built by the Department in 1824. The spring spouted in the centre of this small thermal spa, encircled by a series of wells which captured the water. These were accessed by staircases. The building was heated in all seasons by the hot water, at a temperature of 28°.\nIn 1845 the Town Hall took over its upkeep.\nThe 1824 Rotonde has been restored and is now an exhibition centre for local produce. The spring in front of the Rotonde has been developed with facilities for tourists, including bathing pools, benches , a car park and snack bar, and is regularly controlled."

The micro filtration process is fundamentally the same as reverse osmosis.

Ultra filtration not only filters out what Micro Filtration but as well as viruses.\n\nNano Filtration\n\nNano filtration refers to process to removes any elements larger that 0.001 to 0.005 microns (micrometre- µm). There are membranes that allow molecules either in a gas or gas form smaller than this to pass through the microscopic membrane. The nano filtration process is fundamentally the same as reverse osmosis.\n\nNano filtration removes everything ultra filtration plus many nutrient, pesticides and herbicides. It has the ability to remove salts from water, desalination. The process also removes solutes. The filtered water is extremely low of any nutrients below WHO standard guidelines. Nano filtration only practically operates under high water pressure\n\nElectro-Chemical\n\nThe electro chemical water purification process refers to when water acts like a conductor when water is between two different elements with different and opposing electrical properties. The water allows charge be transferred between the two elements, a spontaneous electrical current is created. The technical term for the reaction is called an oxidation and reduction reaction, Redox. When an element looses electrons it is called Oxidation and when an element gains an electron it is called reduction. When two elements are place together with a transfer fluid it is called an electro chemical cell. As the electrical current passes through the water, the energy from the electrical charge destroys any live bacteria, oocysts, cysts, viruses and anything else alive.\n\nThere are many elements that can be used to generate this voltaic cell (as opposed to electrolytic cell where an external electrical supply is provided). There include carbon, zinc,\n\nElectro dialysis\n\nUsing Electro dialysis in a water purification situation destroys germs, bacteria and cysts through is the process of passing electrical energy through the water. It is accomplished by electrodeionization. It is primarily used for salt water desalination.\n\nAeration\n\nAeration as the name suggests introduces air into the water, in particular oxygen. The oxygen metabolize micro organisms, reduce carbon dioxide as well as it removes methane and hydrogen sulphide. It improves the smell of the water making it good to drink.Aeration is a particularly good where water has a high iron and manganese content, removing the bitter taste of the water. The Aeration process needs to be used in conjunction with another process to remove bad bacteria, cysts and viruses.\n\nIodine Disinfection\n\nIodine can be uses as a water disinfectant, often referred to water purification. The chemical, iodine has the ability to destroy bacteria, viruses and cysts at appropriate levels of concentration and sufficient time in contact the micro organisms. At low dosages iodine is in effective against Giardia and Cryptosporidium (see WHO guidelines). Iodine requires sufficient contact time with bacteria's, viruses and cysts to destroy. Short contact with iodine may be in effective.\n\nPeople with thyroid disorders or pregnant women should not use Iodine in water as it has a major impact. In addition no one should have more than 5 mg of iodine per week. That's less than 5 drops of un-concentrated iodine.\n\nChlorine Disinfection\n\nChlorine disinfection refers to the process where chlorine is added into the water with the view of killing bacteria, viruses, protozoa cysts like Giardia and Cryptosporidium. Chlorine is an oxidization agent. The chlorine at drinkable levels destroys harmful bacteria but not Giardia and Cryptosporidium cysts.\n\nChlorine can react to naturally occurring chemicals creating harmful by products such as chloramine (dangerous carcinogen).\n\nOften Chlorine is used in conjunction with other chemicals to avoid this carcinogen. Chlorine Dioxide can be used in conjunction to prevent this reaction to occur.\n\nChlorine Dioxide Disinfection\n\nChlorine Dioxide, CIO2, has been used for over 100 years to disinfect water. By adding Chlorine Dioxide, a biocide, in water it becomes an oxidant. The by product of this is chlorite. As an oxidant, it is able destroy bacteria and cysts. It is often used to improve the taste of water, reduce iron and manganese and hydrogen sulphide compounds.There are some low level adverse impacts to human health such as neurotoxicity and reproductive toxicity.\n\nUltra Violet light\n\nWhen water is exposed to sunlight it has powerful purification qualities. It is able to eliminated bacteria, micro organisms, cysts, germs and viruses through a natural process. This process has been around for day one and has been proved effective. It is a natural disinfectant.\n\nThe Ultra Violet radiation (UV radiation) of sunlight is the effective disinfection component. The UV wavelength that is most effective to destroy germs is at 254 nano metres. The UV radiation can be simulated by non natural means.\n\nFor UV water purification to be effective, the UV rays need to have the right combination of length of time, energy levels and contact to destroy dangerous organisms and germs.\n\nReverse Osmosis\n\nThe reverse osmosis process refers to passing a fluid through a membrane by applying pressure (hydraulic pressure) to remove unwanted material. Reverse osmosis is usually used with clear water. When used in conjunction with water and the appropriate size membrane, it is able to effective remove bacteria, viruses, cysts, Giardia and cryptosporidium.\n\nIt is one of the most used processes to filter/purify water and in used in municipal water plant, commercial buildings, homes as well by the AquaSafeCorp product group.\n\nForward Osmosis\n\nThe forward osmosis process refers to passing a fluid through a membrane without applying pressure (except atmospheric pressure, natural forces) to remove unwanted material. When used in conjunction with water and the appropriate size membrane, it is able to effective remove bacteria, viruses, cysts, toxins, giardia and cryptosporidium.\n\nForward osmosis is used in conjunction with some solute. The solute material is nominally a sugar based. Forward osmosis is extremely effective to be used to purify and range of liquids including saltwater, urine and brackish water\n\nThe draw backs of this forward osmosis are\n\n1. It is very slow to filter the water, and\n\n2. The filtered water may not be suitable for a diabetic due to the added sugars\n\nActivated Carbon- Granulated\n\nActivated Carbon is a natural material. It is derived from coal, charcoal, coconut shell, lignite. It is processed into form granules to make it exceptionally porous creating an enormous surface area that allows either adsorption or chemical reactions. As little as 1 gram of granular activated carbon, equates to a surface area of almost 2000 sq metre.Depending of the sources of the activated carbon made (from where it has been derived) each will have slightly different performance characteristics. For example, bituminous carbon has higher chlorine absorption whereas coconut carbon improves the taste of water.\n\nActivated Carbon can also be treated with certain chemical to use the absorption qualities to destroy bacteria.\n\nWith the exceptional porous qualities of the granulated carbon, when water is strained through the granules any chemicals in the water will \"stick\" to the carbon surface making a small film. (Carbon absorption process). This is effective to remove chlorine, benzene, radon, toxaphene and other naturally and man made compounds.\n\nWater needs to be passed through the slow to allow the surface area to work effectively otherwise the efficiency may be as low as 0%.\n\nOther issues with activated carbon are;\n\n• Activated Carbon (no form) removes bacteria.\n\n• Channelling may occur, that is, water makes a direct path through the granules.\n\nSilver impregnated Granular Activate Carbon\n\nSilver based Granular Activated Carbon has a very small percentage of silver spray, typically 1-2% of the surface area. The silver is meant stop bacterial growth. As water is leached through the granules, the silver becomes prematurely removed into the water supplied.\n\nDistillation\n\nDistillation is the process of heating of water until its vapour point and then recondensing the steam into a container. The collected water has all the impurities removed. This water is called distilled water.\n\nDistilled water has virtually no minerals. Humans require some of minerals in water for dietary purposes for maintain proper health.\n\nOzonation\n\nThe ozonation process refers to when ozone, O3, is used to purifying water. It is one of the best ways to purify water. Ozone, O3, is an effective oxidizing agent, as it has a very high oxidation potential and has a ½ life of less than 30 minutes making it very effective in make water pure, odourless, colourless and safe. Any organisms, micro organisms, bacteria, oocysts, germs, viral DNA (such as smallpox, herpes and hepatitis) and viral RNA (e.g. measles, mumps, West Nile, rubella and influenza), heavy metals and toxins cannot survive when in contact with ozone.\n\nOzone is a pollutant at ground level being created by hydrocarbons and nitrogens getting into contact with sunlight.\n\nThe ozonation process is typically used in large plants as it requires equipment and energy. It normally is used in with a filtration system.\n\nKDF Resin\n\nKDF (Kinetic Degradation Fluxion) Resign is a brand name of a product that has been designed to filter water. It uses a copper and zinc alloys that when water passes through creates an elelectro-chemical oxidation, electrolysis, destroying bacteria. The process is known as \"redox\". In this process electrons are transmitted between molecules and new elements created. The old elements harmful elements are eliminated. For example chlorine is transformed into chloride. The heavy metals in the water are attracted to the KFD surface due the electrical potential difference.\n\nThe KFD is usually used in conjunction with activated carbon (granular).\n\nCeramic Filters\n\nCeramic filters are a man made product that is manufactured with a specific designed pores size to allow water filtration, typically 0.5 microns. Ceramic filters can be used in either a forward or reverse osmosis process.\n\nOften silver is used in the ceramic to stop any fungicidal or algaecidel or bactericidal growth. As silver is toxic to human, silver levels must be kept to a minimum. All water filtration systems in the US must be registered with the EPA.\n\nSolid Carbon Block\n\nA solid Carbon Block absorbs viruses nor bacteria and destroying them with \"food grade\" pesticides or iodine. The pesticide or iodine s is saturated in the Carbon Block. The bacteria and viruses are attracted to the carbon block by \"electro-attractive forces\".\n\nSolid carbon blocks do not work well to destroy Protozoa's cysts, such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium.\n\nWater Boiling\n\nBoiling is the most effective in removing bacteria, viruses and the like out of water provided it is boiled at 100oCfor at least several minutes."

      "text": "Nitrates in Karnataka wells\n\nToxic water (Credit: Siddharth Rao)yet another case of contamination of water has surfaced. The southwestern regional office of the Central Ground Water Board (cgwb) recently released a report of the water quality study conducted in 1300 national hydrograph wells (where water samples are monitored) in Karnataka. The concentration of nitrates is found to vary between 0 and 1000 milligrammes per litre (mg/l) -- well above the stipulated standards.\n\ncgwb regional director C S Ramasesha points out that unlike fluorides, the presence of nitrates is attributed to external pollution only. \"While the sources of nitrate in urban areas are night soil and municipal waste, human and livestock excreta and agricultural fertilisers that leach into groundwater are the culprits in rural pockets,\" he says. Poor maintenance of the septic system (tanks, sewer lines) is a potential source of nitrate and bacteria. The alarming results of the report are an indication of the poor state of the city's sewage and sanitary system.\n\nStudies conducted across Karnataka reveal an increase in nitrate content in groundwater over the past five years. Out of the 48 samples collected in Bangalore in 1997-1998, 52 per cent were within the desired levels stipulated by the Bureau of Indian Standards (bis) (0-45 mg/l), 21 per cent were below their permissible limit (45-100 mg/l) and 27 per cent were found to be unsuitable (over 100 mg/l). In 1999, 62 per cent of the samples were in the second and third categories. On the other hand the Bureau of Indian Standard's maximum permissible limit of nitrates in drinking water is 45 mg/l.\n\n\"The areas which fall under the unsuitable category are located on the outskirts of the city, where there is no proper sewage system. These places do not receive water from the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewage Board and therefore have to depend on contaminated well water,\" explains Ramasesha. The nitrate concentration has doubled within a year in north Bangalore, and the contamination level exceeds the prescribed limit of 45 mg/l in more than 50 per cent of the water in the city.\"More than 10,000 villages in the state have been identified as being affected, but the state has not looked into the source of the problem,\" says Ramasesha.\n\n\"During the past four to five years, not a single case of the syndrome has been registered,\" reveals Ravi Shankar, resident consultant at Bangalore Children's Hospital and Research Centre. But he adds: \"This could be partially because of the absence of diagnostic facilities and lack of awareness among people."

According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the EWG tested 10 brands of bottled water and found that Wal-Mart's Sam's Choice contained chemical levels that exceeded legal limits in California and the voluntary standards adopted by the industry.\n\nFurthermore, the tests found an average of eight contaminants in each brand, and four brands aside from Wal-Mart's were contaminated with bacteria.The EWG also mentions Giant's Acadia, but hasn't released the other brands involved in the test, and says it will only do so after more extensive testing is complete.\n\nOther contaminants found in some of the water samples include caffeine and Tylenol, as well as arsenic, radioactive isotopes, nitrates and ammonia from fertilizer residue. Industrial chemicals used as solvents, degreasing agents and propellants were also found in the tests.\n\nOlga Naidenko, an EWG toxicologist is quoted in the article: \"The investigation has uncovered that consumers cannot be assured of the quality of their bottled water. Our study was a snapshot of the marketplace. We found some brands that provided good quality and other brands that contained various chemical pollutants. What this shows is that consumers cannot have confidence.\"\n\nThe FDA requires bottled water to meet the same standards as tap, which is 80ppb (parts per billion). However, the article says that the FDA doesn't require bottled water companies to reveal the source and presence of contaminants in their water, which municipal water suppliers must do by law.\n\nAmericans drank more than 8 billion gallons of bottled water in 2007, according to the FDA. The SF Chronicle says the typical cost is $3.79 per gallon, 1,900 times the cost of public tap water.\n\nBut It looks like there has been some progress in the green campaign to bring people back to tap. PepsiCo announced it would cut 3,300 jobs and as many as six plants to cut costs, according to the New York Times, because quarterly earnings were down 10 percent, in part due to declines in sales of soda and bottled water in the US.\n\nThe article says that according to PepsiCo and industry analysts, consumers are increasingly choosing tap water over other beverages at restaurants and at home to help save money and the environment. Research found that 34 percent of consumers say they are reusing plastic bottles more often and 23 percent say they are choosing tap water over other beverages to create less waste.\n\nCarbonated soft drink sales have been declining for years, but the volatile economy has added new problems; consumers are eating out less and buying fewer grab-and-go beverages."

Many tanks are replaced simply because the electricals went bad or someone switched from gas to electric. They are glass or porcelain lined so unless they were handled roughly and the liner cracked rustout is not usually a problem. You can pick them up for scrap prices or free. Automatic water rotation, the fresh water comes in as the old water goes out when you open a tap. Flush any sediment out and slosh some bleach in there before you hook it up. Added bonus in the summertime is the water sits in the tanks and heats up from the ambient air temp, so less energy is used by the actual water heater.\n\nI just use the Coghlans (sp?) water purifier tablets sold at almost any sporting goods department in the camping aisle. The tablets are all basically the same stuff, the one I bought last time has a bottle of vitamin c tablets to add after the purification process is complete. Supposed to remove a lot of the taste.

      "text": "Consider a Home Water Filter\n\nContaminants in water can be colorless, odorless and unhealthy.\n\nThe U.S. water supply is considered to be among the safest in the world, with all but 15 million Americans receiving treated tap water from public water systems.\n\nFor those 15 million relying on drinking water from private wells, though, regular testing or a water filter may be the only protection from contaminants that can be colorless and odorless, but do real harm. Many rural water supplies are safe because groundwater is naturally filtered, but shallow wells or nearby sources of pollution may compromise their integrity. In some areas, contamination can come from the ground itself, if naturally occurring arsenic or fluoride deposits are nearby, for instance.\n\nMany who drink public water also may want to use a filter because certain contaminants may still be flowing along with the treated water.\n\nAlong with removing that chlorine taste that often accompanies treated water, the right filter can remove the disinfection byproducts that flow through the tap. The Environmental Protection Agency, which sets the standards for allowable levels of contamination in drinking water, and the testing procedures water plants must adhere to, has cracked down on the allowable levels of disinfection byproducts in tap water, as science reveals health risks. But not all watchdogs have been satisfied with the EPA targets, and a recent Government Accountability Office study found that many water quality and water testing violations go unreported.\n\nAnother contaminant of concern is lead, which can enter tap water from the pipes in older homes long after the water has flowed from a municipal water treatment plant. Cooking with and drinking only cold tap water after opening the tap long enough to flush water that has been standing in pipes will generally prevent exposure, but some filters can also remove lead."

      "text": "What percentage of Canadians\nrely on private water supplies? An estimated 25% percent of Canadians, living primarily in\nrural areas, rely on private wells, cisterns or other sources for\ntheir drinking water. It must be emphasized that these\nindividuals have the sole responsibility for ensuring the safety\nof their water supply. The most important concern for safe water\nin these systems is microbiological safety since the presence of\na microbiological risk can and will have an immediate acute\neffect on those who consume the water. Chemical contamination\nproblems do occur and frequently while of concern, the condition\nis not normally of an acute health concern. Exceptions may be\nwhen there is a chemical transport accident in the vicinity, or\nthere is or has been excessive or inappropriate use of\nfertilizers or pesticides.\n\nWhat can be done to protect\nthe quality of well water? Action for ensuring the microbiological safety of well water\nis paramount and comes down to frequent testing and adequate\nwell-head protection. It is recommended that water be tested\nregularly for bacteriological quality, and be further tested for\nchemical contamination if that is suspected. Any changes in\nclarity, colour, odour or taste can indicate chemical\ncontamination, and tests should be carried out if this occurs.\nDepending on the province, bacteriological testing of well water\nis done either by the provincial health laboratory or by\ncertified private laboratories, but at the owners expenses. All\nnew wells are required to be tested, retesting is left up to the\nowner. Tests for chemical contamination are normally referred to\nprivate laboratories, although some provinces will analyze water\nfor nitrates. The Environmental Health Division of the local\nHealth Unit is able to supply information on possible\ncontaminants which are known to be found in local wells or water\nsupplies, and will help interpret results of chemical and\nbacteriological tests.\n\nHow do wells become\ncontaminated? Groundwater\ncan become contaminated in several ways:\n\nGeologic\nformations may remove some contaminants. For example, metals like\nlead and mercury can become attached to soil particles. Nitrate\nlevels can be reduced in the aquifer through denitrification. The\nlikelihood that groundwater could become contaminated depends on:\n\nthe size or\nstrength of the contamination source\n\nthe ease\nwith which the contaminant can move into or travel\nthrough the soil\n\nContaminants\nmove most easily through coarse-textured soils (sand and gravel)\nand fractured bedrock. But even clay soils can have fractures\nthat allow the movement of contaminants. Once contaminants have\nreached an aquifer, they are difficult and expensive to remove.\nHigh levels of a contaminant in an aquifer can make the water\nunfit and unsafe to use.\n\nWhere can I get more\ninformation on groundwater and well testing in my province? The provinces have labs to which you can take water to be\ntested for more information on this service in your province\nfollow the hyperlink for groundwater testing information in your\nprovince?\n\nWhat do I do if my water\ntests positive for microbiological contamination? Well water should be tested regularly for bacterial\ncontamination and laboratories will measure both the total\ncoliform levels and test for E.coli. The presence of\ncoliform could indicate that the water has been contaminated by\nfecal matter. The presence of E. coli indicates that water\nis contaminated by fecal matter. Drinking water should\ncontain no more than 10 total coliform bacteria per 100 mL of\nwater, and absolutely no E.coli. If well water exceeds\nthese parameters the water should be \"shock treated,\"\nand if possible the source of the contamination found and\neliminated. Shock treatment involves adding normal unscented\nhousehold bleach to the well water, the amount of bleach added\ndepends on the depth and diameter of the well. In some cases this\ntreatment may be sufficient to eliminate the problem. However, if\nit does not, a disinfection device can be installed. A\ndisinfection device should not be used as a replacement for a\nsafe water supply. If the water supply is chronically\ncontaminated by fecal material, a new water supply must be found.\nDisinfection devices are not commonly used by well owners - most\nassume, once the well has been approved for use that their water\nwill remain safe.\n\nWhat disinfection devices are\navailable for private water supplies? These fall into two types: those that use chemical\ndisinfectants and those which use Ultra Violet (UV) light. They\nare most important for persons being supplied from rural private\nwell systems.\n\nChemical disinfection devices\nintroduce disinfectant chemicals into the incoming water. Ideally\nthis should take place before any storage tank system, so as to\nprovide a residency time that allows the disinfectant to work.\nThe disadvantage of this system is that it will also introduces\nan odour and taste effect to the water, which some consumers find\nobjectionable. These devices may have control systems on them\nthat can shut down the water supply system if the chemical source\nhas been exhausted and the disinfection process stopped. There\nare two principal chemical disinfectants chlorination and\nozonation.\n\nWhat is chlorination and how\ndoes it work? Chlorination destroys disease-causing bacteria, nuisance\nbacteria, parasites and other organisms. It also removes soluble\niron, manganese and hydrogen sulfide from water. One of the main\nadvantages to chlorination is that it is a proven technology, and\nchlorine provides residual protection which can protect against\nre contamination. Devices which continuously chlorinate a\nhome's water supply are available, these use an injector to\nintroduce chlorine into the system, water must be in contact with\nchlorine for 15 minutes to completely kill all bacteria Chlorine\nmust be maintained at a level at which it can be tasted in water\nto ensure disinfection. Further treatment is often undergone in\norder to remove particulate matter and to de-chlorinate the water\nimmediately before drinking using carbon filters to remove the\ntaste and odour effects.\n\nWhat is ozonation and how\ndoes it work? In these units ozone is produced by a generator and pumped\nthrough the water to be treated, it oxidizes contaminants and is\neffective in removing bacteria and microorganisms. Ozone units\nmay also remove other contaminants like organic pesticides.\nAdditional filtration is needed to remove parasites and\nparticulate matter. It offers some residual protection against\nre-contamination, but this effect is short-lived. This technology\nis easy to install and maintain. However, it can be expensive,\nand the unit must be properly maintained to shield against excess\nozone escaping, and to maintain the necessary mixing ratio of\nozone to water.\n\nWhat is ultraviolet\ndisinfection and how does it work? Ultraviolet light treatment uses ultraviolet light to\ndisinfect water or reduce the amount of heterotrophic\n(non-harmful) bacteria. This method uses no chemicals, and\nproduces no taste or odour. It takes only a few seconds of\nexposure to disinfect the water, is easy to install and\nrelatively inexpensive. However, it is effective in ensuring only\nthe microbiological safety of the water, and further treatment is\nneeded to remove any parasites and other contaminants. The device\nis installed so that water passes around the UV light which is\nilluminated only when the water is flowing through the system. A\nhigh intensity light disinfects the water as it passes around the\nlight source. If the water is not clear, the turbidity or\ndissolved solids in the water may form on the surface of the UV\nlight source, slowly diminishing the effectiveness of the\nprocess. Again, modern devices have a fail safe, shut off switch\nwhich prevents water from flowing through a non-functioning\ndevice. The advantage of UV light systems is that they do not\naffect the taste or odour of the water, although they are more\ncostly to purchase and operate.\n\nHow can I treat the\ntaste odour or appearance of my water? The appearance,\ntaste and smell of drinking water is usually more obvious to the\nconsumer than the bacterial quality. Chemicals such as iron,\nmanganese, calcium hardness and sulphide, often common in private\nwater supplies, can impart disagreeable taste and odours. These\nproblems pose no threat to human health, and the water is safe to\ndrink without further treatment, however, there are devices\navailable to correct these problems, but they do not disinfect,\nand in some cases can accumulate any existing bacterial\ncontamination. Below are specific devices commonly used in rural\nsettings. Other treatment devices are described in the CMHC/CWWA\npamphlet regarding Water Quality - Public Water Supplies. These\ntreatment devices should only be used in water that is already\nmicrobiologically secure. Before any treatment device is\npurchased, the water should be tested, to ensure that the best\nand most economic treatment is selected.\n\nWhat is hard water and how do\nyou treat it? Groundwater dissolves rocks and minerals releasing calcium\nand magnesium ions that cause water to be hard. Hard water can\nleave scales or deposits in kettles and water heaters and\ninhibits the performance of soaps, shampoo and detergents.\nSoftening water makes it more suitable for washing and prevents\ndeposits in appliances and pipes. Water softeners work by\nexchanging the unwanted calcium ions with sodium or potassium and\ndo so using special resins. All softeners need to be recharged on\na regular basis (depending on their capacity and the volume of\nwater softened. The recharge water is discharged into the sewer\nline if it is attached to municipal supply system or into a\nsceptic tank if attached to a well water supply. The water\nproduced with a sodium exchange system is not generally\nrecommended for drinking or cooking due to its increased sodium\ncontent. Both the sodium and the potassium softeners decrease\nessential mineral content and have the potential of bacterial\ngrowth. Softened water is also not recommended for watering house\nplants, lawns and gardens due to its sodium or potassium content.\nWastewater from the softener recharging cycle is not believed to\noverload or reduce the effectiveness of small septic systems, but\nthere have been examples of the leachate re-entering the\ngroundwater source for the well, thus increasing the sodium and\ncalcium content of the source water. Sodium free water\nconditioners are available that claim to remove calcium by either\ncatalytic bars or magnetic means. However the effectiveness of\neither of these methods is questionable and it is the position of\nthe Canadian Water Quality Association (CWQA) that they do not\nwork.\n\nWho\ngoverns well drilling?\nMost jurisdictions have regulations governing the construction of\nwater wells. Such regulations set out minimum construction\nstandards for all types. The main purpose of the standards is to\nkeep surface water and foreign matter out of wells and aquifers.\nRegulations cover:\n\nwho is\nqualified to construct wells and install pumps\n\nwhere a\nwell can be located\n\nhow the\nwell is to be constructed, and what materials can be used\n\nwell\nowner's responsibilities\n\nwhen a well\nmust be properly plugged and sealed\n\nWhere\ncan I locate a new well? Location plays an important role when planning a new\nwell or upgrading an existing one. Well locations need to meet\nthe minimum separation distances specified by your local\nprovincial or state regulations. Greater separation distances\nshould be allowed wherever possible. Most provinces have\nregulations that make requirements regarding the minimum\nseparation distance between wells and potential contamination\nsources. For specific requirements in your province search the\nlegislation database."

Foregoing a bit? Eating the canned food or cooking the dry beans/rice?\n\nShowers??? No, if it's a disaster, I'll moisten a towel. I live in a desert city, so no water means no water. We have creeks that flow from the mountains, but they're low most of the summer and there'd be too much competition for it. Yes, it's a city, but the point is not to have to be desperate by the time help arrives.\n\nI live alone and keep two five gallon containers of fresh water in the back of a closet, so I figure 5 days at two gallons a day for drinking and cooking. I should get a third jug to make it a week, but I keep putting it off. I empty them periodically and treat them briefly with a dilute chlorine solution before rinsing and refilling them because the water might as well taste good. You can get stackable square or rectangular containers from the grocery or camping store and some come with built-in spigots.\n\nI also keep chlorine tablets with my camping gear along with plastic bottles of propane for my Coleman stove. Lots of candles and batteries for my headlamp and flashlights. Not enough rice and beans or whatever socked away; I've always thought I should get one of those five gallon buckets that's supposed to last a family for weeks but they don't look particularly nutritious. Freeze dried food has come a long way, so I'm thinking of finding a cheap source and stocking up. Even MREs aren't as bad as they used to beHere in central Texas the rain's not reliable enough for a rain barrel or cistern. I keep a bunch of big 5-gallon jugs of distilled water in the basement, about ten of them all told. You know, though, I haven't checked them in a long time . . . I guess I just assumed that water wouldn't go bad if not exposed to air or likely to contain organisms of its own. Hmm . . . am I making a false assumption here? Maybe I should crack one of those jugs and test the water.\n\nIf nothing else, water will usually taste pretty stale after a certain amount of time sitting in a plastic container. If the container and water were clean when you put the water away it should be safe; I only store water that's been run through a filter that removes all bacteria, just to be safe. If you treat the containers with chlorine and fill them at the grocery store you'd be just fineSometimes \"periodically\" means every year and a half.

Fluoridation is also a cause of fluorosis - or mottled teeth.\n\nIn recent years, scientists and health professionals have been sounding a warning about the dangers of water fluoridation.\n\nThe Canadian Cancer Society states: \"We know that fluoride helps to prevent tooth decay, but some recent studies have raised fears that water fluoridation may be linked to an increased risk of osteosarcoma especially in boys.\" The Canadian Cancer Society recommends that fluoride in drinking water be reduced to the lowest possible level.\n\nThe health impact of too much fluoride\n\nExcessive fluoride is a concern in regard to young children. One possible result of taking in too much fluoride during the tooth-forming years is a condition called dental fluorosis. Excess fluoride affects the cells in the tooth that form enamel. As a result, the enamel of the tooth becomes hypomineralized and more porous. In most cases, the enamel exhibits faint white lines or streaks. In more severe cases, the surface of the enamel is stained yellow or brown and pitted.\n\nFluoride and cancer: the evidence\n\nWhile decades of research have shown that water fluoridation helps to prevent tooth decay, there is also evidence suggesting a potential relationship between exposure to high levels of fluoride in drinking water and cancer, particularly osteosarcoma in boys younger than 19. Osteosarcoma is a type of rare bone cancer . According to Canadian Cancer Statistics, 170 cases of osteosarcoma were reported in between 1997 and 2001, an average of 34 cases per year.\n\nFluoride Filters\n\nInstalling an industry leading fluoride filter such as the MineralPRO™ Reverse Osmosis Drinking Water Filter will provide assurance that you will have safe, healthy drinking water no matter what contaminants are in your water including fluoride.\n\nFor more information regarding fluoride in water and fluoride water filters please contact MineralPRO™.\n\nTestimonials\n\nFlowers last longer\n\"We are writing to say how very pleased we are with our MineralPRO™ water system.

This mission extends to providing clean, safe drinking water for passengers and employees. In more than 60 years of commercial airline operations, there has been no documented case of any outbreak of illness or a public health threat resulting from the consumption of drinking water on commercial aircraft flown by U.S. carriers, and the A4A member airlines continue to take steps to ensure the ongoing quality of aircraft drinking water.\n\nAircraft Drinking Water Systems: How do they Work?\n\nThe aircraft used by A4A members employ closed-loop water systems with various size water tanks depending on the aircraft make, model and configuration. The water tanks are generally small due to the limited on-board demand for water in the galleys and lavatory wash basins (toilets are served by a separate system), as well as the need to limit excess weight. For example, Boeing 737 aircraft, which can hold up to approximately 140 passengers, typically have water tanks with a capacity between 20 and 60 gallons. Given the small size of aircraft water systems, water is replenished regularly from regulated airport public water supplies. An aircraft water system is refilled by personnel using FDA-regulated equipment and approved refilling procedures.\n\nAircraft Drinking Water Regulation\n\nAircraft drinking water has long been regulated by the federal government. Beginning in 1979, the EPA issued Water Supply Guidance requiring carriers to implement operation and maintenance programs to ensure safe drinking water. A revised guidance was issued in 1986 and carriers revised their programs to comply with the guidance. In 2003, EPA undertook a review of the aircraft drinking water program and decided to promulgate a new drinking water regulation specifically tailored to aircraft. As part of the process, A4A members entered into Administrative Orders on Consent (AOCs) with EPA to further refine the maintenance and operation programs, and to develop monitoring and disinfection protocols and procedures. After significant cooperation and collaboration with the airlines, EPA issued a Final Aircraft Drinking Water Rule in 2009. The Aircraft Drinking Water Rule went into effect on October 19, 2011.Under the rule, each airline conducts a thorough program consisting of water sampling, disinfection and flushing of the aircraft water system, and operation and maintenance of the aircraft and water supply system."

      "text": "Latest revision as of 06:15, January 25, 2010\n\nDrinking water can be easily pasteurized using solar energy and a few simple materials. When water or milk is pasteurized the common disease-causing organisms are killed.\n\nWhat you will need\n\nA cardboard box or other container such as a basket or wooden box. Container materials must have basic heat retaining qualities. Bricks and metal containers do not work well unless they are insulated.\n\nAluminum foil to line the inside of the box and the flaps. While it is possible to pasteurize a small amount of water without aluminum foil, its use appreciably improves performance.\n\nA dark colored solar absorber plate made of sheet metal, cardboard, or wood. Metal works best to conduct the heat to the water containers.\n\nA solar \"window\" made of glass or plastic film over the top of the box.\n\nA reflector to bounce in additional sunlight.\n\nDark or clear containers to hold water or food (since you can cook in this oven as well).\n\nTo pasteurize water, heat it in the solar box to at least 65 degrees C (150 F) and keep the water at that temperature or above for at least 30 minutes. If no thermometer is available, heat until bubbles are rising from the bottom steadily. Natural waxes, such as beeswax, can be used to indicate pasteurization temperature. Also, you can use a WAPI device.\n\nSolar conditions, weather conditions, latitude and box efficiency are all variables that affect the ability of solar boxes to pasteurize water. As a general guideline, 4 liters (~1 gallon) of water can be pasteurized in about 3 hours on a day with strong sunlight and the sun high in the sky. The plastic-or glass-covered opening should be at least 45 x 60 cm (18\" x 24\") and have a depth just taller than the water containers inside. Larger boxes can pasteurize more water, smaller less.\n\nPasteurization kills germs and disease-carrying organisms in drinking water including bacteria, rotaviruses, enteroviruses, and cysts commonly transmitted in contaminated water. Pasteurized water is not sterilized, however, and therefore should not be used for medical procedures. Pasteurization does not remove chemical contamination such as pesticides or industrial wastes."

      "text": "The Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 charges the EPA with protecting the quality of drinking water for all 170,000 public water systems in the U.S.\n\nEnvironmental Nutrition Newsletter\n\nAh, life-sustaining water. A cool, fresh drink to quench your thirst, hydrate your body and flush away toxins. At least 50 percent of your body weight is water; it protects your joints, maintains body temperature, transports nutrients and more. Even if you never ponder these critical roles for water, you probably know that you can't live without it. Recently, due to frequent reports of contaminated water, many Americans have become concerned about the safety of our water supply.\n\nLast year, the Environmental Working Group (EWG), a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization committed to environmental safety, analyzed nearly 20 million water records from 45 states from 2004 to 2009 and found 316 contaminants in the states' tap water. Among these pollutants were radon, a radioactive gas; Freon, a common refrigerant; the weed killer metolachlor; and acetone, a common component of nail polish remover.\n\nThe biggest concern, says Nneka Leiba, M.Phil., M.P.H., a research analyst with the EWG, is that \"nearly two-thirds of these contaminants are unregulated, and some have been linked to severe health risks.\"\n\nThe EPA's role in safe water\n\nThe Safe Drinking Water Act, passed in 1974, charges the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with protecting the quality of drinking water for all 170,000 public water systems in the U.S. President Gerald Ford signed this legislation because of public outcry over lead, carcinogenic, and foul smelling contaminants in water. Much has been accomplished since then.\n\nAccording to EPA press officer Ernesta Jones, the EPA set maximum contaminant levels for dozens of contaminants (such as arsenic, lead, industrial chemicals, bacteria and viruses), regularly studies additional contaminants to determine if they need regulation, and revises current regulations based on new scientific data.\n\nSipping contaminants\n\nThe most common contaminants found in tap water are disinfection byproducts produced by disinfectants like chlorine that are added to drinking water to kill disease-producing bacteria or viruses. These are regulated compounds permissible in the water as long as the concentration does not exceed the EPA's limit. However, when disinfectants react with decaying leaves and other organic matter in the water, DNA-damaging, cancer-causing byproducts called trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids are formed, according to Leiba. In some instances, EWG found them in concentrations above legal limits.\n\nSome experts believe that the EPA needs enforceable thresholds for many more pollutants. For example, perchlorate--one of the most harmful contaminants found in water--is unregulated. Used in the manufacture of fireworks, flares and solid rocket propellant, perchlorate can be toxic to the thyroid gland when ingested. The thyroid gland affects your metabolic rate, heart rate, body temperature, skin maintenance and more.\n\nHormones, antibiotics and other drugs also make their way into the public water supply. Though the bathroom is likely the source of this contamination, it's not just from the toilet. Yes, drugs are excreted through feces and urine, and many people flush expired or unused medications down the toilet, but your morning shower is also responsible for contamination, say researchers in the December 2009 issue of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry.\n\nSome medications or their byproducts that are excreted in sweat, as well as those applied topically, can wash off in the shower or tub. Drugs making their way into the water supply is definitely cause for concern, but Ilene S. Ruhoy, M.D., Ph.D, coauthor of the study and director of the Institute for Environmental Medicine at Touro University in Nevada, stresses that the concentrations identified in drinking water are very, very low thus far.\n\nCleaning up water\n\nMuch more needs to be done to ensure our water is safe, specifically, by cleaning up the rivers and reservoirs that provide drinking water, stresses Leiba. Protecting this source water will reduce both the chemicals in drinking water and the cost of treating the water.\n\nWith the floodgates of public concern open again, EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson announced in March that her agency will go beyond the traditional framework of addressing contaminants individually and employ a grouping system, which will allow for a better and faster way of regulating them.\n\nThe EPA is also looking to partner with the private sector, including entrepreneurs and small businesses, to improve the treatment of drinking water. These are good steps, says Leiba, and the EWG will watch closely for implementation of these new strategies.\n\nFilter Your Water\n\nOnce you've learned which contaminants flow from your faucet you can pick an appropriate filter. According to the EWG, a relatively inexpensive carbon filter that mounts on your faucet or comes in a pitcher can remove a large number of contaminants such as lead, chlorine and asbestos, but will not remove other pollutants such as perchlorate and nitrates.\n\nThough more expensive, a reverse osmosis (RO) filter can remove many of the lingering contaminants leftover from a carbon filter. RO filters usually fit under the kitchen sink and work by allowing nothing larger than a water molecule to pass through a semi-permeable membrane. Some models combine RO technologies with carbon filters.\n\n-- Contact your local water supplier; they're required to provide an annual report, sometimes called a Consumer Confidence Report, including information on contaminants found in the water, overall water quality and the source of your local water. They will send you a copy or you might find it online (\n\n-- Visit the EWG website ( to search for the contaminants found in your water supply during the five years of their study.\n\n-- If you suspect that you may have lead in your household plumbing, you'll need to have your home water tested (your water supplier tests water at the treatment plant). Call your state certification officer ( to find a certified water-testing lab."

The lime should be of high purity, with a high calcium oxide level and high chemical reactivity.\n\nIn the treatment of drinking water, lime is used to increase pH in order to help control the growth of bacteria and certain viruses. In waste water and industrial liquid-waste treatment, lime is cost-effective because of its high neutralizing power and rapid rate of acid neutralization. It also reduces dissolved solids in the effluent stream. Slurried lime precipitates heavy metals out of solution in liquid wastes. The metals can then be removed via settling and/or filtration.\n\nLime and lime kiln dust (a ground limestone or calcium carbonate) are also used to treat sewage biosolids and animal wastes, as well as solid hazardous material and industrial sludge. Treatment of human biosolids requires the use of lime, rather than limestone, to help control pathogen growth and convert the sludge into a usable agricultural product.\n\nAcid Rain Remediation Lime kiln dust can also be used to treat streams, ponds, and lakes affected by acid rain. Acid rain has a doubly harmful effect on bodies of water, causing pH to drop from both its inherent acidity and the runoff it causes in adjacent acidic soils. Coarsely ground calcium carbonate (GCC) is often slurried and pumped into the water from a boat. In less accessible areas, the dry powder can be dropped from aircraft."

The PTG process is simply elegant in its design and its unique ability at handling varying types of wastewater streams.\n\nWill the entire treatment plant have to be changed to accommodate a PTG disinfection system?\n\nNo. One of the great attributes of a PTG system is its flexibility and modularity. PTG systems can be an easily added to an existing facility or be can be incorporated into the design of an entirely new wastewater treatment plant.\n\nWhat if the treatment plant does not want to generate electricity; can the PTG process still work?\n\nGood question. The PTG system can work quite effectively without generating power through a turbine. We have a couple plants that have decided to burn their Biogas directly in a heater box and use that hot air to disinfect their wastewater stream. This option also allows them to change to a turbine based system at a later date, if they decide.\n\nWhat types of wastewater can the Pasteurization process disinfect?\n\nThe PTG system is an incredibly robust disinfection process that can work on most wastewater streams. By relying on heat and not UV rays, the PTG process can more easily handle dirty wastewater streams. An example of this is how the PTG process successfully disinfected canal water in Florida, which had extremely high turbidity levels.\n\nCan the PTG system work if the facility does not generate Biogas (methane/digester gas)?\n\nAbsolutely. Our first system was for a municipality that did not generate Biogas. They determined that the savings that would occur from not having to pay \"Utility\" electricity rates, along with the reduced O&M of a PTG system were still quite significant.\n\nIt seems that there cannot possibly be enough heat energy in the exhaust to heat the wastewater to a temperature that can kill pathogens, how can this be?\n\nThe patented PTG process utilizes both the heat energy in the exhaust stream as well as the heat energy in the disinfected wastewater stream. The majority of the heat energy is transferred from the hot water exiting the system to the cold water entering the system. This proprietary system of heat exchangers multiplies the volume treated by over 35 times. It is through the continual transfer of heat energy that PTG has created such an incredibly efficient and simple system.\n\nIf you have an issue that is not covered in the above F.A.Q., please feel free to send us an email and ask your question directly."

Chlorine, iron, manganese, chloramines, tannin, nitrate, TDS, sodium, chlorides, sulfates and many other elements in the water are not desirable for distilling alcohol or brewing beer.\n\nBeer Brewing\n\nBeer contains approximately 90% water, and the importance of the water to final beer quality cannot be over-estimated. Water impacts beer in three ways: (1) Water ions are critical in the mashing process for all grain brewers, where the character of the water determines the efficiency and flavor of the extracted wort; (2) water also affects the perceived bitterness and hop utilization of finished beer; and (3) water adds flavor directly to the beer itself because water is the largest single component in finished beer.\n\nDepending upon the type of beer, certain water ions will greatly affect the final product: magnesium, calcium, sulfate, chloride, carbonate and sodium. US Water does not brew beer, but the best brewers do start with the highest purity and add back certain ions depending upon the type of beer they are brewing. US Water specializes in providing high-purity water for all distillation and brewing companies, especially smaller companies, micro-breweries and distilleries that uses under 30,000 gallons per day.\n\nDistilled Spirits\n\nThe age-old tradition of distilling whiskey involves just three simple ingredients: water, yeast, and barley. It is the purity of these elements that creates the complexity of character evident in the finest single malts. It is difficult to overstate the importance of water quality in the distilling of a premium single malt whiskey or scotch. Water literally is the lifeblood of the product. Apart from its direct role as an ingredient, water naturally informs the character of the remaining elements used in distilling. Vodka is also a distilled spirit that is enhanced with clean, clear water. US Water is the simple solution to solving all your water treatment problems for distilled spirit alcohol production.\n\nTreatment Systems\n\nTo properly treat water for brewing and distillation, it is important that all unnecessary contaminants be removed. The most effective method for remoiving the largest spectrum of contaminants is Reverse Osmosis. Prior to the reverse osmosis system, chlorine and other organics are removed by a backwashing carbon filter and if the water contains iron/manganese or sulfur, it must also be removed. If the water is over 4 or 5 grain hard (over 70 mg/l hardness), then a water softener or anti-scalant must proceed the reverse osmosis system.\n\nAfter the water is processed through the reverse osmosis system it is stored in an atmospheric storage tank that is from 100 gallons to up to 2,000 gallons in capacity. Some distilleries opt to put the water from the RO system through a deionization (DI) system which results in absolutely pure water with a pH of 7.0. After the storage tank, there is a re-pressurization pump that delivers the water to the desired sources at approximately 60 PSI up to 22 GPM. In order to prevent any airborne bacterial contamination, there is an ultraviolet (UV) light in-line to destroy any bacteria.\n\nUS Water offers a variety of monitoring and water quality options to monitor your water quality. Additionally, many breweries utilize a calcite filter which adds a small amount of calcium carbonate back to the water for flavor and to raise the pH. That is your choice – there is no right or wrong answer."

On April 17, DENR completed source water assessments for each public drinking water system in South Dakota.\n\nSource water assessment is a process that identifies critical areas around each public drinking water system's water well or intake, inventories potential sources of pollution in those critical areas, and determines how susceptible each water source may be to contamination. The source water assessment reports present the results of the evaluations for each public water supply system.\n\nThe department completed 574 assessments. In each assessment, DENR assigned to each public water system a susceptibility rating based on a number of potential risk factors. About 32 percent of South Dakota's public water supply systems use water sources that are at lower risk of becoming contaminated, 55 percent are at moderate risk, and 13 percent are at higher risk.\n\n\"Rest assured, a public water supply system with a high susceptibility rating is still delivering water to your tap that's safe to drink,\" said Steve Pirner, secretary of the DENR. \"Regular laboratory testing ensures that your tap water is safe. These assessments were done to simply make public officials aware of potential risks to their sources of drinking water.\"\n\nThe water supply system operators, with local support and working with local community leaders, can use the information gathered through the assessments as the basis to protect the quality of their drinking water source. Local management and protection strategies may include actions such as zoning, health regulations, public education, land acquisition, collection of stored waste materials, water quality monitoring, and the encouragement of water conservation.\n\nStates were mandated by Congress in 1996, as an amendment to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, to complete source water assessments. The amendment required states to develop programs to assess the potential for each public water supply drinking water source to becoming contaminated by possible pollution sources in the area.\n\nSouth Dakota's Source Water Assessment and Protection Program Plan was approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1999. For further information on South Dakota's Source Water Assessment and Protection Program, go to  DES/ground/Sourcewater/sourcewater.htm or call Sarah Speck at 605-773-3296."

Have you ever considered how many pounds of cleaning powders and soaps you have flushed or drained from your house alone?\n\nBecause the Hydrologic Cycle cannot be stopped, water that should be clean and cleanse the air and ground is now polluted and contaminates our natural resources.\n\nOur water supplies are contaminated, as well as the water supply of plants, and of the animals which eat these plants. Not only are you drinking these toxins in your water, but you are eating plants grown on polluted water, and eating animals that ingest these plants that also drink the polluted water themselves. Not very pleasant, is it?\n\nThe sources and kinds of pollution have increased dramatically in recent years. The municipal water treatment plant's in use today were designed over 100 years ago! It is not capable of removing the complex dissolved chemicals contaminating our water today.\n\nThe 100 year old design duplicates nature's Hydrologic Cycle for the removal of suspended matter.\n\nThis simple method uses settling tanks, then filters through sand and gravel. The treatment plant's, however, introduced chlorine and flouride at several points in the treatment process.\n\nWhat About Rain Water?\n\nRain water used to be the ideal water, but today our air is so polluted that it poisons and contaminates this natural water. From our industrial plants, sulfur dioxides, lead, carbon monoxide and hundreds of other pollutants are sent into the air. So don't drink rain water. To maximize our health, we must drink and consume only the purest of waters.\n\nWater has been referred to as our most precious resource. Without water, all life as we now know it would cease to exist on earth.\n\nWe cannot destroy water — however, the earth isn't creating any new water either.\n\nThere is as much water on earth and in the skies today as existed from the earth's creation. What, then, is the problem? The problem is that we are polluting our water faster than nature can clean it up, and — to add to the problem — we are polluting it in ways, and with contaminants, that did not exist 100 years ago.\n\nOur solution: the WaterMax, designed with nine money-saving patents, and the H3500 Reverse Osmosis System will filter out the harmful contaminants that have been introduced into our environment. It will also eliminate the chlorine that has been added by treatment plants to kill the bacteria that exists in the underground pipes between the treatment plant and your home or business.\n\nOnce the water reaches our homes and businesses, the need for chlorine no longer exists. In fact, we need to eliminate it to reduce the harmful effects it is known to cause.\n\nThe WaterMax and H3500 systems provide the ideal water nature intended."

      "text": "Island Forum: Fluoride is safe and effective and benefits everyone\n\nIn its Dec. 6 edition, the Mercer Island Reporter ran an opinion piece authored by Bill Osmunson. This opinion piece claimed fluoride harms babies. Osmunson's claims are indeed opinions, and they shouldn't be confused with the facts.\n\nCommunity water fluoridation is safe, effective, and benefits everyone – young and old. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) named community water fluoridation one of the ten great public health achievements of the 20th century. Fluoride exists naturally in virtually all water supplies. Water is \"fluoridated\" when a public water system adjusts the fluoride to a level known to prevent tooth decay. Community water fluoridation has been studied for over 60 years and endorsed by numerous health and science organizations including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, and the American Dental Association and by child advocacy groups like Voices for America's Children. Why? Because it reduces tooth decay by up to 40%, benefits people of all ages and incomes, and saves $38 for every dollar invested.\n\nSince the 1940s, communities across the nation have begun fluoridating their water and reducing tooth decay. Mercer Island residents are among over 195 million Americans (over 72% of people living on public water supplies) who receive the benefits of community water fluoridation by simply turning on the tap. Mercer Island's fluoridated water is clean, safe, and effective, and has been since 1970 when fluoridation began.\n\nToday, Americans have access to more fluoride than they did in the 1940s, which causes some people to wonder whether we still need fluoridated water. The answer is yes. It's true that other sources of fluoride, such as toothpaste and mouth rinse, have become much more available in the past 60 years. These other sources of fluoride have helped reduce tooth decay even further, but they do not eliminate the need for community water fluoridation.\n\nFurther, fluoridated water is safe for babies and children and can be safely used to reconstitute infant formula.\n\nWhile tooth decay has decreased over the years, it is still a problem and can impact children's ability to eat, sleep, and learn. The good news is that tooth decay is preventable, and community water fluoridation is a safe, highly effective way to prevent this disease and promote good oral health and overall health for people of all ages and income groups.\n\nMy associates at Mercer Island Pediatrics, Drs. Quinn, Ellner, Schreuder, Gonzalez and myself, Dr. Glassy all agree that fluoride in our drinking water is safe and good for children.

      "text": "Fact vs. Fiction\n\nWith a 90-year track record as a safe, effective disinfectant, chloramine is widely used by municipally run and privately owned water systems across the United States and Canada. Unfortunately, misinformation on the Internet and from other sources has created unnecessary confusion. Below are responses to commonly asked questions about chloramine.\n\nWhy does New Jersey American Water use chloramine for the disinfection process?\n\nTo comply with new, stringent Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations, New Jersey American Water needed to transition the water treatment disinfection practice at several of its facilities from chlorine to chloramine. We made the change to reduce the levels of disinfection byproducts that EPA has found to have known health risks. These byproducts are potentially harmful contaminants that form when chlorine reacts with organic compounds naturally present in our surface water sources of supply during the normal water purification process.\n\nCompared to chlorine, chloramine produces substantially lower concentrations of the disinfection byproducts that the EPA regulates in drinking water. The new federal regulations are in effect, and we took a proactive approach to ensure that our water meets all public health standards.\n\nWhere does New Jersey American Water use chloramines to disinfect treated water?\n\nNew Jersey American Water brings almost 30 years of experience using chloramine to treat water in its Raritan System, which serves customers in Mercer, Somerset, Middlesex and Union Counties.\n\nAs a result of the new more stringent drinking water standards, New Jersey American Water changed the way its drinking water is treated for our customers in Coastal North System beginning June 12, 2012. This change impacts customers in Monmouth and Ocean Counties, EXCEPT for customers in Howell Township, Lakewood, Freehold Township and Farmingdale (Note: there are a handful of customers who will receive chloraminated water in Farmingdale and those customers have been notified directly). For more information, please review our customer notice that was mailed to impacted customers at the end of March. NOTE: The week of the transition was moved to the week of June 11, 2012.\n\nHow does the transition to chloramines affect our drinking water?\n\nPeople use chloraminated water in all the same ways for drinking, bathing, cooking, cleaning and watering lawns and gardens. The only change that customers might notice is a reduced taste and odor of chlorine. If you prefer, products are available that reduce or remove chloramine, such as home treatment systems and water filters, which often contain certifications describing their effectiveness. We recommend that you visit the National Sanitation Foundation's (NSF) Web site[c1] , where NSF provides information on in-home filters that remove chloramine and chlorine.\n\nHow can we be sure that chloramination is safe?\n\nFor nearly 90 years, water systems across the United States and Canada have used chloramine without any ill effects. Every day, one in five Americans receive drinking water treated with chloramine, including residents in Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Boston, Dallas, Indianapolis, Denver and Miami. Please note that two groups of customers need to take special precautions: kidney dialysis patients and fish owners. For more information, visit Precautions for Dialysis Patients and Fish Owners. In addition, New Jersey American Water brings almost 30 years of experience using chloramine to treat water in its Raritan System, which serves customers in Mercer, Somerset, Middlesex and Union Counties.\n\nWhat precautions do kidney dialysis patients need to take?\n\nIn the dialysis process, water comes in direct contact with the bloodstream. Just like chlorine, the presence of chloramine in dialysis water would be harmful and it must be removed. Dialysis systems already pre-treat their source water to remove chlorine and many of the pre-treament systems will also remove chloramines. To be certain that modifications aren't necessary to remove chloramines, dialysis patients should consult with their dialysis provider or health care practitioner. Consult your physician if you have any questions. Read more... Read more...\n\nCan dialysis patients drink chloraminated water?\n\nYes. Chloraminated water can be consumed because the digestive process neutralizes the chloramine before it reaches the bloodstream. Kidney dialysis patients can drink, cook and bathe in water treated with chloramine. Please consult your physician if you have any questions. For more information, customers can also visit the EPA's Chloramines Q and As.\n\nHow are fish affected by chloramines and what precautions should fish owners take?\n\nLike chlorine, chloramines are toxic at low levels and must be removed from the water to be used for aquatic life, because they can come into direct contact with their bloodstream. Therefore, chloramines should be removed from water used in aquariums, fish tanks and ponds. Individuals or businesses that keep fish or other animals in tanks, aquariums, or ponds should ask a pet supply company about removing chloramines. Customers who use drinking water for aquaculture purposes (growing plants in water tanks or ponds) should get expert advice regarding the need and procedures to neutralize or remove chloramines. Also, restaurants and grocery stores with lobster tanks must take special precautions to treat the water.\n\nIs chloraminated water safe for my pets?\n\nChloramine is safe for all mammals – including dogs and cats -- as well as birds and most reptiles. Please consult your veterinarian or local pet store for more information.\n\nDoes chloramine increase the chance of lead poisoning due to leaching from household plumbing?\n\nNo. Proper corrosion control is always the key to reducing the risk of lead leaching, and New Jersey American Water has extensive experience in this field. In fact, when the Washington D.C. water system had issues with lead and a lack of proper corrosion control with chlorine – before it made the transition to chloramine, the EPA called our parent company, American Water, to help resolve the issue. Our environmental experts assisted Washington D.C. officials in developing the solution – a phosphate-based corrosion inhibitor.\n\nNew Jersey American Water practices corrosion control at all of its water treatment facilities, and is in compliance at all systems with the Federal and State Lead and Copper regulation.\n\nShould I be concerned about washing open wounds with chloraminated water?\n\nNo. Water disinfected with chloramine is no different than using chlorinated water to cleanse a wound. Virtually no water comes into direct contact with the bloodstream, so there is no harm.\n\nWill chloramination affect business water users?\n\nBusinesses and other establishments that use municipal drinking water for commercial laundering, laboratory procedures, and other processes that require carefully controlled water characteristics should get advice from equipment manufacturers or other suppliers regarding any changes that may be needed. These types of businesses may include laboratories, microchip manufacturers, biotech companies, soft drink bottlers, photography labs and restaurants or seafood suppliers with fish tanks.\n\nWill chloramine adversely affect my swimming pool?\n\nYou should continue to treat your pool according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Test kits available at your local pool supply store can be used to measure the disinfectant concentration in the pool water. Contact your local pool supply store for additional details.\n\nWhen it comes to gardening, will chloraminated water harm ornamental plants, vegetables, trees or shrubs?\n\nNo. The low levels of disinfectant in the water should not have any effect on plant life. The bacteria that contribute to plant growth live within the soil and are generally protected from chloramine concentrations by the soil layer. Soil will reduce or remove the disinfectant, thereby reducing its levels in the water that reach the plants.\n\nIf you have a question that is not listed here, please send it to us via the Got Questions mailbox, or call our customer service center at 1-800-652-6987."

We need a way to purify that water to get freshwater. A\ncouple ways are\npurifying wastewater are using water stills and removing salt from\nocean water (55). Freshwater is very important and I hope I can\nteach\nyou\nthe long process we go through to get it.\n\nAccording\nthe the article \"The Clean Water Challenge\" one way to purify\nwater is to remove the\ncontaminants from the\nwater. This is the process people go through. First the water\ngoes through settling and skimming. The lighter\npollutants settle on top and are skimmed off. Then, the oxygen that is\nprovided when aeration helps grow bacteria that eat waste material. The\nthird step is to disinfect the water. Chlorine is added to the water in\norder to kill harmful organisms. Then, the water goes through\nfiltering and distilling where the carbon-based pollutants are removed,\ndistilling takes out the salt. After this the water goes through\ncoagulation which is when you add chemicals to the water to\nremove other harmful chemicals. Lastly, removing or reusing sludge is\nthe process of using the nutrient-rich sludge to fertilize soil (12 and\n13). This is\nonly one of many ways to purify water.\n\nAccording to the\nwebsite Solar Water\nDistillation a second way\nto purify\nwater is by using water stills. First the wastewater that\ncould\nhave been contaminated by run off fertilizers, septic systems,\nand industrial pollution is heated by solar energy. The water then\nevaporates and condenses on the glass. Only the water vapor rises\nleaving the contaminants behind. The slope of the glass directs the\ncondensate to a collection bucket, then the water goes to a collection\nbottle and we have freshwater (1-5). This water purification process is\nused\nfor settlements lacking a safe water supply.\n\nAccording to\nRoy A. Gallent, author of Water\nOurPrecious Resource\nanother way to purify water is to remove the salt from ocean water.\nFirst, water is placed into pipes that are heated with steam at 195\ndegrees Farenheit. Then the heated water is placed in the first pipe\nwhere the air pressure is lowered. Lastly, when the water vapor that\nwas released meets with the cold water bringing in seawater, it then\ncondenses into freshwater and the water instantly boils at 153 degrees\nFahrenheit (55-56). I think this is the best way to purify water\nbecause most\nof the world's water is salt water.\n\nAs you can see there\nare many ways to get the freshwater we need and people are working very\nhard to get it. As a review, the first way is to purify contaminated\nwater, the second each to use water stills, and the third is to purify\nocean water by removing the salt (n. pag). Next time you open a water\nbottle, think of the many ways it got there."

(References: 40 CFR 141.32 and 141.35; IDAPA 58.01.08.150.02 and 04).\n\nPublic Notification Requirements\n\nEffective May 6, 2002, amendments to the SDWA, known as the 2000 rule, prescribed specific public notification requirements based on the potential of a violation to cause serious effects. Violations are categorized in the following three-tier system:\n\nTier 1\n\nTier 1 notice is required for all violations or situations with significant potential to cause serious effects due to short-term exposure. Owners or operators must notify all persons served by the system within 24 hours. Notice is to be made by radio and television or by posting or hand-delivery, or other method approved by the primary agency. Posting must continue as long as the violation persists.\n\nIn addition, systems must initiate consultation with the primary agency (in Idaho, the Department of Environmental Quality) as soon as practical but within 24 hours after learning of the violation or situation. Lastly, within 10 days, systems must provide to the primary agency a copy of the notice plus certification that all requirements have been met.\n\nViolations or situations that require Tier 1 notice include:\n\nMCLs and some monitoring violations for fecal coliform/E.coli;\n\nnitrate, nitrite, total nitrate and nitrite MCLs;\n\nchlorine dioxide MRDL (maximum residual disinfectant level) when one or more samples taken in distribution system on the day after exceeding MRDL at entrance of distribution system, or when required samples are not taken in the distribution system;\n\nexceedance of turbidity limit where consultation does not occur within 24 hours or where primacy agency requires 24-hour notice;\n\noccurrence of a waterborne disease outbreak or other waterborne emergency;\n\nother violations or situations as determined by the state.\n\nTier 2\n\nTier 2 notice is required for all other violations or situations with potential to cause serious effects. Owners or operators must notify all persons served by the system within 30 days. Community water systems must use mail or hand-delivery, and other reasonable methods, to notify customers, unless directed otherwise by the primary agency. Non-community water systems must use posting, hand-delivery, or mail, and other reasonable methods, unless primary agency directs otherwise. The notice must be repeated every three months until the violation or situation is resolved. In addition, systems must consult with the primary agency within 24 hours if they exceed the maximum allowable turbidity level.\n\nmonitoring and testing procedure violations elevated by the primacy agency; and\n\nfailure to comply with any variance or exemption schedule violations in place.\n\nTier 3\n\nTier 3 notice is required for all other violations or situations not included in Tiers 1 or 2. Owners or operators must notify all persons served by the system within one year. Community water systems must use mail or direct delivery, and other reasonable methods, to notify customers, unless directed otherwise by the primary agency. Non-community water systems must use posting, direct delivery, or mail, and other reasonable methods, unless primary agency directs otherwise. The notice must be repeated annually.\n\nViolations or situations that require Tier 3 notice include:\n\nMonitoring violations, except where Tier 1 notice is required or the primacy agency determines that the violation requires a Tier 2 notice;\n\nFailure to comply with an established testing procedure, except where Tier 1 notice is required or the primacy agency determined that the violation requires a Tier 2 notice;\n\nOperation under variance granted under §1415 or exemption granted under §1416 of the Safe Drinking Water Act;\n\nAvailability of unregulated contaminant monitoring results; and\n\nExceedance of the secondary maximum contaminant level for fluoride.\n\nRequired Public Notice Contents\n\nNotices must contain the following information:\n\nA description of the violation or situation; when the violation or situation occurred; potential adverse health effects; population(s) at risk; whether alternative water supplies should be used; actions consumers should take; system actions to correct the violation or situation; expected date of return to compliance; name, address, and phone number for additional information; and standard language encouraging distribution to others.\n\nAn explanation of the reason(s) for a variance or exemption; the date it was issued; a brief status report on steps to comply with terms and schedules; and a notice of any opportunity for public input.\n\nIn all cases, systems that serve a large proportion of non-English speaking customers must provide information on the importance of the notice in the appropriate language.\n\nPublic Notification Certification Requirements\n\nAfter you provide notice to your consumers, you must, within 10 days, send your primacy agency a copy of each type of notice you distribute (e.g., newspaper article, press release to TV/radio, mail notices) and a certification that you have met all the public notification requirements. You must send certifications for both initial and any repeat notices. When you certify, you are also stating that you will meet future requirements for notifying new billing units of the violation or situation.\n\nPNiWriter (Public Notification Assistance)\n\nEPA's PNiWriter allows drinking water owners and operators to enter data into a web-based public notification template to generate public notices that meet federal and state requirements. The program takes users through the 10 required elements of a public notice and allows them to insert and edit EPA's recommended text."

      "text": "WATER\n\nThe simple combination of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen\natom creates a water molecule (H2O). Water is the most common\ncompound on Earth, making up over half the weight of living things. It is vital\nto life, bringing nutrients to and taking away waste from every living cell.\nWater molecules are attracted to one another through HYDROGEN BONDS, and this gives water some unusual but useful\nproperties.\n\nMore substances dissolve in water than in any other liquid. Its\nmolecules are small and have a slight electrical charge, so they can move\naround and interact with other particles. If water did not have this property,\nlife could not exist. Water is nature's carrier. Dissolved gases, such\nas oxygen and carbon dioxide, are carried by water to and from all living\ncells.\n\nABUNDANCE OF WATER\n\nWater covers around 70 per cent of the Earth's surface. This\nis why Earth looks blue from space, and why it is often called the Blue Planet.\nWater is liquid in the oceans and forms solid ice caps at the ice caps. Water\nvapour is a gas in air. Humid places, such as rainforests, have a lot of water\nvapour. The human body is about 60 per cent water and a ripe tomato contains\nover 95 per cent water.\n\nDRINKING WATER\n\nAt room temperature, pure water is a colourless liquid with a\nneutral pH – it is not an acid or a base. But most water is not pure.\nHard water contains calcium and magnesium minerals, which have dissolved in the\nwater as it flows over rocks. Soap does not lather well in hard water –\nthe minerals react with the soap to form a scum. Hard water is softened by\nboiling or by passing it through a water softener.\n\nHYDROGEN BOND\n\nWater molecules have an attraction to other water\nmolecules. This attraction is called the hydrogen bond. It is a fairly weak\nbond compared to the bonds within a water molecule, but it is still strong\nenough to give water some unusual properties. For example, water is a liquid at\nroom temperature; other molecules of a similar size are gases. It is also less\ndense as a solid than as a liquid.\n\nMOLECULAR STRUCTURE\n\nIn a water molecule, electrons are pulled closer to the oxygen\natom than the hydrogen atoms. So the oxygen atom has a small negative charge,\nand the hydrogen atoms have a small positive charge. The slightly positively\ncharged hydrogen atoms of one water molecule are attracted to the slightly\nnegatively charged oxygen atoms of another water molecule. This attraction is\nthe hydrogen bond.\n\nWater boils at 100ºC (212ºF). This is almost\n200ºC (424ºF) higher than the boiling points of other\nsimilar-sized molecules, such as hydrogen sulphide. Water's high boiling\npoint can be explained by its hydrogen bonds. Extra heat is needed to break the\nhydrogen bonds, so a water molecule can break free of other water molecules and\nleave the liquid's surface as steam, which is a"

Recently, environmentalists have argued that the government should stop adding fluoride to our water supply. I think this is wrong. I support adding fluoride to our water supply for the same reason I support adding iodine to common table salt. I admit that the addition of iodine to table salt has proven benefits and is far less controversial than the addition of fluoride to the water supply. Still, I wonder if the same environmentalists who argue against fluoride would argue against iodine.\n\nWhich of the following is the author's main point?\n\n(LSAT Tip: Before we show you the potential answer choices, try to come up with your own prephrase of the answer. When you're ready, move on to reading the answer choices.)\n\n(A) The addition of fluoride to our water supply should continue.\n(B) Fluoride should be considered to be as safe and beneficial as iodine.\n(C) The government should continue any efforts it feels are in the public's best interests.\n(D) Environmentalists are unable to recognize the benefits of iodine in table salt.\n(E) Environmentalists should not be believed in matters of public health.\n\nHave you made your selection? If so, let's review a discussion of the answer choices for the LSAT Conclusion question.\n\nFirst, you know from reading the question stem that this is a conclusion question. Second, as you read the stimulus, what was the author's call to action? What did the author want you to do? The author wanted to keep adding fluoride to the water supply. You might have underlined the words \"I think this is wrong,\" which is how the author stated her conclusion.\n\nAnswer choice (A) matches this prephrase and is the right answer. Now let's see why the wrong answers were wrong.\n\n(B) Fluoride should be considered to be as safe and beneficial as iodine.\n\nThe author may believe this (we don't know since it is out of scope), but this can't be the main point. Iodine is only mentioned to support the main point, as material for a premise. It is an analogy, and analogies are never the main point of an argument.\n\n(C) The government should continue any efforts it feels are in the public's best interests.\n\nThis seems to match the spirit of the argument, but it is also out of scope. All we know about is how the author feels about fluoride, not other programs.\n\n(D) Environmentalists are unable to recognize the benefits of iodine in table salt.\n\nOut of scope. We don't know how the environmentalists came to their conclusions.\n\n(E) Environmentalists should not be believed in matters of public health.\n\nEnvironmentalists should not be believed? Not only is that out of scope, the choice of words is too extreme for this author."

      "text": "Water Fluoridation\n\nFluoride is a neurotoxin, period. Sodium fluoride is the most effective rat killer known; colorless, odorless, tasteless; no antidote, no remedy, no hope, the most efficient way to exterminate rats. Fluoride is the most corrosive and reactive element known to man. Most Dentists have no idea of the toxicology behind fluoride. They only know what they are told. Even if water fluoridation was effective, you cannot medicate an entire nation with the same dose of fluoride. If someone were to need fluoride for some reason then let it be prescribed to them, we don't need socialized medicine. It's absolutely senseless to prescribe an entire nation fluoride on the pretense that the lower income families may not be able to afford fluoride toothpaste. That was one of the main arguments in the campaign for water fluoridation, not everyone will be able to afford fluoride toothpaste.\n\nShould we begin other nationwide medication plans? According to the American Heart Association, about 73.6 million people in the United States age 20 and older have high blood pressure. Shouldn't we start adding blood pressure medication to the water supply?\n\nThe fluoride that is added to the water supply is not pharmaceutical grade fluoride, or sodium fluoride, the fluoride used in toothpaste, it is a toxic waste byproduct of the aluminum, steel, ceramic, phosphate fertilizer, and other chemical industries. How much would it cost these companies to dispose of their toxic wastes, mainly fluoride? I imagine it would be in the millions. Why not sell it to the municipalities and turn a huge profit? Hitler was the first person to add fluoride to the water supply. Fluoride keeps the brain from developing and Hitler used fluoride as a way to control the masses, to dumb the people down. After WW2, America, the beautiful, hired Hitler's chemical and biological weapons manufacturers, IG Farben. Shortly thereafter, the United States began the water fluoridation campaign. Coincidence? Hitler used sodium fluoride and not the toxic waste fluoride that we use here in the 4th Reich. Sodium fluoride's not any better, sodium fluoride is the fluoride used in rat poison.\n\nAt the same time that water fluoridation started we also began to add it to toothpaste. According to the Journal of Public Health Dentistry, \"Infant formula reconstituted with higher fluoride water can provide 100 to 200 times more fluoride than breastmilk, or cows milk.\" Dental Clinics of North America states that, \"Food processing often concentrates fluoride, and foods processed with fluoridated water typically have higher fluoride concentrations than foods processed with non-fluoridated water...cereals processed in a fluoridated area had fluoride concentrations ranging from 3.8 ppm to 6.3 ppm.\" The Journal of the American Dental Association said, \"Our data suggests that young children who regularly or frequently drink substantial quantities of juice possibly should not receive dietary fluoride supplements, since they might be at increased risk of developing dental fluorosis.\" Soda, tea, wine, beer, mechanically deboned chicken, fish, seafood, teflon pans, anaesthetics and cigarettes, to name a few, are all sources of additional fluorides. I want to know who's keeping track of the levels of fluoride that each person is receiving. Is fluoride an essential nutrient? Absolutely not. The National Academy Of Sciences states, \"Fluoride is no longer considered an essential factor for human growth and developement.\" It is, however, an essential ingredient in the construction of atom bombs.\n\nFluoride helps fight cavities by destroying enzymes that erode tooth enamel. There are many more enzymes in the human body that work in our favor that are also destroyed by drinking fluoridated water. Fluoride's effective as a topical agent. If you want to avoid sunburn don't drink the suntan lotion. Who in the world thought that drinking fluoride would be a good idea? It could only be the few that stood to profit from it. If exposure to fluoride is too high, and the smallest most minute amounts are too high, it can cause serious health issues.\n\nInterview with Christopher Bryson\nAuthor of \"The Fluoride Deception\"\n\nInvestigation into fluorine began in 1902. People living in Colorado Springs, Colorado had stains on their teeth that became known as \"Colorado Stain, \"Mottled Teeth\" and farther south, \"Texas Teeth.\" It took three decades to find the cause of \"Mottled Teeth,\" fluorine. Fluorine is a very active element. Since ordinary chemical analysis will not isolate it, dozens of analysis failed to find anything unusual about the water supplies. Christopher Bryson, from the book, \" The Fluoride Deception, says, \"Fluorine is an element. Fluorine atoms are unbalanced and dangerous predators, snatching electrons from other elements to relieve their core tension. A ravenous hunger for electrons explains why fluorine cuts through steel like butter , burns asbestos, and reacts violently with most organic material. Because of its extreme reactivity, fluorine is usually bound with other elements. These compounds are known as salts, or fluorides. Yet the chemical potency of fluorides is also dramatic. Ionic means having captured or surrendered an electron. It forms powerful bonds with hydrogen, interfering with the normal fabric of such biological molecules.\"\n\nDr. Frederick C. McKay, a dentist, first commented on the lack of decay in teeth in 1908 and then again in 1925 and 1926. By 1941, H. Trendley Dean determined that one part per million of fluoride ion reduced cavities without producing any mottling. The only thing that McKay found in his research was that fluoride reduced the production of cavaties because that was the only thing he was looking for. He wasn't concerned with the effects of fluoride on the development of the brain or the thyroid or any other long term effects. The bottom line is that fluorine and the compounds it produces are dangerous and unstable. The wrong proportions of fluoride could cause skeletal fluorosis or brittle bones, respiratory problems, central nervous system disorders, immune system disorders, under developed brains and thyroids, cancer, premature aging, hardening of the arteries, loss of appetite and sex drive by age 30, birth defects and on and on. It's also highly unlikely that the fluoride added to the water supply could be made so that the concentration was exactly 1p.p.m. and not rise to 2p.p.m. My question is, why were the proponents of fluoridation in such a hurry to add a potential poison to the water supply before the proper results were in?\nFrom the book, \"Health Effects of Ingested Fluoride,\"\n\"cancer mortality was higher in areas with fluoridated water than in areas with nonfluoridated water.\"\n\nProfessional Perspectives on Water Fluoridation\n\nDonald R. McNeil's book, \"The Fight for Fluoridation,\" published in 1957, documents, like the title states, the fight for fluoridation. McNeil marks one of the first fluoridated water studies begining on May 2, 1945. The study took place in a city five minutes away from me, Newburgh, New York. Knowing what the city of Newburgh has developed into since the water fluoridation study, I was anxious to read the results, especially since there was no information on the type of people who consumed water with naturally high levels of fluoride. Which I thought was a very interesting bank of information to overlook. I mean, here we have multiple cities drinking high levels of naturally occuring fluorides for decades and nowhere in McNeil's book, \"The Fight for Fluoridation,\" can I find any other description of the people in Colorado Springs, besides the \"mottled teeth.\" What type of health where they in? Socially how did they act? What were the major causes of death? How did they grow old, meaning, did they fall to pieces or were they strong till the end. What were their IQ's? But no, not a mention of any significant anomalies or anything at all, like it was a totally meaningless concept, to examine the people who consumed, high levels of naturally occurring fluoridated water, in every way, for generations. I just didn't get it.\n\nThe results from Newburgh, New York were not good and I'll get into exactly what they were in a minute. McNeil reveals that the proponents of fluoridation didn't bother to wait for the results, \"The estimated results from fluoridation came sooner than the scientists anticipated. And, ...it became difficult for the scientists to keep the movement to fluoridate water supplies from spreading.\" \"...a small, dedicated, enthusiastic group of dentists in Wisconsin laid plans for the fluoridation of all public water supplies in their states. They were not satisfied with experiments. Once they had decided that fluorides could retard tooth decay without accompanying ill effects, they carried the principle to it's logical extreme. They wanted everyone to enjoy the benefits immediately.\" The key here is, \"once they had decided.\" The dentists who led the way could have cared less about the out come of a ten year study, they forged ahead knowing the actual results were not good and not completed yet. Why? Why do Dentists want to see a reduction in cavities and therefore a reduction in their business? Maybe things will be a bit clearer once we take a look at the actual results from the Newburgh, New York water fluoridation experiments.\n\nThe Newburgh, New York\nfluoride toxicity study was \"covertly monitored\" by Dr. Harold Carpenter Hodge, \"senior wartime toxicologist for the Manhatten project,\" according to Christopher Bryson, author of, \"The Fluoride Deception.\" \"Secretly blood and tissue samples from residents were sent to his atomic laboratory for study.\" Dr. Hodge was a leader in the promotion of water fluoridation in the 40's and 50's, leader in fluoride research, trainer of Dental School Deans, choreographer of the \"notorious human radiation experiments in which hospital patients were injected with plutonium and uranium - without their knowledge or consent - in order to study the toxicity of those chemicals in humans.\" So it was Dr. Hodge who put the idea that fluoride was good for teeth, into the heads of dentists.\n\nThe only result mentioned in the book \"The fight for fluoridation,\" is that fluoride caused a reduction in cavities. This information overshadowed all. By stating disinformation over and over again you can actually make people forget about the real concerns and that is, what are the health effects in a long-term study of fluoridated drinking water?\nThree times as much fluoride was found in the placentas and blood samples gathered from Newburgh as from non-fluoridated sources. The bottom line, fluoride jeopardizes health, even at lowlevels. It accumulates in the brain, and slows down brain development. Thyroid development is severly impaired. Bones throughout the body become brittle, a disease known as skeletal fluorosis, and the number of hip fractures and replacements in fluoridated areas as opposed to non-fluoridated areas is high. Red blood counts in children in Newburgh fell. The first menstrual period came sooner for girls in Newburgh. Hemoglobin levels dropped, bone defects rose, and irregular mineralization of the thigh bone were noted. Abnormal vision rose and, by the way, the people of Newburgh, New York were never told about the fluoridated water study. The only thing they were told was that fluoride was good for children's teeth.\n\nWater Fluoridation; Hitler, I.G. Farben,Communism and the Origins of Fluoride\n\n\" While a member of the Communist Party, I attended Communist training schools in New York and Wisconsin ... and we were trained in the revolutionary overthrow of the U.S. Government. ....\"(From the Article \"Fluoride Stupidity\" Author unknown)\n\nDR. JAN DE VRIES, Dr. H.Med., Ph.D., D.Ac., D.O., N.D. - \"Hitler put fluoride in the water to keep his prisoners quiet, and the same thing happens in other parts of the world.\" Fluoride makes us makes us stupid, docile, and subservient. The Nazis could care less about fluoride's supposed effect on children's teeth; their alleged reason for mass-medicating water with sodium fluoride was to sterilize humans and force the people in their concentration camps into calm submission. (From the book \"The Crime and Punishment of I.G. Farben\" by Joseph Borkin.)\n\nRemove fluoride, bromide and chloride from your body and brain using Nascent Iodine."

Health officials advise the public to check any water bottles purchased after November 1st 2012 for potential gasoline odors before drinking the water contained in them.\n\nWhile routine tests are conducted to detect this kind of contamination and prevent these bottles from being used to distribute bottled water, a few bottles appear to have slipped through undetected and have been put back into circulation. The contamination was detected by bottle companies after gasoline fumes and residues or fumes were found in some of the returned plastic water containers.\n\nAccording to the Department of Public Health, a child from Essex County, MA fell ill this month after drinking contaminated water from a 5-gallon Poland Spring water bottle that originated from the Framingham bottling plant. The child was treated at a local emergency clinic and later released.\n\nGasoline contains a variety of toxic chemicals that can have damaging health effects after long-term exposure, including the following:\n\n1. Benzene: which can cause anemia, a decrease in blood platelets, and an increased risk of cancer;\n2. Chlorobenzene and Ethylbenzene: both of which can lead to liver and/or kidney problems;\n3. Ethylene dibromide: which can cause problems with the liver, stomach, reproductive system, and/or kidneys, and an increased risk of cancer;\n4. Toluene: which can cause problems associated with the liver, kidneys or nervous system;\n5. Xylenes: which can damage the nervous system.\n\nWhile the levels of exposure in this incidence are unlikely to cause any long-term health issues, exposure to traces of these chemicals can nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea if ingested.\n\nThe Department of Public Health advises anyone who detects a gasoline odor coming from their water bottle to contact their bottle supplier to arrange a replacement.\n\nIf you have one of these large bottled water containers, but also have a berkey water filter, you have another alternative as any berkey equipped with the black berkeys will filter these chemicals out of the contaminated bottled water for you."

So keep up the good work, but just use less.\n\nWastewater treatment plants can't remove everything we pour down the drain and some of it reaches the environment. Things you should avoid putting down the drain include:\n\nKeep garbage out of the toilet\n\nOur sewer system can't handle a lot of the materials that some of us flush down the toilet. When baby wipes, disposable mop cloths, feminine hygiene products and other items go down the toilet they can clump together and form a large, solid mass. This mass then blocks pipes, which can damage equipment, cause sewage to overflow into the environment and ultimately, cost taxpayers money. In some cases, pipes at sewage pumping stations need to be manually unblocked two to three times every week to keep our system running.\n\nEven many products that are labeled as flushable can cause big problems. Some of the top items that should not go down the toilet are:\n\nBaby wipes\n\nDisposable cleaning cloths\n\nDisposable mop cloths and mop pads\n\nCondoms\n\nPads, tampons (and applicators)\n\nDental floss\n\nGrease and food\n\nHair\n\nHelp improve wastewater treatment by putting these items in the garbage, not the toilet. Or better yet, use a non-disposable option when possible. Food and grease can be composted – check with your municipality to find out about what is accepted in your organics collection program.\n\nExpanding the wastewater system To pay for new sanitary sewer works such as additional trunk lines and pumping stations in emerging Lower Mainland developments, Metro Vancouver applies Development Cost Charges (DCC) to new users in these areas.

      "text": "Lead and Copper Rule Water utilities in the U.S.A. are required to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Lead and Copper Rule. This rule was passed in 1991 and sets the action level for lead in drinking water at 15 parts per billion (ppb). This means that utilities must ensure that water from the customer's tap does not exceed this level in at least 90% of the homes sampled.\n\nLead Action Level: Exceeds Action Level if more than 10% of the homes tested have lead levels greater than 15 parts per billion Maximum Contaminant Level Goal: Zero parts per billion Source of contaminant: corrosion of plumbing systems\n\nPhosphates On June 1, 2001, the Maui Department of Water Supply (DWS) began a corrosion control program by adding phosphates to the Upcountry water supply. The Hawaii State Department of Health, Safe Drinking Water Branch mandated the use of phosphates to reduce the levels of lead that have been found in some homeowners' drinking water. Phosphates create a protective film on the inside of the pipe, slowing the electrochemical processes that lead to corrosion. On June 28, 2004, the DWS stopped the use of phosphates in the Upcountry water system.\n\nSoda Ash To replace the phosphate, the DWS implemented a high pH, low alkalinity treatment, using soda ash. The DWS is required by the State to implement and maintain an approved corrosion control program in order to minimize lead leaching. The pH of the water is approximately 8.8, not to exceed 9.4. The higher pH should make the water less corrosive.\n\nSoda Ash is the common name for sodium carbonate (Na2Co3). It is a sodium salt and is alkaline. It is commonly used in water treatment for pH adjustments and for corrosion and scale control. It is National Sanitation Foundation / American National Standards Institute (NSF / ANSI) Standard 60 certified safe drinking water treatment.\n\nSoda Ash works by producing an increase in the final sodium content, pH and alkalinity. The combination of higher pH and alkalinity can dramatically reduce lead solubility relative to lower pH and lower alkalinity water. The strategy is supported by scientific theory, laboratory data, and the practical experiences of hundreds of U.S. utilities."

      "text": "Drinking water\n\nThe Water Supply (Safety and Reliability) Act 2008 has been in place since mid 2008 and its provisions regulate drinking water quality to protect public health. The legislation applies to drinking water service providers (service providers) registered with the Department of Energy and Water Supply (the regulator), particularly those involved in treating, transmitting or reticulating water for drinking purposes.\n\nThe primary method by which the regulator ensures that public health is protected is by approving a service provider's Drinking Water Quality Management Plan (DWQMP), and ensuring that the service provider complies with the plan.\n\nAs at January 2013, more than 20 service providers are operating under an approved plan. The remaining service providers, operating under a Notice, are currently in the process of developing or finalising their DWQMPs.\n\nWhere possible, the regulator is working actively and co-operatively with the service providers to ensure that their plans meet all Act requirements. For example, the regulator has visited each of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander service providers to assist in the development of their plans.\n\nSimilarly, workshops were conducted for large and medium service providers towards developing their plans. Assistance to small service providers is currently ongoing ahead of the legislated 1 July 2013 timeframe for approval of their DWQMP's.\n\nDrinking water quality management plans\n\nThe purpose of a plan is to implement a risk-management approach to manage the quality of drinking water.\n\nIn a plan, the provider will:\n\ngive details of the infrastructure of the registered service\n\nassess the hazards and hazardous events that may affect drinking water quality\n\nundertake a risk assessment and document the process for managing these risks\n\nPlans must be approved by the Queensland Water Supply Regulator and will be subject to ongoing reviews and regular audits. Application forms relating to the supply of drinking water are available from the water industry regulation forms page.\n\nSchedule 3 of the Act defines providers as either large, medium or small entities.\n\nDrinking water quality management plans are legislated to be in place by:\n\n1 July 2011 for large drinking water service providers\n\n1 July 2012 for medium drinking water service providers\n\n1 July 2013 for small drinking water service providers.\n\nThere are no exemptions from preparing a plan and the requirement to prepare a plan can be brought forward at the discretion of the regulator.\n\nNew providers (established after 1 July 2008) must have an approved plan in place within 12 months of registering as a service provider.\n\nRegulatory requirements for drinking water service providers prior to plan approval\n\nPrior to having an approved DWQMP, all drinking water service providers were issued a Drinking Water Service Provider Monitoring and Reporting Requirement notice was issued to all existing providers in December 2008. The notice requires that providers address drinking water quality by complying with the following requirements:\n\nmonitor and report Escherichia coli (E. coli) as specified in the Public Health Regulation 2005\n\ncontinue current drinking water quality monitoring program(s) for other parameters (where they are in place)\n\nreport any incident that will or is likely to adversely affect drinking water quality\n\nreport drinking water quality monitoring results on a quarterly basis.\n\nCompliance with the notice is mandatory and remains in place until the service provider has an approved DWQMP."

      "text": "4 Surprising Secrets About Bottled Water\n\n4. #1: It doesn't taste any better :\n\nIn a 2010 study published in the Journal of Sensory Studies, researchers asked people to rate the taste of six bottled mineral waters and six types of tap water. They found that, overall, bottled water didn't perform any better than the stuff from the tap. The reason: It's mineral concentration, not \"water purity,\" that influences flavor. The study's participants preferred water with medium mineralization, which they described as \"tasteless\" and \"cooler,\" but whether it came from a bottle or the tap made little difference.\n\n3. #2: It's not necessarily pure:\n\nThe Natural Resources Defense Council recently tested 1,000 bottles of water and discovered that about 22 percent of the brands in the study contained chemical contaminants at levels above state health limits. And in 2011, California State University researchers tested six brands of bottled water and found that while none contained more than the legal level of contaminates, all six exceeded California public health goals for arsenic. There's also substantial research showing that when certain plastic bottles are heated at high temperatures, chemicals from the plastic can leach into a container's contents (a good reason not to store cases of water in the garage this summer). The takeaway: Don't let label jargon like \"pure\" and \"natural\" fool you. Unlike bottled water, tap water is subject to strict federal, state, and local guidelines, making it a safer beverage choice.\n\n2. #3: It may be glorified tap water:\n\nExotic names and labels conjure up images of tropical waterfalls and mountaintop springs, but in reality, roughly 25 percent of all bottled water comes from municipal water sources. Coca-Cola's Dasani, for example, is nothing but purified tap water with added minerals. And Pepsi's Aquafina? Another bottle of city water. I don't know about you, but if I'm going to be drinking tap water anyway, I'd rather save some cash and drink the free version.\n\n1. #4: It's hurting our planet:\n\nMost water bottles are made of a plastic called polyethylene terepthalate, or PET. There are two problems with PET bottles. Problem 1: They take a boatload of crude oil to produce. University of Louisville researchers estimate that around 17 million barrels of oil are used each year to produce PET water bottles—a major reason why bottled water costs roughly four times as much as gasoline. Problem 2: We're chucking our water bottles in the trash, instead of the recycling bin. According to the Container Recycling Institute, nearly 90 percent of the 30 billion PET water bottles we buy annually end up in landfills—a huge problem when you consider that PET bottles take from 400 to 1,000 years to decompose. The bottom line: We should all take a cue from environmentally conscious activists like the folks at the University of Vermont—which recently banned bottled-water sales on campus—and opt for the tap whenever possible.\n\nYou can find this article online at:"

      "text": "Water Testing Frequently Asked Questions\n\nAs a private well owner or well-water consumer, you will probably use groundwater from your well for doing your family's laundry, drinking, cooking, bathing and watering your garden.\n\nMunicipalities are required to test their water supplies regularly to ensure the water is safe to drink. However, since there is no requirement to test a private well, except when it is first drilled or the pump is changed, you are responsible for making sure your water is safe.\n\nWhile most private wells provide a clean, safe supply of water, contaminants can pollute private wells. Because you cannot see, smell or taste most contaminants, you should test your water on a regular basis. The types of land uses near your well determine which tests you need to have performed on your water supply.\n\nRead the CDPHE Water Quality Control Division pamphlet, Drinking Water from Household Wells, to learn how wells are polluted, how to protect them, what pollutants contaminate the water and what testing is needed.\n\nThe Colorado Oil and Gas Association is providing free baseline water quality monitoring for domestic water wells near oil and gas drilling. Contact for the baseline water quality monitoring for domestic water wells near oil and gas drilling:\n\nOGCC will also sample a private water well if there is an allegation that an oil and gas company has caused an impact to a water well, which is not handled by the COGA baseline water quality program (\n\nNo. Each contaminant must be evaluated individually. However, if you are buying or selling your house and need to have your well tested, a standard test is available. Water testing packages are also available. Click here to see what is included in the water testing packages and prices.\n\nIf you own property with a private water supply, such as a spring or a well, consult the list below for testing suggestions.\n\nBecause bacterial levels in the water can change over time, a coliform test should be performed yearly.\n\nIf there is farming or livestock ranching in the area, nitrates can be found in areas where fertilizers have been applied or livestock waste may be found.\n\nIf there are children drinking the water on a regular basis, fluoride levels should be between 1 and 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l). Fluoride levels of less than 1 mg/l may prevent the proper development of teeth and supplements may be needed. Fluoride levels greater than 4 mg/l can lead to a pitting and staining of the teeth caused by fluorosis.\n\nAn odor of rotten eggs indicates the presence of sulfide. This is more of an aesthetic problem than a health concern and can be easily treated with chlorine.\n\nIf the bathroom fixtures are stained by the water, check for the following metals:\n\nBlue or green stains indicate the presence of copper.\nRed or rust-colored stains indicate that iron is present.\nBlack stains indicate the presence of manganese or zinc.\n\nUranium is naturally occurring in granite formations which are found throughout Colorado especially in the foothills. It can be found dissolved in the waters of wells sunk in these areasYes. Sampling bottles are specially prepared by the laboratory and are required for performing any testing. Samples taken in any other bottles are not accepted because they may be contaminated and ruin the test.\n\nTesting supplies can be ordered by\n(a) calling our order line at 303-692-3074, or\n(b) clicking here to request supplies by our online order form.\n\nTesting supplies are free of charge and sent to you via FedEx or USPS.\n\nIf you are picking up sample bottles from the lab, go to the entrance on the south side of the building marked \"Receiving.\" The main entrance at the west side of the building is locked and not available for pick up of sampling bottles.

Impress your friends.\n\nWhy does bottled water have an expiration date?\n\nEvery single bottle of water sold in the United States carries an expiration date, despite the fact that water doesn't go bad. Ever wonder why? New Jersey:\n\nA 1987 NJ state law required all food products sold there to display an expiration date of two years or less from the date of manufacture. Labeling, separating and shipping batches of expiration-dated water to the Garden State seemed a little inefficient to bottled water producers, so most of them simply started giving every bottle a two-year expiration date, no matter where it was going.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has never set a standard for the life of a bottle of water, and the original New Jersey law has since been repealed. But the expiration date is now industry standard."

Living water is water that is free\nof toxins and contains nutrients that the body requires for\nhealth.\nLiving water brings life to the body, while \"dead\" water brings death\nto\nthe body. The EPA has set standards for only 7 of the 70,000 toxic\nchemicals\nused in water treatment. However, only 50 of the 79,000 regulated\npublic water systems in the United States use activated carbon\nfilters.\nWithout activated carbon filters, the majority of chemical contaminates\nare not removed. What kind of chemical contaminants are we\ntalking\nabout, and what are their effects?\n\nIn my opinion,\nthe\nnumber one contaminant in water today is the fluoride added to our\ndrinking\nwater. It is causing serious and massive health problems in\npeople\nwho do not even suspect that it might be a cause. In addition,\nmost\nphysicians are unaware that fluoride poses significant health risks,\neven\nthough numerous articles have appeared in mainstream medical journals\nduring\nthe last decade about fluoride's dangers, and the largest study of the\neffect of fluoride on children's teeth showed that use of fluoride did\nnot significantly reduce cavities.\n\nAccording to the\nbook Clinical Toxicology of Commercial Products, fluoride is\nmore\npoisonous than lead, and only slightly less poisonous than arsenic. The\nUS Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry has classified\nfluoride\nin the top 20 substances most dangerous to human health. Even\nextremely small amounts of fluoride can damage the immune system,\ninhibit\nthe action of enzymes, create arthritic conditions or encourage\npre-existing\nones, and cause dental fluorosis in children. Fluoride has been\nshown to have a direct relationship to depression and symptoms of\nhyperthyroidism.\nIt also has the ability to transform normal cells to cancer\ncells.\nThis has been confirmed by research. It is also a cumulative\ntoxin,\nmeaning it is stored in the body until it reaches levels toxic enough\nto\neffect health (and it doesn't take long to reach that level).\n\nWhat is fluoride\nexactly? It is derived from the element fluorine, which is a\ncorrosive,\nyellow gas. For this reason, when it is found in nature it\nis always combined with minerals. It is considered an\nenvironmental\npollutant, a by-product of the aluminum, steel, phosphate-fertilizer,\nglass,\ncement and other industries. The dumping of this substance into\nthe\nenvironment in the past caused the destruction of crops and animals,\nand\nmany lawsuits ensued. However, in an interesting turn of events,\nthe public was convinced that fluoride was a valuable and necessary\nnutrient,\nand instead of dumping this lethal compound into the environment, they\nbegan dumping it into the water supply. It saved them millions of\ndollars.\n\nLead is another\nextremely\npotent poison. The EPA estimates that 40 million Americans have\nexcess\nlead in their drinking water, and it has been estimated that 60 to 80\npercent\nof all cancers are the result of toxic chemicals in our air, water, and\nfood. Lead poisoning can result in birth defects, mental\nretardation,\nhigh blood pressure, hyperactivity,\nand other brain and nervous system problems. According\nto the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Institute of Agriculture and\nNatural\nResources, a dosage of lead which would have little effect on an\nadult\ncan have a huge effect on a child, so children, infants, and fetuses\nare\nthe most vulnerable. Infants who receive formula get 40 to 60\npercent\nof their lead intake from the water mixed with the formula.\nAlso, children who are in periods of rapid growth absorb any lead\npresent\nin their diet more rapidly than anyone else would. Often, the\nsymptoms\nof lead poisoning are mistaken for flu or other common illnesses.\nSometimes, there are no symptoms at all.\n\nAmong the\nchemicals\nused in the treatment of water are chlorine and alum (form of\naluminum).\nAutopsy reports on Alzheimer's patients found 70% more aluminum in the\nbrain than that of someone that did not suffer from Alzheimer's.\nAlum contributes to aluminum toxicity, which has been identified as a\npossible\ncontributor to Alzheimer's disease. Of course, there is no EPA standard\nfor aluminum.\n\nMany are\nsensitive\nto chlorine and become ill when consuming it through the water faucet.\nFurthermore, chlorine is know to react with organic compounds, forming\nTHM (trihalomethanes), which are known to cause various types of\ncancer.\nDrinking tap water has been linked to bladder cancer in 10 out of the\n11\nstudies researched on this subject. Also, the combination of\nchlorine\nand cholesterol in the diet (not cholesterol by itself) has been linked\nto increased heart problems.\n\nSo, it is obvious\nthat we want to avoid unfiltered water. It is preferable to have\na system that uses both activated charcoal and reverse osmosis.\n\nWhat validation\nis\nthere for the claims I have made? Here are some links that you\ncan\nread for yourselves. Each link contains many more that you can\nfollow,\nand I hope you will.\n\nThere is much\nmore\nthat I could have included. I hope you will see just how\ndangerous\nthese contaminants can be, and will avoid them.\n\nHow much water\nshould\nwe drink? Take your weight, divide by two, and this will tell you\nthe MINIMUM number of ounces to drink per day. The more you\nweigh,\nthe more water you need to drink.\n\nI hope you will\nchoose\nto drink living water, the only kind of water that can nurture your\nbody. After you have filtered your water, you need to add\nminerals to it to make it living. If the water does not have\nminerals in it, drinking it will leach minerals from your body.\n\nI prefer the\nNutronix O2 Proformance Hydration Product. It puts coral minerals\nin the water, and creates hydrogen ions in the water which help\ndetoxify the body and raise your pH level, which is very important for\nyour body to be able to heal itself. Look at Nutronix Products\n\nSometimes people\nask me why I can't write something positive. Well, asking me to\nwrite\nsomething positive and balanced about fluoride is like asking me to\nwrite\nsomething positive and balanced about Hitler....what could I possibly\nwrite?\nSome things are bad, period.\n\nDrop us a line!\n\nCopyright\n2006-9\nJudie C.

      "text": "Trail Mix Feeding Hungry Hikers Involves More Than Just Opening A Can\n\nThis is the time of the year when people who have never gone camping consider what it might take to spend a night or two away from everything, to sleep under the stars and not much else.\n\nOne of the first considerations has to do with food. The foremost concern, however, is water. Streams and lakes, especially in wilderness areas, may appear to be clear and clean, but looks can be deceiving.\n\nMany bacteria and other contaminants are in the water, so the backpacker or camper who doesn't want to spend weeks recovering from a nasty infection is faced with a choice.\n\nThe option that appears to be the easiest is to carry your own water from home. But that's deceptive, too. Anyone who has walked any distance in the woods with a backpack knows that the best way to travel overland is to travel light.\n\nWater is bulky and heavy and there's no way of telling how much water a camper may need. The one thing you don't want to do is run out.\n\nThere are iodine pills people can buy that effectively kill most of the bacteria and other contaminants in the water. But even if the treated water is boiled after the iodine pills do their job, the resulting water tastes metallic and flat.\n\nIncreasingly, many backpackers and campers are buying small, hand-held water filters that screen out most of the damaging bacteria. The filters, which can cost from as little as $40 to more than $200, are compact and relatively easy to use.\n\nWater filters are usually sold on the basis of the sensitivity of their filters. The sensitivity is usually measured in microns. But even the most expensive filters don't filter out everything that may harm the backpacker.\n\nFor especially sensitive people -- some people are more affected by this sort of contamination than others -- boiling water for two minutes is usually the safest option, although the process is time-consuming.\n\nThe filter investment is a good one, however, especially considering the consequences of drinking unfiltered water.\n\nNow, about the food: This can vary greatly, depending on the weather, the specific conditions of your trip and your own tastes.\n\nOne important thing for beginning backpackers and campers to consider is that they don't necessarily have to eat freeze-dried foods. These are expensive, vary greatly in their palatability and come in serving sizes on the small side.\n\nOn longer trips, say four days or more, the freeze-dried foods become essential because of weight and space considerations.\n\nBut unless you're planning to follow the footsteps of Alison Hargreaves, the Scottish climber who earlier this year became the first woman to climb Mount Everest, the world's highest mountain, without aid of oxygen or guides, you probably can carry the type of food that you normally eat at home.\n\nOne important consideration is to carry more food than you think you might need. Walking in the heat with a full pack for a day or so has a tendency to make people hungry. There is a good chance you may want to eat even more than when you're relaxing at home.\n\nCooking is another issue the beginning backpacker has to confront.\n\nOn a shorter, overnight trip, it isn't essential to have hot food, although it does help.\n\nIf you decide that you want hot food and an ability to make hot coffee or tea, the only sensible option is to carry a backpacking stove. They are small, light and usually work on white gas or some similar fuel. They cost about $45.\n\nThe WhisperLite, a small stove made by Mountain Safety Research, a Seattle, Wash., company, has become the backpacking standard. It burns white gasoline, which is cheap and readily available.\n\nCooking on wood fires is not recommended. Not only is it environmentally damaging, but the supply of firewood in many well-traveled wilderness areas is typically in short supply.\n\nDuring dry times of the year, open fires are not permitted or recommended in many areas. Also, there is the rain factor. Wet firewood, even if it is available, doesn't burn well, and cooking over the unheaven heat of an open wood fire is best left for the trained Eagle Scout or the veteran outdoorsperson.\n\nThe best advice is to keep it simple. Plan meals that require only one pot. I've found that one-pot dishes where vegetables or meats are mixed in with rice or couscous, a granular semolina wheat, are filling and inexpensive.\n\nFor summer backpacking, I usually carry small cans of chicken or tuna. The cans are relatively light and compact. On a shorter trip -- which I define as anything under three nights -- they seem to work fine.\n\nCouscous is an especially handy backpacking food. It is cheap -- a box that will feed four hungry appetites costs about a $1. It cooks relatively quickly, about half the time needed for rice. And it has a somewhat bland flavor, so that it adopts the taste of whatever you choose to mix it with.\n\nHigh-energy foods such as dried fruit and nuts are good to take along as snacks between meals and as a breakfast, although after a few days in the woods they tend to loose their appeal."

      "text": "Should I stick to bottled water?\n\nQ:\nIs bottled water safer than tap water during pregnancy?\n\nA:\nIn recent years, there have been concerns that contaminants in tap water could pose risks during pregnancy. Tap water varies from region to region and even from day to day in the same district. Water supplies may be contaminated with chlorine related byproducts, solvents, pesticides, and heavy metals such as lead.\n\nSome studies suggest that pregnant women who consume water containing high levels of trihalomethanes – byproducts formed by the reaction of chlorine with decomposing plant material – have higher rates of miscarriage. Lead has been linked to miscarriage and preterm delivery. Other chemical contaminants may increase the risk of stillbirth.\n\nScientists are not in agreement about these conclusions, and there are research studies that back up the safety of tap water. While scientists debate the safety of these chemicals in the public water supply, some women feel more comfortable drinking bottled or filtered water.\n\nYou should know that bottled water is not necessarily better than tap water and may not be collected from mountain peaks and glaciers, as some of their brand names imply. Federal regulations only require that bottled water meet the standards set for tap water. Also, the cost of drinking eight to 16 cups of bottled water a day can add up.\n\nThere are several ways to improve your water. Always use cold tap water that has been running for 30 to 60 seconds to flush out lead that can leach out from pipes and plumbing fixtures. Refrigerate your water in an open container for several hours to allow the chlorine to dissipate.\n\nWater filters are another option for families. You can buy pitchers with filters that remove most of the impurities from water. If you prefer a longer lasting and more effective method of reducing contaminants, purchase a carbon containing water filter system that attaches to your faucet. A good choice is a high-quality, solid block, activated carbon (SBAC) filtration system with a submicron pore size. These systems reduce most of the chlorine, chlorine byproducts, pesticides, microorganisms and lead. You could notice a substantial improvement in the look and taste of your water.\n\nIf you have concerns about the water in your area, contact your local water supplier or health department and have your water tested for contaminants"

(THE CHRONICLE HERALD / File)\n\nThe Halifax regional school board will vote next week on whether to ban the sale of bottled water in schools.\n\nThe issue was presented to the board in February by a group of students who were concerned about the environmental and social impacts of bottled water.\n\nHannah Cameron, a Grade 10 student at Citadel High School, will make a plea to the board at Wednesday's meeting to implement the ban.\n\nCameron said she's concerned about the environmental effects of producing the bottles and shipping them to their destinations.\n\n\"The hypocrisy of it is troubling because we're taught in school so much about human rights and how we have to take care of each other because we are the future,\" she said. \"Bottled water has a lot of detrimental effects to societies across the world. I don't think it goes along with everything we're being taught.\"\n\nThe sale of bottled water is banned in 28 municipalities, 12 colleges or universities and four school boards across Canada, while 120 municipalities, school boards and universities have rejected bans, according to a school board staff report.\n\nThe report, which recommends that schools be given the authority to make their own decisions on the matter, cites a number of concerns with implementing a ban.\n\nSchools have a variety of contracts with companies that stock vending machines and run cafeterias, so a board-wide ban may be difficult to implement, the report notes.\n\nBottle recycling is a valued revenue stream for some schools, and a ban would deprive student activities of the extra funds.\n\nNine schools in outlying areas of the school board district are not connected to the municipal water system and rely on bottled water, which is provided free to students.\n\nThe report also suggests that water fountains are \"not always favoured by students\" and are expensive to maintain.\n\nBoard chairman Irvine Carvery said he agrees that schools should make their own decisions.\n\n\"They're in a better position to know what the full impact of that will be,\" he said. \"So, my recommendation is that we leave it at the school level and the students at that school can engage with the school administration and have their discussions.\"\n\nCameron said she hopes to outline her plan in a meeting with Nestle, which holds a number of contracts for vending machines at schools.\n\nShe added that the board could consider a filtered water system for schools that don't have municipal water connections.\n\nCitadel High School and Auburn Drive High School already have a ban on the sale of bottled water, Cameron said.\n\nComments(19)\n\nI personally don't use bottled water, however, it should be up to the schools. First they ban peanut butter, then pop. Might as well ban juice next because they are in the same pesky bottles and we all know there is a lot of sugar in fruits. Why don't they just ban school altogether so the kids never get a chance to be exposed to anything.\n\nIf plastic, and I assume this is the reason for the proposed ban, is such a problem worldwide, then why are so many products going from glass to plastic. This appears to be a government/world environment problem.\n\nWhy ban the one thing thats actually good for our bodies? Why are they not banning sugary drinks? Even fruit juices are apparently bad for our bodies and our teeth. Sure, the kids should bring their own bottles of water, but when its forgotten, what are the choices? Pop?\n\nLet the students decide on an individual basis whether they want to use the product or not. These blanket bans instituted by a few dogooders only reinforces the expansion on the nanny state and the erosion of individual choice.\n\nThese policies get rammed down your throats because a significant minority of the population is either too ignorant or too lazy to do the right thing in the first place. As a member of society I couldn't care less what you to to yourself but when it infringes on my well-being than I say too bad for you.\n\nBottled pop has been banned in schools for some time.\n\nAnd just so you know Russia is in the process of banning all plastic bottles country-wide.\n\nThere goes another revenue stream and there goes any chance to educate these students that if they think they have to buy water, they can always recycle that bottle over and over again with water or juices from home. Sometimes we can get way too caught up in saving the environment and actually end up cutting our noses off to spite our faces. Mind you, I do applaud the students who are thinking about the environment and some sort of action, but I don't think they have thought this through all the way. Hey, maybe they can sell GPS devices as a fund raiser.\n\nThat's the part of this story that I find shameful. That public schools rely upon recycling bottles as a revenue stream, because our government and school board administrators cannot manage money properly. It is no secret that out school boards are top heavy with too many managers, presidents, et al, burning though funds that are meant to help teach our children. Maybe some students should step forward and propose a ban on the 9 unneccessary school boards and their members who suck all the money out of education in this tiny province? Our government leaders certainly aren't doing anything about the bloat, so maybe our young people can rise to this challenge.\n\nShameful isn't it? I could not agree more, schools are in funding crises and yet school boards have $50,000 laying around to spend on spy equipment (GPSs). Wobbling, top heavy ivory towers exist anywhere a bureaucracy exists with tax payer's money. At the end of the day, schools have to raise money to stay afloat and kids learn how the world works, sort of. Proposing a ban on 9 school boards by students, what a delicious idea. Have a great day my forward thinking friend.\n\nYou did read that the $50,000 spent on school bus GPS saved $400,000 right? And although recycling plastic is better than putting it in a landfill it is nowhere close to using something reusable. There is a tremendous amount of energy (oil/coal) used in the recycling industry.\n\nPersonally, I think the alleged $400,000 in \"savings\" is nonsense, I think it is a trumped up number. I mean, think about it, that's almost half a million dollars. I agree, landfills are a terrible place for, well, anything, but we are a very wasteful society. Sure there is a lot of energy used to recycle in an industrial fashion, but what are the alternatives? Remember, recycling begins at home.\n\nStraight from the tap,that's all it is..A lot of office buildings are installing filters onto their supply water from the city..There is a local company that comes by every 3 months or so to change the filter..Problem solved..\n\nI am sometimes embarassed at such nonsense from the people of this Province. Its no wonder other areas of this great country consider us childish and irrelevant. Go and help out at the soup kitchen instead of taking up such irrelevant plights.\n\nBefore you go slagging this as another intrusion into your freedom of choice by the nanny state, look closely at what is being proposed. They're not proposing to ban bottled water in schools, they're proposing to ban the SALE of bottled water in schools. Where there are fountains providing perfectly safe (and free) municipal water, this makes good sense.\n\nIn my opinion, bottled water is the greatest con someone could have ever come up with.\nI say well done on the students. It's about time we heard their voice rather than a bunch of old people who don't even go to the institutions.\nBottled water is not supposed to be reused because of the toxic chemicals that leak into the water. I hope all the best for this campaign. I heard their presentation at he board and know their points and it seems like they put a lot of thought into this.\nEveryone needs to chill out and realize that this is for the best. School's shouldn't contain something so stupid and they should be taught not to be suckered into buying such a stupid product.\n\nWhat most people don't understand about bottled water is that it is simply just a convenience.\nThe cost of bottled water is about 2000x more than tap water. It costs about 50 cents PER YEAR to fill up a reusable bottle 8 times a day. Bottled water is just corporations taking advantage of our ignorance/laziness. You're paying for re filtered tap water...\nIn Canada we have some of the world's cleanest drinking water from our cities very own water treatment plants. There is no need for bottled water.\nGood for the schools and boards that have banned the sale of bottled water. They know whats good for them."

      "text": "Desalination – Reverse Osmosis\n\nRemoval of dissolved solids and salts Reverse Osmosis (RO) is a membrane-based filtration technology which relies on a semi-permeable membrane to remove many types dissolved solids (from large molecules and ions) from liquids. In RO, an applied pressure, greater than the osmotic pressure, is exerted on the concentrated liquid, forcing the water of the concentrate stream (high salt concentration) to flow towards the fresh stream (low salt concentration). As a result, the concentrated side becomes even more concentrated. Though RO can be used with many liquids, its primary application is for water-based systems such as sea water (operating pressure is approximately 60 bar).\n\nSea Water Reverse Osmosis (SWRO), a more efficient form of RO, is used to desalinate brackish groundwater and employed by S&B Water where salinity exceeds 500 mg/L. SWRO is considered the most economical process for such applications because no heating or phase changes are needed."

He was well aware of the difference between hard well water and the soft rain water most families collected in cisterns. On January 9th, 1921 he was pacing the halls at St. Joseph's Hospital as an expectant father and ended up in the boiler room, where he struck up a conversation with the maintenance superintendent. Next to the boilers were two large cylindrical tanks which the superintendent proudly announced softened the water to prevent scaling in the boilers and save soap in the hospital laundry.\n\nThe superintendent then explained how he could prevent diaper rash by building his own softener and softening the water used to wash his baby's diapers.\n\nEmmett was very interested in the hospital water softener and finally convinced superintendent to give him a coffee can full of the greenish-black mineral, called Zeolite, which \"magically\" removed the hardness from water.\n\nThe superintendent explained to Mr. Culligan that he could punch some pinholes in the bottom of a coffee can, put about an inch of sand in the bottom, then fill it with the Zeolite. The superintendent told him to hold this \"coffee can softener\" under the faucet, letting the hard water trickle through, resulting in water that was softer than rain.\n\nEmmet Culligan was so fascinated during his first encounter with ion exchange that the expectant father almost forgot why he was at the hospital.

Doctoral candidate Katherine Alfredo hopes that through her research, she can shed light on how the interaction of various chemicals, specifically fluoride and aluminum, and organic matter can impact drinking water.\n\nKatherine's interest in viable water treatment techniques began during a research trip to Ghana, where she lived in a remote village and learned about fluoride problems in the Upper Eastern Region. Later, she worked for a small water-oriented engineering company, looking at the water quality problems caused by the excessive development in the New York City area. Katherine's profound desire to research water chemistry and treatment possibilities for both extremely rural and urban environments led her to complete her M.S. in Environmental and Water Resources Engineering (EWRE) at the University of Texas at Austin. She is currently a doctoral candidate in the EWRE program at UT, where her research involves analyzing the chemical interactions and competition between fluoride, aluminum, and natural organic matter when aluminum-based coagulants are used to treat drinking water containing excess levels of fluoride.\n\nKatherine hopes to shed light on how chemicals impact drinking water\n\nImpressed by Dr. Desmond F. Lawler's support of her research and \"the department's close-knit community,\" Katherine chose the EWRE department for her master's and Ph.D. She says, \"I love the open-door community the department's professors have created. I feel I can drop in on any professor in the department, whether they are related to my research in any way or not, and discuss research and career questions. I also appreciate how the department is a community, where it is the norm to know everyone in the program, not the exception.\" Katherine describes her study of water chemistry aspects of environmental engineering as \"challenging, but extremely rewarding.\"\n\nA member of the National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship Program (2006-2010), Katherine was able to pursue her research in the field of naturally occurring fluoride and return to Ghana to conduct research in 2008. After later receiving the U.S. Student Fulbright Fellowship Grant (2008-2009), Katherine returned to Ghana to map the physical distribution of fluoride contamination and research the socio-culturally complexities surrounding the use of water. She recently presented her findings at the ACE10 AWWA National Conference in Chicago.\n\nOther awards Katherine has received include: the University of Texas at Austin Thrust Fellowship (2005-present), assisting her in completing the doctoral program; NSF GK-12 Fellowship (2010-2011) through which she will work as the resident scientist for two local teachers, assisting with weekly lessons and bringing imagination and fun to science in the classroom (more information at  the P.E.O Scholar Award (2011-2012) supporting women pursuing higher education; and the UT Austin Graduate Continuing Fellowship (2011-2012).\n\nIn addition to being a busy doctoral student, Alfredo is active in community development and the Society of Women Engineers.\n\nKatherine created an afterschool Science & Engineering Club at local Ann Richards Middle School, which received the 2010-2011 SWE Program Development Grant. She explains her role in the program: \"As the coordinator I mentor graduate students in designing hands-on activities related to their research/engineering discipline. I also create, plan, and manage the coordination of club activities and interactions with the middle school staff. This year I am attempting to survey and collect data on the effectiveness of the program for future funding and implementation in more schools.\" Katherine is also an active member of the Society of Women Engineers, UT chapter, and helps plan professional development workshops for female graduate engineering students. Between her studies and her community development projects, Katherine is an avid runner and looks forward to the Austin 2012 marathon. She also loves biking, and one day she hopes to travel to \"all corners of the world.\"\n\nKatherine aims \"to incorporate more of the human aspect of drinking water treatment,\" as she was able to do while in Ghana, and ultimately hopes \"to continue feeling fascinated and inspired by what I research.\" She says, \"I don't want to look back and think, I wish I had.\""

It must go through a treatment process, otherwise it can pollute surface water, groundwater sources and even drinking water.\n\nTips - What can you do?\n\nIf you have a piped system and if there is an interruption in water service, when service resumes, run water to flush the line to ensure no contamination remains in the system.\n\nIf you have a septic tank and leaching bed, here are some tips to keep your family safe.\n\nLeaching Bed\n\nDo not build anything on top of the leaching bed, such as parking areas, deck or storage shed.\n\nDo not drive vehicles or machinery over the bed, as the weight could crush the distribution pipes or pack down the soil, even in winter.\n\nMake sure the ground over the leaching bed has a good cover of grass or very shallow rooted plants.\n\nDo not plant trees or shrubs near the leaching bed.\n\nThe leaching bed should be built such that water does not pool around it. If water does start to pool, contact your Environmental Health Officer for advice.\n\nSeptic Tank\n\nMake sure you have easy access to your septic tank.\n\nComplete maintenance regularly.\n\nHave your septic tank pumped out every three to five years or when 1/3 of the tank is filled with solids (sludge).You will need a licensed professional to pump and dispose of the waste.\n\nIf your system has effluent filters, clean them out on a regular basis. How often you clean them depends on the filter type and size and the amount of water used in your household.\n\nBe careful what you put into your septic system.\n\nDo not pour paints, solvents, thinners, nail polish remover, or other common household products, medicines or antibiotics down the drain or into your toilet. Doing this could kill the bacteria that break down the organic matter in the wastewater.\n\nNever put oils, grease, fat, disposable diapers, tampons and their applicators, condoms, cat box litter, plastics, cigarette filters, egg shells, or other kitchen waste into the septic system. Solids are not digested and can block your system or shorten its life.\n\nTry to control the amount of water that enters your septic system by reducing the amount of water you use. Some good ways to reduce use are to fix leaky faucets, repair running toilets, and use low-flow toilets."

      "text": "Would You Drink Toilet Water?\n\nRecycled water could be the wave of the future. But would you toast to that?\n\nWhen it comes to living in a world with adequate amounts of clean water, we're starting to skate on some pretty thin ice. By 2025, half of the world's population won't have access to safe water, thanks to disasters fueled by climate change, pollution, political conflict, overdevelopment, and unsustainable farming practices, among other factors. A water crisis might seem hard to picture for the average American, given the country's love affair with pools, lawn sprinklers, carwashes, and hot tubs. But all over the world—and increasingly in certain pockets of the U.S.—there are dangerous shortages of water that could impact food prices and availability, jobs, the economy, and human and environmental health.\n\nRecycling water—in other words, turning wastewater into drinkable H20—has been touted as one of the solutions for taming our growing water problem, but the process doesn't come without a gross-out factor. After all, the toilet-to-tap concept can be hard for the American psyche to process, as highlighted in the new documentary Last Call at the Oasis.\n\nWhile drinking recycled, or \"reclaimed,\" water is largely unheard of in the United States, many of us have tried it, in a roundabout way. According to Redwood City's Reclaimed Water Project in California, indirect drinking water reuse occurs in many communities as treated water from an upstream community rejoins a river and becomes part of a downstream water supply. Through groundwater recharge, recycled water is percolated into groundwater basins, mixes with naturally occurring groundwater, and eventually is pumped out for drinking water use.\n\nWhile we may be unknowingly drinking recycled water here in the U.S., it's a well-known way of life in Singapore, where one-third of the island's water needs are met by reclaimed water treated so intensely that it meets safety standards. In the U.S., water-scarce areas like Tucson, Arizona, have a long history of recycling water, although, like Redwood City's project, it's used mainly for irrigation and not for human consumption—yet. \"Looking at how we recycle water and how we do it is important,\" explains Fernando Molina, spokesperson for the Tucson Water Department. \"We live in a desert. We have limitations on our water resources.\"\n\nTucson takes treated wastewater that would otherwise be discharged into the Santa Cruz River and further treats it for use as irrigation water for more than a dozen golf courses and nearly 40 parks. More than 700 single-family homes also tap recycled water for outdoor landscaping, while 52 schools, including the University of Arizona, irrigate with recycled water. Just taking that pressure off of the regular drinking water supply, which comes from the Colorado River system, and irrigating with reclaimed water saves the city as much water as 60,000 families would use in a year. That's substantial, considering that the average American uses more than 150 gallons of water a day.\n\nIt's not just about conservation, either. Tucson pays $20 million annually to bring in water from the Colorado River basin. A high cost, considering that 90 percent is lost after you flush it down the drain and it leaves the wastewater treatment facility.\n\nThere are two ways to create recycled water after it leaves the wastewater treatment plant. One involves complex mechanical filtration plants (think massive pool filters) while the other more closely resembles nature, with treated wastewater going through the ground to recharge aquifers. In the latter example, the one used in Tucson, Molina says biological processes in the ground help clean and filter the water, removing many contaminants.\n\nStill, contaminants are a concern not just in reclaimed water, but in city and well water, too. Pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and anything else washed down household, industrial, or storm drains puts safe drinking water in peril. In an ideal world, products wouldn't contain toxic ingredients in the first place, but for now, water treatment experts are testing water samples and making innovations to ensure safe and sustainable water supplies. After all, experts have said that 21st-century wars won't be fought over oil, but over water.\n\nRegardless of your stance on recycling water, here are 5 easy ways you can save tons of this precious, life-sustaining resource:\n\n• Be better about eating less beef. Cut back on beef, which requires more than 1,500 gallons of water per pound to produce. Instead, opt to cook nutrient-packed dried beans, which take just 52 gallons of water per pound on average.\n\n• Hit a thrift shop. It takes nearly 2,250 gallons of water to grow enough cotton to make just one pair of jeans, and another 165 gallons to dilute the pesticides and fertilizers used to grow it. On top of that, hundreds more gallons are used to treat, dye, bleach, and finish the fabric. Going naked is probably not an option, but buying used clothing when you can and keeping your clothes until they wear out will go a long way toward slimming your water footprint.\n\n• Create a water-sipping bathroom. In most American households, the single biggest water hog in the house is the toilet, averaging five gallons per flush. If you're in the market for a new low-flow commode, chose one bearing EPA's WaterSense label. If you don't want to buy a new toilet, fill a water bottle with several inches of sand and place it in the tank to reduce the water your toilet uses per flush. An added water saver? Keeping condoms, tampons, and other debris out of the toilet—trash like that can force your toilet to use up to 7 gallons per flush!\n\n• Don't be a defrost dunce. Sure, running water over frozen food will thaw it out faster, but it wastes a significant amount of water. Avoid laying it on the counter to thaw—that could promote the growth of harmful pathogens—and instead plan ahead and defrost in the fridge."

There was a relatively unknown but apparently widespread carcinogen and a great hook—it was tied to the story of contaminated water behind the film Erin Brockovich (and the book A Civil Action). Issues relating to public health threats demand careful and thorough reporting. Unfortunately, those qualities were at times absent from the PBS story.\n\nThe story focused on hexavalent chromium (Cr6 carcinogenic. It's much worse if inhaled, but there's evidence that it is dangerous when ingested as well. As the NewsHour story noted, recent sampling has shown that hexavalent chromium is present in drinking water across the country. Does that mean we have a public health crisis on our hands, caused by shockingly widespread contamination? Let's slow down and get some context.\n\nMeet the metal\n\nHexavalent chromium occurs naturally. That's a rather important fact never mentioned in the NewsHour story, which describes the water as \"tainted\" by industrial chemicals. Chromium, like many elements, is present in Earth's crust. Some types of rock have more than others, but it's actually a little bit more common than copper or zinc—the average concentration in the upper crust is something like 90 parts per million. Oxidize some of that chromium to the hexavalent state, and it can be mobilized into groundwater. If hexavalent chromium is showing up in wells nearly everywhere we look, it might be because it's naturally present rather than a ubiquitous, human-introduced contaminant.\n\nOne of the things people often wonder about earthquakes is whether human activity can play a role in their occurrence. Sometimes that comes from a desire to assign blame, but often it's related to a bigger question: could we actively trigger small earthquakes to prevent the big, damaging ones from occurring? While that lofty piece of geoengineering may not be feasible (or even possible), it is true that humans can sometimes trigger earthquakes.\n\nEarthquakes are fundamentally controlled by two factors. The first is the movement of rock, such as tectonic plates. This constant, gradual movement is the source of conflict in an active fault zone—one region of rock is being forced past another. If the two blocks simply slid smoothly by each other along the fault surface, this would be a pretty peaceful process. But this is where the second factor comes along—the friction between the blocks. The stress builds up until it's great enough to overcome that friction, at which point seismic energy is released violently as the blocks catch up on decades' (or centuries') worth of motion in just a few seconds.\n\nFor the most part, the accumulating stress that creates this situation is much too large for human activities to make a difference. We can, however, affect the friction that locks up the fault. Hydraulic fracturing, where fluids are pumped into the ground at extremely high pressures to crack rocks that release natural gas and oil, has been shown to do just that in certain situations. Increasing the fluid pressure inside the fault partially de-stabilizes the friction-lock, lowering the stress threshold necessary to trigger an earthquake just enough for one to occur.\n\nIn December of last year, Ars reported on a major EPA study in Pavillion, Wyoming that concluded hydraulic fracking operations there had contaminated the groundwater aquifer. While there wasn't a clear link to contamination detected in some shallow private water wells, EPA believed that the deeper contamination was very likely related to fracking. This determination came primarily from two deep monitoring wells that EPA had installed for the investigation.\n\nEncana, the gas exploration company that owned the natural gas wells, disagreed vehemently. They asserted that EPA had drilled monitoring wells into a zone where gas was naturally present. As for the other compounds EPA detected in the wells, which were known to be components of fluids used during fracking, Encana said these were likely introduced into the aquifer during the drilling of the monitoring wells. EPA had foreseen this objection, and went to great lengths to avoid contaminating the monitoring wells, but Encana was not satisfied.\n\nIn the end, the EPA, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the Wyoming Geological Survey, the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, and the Wyoming Water Development Office met to discuss these objections. They decided that the EPA and USGS would carefully re-sample the deep monitoring wells to verify the results EPA had gotten previously.\n\nHydraulic fracturing—fracking—for natural gas has revolutionized the energy industry in many places, including the United States. The pushback over contamination concerns has been a prevailing storyline in the public eye. This possibility has been viewed as unlikely, though, as the shale gas layers being fracked are typically several thousand feet deeper than any aquifers used for drinking water. Fractures would have to propagate tremendous distances, through a number of confining layers, to create a pathway for contamination.\n\nThe physics required to make something like that happen just aren't there. In nature, however, it's usually true that to consider something to be impossible is to be disappointed. And so the nagging question remained: what if there are already some pathways present through those confining layers?\n\nIn 2011, researchers from Duke University published results (open access) showing a correlation between methane concentrations in private water wells and proximity to local natural gas production wells in parts of Pennsylvania and New York. While that suggested the water well contamination could be related to recent fracking, it was not at all a sure thing. The work was controversial, too—triggering a string of comments and replies in the journal that published it.\n\nNo, you don't need to check the prescription on your eyeglasses (or medications)—we really are talking groundwater depletion and sea level rise again. Just a few weeks ago, we covered a recent study on the topic published by researchers from Taiwan and the Netherlands and compared it to one from last year that was done by Leonard Konikow of the United States Geological Survey. There's a good reason that we're back at it again. But first, for those who didn't take notes—what are we talking about?\n\nIn many places, the water table is dropping as groundwater is depleted. When groundwater is pumped up for use, whether for drinking water or irrigation, some portion of it fails to infiltrate back down into the ground. (In drier regions, that portion approaches nil). Instead, the water evaporates into the atmosphere or ends up in surface streams. In either case, most of it eventually makes its way to the ocean. In many places, the amount of precipitation that infiltrates into the ground is too small to make up for that loss. And as the volume of groundwater decreases, sea level must rise in turn. It's an awfully big planet we're on, though. Most of its surface is ocean, so you might not expect this to add up to much.\n\nThat's where these studies become so interesting. They estimated that, currently, the volume of groundwater being depleted is equivalent to about 13 to 20 percent of the ocean volume change. This isn't the whole story, however. The construction of dams on rivers creates large reservoirs (or lakes) behind them, increasing the storage of water on land. As long as you keep building new dams, you continually counteract some portion of sea level rise.\n\nLast year, we had covered a study on the non-trivial contribution of groundwater depletion to sea level rise. It concluded that humans have pumped enough water from underground sources to account for up to 13 percent of the rise in ocean levels that occurred between 2000 and 2008.\n\nA caveat, from a related paper, was that this might be offset by an increased retention of surface water in large reservoirs behind new dams. That would make the net effect of these human activities a wash. In fact, the 2007 IPCC report left out groundwater depletion when projecting sea level rise because of the uncertainty of existing estimates and the presumed balance with reservoir impoundment.\n\nA new estimate, published recently in Geophysical Research Letters, takes a closer look at dam building and projects current trends into the future. While groundwater depletion continues, dam construction is on the decline. The result should be an increasing contribution to sea level rise.\n\nHydraulic fracturing (more commonly referred to as \"fracking\") involves the injection of fluid at high pressure into a well, opening or widening fractures in the rock below that free up the flow of natural gas. Domestic natural gas production has been booming as a result, but opponents claim the technique contaminates drinking water, causing serious health effects"

Homeopathy Explained?\n\nNew research suggests water remembers what has been dissolved in it,\neven after dilution beyond the point where no molecule of the original\nsubstances could remain. Dr. Mae-Wan\nHo reports.\n\nFor more than a century, practitioners of homeopathy have used highly\ndiluted solutions of medicinal substances to treat diseases. Some substances\nare diluted way beyond the point at which no trace of the original substances\ncould remain. It is as though the water has retained memory of the departed\nmolecules. This has aroused a great deal of scepticism within the conventional\nmedical and scientific community. To this day, 'homeopathic' is used\nas a term of derision, to indicate something imagined that has no reality.\n\nBut a series of recent discoveries in the conventional scientific\ncommunity is making people think again.\n\nFirst, there were the South Korean chemists who discovered two years ago\nthat molecules dissolved in water clump together as they get more diluted (see\nSiS 15), which\nwas totally unexpected; and further more, the size of the clumps depends on the\nhistory of dilution, making a mockery of the 'laws of chemistry'.\n\nNow, physicist Louis Rey in Lausanne, Switzerland, has published a paper\nin the mainstream journal, Physica A, describing experiments that\nsuggest water does have a memory of molecules that have been diluted away, as\ncan be demonstrated by a relatively new physical technique that measures\nthermoluminescence.\n\nIn this technique, the material is 'activated' by irradiation\nat low temperature, with UV, X-rays, electron beams, or other high-energy\nsub-atomic particles. This causes electrons to come loose from the atoms and\nmolecules, creating 'electron-hole pairs' that become separated and\ntrapped at different energy levels.\n\nThen, when the irradiated material is warmed up, it releases the\nabsorbed energy and the trapped electrons and holes come together and\nrecombine. This causes the release of a characteristic glow of light, peaking\nat different temperatures depending on the magnitude of the separation between\nelectron and hole.\n\nAs a general rule, the phenomenon is observed in crystals with an\nordered arrangement of atoms and molecules, but it is also seen in disordered\nmaterials such as glasses. In this mechanism, imperfections in the\natomic/molecular lattice are considered to be the sites at which luminescence\nappears.\n\nRey decided to use the technique to investigate water, starting with\nheavy water or deuterium oxide that's been frozen into ice at a\ntemperature of 77K. The absolute temperature scale (degree K, after Lord\nKelvin) is used in science. (The zero degree K is equivalent to –273 C,\nand deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen which is twice as heavy as hydrogen).\n\nAs the ice warms up, a first peak of luminescence appears near 120K, and\na second peak near 166 K. Heavy water gives a much stronger signal than water.\nIn both cases, samples that were not irradiated gave no signals at all.\n\nFor both water and heavy water, the relative intensity of the\nthermoluminescence depends on the irradiation dose. There has been a suggestion\nthat peak 2 comes from the hydrogen-bonded network within ice, whereas peak 1\ncomes from the individual molecules. This was confirmed by looking at a totally\ndifferent material that is known to present strong hydrogen bonds, which showed\na similar glow in the peak 2 region, but nothing in peak 1.\n\nRey then investigated what would happen when he dissolved some\nchemicals in the water and diluted it in steps of one hundred fold with\nvigorous stirring (as in the preparation of homeopathic remedies), until he\nreached a concentration of 10 to the power -30 g per centilitre, and compare\nthat to the control that has not had any chemical dissolved in it and diluted\nin the same way.\n\nThe samples were frozen and activated with irradiation as usual.\n\nMuch to his surprise, when lithium chloride, LiCl, a chemical that\nwould be expected to break hydrogen bonds between water molecules was added,\nand then diluted away, the thermoluminescent glow became reduced, but the\nreduction of peak 2 was greater relative to peak 1. Sodium chloride, NaCl, had\nthe same effect albeit to a lesser degree.\n\nIt appears, therefore, that substances like LiCl and NaCl can modify\nthe hydrogen-bonded network of water, and that this modification remains even\nwhen the molecules have been diluted away.\n\nThe fact that this 'memory' remains, in spite of, or because\nof vigorous stirring or shaking at successive dilutions, indicates that the\n'memory' is by no means static, but depends on a dynamic process,\nperhaps a collective quantum excitation of water molecules that has a high\ndegree of stability (see \"The strangeness of water and homeopathic memory\",\nSiS 15).\n\nLiving with the Fluid Genome\n\nInside story from a scientist who has warned that genetic engineering is\nboth dangerous and futile.

      "text": "Posts Tagged 'natural water filters'\n\nYes, you read that right. According to a recent study of oyster habitats around the world, these mollusks are disappearing, and 85 percent of their reefs have been lost due to over-harvesting and disease. Most of the remaining oysters in the world can be found in five locations in North America.\n\nThe study involved an international team of researchers led by Michael Beck of the Nature Conservancy and the University of California, Santa Cruz. They examined the condition of oyster reefs in 40 ecoregions and found that they are at less than 10 percent of their prior abundance in most places.\n\nWhile they are not officially extinct, the researchers claim that they are \"functionally extinct\", meaning they lack any significant ecosystem role. What does that mean for us? Well, besides the fact that they provide food and employment to people living in coastal areas, oysters are important to ecosystems because they are some of nature's best water filters. Known as \"filter feeders\", they consume harmful pollutants while feeding. As we have mentioned before, an adult oyster can filter up to 60 gallons of water a day, which is more than most reverse osmosis filters can do. In addition to the mollusks, themselves, oyster reefs are also constructed to naturally purify contaminated waters.\n\nIn order to avoid complete extinction, any reefs with less than 10 percent of former abundance should close to further harvesting until the numbers rise again.\n\nStamford professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, Charles Yarish, believes that seaweed could be the next revolutionary trend in water purification technology. His method, termed 'extractive aquaculture' or 'bioextraction', uses seaweed as its main component, and may effectively clean up pollution in waterways from both natural waste and human sources. How does it work? The same way that shellfish do: by extracting organic and inorganic nutrients from from seawater. Although nutrients are generally regarded as beneficial to organisms, too many of them may contribute to the growth of harmful algal blooms, which deplete oxygen in water. Although bioextraction itself is not new (it has been used before by ancient cultures in Egypt and China) Yarish's method of bringing together plants and animals on different levels of the food chain into one place, in order to achieve purification in specific areas, is quite innovative, and will allow aquaculture to function more like a natural ecosystem.\n\nAll this time, we thought banana peels were useless… well except in the game of Mario Kart. Not anymore, thanks to the discovery of Milena Boniolo, a chemist from the Federal University of Sao Carlos, near Sao Paulo, Brazil. When dried and ground into a powder, banana peels have the ability to decontaminate polluted water by at least 60 percent. The process may be repeated until the water is purified almost completely. Banana peels are rich in negatively-charged molecules, which attract the heavy, positively-charged metals present in contaminated water. Considering that restaurants alone may discard tons of banana peels on a daily basis, this natural method could introduce a much-less expensive alternative to current water filtration technologies.\n\nPut these two methods together, and what do you end up with? Banana Sushi – an edible solution to dirty water.\n\nOver the course of one year alone, we have discovered quite a few natural ways to purify water. I'm sure there will be more to come, so stay tuned, and bookmark this tag in your browser for updates.\n\n04\n\n01 2011\n\nAlyson Bell is one of four people chosen for this year's Manning Young Canadian Innovation Award. This high school student's ability to turn her curiosity into a creative solution at the Canada-wide science fair, has won her this award among others, including a $500 Manning Innovation Achievement Award – given to eight people each year – along with university entrance scholarships and $40,000 worth of prizes for her science fair project.\n\nThe project is a natural water filter that uses oregano to filter bacteria from water. Bell figured out the secret to clean water from her grandfather's oregano-dense spaghetti sauce recipe. Wondering how the sauce was able to last over three weeks in the refrigerator without spoiling, Bell tested her hypothesis, that oregano keeps bacteria from growing, in a petri dish. Finding her hypothesis to be correct, she turned these results into an innovative water filter made with fresh oregano layered between sandy gravel and charcoal. Contaminated water that passed through the filter was disease-free.\n\nBut are Bell's results really that innovative? It has long been known that oregano has numerous health benefits. Wild oil of oregano is often used as a holistic alternative to traditional medicine, to boost immunity and prevent disease. It has antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal and anti-parasitic properties, so it's no surprise that it would work as a filter for contaminated water. According to a recent article announcing Bell's achievement, the oregano-filtered water \"came out clean and potable.\" But, the question remains:\n\n25\n\n05 2010\n\nYes, you read that correctly. We have run across a new kind of filter, folks. This one doesn't quite match up to the \"human\" variety, but it comes close…\n\nThousands of hair salons nationwide have donated hair clippings to Matter of Trust – an environmental organization that is involved in a project that collects hair and nylon stockings to make oil booms and mats.\n\nEach strand of hair has scales on it that attract and collect oil, which explains why most of us shampoo our hair daily. However, this basic fact has not just been applied by shampoo companies. The oil booms and mats made from salon hair clippings is now effectively being used to clean up the damage left by the recent Gulf spill. Hair is stuffed into nylon stockings that are dragged along the coast, sopping up oil which sticks to the scales, while the water filters out.\n\nOil spills can do great damage to marine life, including the sea monkeys, oysters and other creatures that act as natural water filters. Such an emergency requires a better remedy than bottled water. Here, we have yet another example of how water filtration is important to our lives as well as to the health of our environment.\n\n06\n\n05 2010\n\nPrahlad Jani brings a whole new meaning to the phrase, \"reduce, reuse, recycle.\" This 83-year-old holy man's body is his recycling bin, according to a recent news article. Claiming to have lived the past seven decades without food or water, Jani was taken in for observation by Indian doctors on April 22, and since then has had no food or water and has not passed urine or stool. His body has remained in perfect health since then, showing no signs of dehydration, hunger or fatigue. He is still active enough to climb stairs and several tests on his brain reveal that it resembles that of a 25-year-old.\n\nJani claims to be a \"breatharian,\" a person who can live on \"spiritual life force,\" since receiving a blessing from a goddess at the age of eight. He says that drops of water, or for him, drops of a magic elixir from the goddess, filter through a hole in his palate, sustaining him. In addition, he is able to produce urine in his bladder as well as reabsorb it back into his body, at will. Ordinarily, a person cannot survive without urinating, but it appears that Jani is able to filter and re-circulate the water that makes up 90 percent of his body at any time.\n\nHere we have waste reduction and recycling in its simplest form. Or maybe it isn't so simple. Scientists, of course, are baffled by this mystery, and as of yet, have no scientific explanation for it. The \"spiritual life force\" that sustains him didn't stop at the blessing of the goddess. At age 83, Jani continues to receive energy through spiritual meditation, adding a fourth \"r\" – \"rethink\" – to the famous phrase, \"reduce, reuse, recycle.\"\n\nJani is undergoing a series of medical tests over a period of fifteen days as scientists are hoping to find solutions for people in emergency situations who must go without food or water for long periods. Last week we gave suggestions for how to survive the apocalypse with six of our best emergency filters. Can we add Jani, the human filter, to our list? Only time will tell, so stay tuned for an update. In the meantime, while you wait for a miracle blessing from a goddess, those six filters still come highly recommended. For Jani and his fellow \"breatharians,\" we recommend the 3M N95 Respirator Mask in case of emergencies; since meditation involves breathing, they'll want to make sure they aren't inhaling air pollutants.\n\n29\n\n04 2010\n\nAbout a year ago, I wrote about the benefits of four natural water filters – plants, sand, oysters and coconut. Well, it seems you can throw the prickly cactus in there as one of nature's water filters as well, according to Norma A. Alcantar, an assistant professor in the University of South Florida chemical and biomedical engineering program.\n\nAlcantar first learned about the thick, gooey mucilage from her grandmother. Now, she and her team are using the gummy goo to provide clean drinking water to residents of rural Mexico. Apparently using the mucilage of a cactus to filter water is nothing new, but it's now been scientifically-validated.\n\nSo how do you filter water with a cactus? Just extract the cactus mucilage from the cactus and put it in the water, where it binds to dirt, particles, bacteria and even arsenic. The mucilage and other contaminants bound to it can then be removed. Alcantar and her team are still researching to see if the cactus mucilage will remove other heavy metals.\n\n28\n\n04 2010\n\nWith filter media like Manganese Greensand, KDF 55 and granular activated charcoal, it's easy to think of water filtration as consisting entirely of strange, manmade materials, plastics and polymers that purify your water using space age technology. These filter medias are then connected to other technological devices, such as kitchen sinks, refrigerators, pools, spas and showers. Water filtration, the hallmark of 21st century scientific achievement.\nOf course, this is hardly the case. Water filtration is a natural and integral part of life, and it's a process aided by a variety of animals and natural materials. The Earth has many natural methods of water filtration, and humankind has also used natural materials to purify water for thousands of years.\nNow I present to you, without further ado, \"Nature's Four Favorite Filters\": Plants: Especially in Wetland areas, plants naturally filter the water in which they exist. Such plants move carbon dioxide through the water while also adding oxygen. In addition, many rid ponds and bogs of toxic metals and allow for the growth of beneficial bacteria. Water lettuce and water hyacinth are both particularly absorptive plants, and have even been used as pre-filters to waste water treatment systems. Sand: More than 2,000 years ago, the Greeks and Romans used sand to filter the water of their bathhouses and pools. This technique is still used today to capture dirt and larger sediment, as it filters particles between 25-50 microns in size. Oysters: Oysters are filter feeders that consume many harmful pollutants while feeding. An adult oyster can filter as much as 60 gallons of water a day. That's more than most reverse osmosis systems. In many contaminated waters, oyster reefs are constructed to purify the water in a natural way. Coconut: When a coconut ripens, the water inside hardens into the white flesh that we all know as coconut. In the months before this happens, however, water is purified in the unripe coconut as it is passed between many fibers and kept sterile inside the nut. The result? A liquid brimming with electrolytes and second only to water itself in terms of purity. There is a reason many of today's water filters employ a coconut carbon block.\nWhile water purification is indeed a natural occurrence, many contaminants found in water can hardly be described as such. The problem, of course, is that all the plants, sand, oysters and coconuts in the world could not rid the world of some of the chemicals found in your water. But by using modern filters that use some of nature's best filters, like sand and coconut, we can restore water to a more pure and natural state."

      "text": "The\ncolouration and precipitation of the water after every session\nis primarily due to a combination of the degradation of the\nrings within the Orb (water module) and the impurities present\nin the water source. However, if these were the only two factors\naffecting colouration and these factors remained constant, one\nwould expect the same colouration outcomes after every session.\nThis is not the case. There are a number of other factors that\nalso play a role.\n\nThe main factors that\naffect water colouration are:\n\nWater Source\n\nConductive Agent\n\nThe person in session\n\nTemperature of the water\n\nWeather and other Environmental Factors\n\nOrb\n\nPower Supply\n\nContainer used\n\nPlease\nNote: Session without any person in it may also cause\ndiscolouration and precipitation in the water.\n\nIn the industrialized world of today, \"living\" energetically\ncharged water is a rarity. In our drinking water supply systems,\nwater is exposed to the detrimental energetic effects of\nstraight unnatural water pipes, high mains pressures and\nchemical treatments. Water is not allowed to move in its\nnaturally winding way thereby causing loss of life force.\nNegative energetic imprints from chemicals, such as fertilizers,\npesticides and sterilizers remain in the water, even after\nphysical removal of such substance.\n\n(Dr Wolfgang Ludwig & Prof. Jacques Benveniste)\n\nLast updated: April 2008\n\nFactors affecting the Colouration of the water\n\n1. Water source:\n\nUnder ideal water conditions no discolouration and precipitation occurs. Note that water sources are ever changing.\nFor example: the conductivity and atmospheric electrical activity alter during certain times of the year and may fluctuate\nduring periods of rain.\n\nTap water (treated) - Generally has good conductivity and is readily available. Discolouration and precipitation\ndepends on the treatment by your local water treatment plant and other local environmental factors.\n\nBore or ground water - Generally very conductive, may require diluting by adding either tank or distilled\nwater. Different sources of bore water affect the colours and precipitation differently. Environmental factors play a large role.\n\nTank or distilled water - Generally very little conductivity. Often requires a small amount of 'Conductive Agent' in\norder for the unit to operate (the only instance that anything should be added to the water).\n\nDuring session, some of the minerals, chemicals and other impurities suspended in the water, along with the degradation of\nthe rings, congeal to form large molecules, evident in more precipitation and discolouration.\n\n2. Conductive agent (salt):\n\nUnder normal circumstances no 'Conductive Agent' is required in order for the QEnergySpa to operate.\nIn the rare event that the conductivity of the water is too low, a 'Conductive Agent' may be added. Adding\n'Conductive Agent' results in increased precipitation and colouration. Rock salt (e.g. Himalayan) or sea\nsalt are the only two current 'Conductive Agents' we recommend. At the rate of ¼ - ½ tea spoon per\n3 gallons of water (1g per gallon).\n\n3. Person in session:\n\nWe all have unique bio-energy fields or signatures (which is constantly changing due to various exposures) much like finger\nprints. Even identical twins with seemingly the same health status have different bio-energetic fields. These different bio-energy\nfields interact differently with the water, resulting in diverse colours and solids.\n\nOne of the most common misconceptions is that people using these devices are detoxifying through the soles of their feet\nand that the resulting colour is a direct clinical interpretation indicative of specific ailments. This is a medical 'Detox hoax'.\nNo interpretation or diagnosis should ever be applied to any colour and or precipitation. A visual inspection of the water in the first few\nminutes during session, will clearly show the precipitation arising from the ORB and NOT from around your feet.\n\nDetoxification takes place through the body's natural channels and is but one aspect of regaining better health.\nThe QEnergySpa is capable of much more.\n\nA test of 13 people was conducted using the same water on the same day resulting\nin different colours and sediments. The lightest water colour (top left of picture) came from the\nheaviest smoker in the room, clearly showing that no interpretation can be applied to the water colour and the\ntoxins are not drawn out of the soles of the feet.\n\n4. Temperature of the water:\n\nChanging the temperature, changes the conductivity of the water. It also affects the lattice structure of\nthe water. The temperature of the water helps determine the release rate of toxins from the water. Hot water\nwill release solids at a faster rate than cold water, provided there are materials in the water which can\nbe released. Even though heating the water damages the lattice structure, the critical temperature for the\n'damage' to occur is 87.1 degrees Celsius, which is well inside the critical temperature for sessions.\n\nAs a result of the vast misinformation from competitive products in the marketplace regarding water colour\nand detoxification, Q Tech Laboratories conducted an experiment with an earlier model power supply and Array\nto demonstrate the differences that can be achieved by changing water temperature. Two trials were conducted\nusing 33 and 45 degrees Celsius water. In this experiment water temperature was the only variable, all other\nfactors remained constant. Note: this water was treated by itself, no human contact was made during the session.\n\nThe first test using ordinary reticulated tap water temperatures at 33ºC.\n\nThe second test using ordinary reticulated tap water temperatures at 45ºC.\n\nPicture 1a: Prior to beginning.\nNote the number of lights on the power supply in the background.\n\nPicture 1b: Prior to beginning.\n\nPicture 2a: After 10 Minutes\n\nPicture 2b: After 10 Minutes\nNotice that the colour and the amount of sedimentation is already more than that shown in Picture\n2a.\n\nPicture 3a: After 20 Minutes\n\nPicture 3b: After 20 Minutes\nNotice that the sediment on top and the colour of the water\nare darker.\n\nPicture 4a: After 35 Minutes\n\nPicture 4b: After 35 Minutes. Slightly darker again.\n\nThe above images show that a small increase in temperature from 33ºC to 45ºC will increase the\nsedimentation and discolouration of the water considerably. This is proof that \"Temperature\" does\nin fact impact the outcome in the water.\n\n5. Weather and other environmental factors:\n\nWater itself is not only very sensitive to the weather but also the entire environment. The electrical activity\nincluding the conductivity can fluctuate during extreme weather conditions.\n\nProximity to natural and man-made\nexposures including (but not limited to) geological formations, mineral deposits, chemicals/toxins, electrical\ninfluences such as power lines, microwaves, electrical storms, solar flares, lunar cycle, radio frequencies and\nradiations present in the immediate environment at the time of session will influence water discolouration and\nprecipitation.\n\nThe graph on the left indicates the electrical activity of water recorded over a twelve (12)\nhour period. As you can see it is not static, but is in fact very active. Water is completely\ninteractive with the environment.\n\n6. The Orb (water module):\n\nWith every use, the rings encased within the Orb degrade. The extent of degradation or corrosion\ninto the water is determined by such factors as the water source and the presence of conductive agent.\n\n7. Power supply:\n\nThe components, as well as the type of power supply used for this\ntechnology, although minimal, will affect the colouration\nand precipitation of the water after session. For example, switch-mode power supplies found\nin other brands are less suited for bio-energetic use, creating considerably higher levels of\nprecipitation and colouration. The Q ENERGYspa® utilises a transformer based technology which\nis designed and manufactured to specific safety and Quantum Reality Field Science (QRFS) standards.\n\n8. Container used:\n\nThe energetic properties or signature of the bath container also impacts on the colouration and precipitation of the water.\nWe recommend you use a (in order of preference) pure quartz crystal bowl, a raw untreated copper bowl, glass, ceramic or plastic bowl\n(for ease of use, a disposable plastic bag or liner may be used). You can also use your bath tub. The only stipulation is that\nthe bowl cannot be made of or contain Aluminium or uncoated fibre glass. Size and shape matters little, as long as the orb is fully\nsubmerged and you can fit a part of your body in the water.\n\nNote:\nWater Colour from any session, with any device of this technology, may vary due to a large number of\ndifferent parameters and circumstances, some of which are outlined are outlined herein. No\nInterpretation should ever be applied to any one colour and/or precipitation, No matter\nthe configuration or system used. Nor should it be indicative of the effectiveness of the QEnergySpa session"

Yet when it comes to bottled water, North Americans are conned to the tune of $15 billion and eight billion gallons annually, paying twice for a commodity we already own.\n\nThe truth is most of us in the United States and Canada can be assured that the water that flows from our taps is as clean as bottled water – and our taxes have already paid for it.\n\nIn fact, tap water may actually be cleaner. Last month, researchers found that some bottled water contains more bacteria than tap water. More than 70 percent of the popular brands tested in this new study failed to meet bacterial standards set by the United States Pharmacopeia, a non-governmental agency that sets safety standards for medications and health-care products, reports The Montreal Gazette.\n\nIn comparison, tap water is usually so pure, bottled water companies can simply bottle it and sell it to you.\n\nToday, the U.S. and Canada spend enormous sums of money on research and regulations to keep tap water safe. The Colorado-based Water Research Foundation, the world's largest non-profit organization dedicated to drinking water studies, is bankrolled by about 900 water utilities, and spends $20 to $25 million a year on its research, which is used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Health Canada, and by water utilities serving roughly 80 percent of the U.S. population.\n\nThe bottled water industry possesses no such research arm. Nor is it regulated as rigorously. EPA requires public water supply testing by certified labs that must give timely violation reports. Public water systems must also offer reports to customers, noting their water's source, evidence of contaminants and regulatory compliance. In contrast, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which regulates bottled water, cannot require certified lab testing or violation reporting. Nor does FDA require bottled water companies to disclose where their water comes from, how it is treated, or what contaminants it contains.\n\nLook at the historical record and you'll see that the government regulated water systems of the U.S. and Canada are among the best on the planet, protecting against cholera, typhoid and other water-borne epidemics that still plague the developing world. Unfortunately, the success of these utilities has made them largely invisible. It's like mass vaccinations – when the threat of a deadly disease is eliminated, we quickly forget how we achieved public health in the first place, and then take it utterly for granted.\n\nFifty years ago, when the American public started to worry about a clean environment, including their drinking water, they didn't suddenly start buying bottled water. Instead they demanded action and the Clean Water Act was passed – a regulatory framework that dramatically improved drinking water standards in the 1970's, and still does today.\n\nStill, there's an appropriate market for bottled water. Take lead contamination. It's a big deal in some schools where old pipes leach toxic lead into tap water. In such cases, bottled water is an affordable substitute to keep students safe. Even mundane problems, like the inconvenience of a suddenly thirsty child, makes bottled water a better choice than a sugary drink.\n\nI'm not saying that bottled water is inherently evil, just mostly unnecessary and a waste of money.\n\nIf you want to pinch pennies in these hard economic times, why pay up to 36 times more for bottled water that may or may not be just as good as your own tap water?\n\nJUDE ISABELLA is a science writer and managing editor of YES Mag, the Science Magazine for Adventurous Minds.(c) 2010 BlueRidgePress"

      "text": "For the most part, Valley residents depend on cracks in the bedrock-sometimes hundreds of feet below the earth's surface-for the water that spills out of their faucets at the flick of a wrist.\n\nIt's the region's steep-sided mountains and shallow soils that make these fractures so important, said Eric Hanson, a groundwater specialist with the Vermont Rural Water Association. Since topography limits the number of sand and gravel deposits in the Valley-a reliable water source for many other communities--hitting a crack in the bedrock where groundwater collects is often a person's best bet when searching for water here.\n\nHe urged Valley residents to prevent future problems with their water supply by taking an interest now.\n\n\"Everything does count and we should do what we can to protect our groundwater resources,\" he said.\n\nHanson spoke to a packed gymnasium at the Waitsfield Elementary School April 2 along with Liz Royer, a source water specialist, in the first of two forums on drinking water sponsored by Friends of the Mad River (FMR).\n\nFMR president Kinny Perot said the organization hopes to eventually work with a geologist to map groundwater resources in The Valley. She said such projects are required by state law, although, so far, state funding has been non-existent.\n\nPrivate homeowners may sign up to test the quality of their water at a discounted rate at either the next water forum later this spring or by contacting the FMR office. The FMR provides bottles and ships the water samples to a lab for analysis.\n\nResults from these tests may help a future Valleywide groundwater mapping project.\n\nAs The Valley continues to grow, many towns are dealing with water-related issues, Perot pointed out. The town of Waitsfield recently drilled a test well off Reed Road for a possible public water source; in Warren, ski area expansion has led to more exploration for water supplies. In Moretown, MTBE contamination in some wells was a recent problem, Perot said.\n\nGROUNDWATER CONTAMINANTS\n\nBecause Valley residents depend on fractures in the earth to feed their wells, Hanson said vast differences in the quality and quantity of water may exist between wells in the same neighborhood, and even in the same type of bedrock.\n\nIt all depends on the particular fracture the drill taps.\n\nBedrock type influences levels of some naturally occurring pollutants, including arsenic, radon and uranium, Hanson said. In some cases, wells have been drilled and abandoned because of contamination levels.\n\n\"When you're in that bedrock type, there's not much you can do about it,\" he said.\n\nMan-made contaminants include herbicides, road salt, and bacteria from failed septic systems. At high enough levels, these contaminants may percolate through the soil and seep into the groundwater supply at a given location.\n\nMany variables come into play when dealing with contaminants, including soil and bedrock type as well as topography. In general, however, soil acts as a natural filter that keeps groundwater relatively untainted.\n\n\"In general, soil is a miracle filter,\" Hanson said.\n\nBecause groundwater and surface water exist in a cycle, the state monitors whether wells draw enough groundwater to affect nearby rivers and streams. Groundwater is often crucial to \"recharging\" streams and rivers, adding to rain and snowmelt.\n\n\"Those kinds of issues are starting to happen more than they have in the past,\" Hanson said.\n\nRECOMMENDED TESTS FOR DRINKING WATER\n\nThe state recommends private well owners conduct several tests regularly, said Liz Royer, a source water specialist with Vermont Rural Water Association. These include:\n\nA total coliform bacteria test annually to measure a \"large group of soil and intestinal bacteria that indicate potential well contamination.\"\n\nInorganic chemical test every five years to measure levels of arsenic, chloride, iron, lead, and other naturally occurring contaminants.\n\nGross alpha radiation screening every five years. This screening tests for \"mineral radioactivity,\" including uranium and radon.\n\nThe state regulates \"public water supplies,\" defined as wells serving more than 25 people at least 60 days per year. Some restaurants and businesses as well as housing developments fall into this category, Royer said.\n\nShe said for these systems, the state requires protection plans to map source waters and identify potential pollutants.\n\nContact Erin Post at\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.

It works effectively to break the chlorine and chloramine bonds (chlorine + ammonia = chloramine) and reduces the chlorine and ammonia down to non-toxic levels. Makes the water column safe for the introduction of fish and plants almost instantaneously!\n\nEven low levels of chlorine and chloramines can be extremely toxic to fish. Chlorine is a very powerful oxidizing agent and is toxic to fish at concentrations of less than 0.05 mg/L. Water used for fish culture should not contain any residual chlorine to be considered safe. Chlorine and Chloramines cause gill damage which eventually results in gill lesions. These lesions will eventually thicken the gill filaments leaving the fish unable to utilize oxygen and release carbon dioxide, thus resulting in fish death."

      "text": "As many more students and staff became more informed about the water problems at La Cueva High School, the push to have the water tested has become more apparent to APS officials.\n\nMon. the 25, at around 5 a.m. water testing of 57 faucets from around the school took place. The testing concluded with the eight workers leaving with 115 samples that will be tested by Assaigai Analytical Laboratories Inc. sometime this week.\n\nAPS Environmental Management Planner, John Dufay, said \"The testing went well, everything went smoothly and as planned.\"\n\nThe Edition had the water tested themselves. They found that the Arsenic level was two times higher than EPA Standards and the Lead was just over the marker for EPA standards. Meaning that, theoretically, effective action would need to take place.\n\nDufay also commented by giving a background of the history of the schools water problem by saying that the last sampling for lead was done in 2002. This was five years after a corrosion protection additive was recommended by the EPA to reduce lead levels in 1997. He also spoke on the miscommunications that APS has been having about where La Cueva's water stands and how regularly it is being tested and what is going to be done about the problem.\n\nThough La Cueva's water is supposed to be tested on a monthly basis and usually is, it is never being tested for Lead but for more basic things, most of which are not harmful to ones body.\n\nIn a recent interview Mr. Dufay said that, \"Sometimes it is hard to back track when the last testing was done and what the results were. A lot of people aren't up to date on what's being tested and or when it's happening, there are a lot of miscommunications is the process but we are presently working on a plan of action to help fix the issue.\"\n\nThe testing for lead was done by a certain protocol required by the EPA; two draws have to be taken from the source of water. The first draw will indicate lead levels in the faucet and the second will be indicating if there are lead levels in the waterline. Before the testing took place, APS decided to have the entire water system flushed for three hours Sunday night.\n\nOnce the results are confirmed, APS and the EPA will have the results analyzed and review the EPA protocol to see if action needs to be taken. If there is a problem with the water, Dufay said that a short and long-term response would take place.\n\nThe short-term response would be finding spots that are severely affecting the water system and put filters into those areas best as possible.\n\nThe long-term response would to start re-piping the domestic water use system as soon as possible. Most of the money that would fund this project would be taken from the Mill Levy bill that was passed last February.\n\nAll school newspaper content is copyrighted by individual schools and protected by copyright law.

      "text": "Council strives to supply clean safe drinking water at all times, though occasionally cases of discoloured water occur.\n\nOccasionally residents may experience discoloured water, below are some details about what causes discoloured water and what to do if you experience this.\n\nDiscoloured Water has two main triggers as follows:\n\nThe most common case is that a number of residents in the summer months experience discoloured water coming through their household system, the result of manganese or iron being removed from the inside wall of pipework. Manganese or iron are trace elements which are soluble in water, but can also come out of solution and accumulate inside pipework.\n\nOccasionally after very heavy rain upstream of Bathurst, the river water quality gets so bad that the treatment plant is unable to produce water to the usual high standards of clarity. This continues until the quality of the river water improves, and the clean water makes its way through the system.\n\nWhy does it occur?\n\nBathurst has had reticulated water for over 120 years and while the system largely works very efficiently, at times discoloured water can be an issue. Discoloured water in hot weather is usually caused by Manganese which is common in many drinking water supply systems in Australia. In Bathurst, the soils in our catchments contain manganese and some iron which is very difficult to remove completely during the treatment process.\n\nOver time the manganese is deposited on the walls of pipe work where is normally stays in a biofilm unless disturbed. Consequently, it is worse where the pipe work is older.\n\nManganese can be disturbed when the flow (speed) of water in the pipe is increased. This increase can be due to a water main break, a shutdown for maintenance, a large demand on the water supply due to a fire or high water demand due to warm or hot weather.\n\nWhat can Council do?\n\nCouncil flushes water mains as a maintenance measure to reduce the incidence of discoloured water, especially during summer, however it is impossible to predict where discoloured water will occur. Also, as Council is keen to conserve water and not be wasteful, flushing is limited to essential cases. Current technology is also limited in its ability to remove the manganese from the water supply system, however improvements are constantly being made, and when a suitable solution is available, it will be used as Council is keen to minimise this problem.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nIf you encounter discoloured water during working hours you should call Bathurst Regional Council on 02 6333 6100. If the discoloured water occurs after hours call Council's emergency number 6334 2795. Council staff will normally advise to run the tap closest to the street and another tap furthermost from the street for 5 minutes only. If possible, the water should be put to good use on the lawn or garden. In many cases, this will clear the problem. The cost to the customer of this flushing is on average between 10 and 20 cents. If the water is still discoloured after this time, the same number should be called and arrangements will be made to send a crew to your street and flush the water main, and the service if necessary. Once these have been flushed you may need to run your taps individually to clear any residue.\n\nIs the water safe to drink when discoloured?\n\nCouncil carries out weekly water quality testing and whilst discoloured water may appear unpleasant, the water quality tests show discoloured water is safe to drink and is not a hazard to health.\n\nDiscoloured water does not cause stomach upsets or diarrhoea.\n\nMild or moderate cases of dirty water usually only pose aesthetic concerns and the water remains safe to drink. Examples of water safe to drink are shown in the following photos:\n\nWhat do I do if I need to wash?\n\nIf you think you might have discoloured water you should check the colour of the water before washing clothes. Do not wash until the water is clear.\n\nIt is especially important to check the colour of the water before the final rinse cycle as this is the time when clothes can be stained. Avoid using oxidising agents such as laundry bleach as these products may intensify staining where any elements present may form as solid and will stick to the clothing fibres.\n\nIf your load of washing is dirty or stained, you should keep the washing completely wet, and not hang it out.\n\nSome washing powders cause the pH level of the water in the washing machine to increase, and this has the effect of causing manganese or iron in the water to come out of solution and to stain the washing. Also, powders high in phosphorus can also have the same effect.\n\nWhen the water has cleared rewash using a good quality liquid dishwashing detergent and white vinegar as they can also help remove dirty water stains.\n\nManganese Removal\n\nCouncil is currently undertaking a trial to remove Manganese from the water which is treated at the Water Filtration Plant for town use, early results from this trial have been very positive.\n\nThe Bathurst Water Filtration Plant (WFP) treats water released from the Macquarie River for distribution to consumers in the Bathurst Region. The basic filtration processes at the WFP comprise of the addition of alum and polymer to the raw water for coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, gravity sand filtration, chlorination disinfection, pH control and fluoridation.\n\nPowdered activated carbon (PAC) is also dosed to the raw water periodically for taste, odour and toxin removal due to the presence of algae in the raw water. Potassium permanganate is also pre-dosed to the raw water for the oxidation of manganese. Manganese is a compound naturally occurring in river water; it does not create any public health concerns but is unsightly as the colouring will often turn the filtered water to varying shades of black. The soil in the catchments above the Bathurst Water Filtration Plant is naturally rich in manganese.\n\nThe WFP was designed to consistently produce water which complies with the current Australian Drinking Water Guidelines. However, due to limitations with the plant design (in that not enough contact time can be provided), the existing potassium permanganate dosing plant cannot cope with the manganese problem associated with the feed water. Councils' objective is to determine an alternative method of removing the manganese from the raw water.\n\nIn June 2011, Council requested NSW Public Works to undertake specific investigations on Council's behalf into potential Manganese removal methods which had been successful in other areas where the feed water was similar to that in Bathurst. The result was that NSW Public Works prepared a proposal for Council which covered a three stage trial. Stage 1 of the trial has been completed.\n\nStage 1 of the pilot plant trial has involved the construction of a replica filter which functions in the same way as the 14 filters operational at the WFP. The replica filter is being used to dose chemicals to determine the most effective method of oxidising the manganese in the raw water. Different parameters such as water temperature, PH levels, turbidity and residual chlorine levels have been included to ensure that the test dosing takes into consideration the changing attributes of the feed or raw water.\n\nEarly results have been very positive and indicate that a high level of manganese removal will be possible by dosing sodium hypochlorite to the settled water prior to filtration."

Plastic bottles and caps contain chemicals called phthalates, which are known to disrupt testosterone and other hormones, and can leach into bottled water over time. Although there are regulatory standards limiting phthalates in tap water, there are no legal limits for phthalates in bottled water — the bottled water industry waged a successful campaign opposing the FDA proposal to set a legal limit for these chemicals.\n\nBefore rushing off to buy expensive bottled water, check your community's tap water safety status.

He said that while there's not enough lead in water to be a problem …\n\n\"When it comes to lead, it's always better to be safe than sorry because according to the U.S. CDC, according to the U.S. EPA, there really is no level of lead that's safe in children,\" Dr. Rosen said.\n\nThe potential for lead in the water increases in buildings and homes built before 1987, because lead solder was used to seal pipe joints. And for buildings put up before 1961, there's an even greater concern — because the pipelines that brought water to those homes were made entirely of lead.\n\nThe city monitors water in older buildings through regular testing as part of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. In this year's tests, conducted from June to September, 14 percent – or 30 out of 222 tested buildings – showed lead levels higher than the accepted benchmark.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requires local utilities to take action if 10 percent or more of tested buildings have lead levels of more than 15 parts per billion.\n\nToo much lead can damage the brain, kidneys, nervous system and red blood cells.\n\nThe city said drinking water is rarely the cause of lead poisoning but can contribute to a person's overall exposure.\n\nThe guidelines say a tap needs to be run if the water in that faucet has not been used for six hours or longer.\n\nThe last time the city's water triggered such a response was in 2005, the DEP said.\n\nIn the past decade, other cities have similarly exceeded the EPA benchmark, including Boston, Washington and Portland, Ore.\n\nLead shouldn't be a problem, the entire federal complex in DC has had leaded water for decades and they're just fine..\n\nBubba\n\nI always wondered why new yorkers kept electing liberals when liberals make their lives a living hell. Now I have the answer, LEAD POISONING! It is not their fault that they are brain damaged.\n\nBrenda\n\nI wouldn't trust the EPA to wash my dog much less tell me how much lead is in the pipes. They will do anything to push this White Houses's agenda. More money on infastructure, more money for a slush fund, plain and simple more money period!!!\n\nBob C\n\nJust raise the rates Mike, that will fix everything. And no salt. And no trans fats or smoking. Lead is okay, right Mike?\n\nRachel\n\nHow did lead get into our water system in the first place? Lead does not naturally occur in water. Even if we can't do anything about it, as Natalie says, are we all just supposed to be okay with drinking poison? Why hasn't any news source given us any real idea of HOW this might have happened? If these pipes have all had lead in them for 40 years, why is this all of a sudden a problem? Isn't it more likely that lead entered our water supply through, oh i don't know…fracking?!?\n\nM. Savage\n\nExplains all the mental illness in New York.\n\nYephora\n\nBut . . . but . . . but . . . \"New York has the best water in the world!\"\n\nI hope we've heard the last of that nonsense.\n\nClifton Middleton\n\nThe Water Crisis, A Practical Solution\n\nThe Water crisis is the most serious problem humanity has ever faced. Water pollution has infused the entire food chain with neurotoxins, poisons and pharmaceuticals, all of which damage the health and survivability of man and planet. The cause is our modern, water based sewer system. We flush all of our disposables down the drain, into the sewer system where more chemicals are added and then finally pumped back into our water system. Water based sewer systems are the prime polluters and our use of them has proved to be full of unintended and unanticipated horrors. The use of water based sewer system wastes and contaminates the entire water supply with pollutants and nutrients that if captured and recycled, could provide sufficient agricultural nutrients to ensure a sustainable food supply.\n\nOne practical solution to the water shortage is to replace our centralized water based sewer system with on site, waterless toilets and recycle grey water. Grey water is the water from the kitchen and shower and can be recycled, on site and reused for landscaping. This will reduce our demand on the water source by 80 percent while simultaneously creating a sustainable, renewable, agricultural resource, namely, organic nitrogen.\nNo Mix toilets collect urine and feces in separate places, the toilet bowl has two drains, one, in the front for the urine and one in the back for the feces. The feces are dry composted and the urine is processed for agricultural purposes. Separating toilets protect the water supply and provide a renewable, safe, low cost source of nitrogen, enough to greatly reduce our dependence on foreign natural gas and oil. The important key is to separate the valuable, nitrogen rich urine, human urine is 18% organic nitrogen, at the source, before it is mixed with feces and before it is flushed into the water supply.\n\nThe economic potential of capturing human urine is stunning. Human urine is 18% organic nitrogen and has been used in agriculture for thousands of years. Sweden, Germany, Holland and many other countries have been using and processing human urine for agricultural purposes and to protect the environment from water based sewer systems. Human urine is the only renewable, sustainable and economically feasible source of nitrogen available to humanity and it is free.\n\nWhat is the economic value of human urine? Here is how it works, the value of comparative petroleum derived fertilizer with the same 18% nitrogen content is approximately $10.00 a gallon and requires a massive polluting industry that is not renewable. The average person produces 2 liters of urine a day or roughly $5.00 worth of organic nitrogen. A city like Miami flushes down the drain 10 to 20 million dollars worth of nitrogen a day and spends another fortune to do it. Integrated Recycling is the future of our economy and could replace taxation in funding community services. The cities will become fertilizer factories and urban and suburban farming and food production could provide a sustainable, local food supply. Schools and churches could be nurseries and local gardening centers, hubs of city and urban agriculture and recycling. This could be a sustainable, local system that is a renewable doable foundation for local economies. Local food production is the basis of all economies and the missing component in modern cities.\n\nThis kind of integrated recycling is highly profitable and turns three life threatening problems, water shortage, water pollution and imported oil into one sustainable, environmentally positive and economically beneficial solution.\nWater based sewer systems unnecessarily wastes and pollutes our most valuable resource, clean water. There is only one water supply for the entire earth. We share this single resource with 6.5 billion other humans and with all living organisms. Water should be regarded as our most important natural resource and shared birthright. Water is the first thing mankind must agree to share according to the highest collective principle. Water is the tie that binds us together, for better or for worse.\nWater is the blood of the earth and a true sacrament, something we all share, something that is absolutely necessary for life. We should not pollute the water supply with chemicals, insecticides or human disposables that can and should be recycled to insure a healthy and sustainable future.\n\nModern, water based sewer systems could be the worst idea mankind has ever adopted. Common sense informs us not to defecate in the drinking water but that is exactly what we currently do in every city of the land. We do it without thinking. That is the problem. We are not thinking right. It is possible, conceivable, that the water crisis could be THE reason people begin to think of ourselves as truly united with everyone else on the planet, known and unknown, united in our fears, hopes and desires. 6.5 billion Separate destinies have become one destiny for us all …\n\nmatt\n\ntrying to squeeze more money out of people as they reduce consumption because they have reduced/lost wages.

All across the country we have disgusting tap water. How awful.\n\nBetween lead and all the other pollutants that expectant moms and young kids are exposed to in water and in the general food and drink supply, I'm sadly not surprised at the rise in autism (not to mention cancer).\n\nAll these kids weren't being born with it 20 years ago, and don't give me that \"new kinds of diagnoses\" business either. There is some kind of environmental factor causing this.\n\nHarry Potash\n\nI hate to be rude, but that is the most sorry excuse for four ledes that attempt to get me to read a non-story.\n\nsezme\n\nPb will do it everytime! now we know the root of your insanity!\n\ngh\n\nWell, that explains it. Lead poisoning is known to call all sorts of mental problems; like generally going nuts.

So those og us who are trying to conserve to keep our costs down are now being told we have to 'let it run' to avoid becoming ill. This is just another scare tactic to squeeze more money from us."

      "text": "The Dentist's Chair: Fluoridated water a benefit to society\n\nDear Dr. Reitz: The Reading Environmental Advisory Council is talking about the fluoride in the city's water supply. Member Andrew Molteni said some studies have shown that fluoride lowers IQ and can promote certain types of cancer. Molteni said people are entitled to pure water and can choose if they want to add anything to it. What's your opinion concerning fluoridated water? - Mike, Reading\n\nDear Mike: This is a hot-button topic because in America we prize freedom of choice. The idea of government mandating anything, such as fluoride in our drinking water, makes some people angry. But living in a free society doesn't mean there aren't times the public good outweighs personal individual freedoms.\n\nThe vaccination for children against potentially serious illnesses like measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) is required in most states for children to enter school. There are rare cases of children that react negatively to the vaccine, but overall the risk is greatly outweighed by the benefit.\n\nAs a dentist, I see the devastation caused by tooth decay - painful toothaches, missed days of school and facial infections. A few years ago in Maryland, a 12-year-old boy died after complications from an untreated dental infection.\n\nTooth decay occurs when susceptible teeth are exposed to acid secreted by oral bacteria. There is indisputable evidence that when fluoride is available for teeth during formation, the teeth are more resistant to acid and less likely to decay. If you add chromium to steel it becomes stainless steel, a product resistant to rusting. When fluoride is incorporated into the tooth's enamel it makes the tooth more resistant to oral acids.\n\nFluoride applied directly on the teeth by a dentist is more effective than obtaining fluoride from drinking water. In a perfect world, every parent would take his or her children for a dental visit twice a year for a cleaning and fluoride application. In reality, many children never visit a dentist and, unless there is fluoride in the water, they are more likely to suffer from a lifetime of tooth decay and dental problems.\n\nWhen water fluoridation was first introduced into public water, a group of people against the concept said it was a Communist plot to poison Americans. With the fall of the USSR, it now appears the same people are using cancer and a lower IQ to scare people into removing fluoride from the water"

      "text": "In the middle of the Pacific Ocean, a giant pile of garbage is growing.\n\nRelated Content\n\nIn the middle of the Pacific Ocean, a giant pile of garbage is growing. Called the North Pacific Gyre by oceanic scientists, it is made up almost entirely of floating plastic. Bags, bottles, pellets, wrappers; whatever the form, as long as it floats, the Pacific's plastic ends up there, to the dismay of environmentalists and scientists alike.\n\nSince the first mass-produced plastic, Bakelite, took hold of the products in our daily lives, the importance of plastics has grown immeasurably. And the North Pacific Gyre tells the story of where that growth is leading us.\n\nFrom the story of plastic in water, we come to a story of water in plastic. The plastic water bottle craze has made water a companion to bottled juices and soft drinks, arguably encouraging its consumption. This has created demand for water filtration products that can provide a great profit add- on for kitchen designers who cater to health-conscious – and environmentally conscious – consumers.\n\nAndy Butler, CEO of San Francisco-based water filtration products company Zuvo, says, \"Increasingly, the American public is becoming aware of both the high cost of bottled water and the highly negative impact of plastic bottle waste on the environment.\"\n\nBut the hidden cost of plastic bottles, apart from the environmental impact, is the bad rap that tap water has gotten as a result.\n\nButler says: \"Consumers are getting a clearer picture of the facts: that bottled water can cost up to 2,000 times more than tap water, while there's no demonstrable evidence that it's safer or of higher quality than tap water.\"\n\nMatters of Taste\n\nIn the category of \"value-adds you can feel good about specifying\" comes the latest in water filtration products. Aesthetic reasons such as taste keep many people \"on the bottle\" and away from the tap.\n\nThe bottom line is that water shouldn't taste like anything. If it tastes like something, that means there is something to taste. Chlorine, pesticides, rust from aging pipes: the smells and tastes of some local water supplies can be unappetizing.\n\nBeyond that, however, is the potential health risk from years of exposure to whatever might be floating through the pipes and into your tap.\n\nJoe Hutko, marketing manager for Everpure, maker of undercounter filtration systems, says his company's stand is that water is a critical component to a healthy lifestyle. \"We're finding the choice for filtration is very often made as the result of a concern for lead reduction and elimination of chlorine taste and odor.\"\n\n\"We recognize that, for many consumers, drinking straight tap water is an undesirable option,\" says Butler. According to Butler, Zuvo's Purator unit eliminates foul odors and tastes through the application of ultraviolet rays, the same technology employed by bottled water companies to \"match their drinking water needs with their health concerns, budgets and concern for the environment.\"\n\nThe Big Picture\n\nConsumers are more educated about the resource management issues surrounding the production of water bottled in plastic. Hutko notes consumers are also far more educated about pollutants their tap water might be subjecting them to.\n\n\"Not surprisingly, our research is indicating that virus, bacteria and pharmaceuticals are contaminants that are most commonly concerning homeowners at this time. We have also found that consumers are choosing water filtration for lead reduction and elimination of chlorine taste and odors,\" he notes.\n\nSo what does Hutko think homeowners should be concerned about? \"It can only be assessed on an individual household basis,\" he comments.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a database of dozens of contaminants present, in amounts that vary by state, city and town, in the national water supply. Called \"Surf Your Watershed,\" the program allows users to search their local water supply and find out when the water in their area was last tested, what was found, and at what level. Armed with that information, you can direct your clients to a filtration system that will be appropriate for their area."

The truth is, there are some little known facts\nthat can help you get over the hump, and transfer your status from renter to\nhomeowner. With this information, you will begin to see how you really can.\n\nYour appliances are designed to run on the normal 120 volts AC supply, with\nsome tolerance for more or less, but they can be damaged, or their controls can\nbe upset by surges. The result is then frustration and repair bills, and even a\nfire in rare cases. Learn how you can prevent this from happening to you.\n\nIs the Water You Drink Safe?What contaminants may be found in drinking water?\n\nThere is no such thing as naturally pure water. In nature, all water contains some impurities. As water flows in streams, sits in lakes, and filters through layers of soil and rock in the ground, it dissolves or absorbs the substances that it touches. Some of these substances are harmless. In fact, some people prefer mineral water precisely because minerals give it an appealing taste. However, at certain levels minerals, just like man-made chemicals, are considered contaminants that can make water unpalatable or even unsafe.\nSome contaminants come from erosion of natural rock formations. Other contaminants are substances discharged from factories, applied to farmlands, or used by consumers in their homes and yards. Sources of contaminants might be in your\nneighborhood or might be many miles away. Your local water quality report tells which contaminants are in your drinking water, the levels at which they were found, and the actual or likely source of each contaminant.\nSome ground water systems have established wellhead protection programs to prevent substances from contaminating their wells. Similarly, some surface water systems protect the watershed around their reservoir to prevent contamination.\n\nWhere does drinking water come from?\n\nA clean, constant supply of drinking water is essential to every community. People in large cities frequently drink water that comes from surface water sources, such as lakes, rivers, and reservoirs. Sometimes these sources are close to the community. Other times, drinking water suppliers get their water from sources many miles away. In either case, when you think about where your drinking water comes from, it's important to consider not just the part of the river or lake that you can see, but the entire watershed. The watershed is the land area over which water flows into the river, lake, or reservoir.\nIn rural areas, people are more likely to drink ground water that was pumped from a well. These wells tap into aquifers--the natural reservoirs under the earth's surface--that may be only a few miles wide, or may span the borders of many regions. As with surface water, it is important to remember that activities many miles away from you may affect the quality of ground water.\n\nHow is drinking water treated?\n\nWhen a water supplier takes untreated water from a river or reservoir, the water often contains dirt and tiny pieces of leaves and other organic matter, as well as trace amounts of certain contaminants. When it gets to the treatment plant, water suppliers often add chemicals called coagulants to the water. These act on the water as it flows very slowly through tanks so that the dirt and other contaminants form clumps that settle to the bottom. Usually, this water then flows through a filter for removal of the smallest contaminants like viruses and Giardia.\nGround water is naturally filtered as it passes through layers of the earth into underground reservoirs known as aquifers. Water that suppliers pump from wells generally contains less organic material than surface water and may not need to go through any or all of the treatments described in the previous paragraph. The quality of the water will depend on local conditions.\nThe most common drinking water treatment, considered by many to be one of the most important scientific advances of the 20th century, is disinfection. Most water suppliers add chlorine or another disinfectant to kill bacteria and other germs.\nWater suppliers use other treatments as needed, according to the quality of their source water. For example, systems whose water is contaminated with organic chemicals can treat their water with activated carbon, which absorbs or attracts the chemicals dissolved in the water.\n\nWhat are the health effects\nof contaminants in drinking water?\n\nThe contaminants fall into two groups according to the health effects that they cause. Your water supplier will alert you through the media, mail, or other means if there is a potential acute or chronic health effect from compounds in the drinking water. You may want to contact the supplier for additional information specific to your area.\nAcute effects occur within hours or days of the time that a person consumes a contaminant. People can suffer acute health effects from almost any contaminant if they are exposed to extraordinarily high levels (as in the case of a spill). In drinking water, microbes, such as bacteria and viruses, are the contaminants with the greatest chance of reaching levels high enough to cause acute health effects. Most people's bodies can fight off these microbial contaminants the way they fight off germs, and these acute contaminants typically don't have permanent effects. Nonetheless, when high enough levels occur, they can make people ill, and can be dangerous or deadly for a person whose immune system is already weak due to HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy, steroid use, or another reason.\nChronic effects occur after people consume a contaminant at levels over safety standards for many years. The drinking water contaminants that can have chronic effects are chemicals (such as disinfection by-products, solvents, and pesticides), radionuclides (such as radium), and minerals (such as arsenic). Examples of the chronic effects of drinking water contaminants are cancer, liver or kidney problems, or reproductive difficulties.\n\nHow can I help protect drinking water?\n\nUsing the new information that is now available about drinking water, citizens can both be aware of the challenges of keeping drinking water safe and take an active role in protecting drinking water. There are lots of ways that individuals can get involved. Some people will help clean up the watershed that is the source of their community's water. Other people might get involved in wellhead protection activities to prevent the contamination of the ground water source that provides water to their community. These people will be able to make use of the information that local authorities and water systems are gathering as they assess their sources of water.\n\nOther people will want to attend public meetings to ensure that the community's need for safe drinking water is considered in making decisions about land use. And all consumers can do their part to conserve water and to dispose properly of household chemicals.\n\nDon't Pay Another Cent in Rent To Your Landlord\n\n\"If you're like most renters, you feel trapped\nwithin the walls of a house or apartment that doesn't feel like yours.\"\n\nIt's a dream we all have - to own our own home and stop paying rent.\nBut if you're like most renters, you feel trapped within the walls of a\nhouse or apartment that doesn't feel like yours. How could it when you're\nnot even permitted to bang in a nail or two without a hassle. You feel like\nyou're stuck in the renter's rut with no way of rising up out of it and\nowning your own home.\n\nDon't Feel Trapped Anymore\n\nIt doesn't matter how long you've been renting, or how insurmountable\nyour financial situation may seem. The truth is, there are some little known\nfacts that can help you get over the hump, and transfer your status from\nrenter to homeowner. With this information, you will begin to see how you\nreally can:\n\nsave for a down payment\n\nstop lining your landlord's pockets, and\n\nstop wasting thousands of dollars on rent.\n\n6 Little Known Facts That Can Help You Buy Your First Home\n\nThe problem that most renters face isn't your ability to meet a monthly\npayment. Goodness knows that you must meet this monthly obligation every 30\ndays already. The problem is accumulating enough capital to make a down\npayment on something more permanent.\n\nBut saving for this lump sum doesn't have to be as difficult as you might\nthink. Consider the following 6 important points:\n\n1. You can buy a home with much less down than you think\n\nThere are some local or federal government programs (such as 1st time\nbuyer programs) to help people get into the housing market. You can qualify\nas a first time buyer even if your spouse has owned a home before as long as\nyour name was not registered. Ensure your real estate agent is informed and\nknowledgeable in this important area and can offer programs to help you with\nyour options.\n\n2. You may be able to get your lender to help you with your down payment\nand closing costs\n\nEven if you do not have enough cash for a downpayment, if you are\ndebt-free, and own an asset free and clear (such as a car for example), your\nlending institution may be able to lend you the downpayment for your home\nby securing it against this asset.\n\n3. You may be able to find a seller to help you buy and finance your\nhome\n\nSome sellers may be willing to hold a second mortgage for you as a\n'seller take-back'. In this case, the seller becomes your lending\ninstitution. Instead of paying this seller a lump-sum full amount for his or\nher home, you would pay monthly mortgage installments.\n\n4. You may be able to create a cash down payment without actually going\ninto debt\n\nBy borrowing money for certain investments to a specified level, you may\nbe able to generate a significant tax refund for yourself that you can use\nas a downpayment. While the money borrowed for these investments is\ntechnically a loan, the monthly amount paid can be small, and the money\ninvested in both home and investment will be yours in the end.\n\n5. You can buy a home even if you have problems with your credit rating\n\nIf you can come up with more than the\nminimum down-payment, or can secure the loan with other equity, many lending institutions will consider you for\na mortgage. Alternatively, a seller take-back mortgage could also help you\nin this situation.\n\n6. You can, and should, get pre-approved for a home loan before you go\nlooking for a home\n\nPre-approval is easy, and can give you complete peace-of-mind when\nshopping for your home. Mortgage experts can obtain written pre-approval\nfor you at no cost and no obligation, and it can all be done quite easily\nover-the-phone. More than just a verbal approval from your lending\ninstitution, a written preapproval is as good as money in the bank. It\nentails a completed credit application, and a certificate which guarantees\nyou a mortgage to the specified level when you find the home you're looking\nfor. Consider dealing only with a professional who specializes in mortgages.\nEnlisting their services can make the difference between obtaining a\nmortgage, and being stuck in the renter's rut forever. Typically there is\nno cost or obligation to enquire.\n\nThere are many important issues you should be aware of that affect you\nas a renter. Why on earth would you continue to lose thousands by throwing\nit away on rent when with your agent you could take a few minutes to discuss\nyour specific needs so that you can stop renting and start owning.\n\nThis conversation costs you nothing. And, of course, you shouldn't\nhave to feel obligated to buy a home at the time you review this. But by\ntaking the time to explore your options, and learn about the ways you can\nafford to buy a home, think how prepared and relaxed you'll be when you are\nready to make this important step.\n\nSurges Happen! How To Protect the Appliances In Your Home\n\nThe power you get from the wall outlet is known as \"120 volts AC power.\"\nThe power companies try to keep that voltage uniform. Lightning,\nshort-circuits, poles knocked down by cars, or some other accident can make\nthe voltage jump to hundreds, even thousands of volts. This is what\nengineers call a \"surge.\" A surge will last only a few millionths of one\nsecond (the \"blink of an eye\" is thousands of times longer than the typical\nsurge). It is enough to destroy or to upset your appliances.\n\nWhat can a surge do to your appliances?\n\nYour appliances are designed to run on the normal 120 volts AC supply,\nwith some tolerance for more or less, but they can be damaged, or their\ncontrols can be upset by surges. The result is then frustration and repair\nbills, and even a fire in rare cases.\n\nDisturbances\n\nNormal - This is the voltage that we all take for granted, every second\nof the minute, every minute of the hour, every hour of the day, every day of\nthe year. But occasionally, for a short time...\n\nThe voltage falls below normal: a sag. Sags are unlikely to damage most\nappliances, but they can make a computer crash, confuse some digital clocks\nand cause VCRs to forget their settings.\n\nThe reverse of a sag is called a swell: a short duration increase in the\nline voltage. This disturbance might upset sensitive appliances, and damage\nthem if it is a very large or very long swell.\n\nNoise is a catch word sometimes used to describe very small and\npersistent disturbances. These do not have damaging effects but can be a\nnuisance.\n\nThere is, of course, the ultimate disturbance: an outage -no voltage at\nall!\n\nThese disturbances are different from surges, but they should be\nmentioned because the remedies are generally different. As we will see\nlater, some available devices can help overcome both sensitive appliances in\nyour home.\n\nYour home contains all sorts, types or kinds of appliances. These not\nonly include the traditional household helpers, but also the entertainment\nelectronics, the family's computer(s), smart telephones, control systems\n(thermostats, garage door, etc.), and all the new things to come.\n\nMore and more, traditional large appliances in your home depend on very\nsophisticated electronics for their control. This can often make them\nsensitive to surges (as well as power interruptions).\n\nTo help sort out which types of your appliances might be damaged or\nupset, you can describe them in general terms depending on their\nconnections: power, telephone, cable, or antennas. Each of these connections\noffers a path for a surge to come in, something that might be overlooked\nwhen the cause of damage is explained as a \"power surge.\"\n\nThe first type includes electronics that are connected only to the power,\nsuch as a computer with no modem, a TV set with rabbit ears, a VCR not\nconnected to cable TV, a table-top radio, a microwave oven, etc. Surge\nprotection of these is not particularly difficult, and quite often it is\nalready built-in by the manufacturer.\n\nThe second type, for which more protection might be needed, includes\nelectronics that are powered, of course, from your power receptacles but\nalso connected to an external communications system: telephone, cable TV,\nsatellite receiver. A slightly different but similar situation, which also\nneeds attention, is that of appliances connected to a household control\nsystem such as garage door opener, intrusion or fire alarm, automatic\nsprinklers, or intercom.\n\nWe will see later why the two kinds of appliances face different risks of\nbeing damaged and consequently might require different protection methods.\n\nWhere do surges come from?\n\nThere are two origins for the surges that occur in your power system:\nlightning surges and switching surges.\n\nLightning surges, occur when a lightning bolt strikes between a cloud and\nobjects on earth. The effect can be direct --injection of the lightning\ncurrent into the object, or indirect --inducing a voltage into electrical\ncircuits.\n\nWe will look at ways of protecting your appliances against lightning\nsurges that come by way of the wires -power, telephone, cable, etc.\nProtection of the house against the direct effects of lightning is done by\nproperly grounded lightning rods. Note also that lightning rods are intended\nto protect the structure of the house and avoid fires. They do not prevent\nsurges from happening in the wiring.\n\nDirect lightning effects are limited to the object being struck and its\nsurroundings, so that the occurrence is considered rare but it is nearly\nalways deadly for persons or for trees. Well-protected electrical systems\ncan survive a direct strike, perhaps with some momentary disturbances from\nwhich they recover (blinking lights and computers restarting during a\nlightning storm). The key word, of course, is \"well-protected\" and this\ninformation will help ensure your home has a well- protected electrical\nsystem.\n\nIndirect lightning effects are less dramatic than from a direct strike,\nbut they reach further out, either by radiating around the strike, or by\npropagating along power lines, telephone system and cable TV. From the point\nof view of the home dweller, unwanted opening of the garage door, or a surge\ncoming from the power company during a lightning storm, would be seen as\nindirect effects.\n\nSwitching surges occur when electrical loads are turned on or off within\nyour home, as well as by the normal operations of the power company. An\nanalogy often given is the \"water hammer\" that can occur in your piping if a\nfaucet is turned off too quickly: the electric current flowing in the wires\ntries to flow for a short time after the switch has been opened, producing a\nsurge in the wiring, just like the surge of pressure in the piping.\n\nHow often, how far, how severe?\n\nSo, surges can and do happen!\n\nThese questions -how often do surges occur, how far do they travel before\nhitting your appliances, how severe are they - must be answered, as well as\npossible, so that you can proceed to the next step of taking calculated\nrisks or making a reasonable investment by purchasing some additional\nprotection. There are several ways of getting surge protection, from the\nsimple purchase of a plug-in device from an electronic store, to the\ninstallation of protective devices for the whole house, to be done by an\nelectrician or the power company.\n\nHow often?\n\nYou are probably best placed to answer that question if you have lived in\nyour neighborhood for several years. Lightning is random but can strike more\nthan one time at the same place. There are now sophisticated means to record\nthe occurrence of individual lightning strikes; electric utilities and\nbusinesses seek the data to make decisions on the risks and needs for\ninvesting in protection schemes. The reason for mentioning \"several years in\nyour neighborhood\" is that the frequency of lightning strikes varies over\nthe years and the section of the country where you live.\n\nHow far, how severe?\n\nThe answers to these two questions are linked: a nearby lightning strike\nhas more severe consequences than an equal strike occurring farther away.\nThere is also a wide range in the severity of the strike itself, with the\nvery severe or very mild being rare, the majority being in mid-range (a\ncurrent of about 20,000 amperes for a short time) -but still much shorter\nthan the blink of an eye.\n\nCalculated risk or insurance?\n\nThe trade off:\n\nA large stack of dollar bills and some change to replace your unprotected\ncomputer, if and when a lightning or some other surge destroyed it ...\n\n... or use a small number of bills to purchase a \"surge protector\" for\npeace of mind and effective protection.\n\nIf you look at it from that point of view, the choice is probably easy\nand, most likely, you will be looking for one of those \"surge protectors\"\n-or some device with a similar name to do the same job, as explained next.\n\nWhat's in a name?\n\nWhen you walk in the computer store or electronic supply store, you might\nask for something to protect your appliances against surges, but what to\ncall it ? The devices that can protect against surges are called\n\"surge-protective devices\" by engineers, but that sounds too much like\njargon to some people.\n\nOne name that seems to stick is \"surge suppressor\" with a variety of\ntrademark names. The Underwriter's Laboratories chose to call them\n\"Transient Voltage Surge Suppressor\" and you might find that name or the\nTVSS acronym next to the listing on the product. Always make sure that the\nproduct has been tested by a product safety testing organization, such as\nUL, ETL, or CSA, as indicated by their labels.\n\nYou cannot really suppress a surge altogether, nor \"arrest\" it (although\nyour utility uses devices they call \"surge arresters\" to protect their\nsystems). What these protective devices do is neither suppress nor arrest a\nsurge, but simply divert it to ground, where it can do no harm.\n\nDecisions, decisions\n\nSurge protectors come in many shapes and forms for many purposes, not\njust the plug-in kind that you find in the electronic stores. There are\nseveral ways to install them on your power supply: plug and play,\ndo-it-yourself, hire a licensed electrician to do it, or even call on your\npower company to do it. Here is a run down on your options, and who does it:\n\nPurchase one or more plug-in surge protectors\n\nInstall a surge protector at the service entrance panel\n\nHave the power company install a surge protector next to the meter\n\nPlug-in surge protectors\n\nThis is the easiest solution, and there are a wide variety of brands\navailable in the stores. These come in two forms: a box that plugs directly\ninto a wall receptacle, or a strip with a power cord and multiple outlets.\nDepending on the appliance, you will look for a simple AC power plug-in, or\na more complex combined protector for AC power and telephone or cable.\nHowever, before you purchase the right protector for the job, you should\nthink about some details.\n\nThere is another decision to make, concerning how a surge protector will\npower your appliance if the protective element should fail under extreme\ncases of exposure to a large surge or large swell. Most surge protectors are\nprovided internally with some kind of fuse that will disconnect in case of\nfailure. However, this disconnect can operate in two different ways,\ndepending on the design of the surge protector: some will completely cut off\nthe output power, others will disconnect the failed element but maintain the\npower output.\n\nQuit and be protected or continue?\n\nFor you, it is a matter of choice: would you want to maintain the output\npower to your appliance -but with no more surge protection? Or would you\nrather maintain protection for sure -by having the circuit of the protector\ncut off the power supply to your appliance, if the protective function were\nto fail? To make an intelligent decision, you must know which of the two\npossibilities are designed into the surge protector that you will be looking\nfor.\n\nWhat are the lights telling you?\n\nTo help the consumer know what is going on inside the surge protector,\nmany manufacturers provide some form of indication, generally by one or more\npilot lights on the device. Unfortunately, these indications are not\nstandardized, and the meaning might be confusing, between one, two - even\nthree or four lights -where it is not always clear what their color means.\nRead the instructions!\n\nMore decisions ...\n\nSo far, we have looked mostly at the plug-in surge protectors because\nthey are the easiest to install and they do not require the services of an\nelectrician. The two other possible locations for surge protectors are the\nservice panel (breaker panel) and the meter socket.\n\nService-panel surge protectors\n\nInstead of using several plug in protectors -one for each sensitive\nappliance is sometimes recommended -you can install a protector at the\nservice panel of the house (also called \"service entrance\" or \"breaker\nbox\"). The idea is that with one device, all appliances in the house can be\nprotected, perhaps with a few plug-in protectors next to the most sensitive\nappliances. There are two types of devices available: incorporated in the\npanel, or outside the panel.\n\nSome breaker panel manufacturers also offer a snap in surge protector,\ntaking the space of two breakers (assuming that there are blank spaces\navailable on the panel), and easily installed by the home owner or by an\nelectrician. However, there are two limitations or conditions to that\napproach:\n\nThe snap in protectors generally fit only in a breaker panel from the\nsame manufacturer -possibly down to the model or vintage of the panel.\n\nTo install the snap in protector, you must remove the front panel (do\nturn off the main breaker before you do that). Most cities have codes\nallowing the home owner to do it, under some conditions. Check with your\nlocal authorities to find out if they allow you to do that, or hire a\nlicensed electrician to do the installation for you. There are other surge\nprotectors packaged for wiring into the service panel, either within or next\nto the panel. That kind of installation is best left to a licensed\nelectrician.\n\nAt the meter socket\n\nThere might be a possibility that the power company in your area offers,\nas an option, to install a surge protector with a special adapter, fitting\nit between the meter and its socket (the dark band in the bubble of the\npicture). But that type of device and installation is out of the question as\na do-it-yourself project, and will require cooperation from the power\ncompany, if they do offer the program.\n\nOther types of outdoor surge protectors can be installed near the meter.\nThat kind of installation must be done by a licensed electrician.\n\nCheck list\n\nBefore you decide which way you want to protect your appliances, there\nare other points to consider.\n\nWhere do you live?\n\nThis is an important question because the type of dwelling has some\neffect on how severe your surge problem might be. In a somewhat simplified\nway, consider three categories according to the arrangement of the\nutilities:\n\nDetached house with power and telephone and/or cable TV drops at\nopposite ends of the house -the worst possible arrangement of all. But do\nnot fret, there is a way of compensating, even after the fact, for this\nunfortunate situation, as we will see.\n\nDetached house with all services (power, cable TV, phone) entering on\nthe same side of the house.\n\nTownhouse or apartment building with services entering the building at\none point and fanned out to the different dwellings - about the same as\nthe case of the detached house with all services on the same side.\n\nWhat appliances are you using?\n\nFrom the surge protection point of view, there are four kinds of\nappliances, with examples listed below by order of increasing sensitivity to\nsurges, either because of their nature or because of their exposure:\n\nLet's then take a quick look at each of these and see which might need\nsome form of surge protection.\n\nMotor-driven appliances and heating appliances\n\nFor each of these two categories, there can be two or more kinds,\ndepending on the type of control used.\n\nMechanical control (ON-OFF switch, rotary control, etc.), no\nsophisticated key pad or other electronic control\n\nElectronic control (programmable operation, key pad, display, etc.)\n\nAppliances with mechanical controls are generally insensitive to surges\nand can be expected to withstand the typical surges that occur in a\nresidence. Extreme cases, such as a direct lightning strike to the building,\nor one to the utility, very close, might cause damage.\n\nAppliances with electronic controls can be more susceptible to damage\nthan those with mechanical controls. Less traumatic but annoying can be\nupset memory in programmable appliances, although progress is being made in\nproviding more built in protection.\n\nAnother difference to be noted is that of appliances permanently\nconnected, as opposed to those in intermittent use. The risk of a damaging\nsurge happening at the time of intermittent use is much smaller than that of\nan appliance which is on all the time.\n\nWhat kind of appliances?\n\nElectronic appliances\n\nPower companies sometimes include as bill stuffers the suggestion to\ndisconnect your appliances when a severe lightning storm is approaching. But\nthat is no help if you are not in the house at that time. If, on the other\nhand, you are in the house, pulling out the power cord of an appliance that\nremains connected to a telephone line or cable TV might not be the best\nidea: you would lose the grounding of the appliance normally done by the\npower cord - possibly a safety problem should a surge come upon the\ntelephone or cable TV.\n\nThis information should help you make the choices that fit your needs for\nsurge protection. To make the right choice, it is useful to note that there\nare two types of electronic appliances. For each of these types, a different\ntype of surge protector might be needed. These types include:\n\nSimple, one link connection to power the system\n\nDual connection to both power and communications\n\nOne-link connections\n\nExamples of one-link connection of powered electronic appliances include\na TV set with \"rabbit ears\" antenna, a portable radio receiver, a computer\nwith no modem connection or remote printer, a compact fluorescent lamp, etc.\nIn the category of one-link connection we also find an old-fashioned\ntelephone connected only to the telephone system.\n\nNote that most of these have a two prong plug, which is their sole\nconnection to the power system. For the TV set, a simple\" AC plug in surge\nprotector on the power cord would be sufficient. For just the Clamp, the\ncost of a surge protector \" would be greater than the cost of simply\nreplacing the lamp, if damaged by a surge -and therefore not be justified.\n\nTwo-link connections\n\nThis type of appliance is another matter. Typical of these would be a\ncomputer with a modem, a video system with cable or satellite link, a phone\nsystem directly powered from a receptacle (those with a large adapter plug\nand a thin cable with jack which goes to the appliance generally have\nsufficient internal isolation against surges).\n\nThe surge problem with this type of appliance is that a surge coming in\nfrom one of the two systems -power or communications -can damage the\nappliance, because of a difference in the voltage between the two systems\nwhen the surge occurs. This can happen even when there are surge protectors\non each of the systems. Fortunately, you can find a special type of surge\nprotector against the problem, as described next.\n\nEqualizing differences\n\nA simple solution to the problem of voltage differences for two-link\nappliances is to install a special surge protector that incorporates, in the\nsame package, a combination of input/output connections for the two systems.\nEach link, power and communications, is fed through the protector which is\nthen inserted between the wall receptacles and the input of the appliance to\nbe protected. This type of surge protector is readily available in computer\nand electronics stores, and the electrical section of home building stores.\n\nIn addition to words on the package, it can be recognized by the presence\nof either a pair of telephone jacks or video coax connectors in addition to\nthe power receptacles. Some models might have all three in the same package.\nDo note a few words of caution: (1) Read carefully the instructions or\nmarkings to find which is \"in\" and which is \"out\" for the telephone wires.\nIt is important to note, before you buy the product, whether your wall\nreceptacles are wired for three-prong power cords. Some of these combined\nprotectors might not work very well if plugged into a 2-blade receptacle,\nusing a \"cheater\" plug. (On some, an indicating light will signal that.)\n\nNot just power-line surges\n\nAmong other disturbances on the power lines, there was a brief mention of\nsags and outages. You are certainly and unhappily well- acquainted with\noutages that can occur for any number of reasons beyond the control of your\nutility. Sags -a brief decrease of the line voltage -can be more subtle and\ndo occur more often than the complete outage. You will notice these when the\nlights dim momentarily, digital clocks or VCR controls blink, or your\ncomputer shuts down then reboots -possibly losing some data.\n\nIndustrial and commercial users, health-care facilities and other\ncritical systems have for many years used a device called \"uninterruptible\npower supply\" (UPS) that provides continuous power across a sag, or for the\nfirst portion of an extended outage (an independent local power generator\nset can then kick in).\n\nThe aggravation of consumers caused by sags and outages has created a\nmass market for consumer applications, making them affordable when looked at\nas protection against these annoying (but not damaging) disturbances -and\nwith built in surge protection as a bonus in many cases. These consumer type UPSs have a small battery which is sufficient to ride through any sag and\nshort outages. Some models even include the software to make a computer shut\ndown in an orderly sequence in case of a long outage.\n\nSurges in other systems\n\nSo far, we have looked at surges on the power line alone, or on a\ncombination of power and communications lines. Surges of a slightly\ndifferent kind can also happen in parts of other electrical systems that do\nnot directly involve a power line. Examples of these are: the antenna for a\nremote garage door opener, the sensor wiring for an intrusion alarm system,\nthe video signal part of a satellite dish receiver. Surges in these systems\nare caused by nearby lightning strikes.\n\nThese other systems just mentioned have not been the subject of standards\non surge protection as much as power and telephone systems. Furthermore,\nprotective devices for these other systems are not as readily available to\nconsumers. It is more difficult to offer well-defined guidance on surge\nprotection for these systems. Applying preventive surge protection schemes\nto an existing system might be difficult when the sensitivity of such a\nsystem to surges is not known. When considering installation of a new\nsystem, it would be a good idea to ask specific questions on that subject\nbefore signing the contract.\n\nProtection for other systems\n\nSome codes or practices aimed at providing safety for persons, when they\nare correctly applied, can also provide some equipment protection.\n\nFor instance, the general practice of telephone companies is to provide a\nsurge protector as part of their services at the point where the telephone\nline enters the house (in dense urban environments, the National Electrical\nCode allows an exception). This protector is known as the \"Network Interface\nDevice\" (NID) and you will find it on the outside of your house.\n\nAnother example of code requirement is that of cable TV systems for which\nthe National Electrical Code requires proper safety-oriented grounding\npractices. The problem, however, is that in some cases, the video equipment\ncan still be damaged by voltage differences.\n\nWith the increasing popularity of small-dish satellite receivers,\ninstallation by the user as do-it-yourself has also increased. Typical\ninstructions for installation show how to make the connections, for instance\nin the figure at right. What the figure does not show is the need to provide\na combined protector for power, telephone, and cable.\n\nA well pump installed outside the house presents a double challenge:\nprotection the pump motor itself against surges, and protection the house\nwiring against surges that might enter the house by the line that powers the\npump. The first protection is generally built-in for modern submersible\npumps. The second protection should be provided by surge protector installed\nat the point where the power line to the pump leaves the house, using\nprotectors similar to those applied at the power line service entrance.\n\nIntruder alarm systems using wires between sensors and their central\ncontrol unit can be disturbed -and damaged in severe cases -by lightning\nstriking close to the house. The wires necessary for this type of\ninstallation extend to all points of the house and act as an antenna system\nthat collects energy from the field generated by the lightning strike, and\nprotection should be included in the design of the system, rather than added\nlater by the owner. Wireless systems are less sensitive than wired systems"

      "text": "What's lurking in the water?\n\nDrinking water contamination is not just a problem for the developing world ­– developed countries increasingly face water contamination problems. To tackle all water contamination issues time is of the essence, here Bret Barnhizer discusses moving live-threat water quality testing times from days to hours\n\nConventional thinking is that quality drinking water is only an issue in developing countries, where women and children commonly walk miles each day to bring back water for the family. However, in 2008 the European Environmental Agency estimated 10 of 12 waterborne disease outbreaks reported in Europe were linked to the contamination of private wells. Pesticide pollution of drinking water has been identified as a problem in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK (Eureau, 2001) where it is estimated that between 5 and 10% of resources are regularly contaminated. Meanwhile in the EU15 countries, nitrate contamination is a problem commonly identified, with 29% of small wells in Belgium possessing nitrate levels in excess of 50 mg/l nitrate (OECD EPR Belgium, 1997). Additionally, in Poland 75% of the country's river water is too polluted even for industrial use and the Baltic Sea is among the most polluted in the world today. These are just a few examples of how developed countries are increasingly facing their own water problems, as water contamination from current and past industrial development and an ever-expanding population continue to strain water sources and quality.\n\nPoor water quality from chemicals, sewage or pathogenic bacteria can cause severe illnesses, such as stomach flu, skin rashes, pinkeye, respiratory infections, meningitis, and hepatitis. Of course, water treatment makes water fit for human consumption, but unfortunately treatment does nothing to protect people when they are exposed to polluted waterways and streams. As such, regular monitoring of all potential pollution sources and strategies for reducing water contamination are crucial in maintaining safe water standards for human consumption and for protecting water in the general environment.\n\nIn the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is working to establish frequent testing standards to control the levels of pollutants in drinking water, ground water and waterways. The urgency of the water pollution problem was recently discussed by the Natural Resources Defence Council (NRDC), in its latest Testing the Waters annual report. The NRDC found that the number of beach closings and advisories in 2010 soared to its second-highest level in the last 20 years, and had increased 29% over 2009. NRDC also found that the number of beaches being monitored declined in 2010, resulting in an increase in undetected water pollution that puts swimmers and local economies at risk. To prevent or reduce these water-spread diseases, experts recommend a variety of preventative measures, the most important of which is frequent water-quality testing.\n\nThe primary limitations of traditional water testing methods include long wait times for definitive test results, and the necessity to take samples to a lab for analysis. However, considerable efforts are underway around the world to develop and implement new materials and technologies for improving the speed of getting water test results.\n\nTraditionally, water quality from source water and waterways is analysed using Petri culture methods. This tried and true approach is often the default process to test for bacterial contamination, because the culture provides a definitive result on whether the microorganisms found in a sample are living and therefore a health threat. Although highly accurate, the Petri culture method is slow in producing definitive culture results. This creates a lag time of a day or more between obtaining samples and alerting the public of a health hazard, leaving the population vulnerable to water-borne illnesses in the meantime.\n\nOver the past decade, however, attempts at speeding up this detection time from 24 hours or more to just a few hours or even a few minutes have been introduced with varying success. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method has grown in popularity due to its ability to detect pathogens in water by identifying DNA sequences. The qPCR analysis offers promising progress in water treatment, by decreasing waiting times for both bacterial and viral test results to approximately 18 hours, when overnight enrichment times are factored in. However, 18 hours is still too long to wait before alerting the public of potential water contamination. Additionally, the NRDC report notes that \"unlike traditional culture methods, qPCR cannot distinguish between genetic material from dead bacteria and genetic material from live bacteria.\" Experts believe that the concentration of live-threat bacteria is a better indicator related to human health impacts than just detecting DNA in a water sample. DNA can be detected from dead non-threatening pathogens resulting in false-positives diagnoses. As such, under a court order resulting from a suit brought by the NRDC, the EPA is working to develop a rapid testing method for monitoring source water quality by the end of 2012 that detects live-threat bacteria.\n\nThe EPA is currently working with NanoLogix, involving rapid detection and identification of live-threat bacteria and protozoa. NanoLogix' BioNanoFilter (BNF) technology is a quick on-site test to identify live-threat contamination in drinking and source water. The goal is for BNF technology to allow the target pathogen to be isolated in as little as one cell per litre of water. BNF has the potential to reduce detection time from more than 24 hours to just a few hours, depending on the pathogen being tested. Currently NanoLogix and the EPA have a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to increase recovery rates of Cryptosporidium, E. coli, and nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM), as well as to explore the process as a detection system for viruses.\n\nMore novel methods are also seeking to improve on the long wait times of qPCR and Petri culturing for water testing. Western New England College and the Massachusetts' company Physical Sciences is conducting a study funded by the U.S. Army to determine if sound waves can be used to detect water contamination. In this method, water flows through a cavity where it is exposed to an acoustic standing wave. Bacterial spores in the water are then subjected to three forces: buoyancy/gravity, the drag of the fluid as it flows along and the acoustic pressure from the standing wave. By balancing these forces to specific levels, any water borne spores of Bacillus cereus bacteria can be trapped, indicating its presence in the water sample. The technique being developed is suited for large volume testing of water sources.\n\nMeanwhile, the company Sensicore has developed a lab-on-chip micro-sensor array technology that incorporates chemical selective sensors and physical measuring devices on a single silicon chip. This panel of tests is in a handheld device called the WaterPOINT 870, and can be used to chemically profile drinking water (and/or other liquids) in approximately five minutes. Presently the device tests for substances like chlorine, calcium, ammonium and carbon dioxide, but the use of lab-on-chip technology holds promise for detecting illness-causing cells and spores.\n\nAs water resources become further strained in the coming years, both developing and developed countries are requiring new means to more rapidly gain test results from water sources. New technologies and methods hold much promise to more rapidly and accurately provide results that can help prevent millions of cases of water-borne illnesses simply by providing actionable data faster.\n\nThe Author Bret Barnhizer\nBret is CEO of NanoLogix , an Ohio biotech company\n\nPolls\n\nLaboratory News is the UKs leading scientific and laboratory equipment magazine with\nover 40 years of service to producers and consumers of all types of laboratory\nscientific equipment.

Heavy metals can have adverse health and environmental effects. Current methods of removing heavy metals from water are expensive, and some substances used in the process are toxic themselves. Previous work has shown that some plant wastes, such as coconut fibers and peanut shells, can remove these potential toxins from water. In this report, the researchers wanted to find out whether minced banana peels could also act as water purifiers.\n\nThe researchers found that minced banana peel could quickly remove lead and copper from river water as well as, or better than, many other materials. A purification apparatus made of banana peels can be used up to 11 times without losing its metal-binding properties, they note. The team adds that banana peels are very attractive as water purifiers because of their low cost and because they don't have to be chemically modified in order to work.\n\nThe authors acknowledge funding from the São Paulo Research Foundation.\n\n- American Chemical Society (2011, March 9).

The Hyperflow Microfilter remedies this backcountry torture by anchoring the feed tube to a wide sleeve that floats on the surface of the stream, lake, spring, or puddle, greatly reducing the game of grasshopper that's nearly a prerequisite with other models. It also helps keep down the silt that gets kicked up with the filters that require greater submersion. The actual filtering of the water is also handled with equally innovative ease. After positioning the red flap in the water, you pull back on the handle and the tube fills with water. Depress the pump, and filtered water flows from the mouth at the rate of three liters per minute. You can also clean the filter, repeatedly and without tools, in the field. The purifier is effective against protozoa, bacteria, and particulate, but not against viruses. We did find that the proprietary bottle adapter didn't fit some of our water bottles, but the tubes of most hydration reservoirs did fit snugly onto the filter's nozzle; otherwise, you just have to position the water bottle or bladder under the pump, which can result in some spillage. Added benefit: it's diminutive seven-inch height means you can stash it in a day pack without sacrificing too much space."

      "text": "Water for Emergency Use\n\nKnowing How Much Water Is Enough Store at least one gallon of water per person per day. Keep in mind that although this is a good estimate, everyone's needs differ depending on age, physical condition, activity, size, diet, and weather. A normally active person needs to drink at least two quarts of water per day. In hot environments twice that amount may be needed. Therefore, store more water for children, pregnant women, nursing mothers, and ill people. Additional water is needed for food preparation and hygiene. You can reduce the amount of water your body needs by decreasing activity and staying cool.\n\nChoosing a Water Container Thoroughly washed, rinsed, and sanitized plastic, glass, fiberglass, or enamel-lined metal food-grade containers are appropriate for storing water. Plastic containers such as soft drink bottles or purchased food-grade plastic drums (intended for water or food) are best.\n\nNever use a container that has held toxic (poisonous) substances. Tiny amounts of the toxic substance can remain in the pores of a plastic container, regardless of how well you clean it. Do not use plastic milk jugs because they are impossible to clean properly, the lids do not seal well, and they are usually made from biodegradable plastics that will break down over time, causing leaks and possibly allowing contaminated air to enter. Finally, do not store water in unlined steel, stainless steel, aluminum, or iron containers because undesirable substances from the containers may leach into the water.\n\nSanitizing a Water Container Before bottling any water, you will need to wash, rinse, and sanitize the container. This process should take only a few minutes. Add 1 tablespoon of common household bleach, which contains 5.25 percent sodium hypochlorite, to one gallon of water. Pour a little of the solution into the container that will store water. Cap the container and shake it up and down thoroughly. Let it stand for about a minute. Empty out the sanitizing solution. The container is now ready to store water.\n\nStoring Tap and Purchased Water Under ordinary conditions, if you receive water from a public supply and not from a private well, you do not need to treat your water before bottling it. All storage containers need to be thoroughly washed, rinsed, and sanitized before they are filled with water. (See previous section for how to sanitize a container.)\n\nBefore storing tap water from a private well, disinfect it to prevent the growth of microorganisms. Use liquid household chlorine bleach that contains 5.25 percent sodium hypochlorite and no soap. Do not use scented or \"color safe\" bleaches or bleaches with added cleaners. Some bleach containers warn, \"Not For Personal Use.\" You can disregard these warnings if the label states sodium hypochlorite is the only active ingredient and if you use only the small quantities in these instructions. Add four drops of bleach per quart of water and stir. Seal your water containers tightly and label them ('Disinfected Drinking Water').\n\nReplace the water every three to six months with new, disinfected water. Always keep commercially purchased water in its original sealed container. Generally, the shelf life is one year. Do not store larger containers, such as five-gallon jugs, for more than six months.\n\nLight can cause plastic containers to degrade, so store water in cool, dark places, away from sunlight and fluorescent lighting. Closets are good storage spaces. Store water away from items that have a scent or perfume (such as laundry soap or air fresheners) and away from gasoline, kerosene, pesticides, and other chemicals. Vapors from these chemicals can permeate the plastic and contaminate the water. To extend the shelf life of water stored in transparent containers, place the containers together in dark plastic bags to keep out the light.\n\nYou can also store water in the freezer. Being frozen keeps water at an acceptable quality for a longer time, and the presence of this ice in the freezer will help keep food from thawing in the event of a power outage. Keep in mind that when you store water by freezing it, you should not fill the container all the way because water expands as it freezes. For this reason, it is best to use a plastic container instead of a glass one.\n\nFinding Other Sources of Drinking Water If you haven't stored water for emergency use, you do have some other options. Most homes contain sources of water you might not think to use. Remember, however, that during an emergency, water from wells, cisterns, and other delivery systems may be unsafe and should be disinfected. Other home sources of water are the following:\n\nWater heater\n\nPlumbing system\n\nMelted ice cubes\n\nToilet tank (not bowl)\n\nSnow (melt; disinfect the water)\n\nTo obtain water from your water heater, turn off the power supply to the heater. For example, turn off the gas at the intake valve or turn off the electric circuit breaker or unplug the unit. If you have lost water because of a water main break, take extreme care when removing water from the heater or your house's plumbing. Open a faucet or two on an upper level of the house and drain the water from the water heater or from a faucet on a lower level. Draining water without opening the extra faucets can create a suction in the broken main and possibly draw contaminated water into the plumbing system. Opening the faucets, even if a line is not broken, will make it easier to get water from your plumbing or water heater.\n\nAs a last resort, you can use water in the reservoir tank of your toilet (not the bowl), but disinfect it first by boiling it. Do not use this water if it contains a disinfectant or bowl cleaning tablets or solutions.\n\nIf an emergency arises quickly, you can fill containers and bathtubs with water. This water can be disinfected immediately before use."

The instructions for the product say that the dose should be tripled if the presence of cryptosporidium is suspected.\n\nWhat are the warning signs that could indicate that a source of water is contaminated with cryptosporidium?\n\n1 Answer\n\nAs Cryptosporidium is passed in the faeces of animals, the more heavily the land is used by animals, the greater the risk of Cryptosporidium contamination in water sourced from that land.\n\nThis article suggests some ways (quoted below) to avoid Giardia (which has a similar lifecycle to Cryptosporidium), conversely, if you are unable to source water following these guidlines the greater risk of Cryptosporidium contamination.\n\nDrink from large streams whenever possible, preferably those entering from the side rather than those paralleling the trail.\n\nWater in fast-flowing streams is safer because any contaminants present at any location are swept downstream, being quickly displaced by presumably clean water from above.\n\nWater at higher elevations is safer, partly because of reduced human and animal presence, and partly because water flowing to lower elevations has a chance to pick up more contaminants the farther it travels.\n\nTaking water from a lake is best advised at the inlet, with the next best place at the outlet. Inlet water has a tendency to flow somewhat directly to the outlet, undergoing little mixing with the lake water as a whole.\n\nFew Giardia cysts survive harsh Sierra winters. Contamination begins essentially anew each year, so springtime water is safer than summer or fall.\n\nThe colder the water is, the more likely it is freshly melted, meaning less opportunity for contamination.\n\nBecause filtration of water through soil removes Giardia cysts, deep well water is considered safe. By implication, springs in the wilderness should be, too.\n\nOne would think that, after a heavy snow year when streams run full and long, some kind of \"flushing out\" of lakes and streams must be occurring. Conversely, it makes sense to be more cautious in dry years.\n\nAvoid water that likely could have passed through an area subject to heavy human or animal use.\n\nIf it doesn't look good—it's cloudy or has surface foam—treat it or don't drink it.\n\nthanks, that was an interesting article. One significant difference between giardia and cryptosporidium to keep in mind though is that while giardia cannot survive for a long time in cold water (less than a day in freezing water according to your source), cryptosporidium can (for over a year). Therefore, it seems that for cryptosporidium, a very cold water source is not quite as advantageous. – Big GeneralFeb 13 '12 at 21:15"

      "text": "Managing water in the home: accelerated health gains from improved water supply\n\nHeat and UV radiation\n\nOverall, the results of both microbiological and epidemiological indicate that solar disinfection of household water has the ability to appreciably improve its microbial quality and to reduce household diarrheal disease of consumers. Additional epidemiological studies to better document the extent of diarrheal disease reduction are recommended because available studies are limited to only one geographic region, Kenya, and study population, Maasai children. Apparently, additional epidemiological studies are now in progress (Mintz et al., 2001). Because of its simplicity, low cost, and the need for only beverage bottles and sunlight, solar disinfection is an appropriate technology for disinfection of household water in the developing world.\n\nThe UV radiation technology is simple to use and highly effective for inactivating microbes in drinking water, and it does not introduce chemicals or cause the production of harmful disinfection by-products in the water. While UV lamp disinfection systems have been widely used to disinfect drinking water at the community and household levels, no epidemiological studies of intervention type that document health impacts at the household level have been reported for this technology. There are no reasons to doubt the efficacy of sound UV lamp disinfection technology to adequately disinfect either household or community drinking water when properly applied. However, field studies documenting the ability of this technology to disinfect household drinking water and reduce diarrhea and other waterborne diseases are recommended. Such studies would validate the expected performance of this technology and provide further evidence that the technology is reliable and capable of being used successfully by individuals and communities. Such documentation is needed because UV lamp disinfection has some disadvantages for use as a drinking water disinfectant at the household level. It does not provide a chemical disinfectant residual to protect the water from recontamination or microbial regrowth after treatment. Particulates, turbidity and certain dissolved constituents can interfere with or reduce microbial inactivation efficiency. A reliable and affordable source of electricity is required to power the UV lamps. The UV lamps require periodic cleaning, especially for systems using submerged lamps, and they have a finite lifespan and must be periodically replaced. The technology is of moderate to high cost when used at the household level. Despite these drawback and limitations, UV irradiation with lamps is a recommended technology for disinfection of household and community water.\n\n1 Boiling or heating with fuel\n\nBoiling or heating of water with fuel has been used to disinfect household water since ancient times. It is effective in destroying all classes of waterborne pathogens (viruses, bacteria and bacterial spores, fungi and protozoans and helminth ova) and can be effectively applied to all waters, including those high in turbidity or dissolved constituents. Although some authorities recommend that water be brought to a rolling boil for to 1 to 5 minutes, the WHO GDWQ recommend bringing the water to a rolling boil as an indication that a high temperature has been achieved. These boiling requirements are likely to be well in excess of the heating conditions needed to dramatically reduce most waterborne pathogens, but observing a rolling boil assures that sufficiently high temperatures have been reached to achieve pathogen destruction.\n\nAlthough boiling is the preferred thermal treatment for contaminated water, heating to pasteurization temperatures (generally $ 60oC) for periods of minutes to tens of minutes will destroy most waterborne pathogens of concern. Even heating to as little as 55oC for several hours has been shown to dramatically reduce non-sporeforming bacterial pathogens as well as many viruses and parasites, including the waterborne protozoans Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica (Feachem et al., 1983; Sobsey and Leland, 2001). In many situations, however, it is not possible to monitor the temperature of the water with a thermometer or other temperature sensor such as a melting wax visual indicator system. Unless such temperature monitoring is possible, caution is recommended in attempting to pasteurize waters at non-boiling temperatures.\n\nIt is also recommended that the water is stored in the same container in which it has been boiled or heated, preferably one with a lid or other protected opening, in order to reduce opportunities for recontamination. It is further recommended that boiled or heat-treated water be consumed soon after it has cooled and preferably within the same day. This is because of the potential for microbial recontamination during prolonged storage. Introduction of microbes from hands, utensils and other sources is a major concern. A major disadvantage of boiling is its consumption of energy in relation to the availability, cost and sustainability of fuel. It is estimated that 1 kilogram of wood is needed to boil 1 liter of water. In areas of the world where wood, other biomass fuels or fossil fuels are in limited supply and must be purchased, the costs of boiling water are prohibitive. Therefore, boiling household water is unrealistic and inaccessible for many of the world's poorest people due to the scarcity and high cost of fuels and the lack of sustainability of biomass or fossil fuels in the community or region. In some areas of the world the use of wood and wood-derived fuels is also a concern because it contributes to the loss of woodlands and the accompanying ecological damage caused by deforestation. However, where affordable and sustainable sources of fuel are available without causing environmental degradation, heating household water to a rolling boil is an effective and accessible method of treatment for collected household water.\n\n2 Thermal treatment with solar radiation and solar cooking\n\nAlthough boiling with fuel may be a prohibitive option for household treatment of water, heating water, other liquids and other foods to lower temperatures using solar radiation is a more accessible, economical and technologically feasible option than heating with fuel. Treatment of water with solar radiation was practiced in ancient India more than 2000 B.C.E. The ability of solar radiation to disinfect has been recognized in modern times at least since studies at by Acra at al. (1984) at The American University of Beirut, Lebanon. Since then, it has been shown that water can be heated to temperatures of $ 55oC in transparent bottles (e.g., clear plastic beverage bottles) exposed to sunlight for several hours, especially if the bottle is painted black on one side or is lying on a dark surface that collects and radiates heat (Wegelin et al., 1994; Joyce et al., 1996). This method of treatment utilizes both the UV radiation in sunlight as well as the thermal effects of sunlight to inactivate waterborne microbes, and will be discussed in detail in the next section of this report. Alternatively, if the exterior of the vessel is completely black or similarly capable of absorbing heat (e.g., most metal containers), only thermal effects occur and temperatures can reach >60oC. At these temperatures, water and other liquids can be pasteurized because most enteric viruses, bacteria and parasites are rapidly inactivated (Ciochetti and Metcalf, 1984). Furthermore, if a dark, opaque container is more highly exposed to solar radiation using a solar reflector or solar cooker, the water temperature can reach $ 65oC, a pasteurization temperature capable of inactivating nearly all enteric pathogens within several tens of minutes to hours (Safapour and Metcalf, 1999).\n\nIn those parts of the world where solar cooking already is available and widely practiced, solar pasteurization of water, other beverages and weanling foods is a practical, accessible and affordable option for household water treatment. Low cost solar reflectors or cookers can be made from materials as simple and economical as cardboard and aluminum foil. This technology for water treatment and food preparation has been field tested in many parts of the world, including Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Vietnam and some countries in the Americas. A major limitation of solar heating is that only small volumes (# 10 liters) of water can be exposed conveniently at one time per water container and solar reflector. However, using multiple water containers and alternative solar collectors (e.g., metal roofing material), the volume of water treatable with solar heat at one time can be substantially increased. Another important limitation of solar heating is the availability of sunlight, which varies greatly with season, daily weather (meteorological) conditions and geographic location. However, in many regions of the developing world, sunlight conditions are suitable for solar heating of water and for cooking nearly all year long on full sun or part sun days (approximately 200-300 days per year). A third potential limitation of solar heating to disinfect water is the determination of water temperature. Thermometers are relatively expensive and may not be available or affordable in many regions of the developing world. However, several simple, low cost temperature indicators have been devised. One of the simplest and most effective is a reusable water pasteurization indicator (WAPI) based on the melting temperature of soybean wax. The WAPI consists of a clear plastic tube partially filled with a soybean wax that melts at about 70oC and a piece of nylon (e.g., fish) line attached on each end to stainless steel washers. The WAPI is placed in the water to be heated with the wax at the top of the tube. When the wax reaches 70oC, it melts and falls to the bottom of the tube, thereby giving a simple visual indication of when pasteurization conditions have been achieved. Similar wax indicators have been devised for other target melting temperatures, depending on the type of wax.\n\n3 Solar treatment by combined UV and thermal effects\n\nTreatment to control waterborne microbial contaminants by exposure to sunlight in clear vessels that allows the combined germicidal effects of both UV radiation and heat also has been developed, evaluated and put into field practice (Acra et al., 1984; Conroy et al., 1996; 1996; 1999; Joyce et al., 1996; McGuigugan et al., 1998; 1999; Sommer et al., 1997; Wegelin and Sommer, 1998; Wegelin et al., 1994). A number of different solar treatment systems have been described, but one of the technically simplest and most practical and economical is the SODIS system developed by scientists at the Swiss Federal Agency for Environmental Science and Technology (EAWAG) and its many collaborators and partners. The SODIS system consists of three basic steps: (1) removing solids from highly turbid (>30 NTU) water by settling or filtration, if necessary, (2) placing low turbidity (<30 NTU) water in clear plastic bottles of 1-2 liter volume (usually discarded beverage bottles and preferably painted black on one side), and (3) aerating (oxygenating) the water by vigorous shaking in contact with air, and (4) exposing the filled, aerated bottles to full sunlight for about 5 hours (or longer if only part sunlight). The water is exposed to UV radiation in sunlight, primarily UV-A and it becomes heated; both effects contribute to the inactivation of waterborne microbes. The system is suitable for treating small volumes of water (<10L), especially if the water has relatively low turbidity (<30 NTU). Clear plastic bottles are considered preferable by some workers over glass because they are lighter, less likely to break, and less costly. Bottles made of polyethylene terephthlate (PET) are preferred to those made of polyvinylchloride (PVC), other plastics and most types of glass because they are less likely to leach harmful constituents into the water. In addition, they are lightweight, relatively unbreakable, chemically stable and not likely to impart tastes and odors to the water. PET bottles require period replacement because they can be scratched and they become deformed if temperatures exceed 65oC. The use of an internal temperature sensor is encouraged as an aid to determining if a minimum target temperature of 50oC and preferably 55oC or higher is reached. The reusable sensor contains paraffin wax attached to a screw weight. When the paraffin melts, the weight drops to indicate that the target temperature has been attained.\n\nThe effects of several factors influencing microbial inactivation by solar disinfection are summarized in Table 5 below. Microbial inactivation by the SODIS system is attributed to the combined effects of UV radiation in the UV-A range (320 to 400 nm), which is somewhat germicidal, and heating to temperatures of 50-60oC, which are high enough to extensively ($ 99.9%) inactivate many enteric viruses, bacteria and parasites in about 1 hour to several hours. It has been reported that the combined exposure to UV plus heat in the SODIS process has a synergistic effect on microbial inactivation, producing greater inactivation than predicted by comparable levels of exposure to either one of the two agents alone. During the exposure period, UV dose increases to $ 100 Wh/m2 and the water temperature reaches 55oC or even higher. However, others report that even non-UV transmissible sunlight when used to heat water to 60oC in a commercial solar panel system, will inactivate enteric bacteria, spores and viruses (Rijal and Fujioka, 2001). When treated with heat and no UV or heat with UV for 2-5 hours, fecal coliforms, E. coli, enterococci, HPC bacteria and coliphage MS2 were reduced by >3 log10 and Clostridium perfringens spores were 1-2 and nearly 3 log10, respectively. Under cloudy conditions bacterial and spore reductions were much lower, they were lower with heat-no UV than with heat plus UV and temperatures did not reach 50oC. Therefore, achieving a sufficiently high temperature (preferably 55oC or higher for several hours) is an important factor for microbial inactivation by solar disinfection systems. Overall, studies have shown that various bacteria, such as fecal coliforms, E. coli and enterococci, and viruses, such as coliphage f2, rotavirus and encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus, in water bottles are reduced extensively (by several orders of magnitude) when exposed to sunlight for periods of several hours and sufficiently high temperatures are achieved.\n\nStudies also show that dissolved oxygen in the water contributes to bacterial inactivation, with much greater reductions of E. coli and enterococci after 3 hours in oxygenated water (~6 log10) than in anaerobic water (<2 and <1 log10, respectively) (Reed, 1996). In subsequent studies total and fecal coliforms were inactivated by >3 log10 in 6 and 4 hours, respectively, in aerated water and by # 1.5 log10 in anoxic water or water kept from sunlight (indoors) (Meyer and Reed, 2001). Therefore, aeration of the water by mechanical mixing or agitation is recommended before solar treatment in bottles. The combined process of oxygenation (aeration) by mixing, followed by solar radiation exposure for several hours in a clear plastic bottle is also referred to as solar photooxidative disinfection of SOLAR. Enteric bacteria inactivated by the SOLAR or SODIS process do not appear to regrow or recover their infectivity.\n\nUV exposure (UV scattering by particles and absorption by solutes and particles); microbial protection by solids-association\n\nWater Aeration (oxygenation)\n\nIncreased oxygen content of the water by agitating (shaking) for several minutes in contact with air prior to sunlight exposure\n\nExposure time\n\nWater temperature and duration of exposure to elevated temperature; cumulative UV dose. Typically several hours with full sunlig\n\nThe advantages of disadvantages of solar treatment systems are summarized in Table 6 below. Potential limitations of this and perhaps other solar disinfection systems are: the availability of suitable water containers and other needed materials, lack of sunlight for disinfection, potential difficulties in treating highly turbid water and the availability of simple methods for reducing the turbidity of water before solar treatment, lack of a residual disinfectant to protect water during handling and storage, potential user objections to the technology due to the length of time to treat the water (several hours or longer) and possible objectionable tastes and odors leached into the water from the plastic bottles. Despite these limitations, solar disinfection in clear plastic bottles is one of the most promising and extensively tested methods for disinfection of household water stored in a container.\n\nTable 6.

SODIS has been field-tested in many different parts of the world and in many countries, including South America (Colombia and Bolivia), Africa (Burkino Faso and Togo), Asia (China) and Southeast Asia (Indonesia and Thailand). It has been introduced and disseminated by both governments and NGOs and subjected to economic analysis based on actual costs (estimated at 3 US$ per year for a household of 5 people) for willingness to pay. Acceptance rates, based on willingness to continue use after its introduction as a demonstration project, is reported at to be >80%. However, when introduction was not adequately supported by community involvement activities to address educational, socio-cultural, behavioral and motivational issues, community support for continued use was lower.\n\nThe SODIS system has not been extensively tested for reduction in waterborne disease in epidemiological studies of the intervention type. However, as shown in Table 7, three reported studies found measurable reductions in diarrheal disease and cholera in Maasai (Kenyan) children drinking solar disinfected water (several hours of full sunlight) compared to children drinking undisinfected water (kept indoors) in the same plastic bottles (Conroy et al., 1996; 1999; 2001). While it is clear from these intervention studies that reductions in diarrheal disease and cholera by solar disinfection in bottles are achieved in children under 6 years of age, more studies of this type are needed. This is because it is important to determine the extent of reduction of diarrheal and other waterborne disease by this system in different geographic locations having different water quality conditions and different populations at risk. The measurement of the microbial quality of the water used by intervention and control groups also would be desirable to further document the efficacy of the solar disinfection system. While there are reliable laboratory and field data from studies documenting the inactivation of waterborne microbes by solar disinfection systems, such documentation has not been included in the epidemiological studies reported to date. Therefore, the extent of pathogen or microbial indicator reduction in waters used by those consuming the water and being monitored for diarrheal and other enteric disease is not known.\n\n6 UV irradiation with lamp systems\n\nTable 7.

This method of drinking water disinfection has received renewed interest in recent years because of its well-documented ability to extensively (>99.9%) inactivate two waterborne, chlorine-resistant protozoans, Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and Giardia lamblia cysts, at relatively low doses (<10 mJ/cm2).\n\nUV disinfection is usually accomplished with mercury arc lamps containing elemental mercury and an inert gas, such as argon, in a UV-transmitting tube, usually quartz. Traditionally, most mercury arc UV lamps have been the so-called \"low pressure\" type, because they operate at relatively low partial pressure of mercury, low overall vapor pressure (about 2 mbar), low external temperature (50-100oC) and low power. These lamps omit nearly monochromatic UV radiation at a wavelength of 254 nm, which is in the optimum range for UV energy absorption by nucleic acids (about 240-280 nm). In recent years medium pressure UV lamps that operate at much higher pressures, temperatures and power levels and emit a broad spectrum of higher UV energy between 200 and 320 nm have become commercially available. However, for UV disinfection of drinking water at the household level, the low-pressure lamps and systems are entirely adequate and even preferred to medium pressure lamps and systems. This is because they operate at lower power, lower temperature, and lower cost while being highly effective in disinfecting more than enough water for daily household use. An essential requirement for UV disinfection with lamp systems is an available and reliable source of electricity. While the power requirements of low-pressure mercury UV lamp disinfection systems are modest, they are essential for lamp operation to disinfect water.\n\n9 Costs of UV disinfection for household water\n\nAt sufficiently high doses, all waterborne enteric pathogens are inactivated by UV radiation. The general order of microbial resistance (from least to most) and corresponding UV doses for extensive (>99.9%) inactivation are: vegetative bacteria and the protozoan parasites Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia at low doses (1-10 mJ/cm2) and enteric viruses and bacterial spores at high doses (30-150 mJ/cm2). Most low-pressure mercury lamp UV disinfection systems can readily achieve UV radiation doses of 50-150 mJ/cm2 in high quality water, and therefore efficiently disinfect essentially all waterborne pathogens. However, dissolved organic matter, such as natural organic matter, certain inorganic solutes, such as iron, sulfites and nitrites, and suspended matter (particulates or turbidity) will absorb UV radiation or shield microbes from UV radiation, resulting in lower delivered UV doses and reduced microbial disinfection. Another concern about disinfecting microbes with lower doses of UV radiation is the ability of bacteria and other cellular microbes to repair UV-induced damage and restore infectivity, a phenomenon known as reactivation. UV inactivates microbes primarily by chemically altering nucleic acids (pyrimidine dimers and other alterations). However, the UV-induced chemical lesions can be repaired by cellular enzymatic mechanisms, some of which are independent of light (dark repair) and others of which require visible light (photorepair or photoreactivation). Therefore, achieving optimum UV disinfection of water requires delivering a sufficient UV dose to induce greater levels of nucleic acid damage and thereby overcome or overwhelm DNA repair mechanisms.\n\nTwo alternative configurations or physical systems are used for UV disinfection of small or household water supplies, submerged lamps or lamps in air and mounted above a thin layer of the water to be irradiated. In the units with submerged lamps, the lamps are covered with a protective, UV-penetrable as protection from the electrical hazards associated with water. Water can be treated on a batch basis by placing the lamp in a container of water for several minutes or longer, or on a flow-through basis in a housing or channel, with the water flowing parallel or perpendicular to the lamp(s). In units having the lamps mounted in the air, the UV lamps are in a metal housing with reflective surfaces that direct the UV radiation downward onto a thin layer of water flowing through a channel or tray below the lamps. The advantage of the submerged systems is intimate lamp contact with the water, water-mediated cooling of the lamps, and the use of housing designs that maximize UV exposure of the water. However, the protective sleeves over the lamps must be mechanically or chemically cleaned on a regular basis to overcome fouling by a physical, chemical or biological film that can forms on the sleeve surface, reducing UV passage into the water. The non-submerged, in-air lamp units have the advantage of no need for lamp cleaning due to lamp fouling, but there is some loss of UV radiation due atmospheric and surface absorption. However, both types of UV disinfection system designs are available for disinfection of household water at point- of-use, point-of-entry or at the community level .\n\nUV disinfection with lamps has the advantages of being effective for inactivating waterborne pathogens, simple to apply at the household and community levels, and relatively low cost, while not requiring the use of chemicals or creating tastes, odors or toxic chemical by-products. The disadvantages of UV disinfection with lamps are the need for a source of lamps, which have to be replaced periodically (typically every year or two), the need for a reliable source of electricity to power the lamps, the need for period cleaning of the lamp sleeve surface to remove deposits and maintain UV transmission, especially for the submerged lamps, and the uncertainty of the magnitude of UV dose delivered to the water, unless a UV sensor is used to monitor the process. In addition, UV provides no residual chemical disinfectant in the water to protect against post-treatment contamination, and therefore care must be taken to protect UV-disinfected water from post-treatment contamination, including bacterial regrowth or reactivation.\n\nBecause the energy requirements are relatively low (several tens of watts per unit or about the same as an incandescent lamp), UV disinfection units for water treatment can be powered at relatively low cost using solar panels, wind power generators as well as conventional energy sources. The energy costs of UV disinfection are considerably less than the costs of disinfecting water by boiling it with fuels such as wood or charcoal.\n\nUV units to treat small batches (1 to several liters) or low flows (1 to several liters per minute) of water at the community level are estimated to have costs of 0.02 US$ per 1000 liters of water, including the cost of electricity and consumables and the annualized capital cost of the unit. On this basis, the annual costs of community UV treatment would be less than US$1.00 per household. However, if UV lamp disinfection units were used at the household level, and therefore by far fewer people per unit, annual costs would be considerably higher, probably in the range of $US10-100 per year. Despite the higher costs, UV irradiation with lamps is considered a feasible technology for household water treatment."

In addition, roughly 12,000 people, mostly college students, have signed a TOTB pledge to not buy bottled water.\n\nBut for Tufts students like Daniel, greener efforts may no longer be enough. When she learned that as much as 40 percent of bottled water comes from municipally managed water sources, and not the pristine springs she imagined, she decided to seal the cap once and for all.\n\n\"Clearly the ABA is threatened by this movement because they know how powerful college students are,\" says Lizzie DeWan, a junior at Tufts and cofounder of its TOTB campaign.\n\nThe International Bottled Water Asso­ciation shot back at critics in a press release, saying, \"To single out this product as any more polluting or dangerous than the thousands of others packaged in plastic is to ignore the fact that today's society demands and relies upon packaged food and drinks.\"\n\nMoney drain for city hall\n\nCity and state governments are looking at the economics of banning bottled water. Citing environmental concerns and a misallocation of resources, Los Angeles; San Francisco; Ann Arbor, Mich.; and the state of Illinois have banned the use of public funds to purchase bottled water for city and state functions, while the mayors of Salt Lake City and Minneapolis have strongly urged constituents to opt for tap water instead. In June, the US Conference of Mayors adopted a resolution to bring attention to the negative impact of bottled water and promote local sources."

We Investigate\n\nAlright, so if Evian water is available to drink for free, are bottles of Evian sold there?\nIt's absolutely true that spring water can be drawn in various locations throughout the city, so common sense would dictate that a shop would have to be crazy to sell bottles of Evian in Evian. Even a tourist would know better than to pay money for Evian. Why else are they going to Evian?\n\nHowever, as it turns out, Evian can be found on sale everywhere in the city. Supermarkets, convenience stores, and even mom and pop shops are stocked with bottles of Evian water.\n\nSo… Why do they sell the stuff?\nAccording to someone who works at a hotel in Evian, \"Usually I just get it out of the spring but it seems like some people buy it. In my case, I don't like tap water. So, sometimes I buy it if I'm too lazy or it's too far to get it from the spring. My friends are like that too.\"\n\nA cashier at a local supermarket gives a different viewpont, \"I buy it because it's only 50 cents. There really aren't that many people who get from the spring though. We also sell Volvic. [laughs]\"\n\nThere you have it. Even in Evian, Evian vendors thrive. Well, they don't really \"thrive,\" they just sell the stuff. The tongue twister was too good to pass up. This brings us to the final question.\n\nSo free water is flowing 24/7 all over Evian, but is it really Evian water?\nIt's all coming off the same flow of water from \"the heart of the alps\", but the places that town folk collect their water are not the same places the bottler uses. Therefore it's likely that the water is of at least a similar quality, but difficult to say if it's exacltly the same.\n\nPhotos and Video: RocketNews24\n\nArriving in Évian-les-Bains, we see that even this quaint spa town has a graffiti problem.\n\nFirst, straight to the vending machine to see if…\n\nYup, there it is.\n\nLeaving the station in search of a supermarket.\n\nNice little town.\n\nFound the supermarket, and what do we have here?\n\nEven one of Evian's top rivals is selling here.\n\nOnly €0.47 per bottle. Note the price of Volvic in the photo above though. I guess they understand it's a hard market.\n\nWater comes out of this nozzle all day every day.\n\nSome people still seem to get all their water straight from the spring.\n\nI wonder if it's considered rude to collect Evian water in a Volvic bottle"

The shape of the water bottle has little effect\non the pressure it can hold. The most important thing is that the\nbottle must be round. Whether it is straight-sided (like a cylinder),\nor it gets \"skinny\" in the middle (like a Coke bottle), for example,\nmakes no significant difference to its ability to hold pressure.\n\nIf the bottle is not round, things get more complicated. Take a square\nbottle for example. If you try to pressurize it, the flat sides will\nbulge outward, and if there is enough pressure it will actually start\nto look round! Water and pop bottles derive almost all their strength\n(and ability to resist pressure) by being perfectly round. They can\nincrease or decrease in diameter at different points along their\nlength without affecting their strength, provided all sections are\nstill round.\n\nRegards,\n\nBob Wilson\n\nThe pressure inside a container is the SAME IN ALL DIRECTIONS regardless of\nthe shape of the container. These bottles are not meant to withstand high\npressure so they should not be pressurized. Failure of the container occurs\nat the weakest point of the container. Typically this is a seam (if there is\none), a \"thin\" spot, or where there is a large curvature such as the base."

      "text": "The intent of this web-site is to educate you about a natural \"environmental stressor\" that imposes physical stress to the human body. Long-term exposure to this stressor weakens the immune system and can lead to chronic illness and disease.\n\nStressor: Is something that causes stress to the body – for which the body responds by producing a stress reaction. When stress reactions are excessive, prolonged and chronic, it actually breaks down our body's defense mechanism and leaves us open and vulnerable to disease and illness. Stress, either internal or external (attacking the body from the outside), has been called the number one universal health factor contributing to major disease because too much stress destroys the immune system.\n\nAquifers:When water travels from point A to point B underground, it travels through aquifers. Geologists compare an aquifer to that of a hard sponge, the moving water, at times, has to force its way through the tiny nooks and crannies in the aquifer, creating tremendous pressure, friction and turbulence. Aquifer is the proper name for an underground water stream and can be at depths less than 100 feet to more than 500 feet below ground.\n\nDr. Mark Krinker, PhD, Physicist and Member of the Advisory Committee for Department of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, City College of Technology, CUNY, New York, NY, explains the \"environmental stressor\" this way: In the places where water flows turbulently in an aquifer (due to friction and pressure), extremely low frequency electric fields are generated (ELF up to 30Hz). And because the Earth already has its own permanent electric field, these ELF's modify the Earth's electric field into electrical fields of different force and wavelengths. Dr. Krinker has developed test equipment to detect these electric fields.\n\nThis creates an \"environmental stressor\" which has been scientifically shown to harm the body:In the areas of the aquifer where these electric fields are being generated, an \"environmental stressor\" will be found (directly above) on ground level. When a human being is placed in this stressor, the body will react by producing a stress reaction in as little as 15-30 minutes. This was shown in the 2005, double blind, peer reviewed study, entitled \"Biomedical Evidence of Influence of Geopathic Zones on the Human Body: Scientifically Traceable Effects and Ways of Harmonization\", by the Institute for Frontier Questions of Medicine and Biotechnology, St. Johanns-Hospital, Salzburg, Austria.\n\nNOTE: (The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) explains these natural electric fields on their web-site. The following is an excerpt: Telluric currents are naturally occurring electric fields that are widespread, some being of global scale. Electric fields may also occur as streaming potentials generated by groundwater movement. Electric fields associated with groundwater movement will have the greatest amplitude where groundwater flow rates are high, such as through subsurface open-channel flow).\n\nThe medical scientists, led by Univ.-Prof. Dr. Gerhard W. Hacker, conclude that long term exposure to this stressor will weaken the immune system and can lead to chronic illness and disease. Serious health issues can occur when people (and animals) sleep or work for long periods of time in this stressor because the body is not intended to produce stress reactions for long periods of time.\n\nThis \"environmental stressor\" found above turbulently moving water has also been scientifically shown to inhibit melatonin production in dairy cows: A study conducted in 2010 measuring dairy cows exposed to this stressor was conducted by medical scientists in cooperation with the University of Zurich Veterinary Clinic. The cows were exposed to this stressor for 3 sequences of 3 weeks on (standing in this stressor), and 3 sequences of 3 weeks off wherein this stressor was eliminated from their stall. Samples of the cow's urine were taken in order to measure the Melatonin sulfate levels. For the 3 week on periods, when the cows were living in the stressor and were under stress, melatonin production significantly dropped in all cows tested, and when the stressor was eliminated from the stall during the 3 week off periods, melatonin production increased significantly in all cows tested.\n\nShort-term exposure to this \"environmental stressor\" has been scientifically shown to reduce well-being in humans:Published in \"The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine\" in 2010, \"Geopathic Stress Zones: Short-Term Effects on Work Performance and Well-Being?\" concluded that well-being was negatively affected – the analysis of variance revealed a trend (p = 0.07) and showed significantly poorer well-being while on the stressor compared to being on a neutral (safe) location (p = 0.01).\n\nLack of awareness is the real problem:Eliminating this stressor whenever and wherever it exists above turbulently moving groundwater is both simple and relatively inexpensive to do.\n\nHouses and communities sitting above aquifers, wherein the water is moving turbulently (due to pressure and friction), have higher illness and disease rates than homes not sitting above turbulently moving water.\n\nAquifers and Health Institute is a non-profit organization committed to creating a public awareness campaign as well as getting government and federal agency attention to this very serious \"environmental stressor\". Serious health risks exist because long term exposure to this stressor weakens the immune system."

It's water that goes through an additional process, called ionization.\"\n\nThe water system is simply hooked up to your faucet.\n\nHana Dolgin: \"Inside the machine there are plates made out of medical grade titanium and the machine is plugged into the electricity, so there is a mild electrical charge running through those plates. And when the water flows over those plates it actually restructures the water.\"\n\nThe machine takes tap water, filters out harmful contaminants then splits it into alkaline and acid waters. The theory is ... our bodies PH needs to be balanced.\n\nHana Dolgin: \"Little by little the body is becoming too acidic, so this water helps to offset the acidity. To give your body the right kind of water that it needs, that's alkaline, has minerals in it. In addition, the water is antioxidant, which means it fights free radical damage.\"\n\nResearch trials are just beginning here in the U.S. on whether ionized water is any better than regular water. But Pablo says he saw health benefits immediately.\n\nPablo Lucero: \"In less than 48 hours the migraines went away.\"\n\nMost importantly, his high cholesterol dropped within three weeks which stunned even his doctor.\n\nPablo Lucero: \"My cholesterol it dropped from 228 to 221.\"\n\nDiana Diaz: \"The Kangen System does not come cheap prices range from $1,280 to $4,000.

It is distinct from greywater or sullage, the residues of washing processes.\n\nContents\n\nWater coming from domestic equipment other than toilets (e.g., bathtubs, showers, sinks, washing machines) is called greywater and it is preferred to be kept separate from blackwater (which comes from toilets) to reduce the amount of water that gets heavily polluted.\n\nSeparation of blackwater and greywater nowadays happens with all ecological buildings. Especially in autonomous buildings, the separation is always present. It is also commonly used on recreational vehicles which feature a greywater holding tank and a blackwater holding tank.\n\nBlackwater contains pathogens that must decompose before they can be released safely into the environment. It is difficult to process blackwater if it contains a large quantity of excess water, or if it must be processed quickly, because of the high concentrations of organic material. However, if blackwater does not contain excess water, or if receives primary treatment to de-water, then it is easily processed through composting. The heat produced by naturally occurring thermophilic microorganisms, will heat the compost to over 60 degrees C, and destroy potential pathogens. The compost is eventually reduced to safe fertilizer after about 1 year. [2]\n\nBlackwater can be avoided by making use of composting toilets and vermicomposting toilets. In certain autonomous buildings, such as earthships, this is almost always present and allows the water requirements of the building (which, with earthships, are self-generated) to be heavily reduced. Besides saving water, composting toilets allow the user to reuse the nutrients found herein (e.g., for growing crops/trees)."

Ranging from vitamin A to zinc, they include folate, iodine, iron, selenium, and vitamin C. Deficiencies in these micronutrients usually occur when someone's diet lacks an adequate variety of vegetables, fruit, and protein sources.\n\nLack of micronutrients compromises health even if the diet provides enough calories. Though less dramatic than outright starvation, micronutrient shortages can seriously damage one's health. Hence it is called \"hidden hunger.\"\n\nMicronutrient deficiencies can also result from relying too heavily on sugars, starches, and processed food for calories, as frequently occurs in wealthy countries. Increasingly this is becoming a problem in other countries that turn to fast foods and other Western products.\n\nMost of the electricity used for running computers, lights, television sets, and video game systems is generated by power plants that burn fossil fuels to make steam to turn a turbine that spins a generator. Since the burning of fossil fuels adds greenhouse gases to the air, any reduction in their use will help turn the problem around. The bottom line is that the less electricity we use, the less we need to burn fossil fuels.\n\nYes, in surprising ways that no one can anticipate. For example, the Gulf Stream, a powerful ocean current that runs from the southeastern U.S. to northern Europe, keeps huge areas of Europe warm enough to support agriculture. Melting ice in the north Atlantic could cool the Gulf Stream, which would, in turn, bring colder weather to much of Europe. While this would not occur overnight, it is possible. Indeed, fossil evidence indicates that it may have happened several times in the past.\n\nAbsolutely! Swimming or bathing in water contaminated with bacteria or disease-causing parasites can have the same negative effects as drinking the water. Disease-causing organisms can enter the body through cuts in the skin, and even through your eyes and nose. In addition, if you accidentally swallow any water while swimming, it's as bad as drinking it.\n\nAnti-bacterial soap kills some bacteria, but it does very little to stop the spread of viruses and other microbes, especially if these \"germs\" are found in the water you are washing with. Washing your hands or food in water contaminated with parasites such as \"crypto\" can actually help spread them to your food. It is also important to note that because of the excessive use of antibiotics, many strains of bacteria have become resistant to standard anti-bacterial soap."

      "text": "Carbon Filters\n\nCarbon filtering is a method of water purification that uses a piece of activated carbon to remove contaminants and impurities, utilizing chemical adsorption. Each piece of carbon is designed to provide a large section of surface area, in order to allow contaminants the most possible exposure to the filter media. One pound of carbon contains a surface area of approximately 500.000 mē (125 acres). This carbon is generally activated with a positive charge and is designed to attract negatively charged water contaminants.\n\nCarbon filters are most effective at removing chlorine, sediment, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from water. They are not generally effective at removing minerals, salts, and dissolved inorganic compounds.\n\nTypical particle sizes that can be removed by carbon filtres range from 0.5 to 50 micrometres (microns). The particle size will be used as part of the filter description. The efficacy of a carbon filter is also based upon the flow rate regulation. The slower water is able to flow through the filter, the more contaminants are exposed to the filter media."

      "text": "\"My water smells like rotten eggs.\" This is a very common complaint from many homeowners but one that may be easily explained. Hydrogen sulfide, a compound that is widely known for its distinct rotten egg or sulfur odor could be the culprit. This colorless, flammable gas occurs naturally in gases from swamps and stagnant pools of water, volcanoes, hot springs or crude petroleum. H2S is also a waste product of many industrial processes and from municpal sewers and sewage treatment plants. The production of H2S is due to a process called anaerobic digestion, a breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen.\n\nIn well water supplies, H2S is commonly formed by sulfate reducing bacteria. Well water naturally contains minerals of sulfate picked up from soil and rock formations. Sulfur reducing bacteria can change sulfates in the water to hydrogen sulfide gas. In other cases, hydrogen sulfide in well water can be caused simply by the decay of organic matter.\n\nThe human sense of smell can detect H2S in concentrations as low as 0.5 ppb (parts per billion). In addition to the odor, the taste of the water may also be affected. If left untreated, H2S can corrode steel, stainless steel and copper pipes. It can also tarnish silver and leave yellow or black stains on bathroom fixtures. While the amount of H2S typically found in most household water supplies is not high enough to pose serious health risks, slight nausea can occur due to the foul odor.\n\nThere are several options to treat H2S in a water supply. Trace amounts of the gas can be handled by activated carbon. If you have low to moderate amounts of H2S in your water, the gas can be converted to elemental sulfur and then filtered out by using an oxidizing filter. High amounts of H2S may require more advanced treatment.\n\nIt is important to note, if the rotten egg smell is only present in the hot water, not in the cold water, chances are the problem lies in the hot water heater. All hot water tanks have an anode rod, which is in place to prevent corrosion of the tank. However, if anaerobic bacteria are present in the water, they can use the electrons produced by the corrosion of the anode rod as an energy source to produce H2S. One simple fix is to switch out the anode rod in the tank. Check with a reputable dealer for replacement anode types to ensure you keep the warranty intact. Turning the temperature up on the hot water tank for a short period of time to kill the bacteria may help. But, remember to turn the temperature back down and drain the tank, otherwise scalding may occur. Shock chlorination of a private well is a temporary solution as well. Although these fixes can reduce the odor problem, they aren't permanent.\n\nIf you suspect you have H2S in your water, it is best to contact a water professional for further on-site testing and precise treatment solutions treating would"

It regulates all our bodily functions, from our metabolism to thought processes. However, water is much more than just a transport medium for oxygen or metabolic products; above all, it is a medium for storing information. The information contained in water can, for example, make water healthy – despite minerals or other substances it may contain.\n\nThe information in our water is constantly altered by environmental influences. This makes the question of what information there is in the water we drink every day, and what it passes on to us all the more important.\n\nOur tap water generally consists of about two thirds ground water and one-third surface water, from lakes, dams and riverbank filtration. It needs treatment before it is drinkable. After treatment, however, tap water may still contain around fifty chemical additives such as chlorine, chlorine dioxide and hydrochloric or sulphuric acid, within certain limits. The same applies to mineral water, although the guideline for that is even less strict than for tap water. The water treatment plants test the quality of the water regularly in accordance with drinking water guidelines. What is not taken into account is the information the water contains.\n\nOn its way into our homes, the water comes into contact with all kinds of different harmful substances i.e., pesticides, fungicides, residues from medicines, beta-blockers, hormonal derivatives (e.g. birth control pills) just to name but a few. Even if the water is cleaned in a treatment plant, it still contains the \"energy signature\" of these harmful influences, which we absorb without noticing. This \"energy signature\" contains a cocktail of harmful information that the water has stored at specific frequency, which then passes into our body.\n\nIt makes sense, therefore, to search for the best water tested at a high level on the Bovis scale as life enhancing."

Despite these amazing numbers, only 1% of the Earth's water is safe for drinking. We also bathe in it, cook with it and clean with it, but we also need to conserve it. With water conservation and water treatment systems, we save two other valuable resources: TIME & MONEY.\n\nTime is quickly becoming a sought after commodity in a world where time is always 'of the essence'. Husbands and wives don't have enough time for their family or one another, much less themselves. Many households are looking for ways to free up some time.\n\nEvery Saturday, Karen, a working mother of three, wakes up the kids, makes breakfast, mops floors, scrubs tiles on her hands and knees, does the laundry and many more water-using chores.\n\nHer free time is valuable and she seems to be running out of it. \"It's enough to take care of three children\" Karen remarks. \"Add to that managing a household, bills, cleaning, chores, groceries, plus the kids was starting to drive me crazy.\"\n\nBut if Karen could remove some of the stress, hassle, and work of cleaning tasks, she could gain some time. The solution: Remove the elements in the water that create stains on glasses (re-washing), rings around sinks and tubs (scratchy cleansers/heavy scrubbing) and the look of hard water scum on tile (constant cleaning). \"Generally, scrubbing using a hard abrasive was the only way to clean areas like the dishwasher sprayer. Dishes always showed residue or stains,\" explained Karen. \"Cleaning was quite a workout.\"\n\nTotal Dissolved Solids* (TDS) and hard water (dissolved rock) create these problems and aren't easy to get rid of. Eliminating these causes would reduce the problems, wasted time from constant cleaning/re-cleaning, and wasted money from water usage, appliance replacement, and cleaning supplies. A water treatment system, such as RainSoft, filters out the harmful, hard water substances and provides only soft or conditioned water throughout the home for cooking, cleaning and bathing.\n\nOther Ways To Save\n\nFill a pitcher with drinking water and store it in the fridge.\n\nNever put water down the drain that can be used for something else, such as watering plants.\n\nLimit showers to 5 minutes.\n\nInstall water saving shower heads.\n\nDishwashers & washing machines run more efficiently if they are full.\n\nTurn off water while brushing teeth or shaving.\n\nFix leaking faucets or toilets.\n\nRinse fruit and vegetables in a pot of water rather than in running water.\n\nWater your lawn every third day, during cool time of day. (early morning is best)\n\n\"The RainSoft water treatment system we invested in made an immediate impact. I saved time because I didn't have to scrub the bathroom tiles, rings around tubs or stains off the faucet.\" Karen stated. The biggest impact for Karen was her first RainSoft bath. \"It felt so good…better than…well, let's not go there. When I stepped out of the tub, I didn't need moisturizer on my skin. No dryness or flaking either.\" Karen reports that she can tell if a hotel uses a water treatment system like RainSoft, or not.\n\nLess bad hair days add greater time savings to Karen's life. \"I found out that hard water allows shampoo to stick to your hair making it flat and dry, increasing styling time. Now using conditioned water, my hair has never looked better.\" Karen observes. \"It's gross to think that you still have soap and shampoo on you when you are supposed to be clean.\" Quite an observation.\n\n*Basic water conditioning doesn't reduce TDS, but by removing hardness, we increase the sheeting action of water, thus greatly reducing the formation of water spots by TDS. Results vary by your water conditions. Different customers report varying degrees of benefits."

However, due to the social/political hurdle of the public conception of drinking \"poo\" I concede that industrial use is a good start.\n\nBut our power stations could do a lot better than their current performance with respect to water. The steam cycle requires that the process water is cooled after it emerges from the turbines. This is done by evaporative cooling - allowing massive quantities of water to evaporate in cooling towers.\n\nHowever, they could take a separate stream of impure water (grey water, stormwater, seawater) and use it to cool the process water in a series of heat exchangers. This would immediately reduce or eliminate the need for evaporative cooling.\n\nThen, the impure water stream, which has been heated with \"free\" waste energy, could be very cheaply purified, using either flash distillation (if it's hot enough) or RO (which becomes more efficient as temperature increases).\n\nSo there is a two-fold gain. Reduced consumption of water in the power station, and cheap water purification powered by free waste energy.\nThis technology exists today. They do it in Dubai. If our state government invested some money researching and implementing this technology, we really could lay claim to being the \"smart state\".\n\nDarren the jury is still out in my book for using sewage as drinking water, however you never cease to amaze me with that practical and innovative solution.

That's a lot of water!\nIf you look at the cost:yield equation for the proposed dam (>$2B for 70 GL/year) that should mean a lot of money to throw at improving the water efficiency at coal fired power stations.\n\nThe station also has two cooling towers which emit fog-like clouds of water vapour. The towers cool the hot air that was used for cooling steam in the station's condensers. The flow of air in the towers cools the hot water by evaporating as it falls from the upper hot pond to the lower cold pond. The cool water is then pumped back to the condensers and the process begins again"

Even in a very clean lake like Mask there's always some algae present. In the past at least it was aggravated by the fact that they weren't using aluminium - especially to cater for dialysis patients using Baxter dialysis bags as I understood it. Aluminium is used to take out organic materials like algae from the water before it is chlorinated. So although we had very low aluminium the tendency to produce high trihalomethanes is much increased.\n\nWith the E. coli thing I'm not surprised because two labs could give completely different answers on two different days simply because the bacteria come and go depending on rainfall, and what's happening nearby such as slurry spreading and loo-flushing into septic tanks."

Water (often a large component in the structure of these chemicals) easily takes on their residues and toxic properties, which when ingested poses a danger to the human body.\n\nThe most common chemicals that invade our water are pesticides and large concentrations of basic minerals (such as iron). These toxins aren't put into water with malicious intent; often they are the products of runoff from farming, mining and chemical testing, but they are there and precautions need to be taken in dealing with them and removing them.\n\nLuckily, there are ways to eliminate them to maintain the safety and purity of your water supply.\n\nThere are filters available that are capable of purifying a large amount of water by attachment to your home's water pump.\n\nThe Water Depot, which handles everything water, retails and installs several different models of these filters, all of which handle different needs; there are filters for trapping sediment and filters for reverse osmosis (removing larger or more toxic particles by forcing them through a membrane), filters that will trap Iron, filters that will trap tannins to name a few. They have locations throughout Ontario, though consumers in cottage country would be best served by going to the Parry Sound location (705-771-9582).

The water is treated in a treatment plant to remove sediment and bacteria. The output from the water treatment plant (A) is clear, germ-free water. A high-lift pump (B) pressurizes the water and sends it to the water system's primary feeder pipes (C). The water tower is attached to the primary feeders quite simply by a tube that passes directly through the ground.\n\nIf the pump is producing more water than the water system needs, the excess flows automatically into the tank (D). If the community is demanding more water than the pump can supply (like in the morning when people shower, brush teeth, etc.), then water flows out of the tank to meet the need. Source: HowStuffWorks\n\nThe More You Know: Water towers are tall to provide pressure. Each foot of height provides 0.43 PSI (pounds per square inch) of pressure. A typical municipal water supply runs at between 50 and 100 PSI (major appliances require at least 20 to 30 PSI). The water tower must be tall enough to supply that level of pressure to all of the houses and businesses in the area of the tower."

In this report, HAUWA MAHMUD KOLO writes on a technology that could enhance access to drinking water and even power.\n\nUndeniably, water is life. In fact, experts have argued that no one could survive beyond three days without drinking water. This only goes to show the fundamentality of water to life and underscores how tragic it is that in many parts of Nigeria today, even in urban areas, the non-availability of potable water is still an issue.\n\nIt was recently published in the May 4 issue of Science Daily that researchers have developed an aluminium alloy that could be used in a new type of mobile technology to convert non-potable water into drinking water, while also extracting hydrogen to generate electricity.\n\nAccording to a professor of electrical and computer engineering in Purdue University, Jerry Woodall, such technology might be used to provide power and drinking water to villages and also for military operations.\n\n\"The alloy contains aluminium, gallium, indium and tin. Immersing the alloy in fresh water or salt water causes a spontaneous reaction, splitting the water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules. The hydrogen could then be fed to a fuel cell to generate electricity, producing water in the form of steam as a by-product.\n\n\"The steam would kill any bacteria contained in the water, and then it would condense to purified water, so you are converting undrinkable water to drinking water,\" Woodall says.\n\nWoodall envisions a new portable technology for regions that are not connected to a power grid, such as villages in Africa and other remote areas.\n\n\"There is a big need for this sort of technology in places lacking connectivity to a power grid and where potable water is in short supply. Because aluminium is a low-cost, non-hazardous metal that is the third most abundant metal on Earth, this technology promises to enable a global-scale potable water and power technology, especially for off-grid and remote locations.\n\n\"The unit, including the alloy, the reactor and fuel cell might weigh less than 100 pounds. You could drop the alloy, a small reaction vessel and a fuel cell into a remote area via parachute. Then the reactor could be assembled along with the fuel cell. The polluted water or the seawater would be added to the reactor and the reaction converts the aluminium and water into aluminium hydroxide, heat and hydrogen gas on demand. The aluminium hydroxide waste is non-toxic and could be disposed of in a landfill,\" Woodall explains.\n\nIn some parts of the Federal Capital Territory, residents complain about the dirty water that sometimes flows from taps. Mrs. Lillian Christopher, a resident of Karu, a suburb in the FCT, relates, \"Water supply in this area is really poor. Most people rely on boreholes and those of us who don't have are at the mercy of Water Board. We wait for tap water, which comes once or twice in a week. Sometimes it even comes out brownish and you begin to wonder whether it is tap or stream water,\" Christopher laments.\n\nAccording to an Abuja-based scientist and water purification expert who didn't want his name in print, the FCT does employ the use of an aluminium alloy to purify water. \"Aluminium sulphate, popularly referred to as 'alum' is used in the sedimentation of water in the FCT and this brings about clear and potable water for drinking. But this new technology indicates that the aluminium alloy used also produces hydrogen for energy. It simply means that they are trying to use aluminium in another way to generate power.\"\n\nHe says that while the research says that the process of the technology produces steam that would destroy micro-organisms, chlorine is currently used to destroy micro-organisms in water purification in Nigeria.\n\n\"After using aluminium sulphate to settle the particles, we use chlorine to kill the micro-organisms. In Africa we have a lot of water and also, the technology for its purification, but our major constraint is availability of water treatment chemicals. So if we can truly have a technology that is cheaper than the current one we use, then making potable water available will certainly be enhanced,\" he explains"

It starts with protecting the quality and quantity of water that will ultimately be the source of public water supplies. The approach includes critical actions from the time water is withdrawn from its source, through treatment, to its eventual delivery to homes, schools and businesses.\n\nBy almost any measure, a tremendous amount has been accomplished over the past three decades in ensuring the safety of drinking water for our citizens:\n\nH Since 1974, we have dramatically increased the number of individuals and communities receiving water that meets all public health standards. Today, more than 3,473,415 people in Oklahoma receive water from 1,160 community water systems. The vast majority of that water meets all public health standards.\n\nH The number of contaminants that are regulated by public water systems has grown from about two dozen in 1974 to almost 100 in 2004, while the number of waterborne disease outbreaks had dropped and continues to stay low.\n\nH Using funds provided by the federal government and matched with their own funds, Oklahoma has provided $149,736,877 to local water systems since 1996. This assistance has helped water systems make the infrastructure improvements needed to maintain public health.\n\nOklahoma has played a central role in this march of progress. Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, states are vested with the principal responsibility for administering the requirements of the Act within their jurisdictions. States carry out their responsibilities through partnerships - working closely with officials at the federal, state and local levels. Drinking water has always been important in our state and as a result Oklahoma was the first state in the nation to attain primary enforcement responsibility for both the Public Water Supply Supervision Program and the Underground Injection Control Program under the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n\nThe tasks facing state drinking water programs will continue to be extremely challenging — especially in an era of scarce resources. The drinking water infrastructure in many cities is aging and presents daunting resource demands. As a nation, we continue to be challenged by new and emerging drinking water contaminants associated with our industrial society. \"Today, states renew their commitment to build on the successes of the past 30 years and to continue to work with all of our partners to fully realize the public health goals of the Safe Drinking Water Act\", said Thompson."

      "text": "Using the latest technology, 33 Buckets has designed a filter that will provide a girls' school in rural Bangladesh with arsenic-free water that they can sell to the community in a sustainable microfinance business.\n\n0\n\nProviding safe water to the community of Baher Char and empowering women through microfinance opportunities.\n\nOver 77 million people in Bangladesh, approximately ¼ of the population of the U.S., have been exposed to toxic amounts of arsenic in well water. This chronic exposure has lead to arsenic becoming the leading cause of death in Bangladesh. The current situation has been called \"the largest mass poisoning of a population in history\" by the World Health Organization. The Rahima Hoque Girl's School, located in rural Bangladesh, works to give women the education they need to pursue higher opportunities. Unfortunately, students must put their health at risk every day just to obtain an education. This unfair trade-off is a result of the arsenic-contaminated drinking water present at the school.\n\nIn light of these facts, we felt compelled to make a difference. We've designed a reasonably priced water purification system to provide safe drinking water to the school. Our filter will not require electricity and will produce at least 4,000 gallons of drinking water per day. The design is simple and involves chlorination, activated carbon, adsorption of arsenic through a media, and then filtration through sand. This filter is also designed to provide an extra 2,000 gallons of water to sell to the community, allowing the girls to start a microfinance business. Not only will the community benefit as a whole, but the profits made from water sales can be used to maintain the filter and make much needed repairs to the school.\n\nWe've partnered with the founder of the high school and the Civil Engineering Department at ASU. But, we need your help, too. At this stage, we have identified two state of the art medias, LayneRT and E33, for the arsenic adsorption process. We want to have built two prototypes, one for each media, and quantitatively prove which one is better. Then we will incorporate the other stages of our filter into a quarter-scale model for proof-of-concept. Funding by the Dell Social Innovation Challenge will help set our plans in motion – by establishing proof-of-concept, we can take the steps we need to implement our filter on-site. Following proven success on-site, we can work on applying our filter to similar villages in Bangladesh and the world. With your help, we can help promote social entrepreneurship and bring clean, healthy water and hope to hundreds of high school girls in Bangladesh.\n\nSupport Your Idea Optional(5 - 7 minutes for three uploads)\n\nFIVE PROJECT QUESTIONS Required(60 - 90 minutes)\n\n1. What is your innovation?\n\nOur design meets the unique constraints of being a medium-scale (4,000 gallons/day) arsenic filter that uses no electricity and is easy to maintain, repair, and install. However, our project's main advantage is that it not only filters water, but also provides a sustainable microfinance business for the women to run and be empowered by. The girls will gain real world experience and will learn valuable business skills that they can use and expand on in their future endeavors.\n\n2. Who gains the most?\n\nThe girls and the surrounding community will gain the most from the implementation of our filter because they will now have clean, arsenic-free water to drink. The girls that attend the school will be able to start their own microfinance business from selling the excess water. The knowledge gained from running their own microfinance business will teach them many valuable, real-world business skills that will enable them to break free from the traditional roles of women in this country.\n\n3. Who pays?\n\nOnce it is set up, this project will pay for itself. The only contributions required will be to cover travel expenses as well as the testing and installation of the filter. After the filter is running, water not used by the school will be sold to the local people and businesses for half the current market price. This will provide a steady stream of income to pay for all maintenance costs, and any additional profit can be used to purchase supplies, equipment, and repairs for the school.\n\n4. What is your success?\n\nBy the next year, we hope to have proven our filter's effectiveness against arsenic and implemented our pilot program at the school. Subsequent efforts will be to ensure the continued safety of the water and long-term success of the microfinance business. Once these goals are met, we will look to adapt our model to similar situations in Bangladesh and around the world, creating further social impact, raising awareness of water issues, and even inspiring locals to start their own ventures.\n\n5. How will you do it?\n\nWhat sets 33 Buckets apart from similar projects is the simple design of our filter and the microfinance business it provides. These will address the most common problem with water projects in developing countries: they work at first, but then slowly break down and are never fixed. Our gravity-fed design has no moving parts and its arsenic filtration media is regenerable; this greatly reduces maintenance needs, and the costs that do arise can be paid for with the revenue from selling the water."

Increasing temperature also increases the rates of chemical reactions taking place in the water. Increases in temperature are often associated with hot water discharge from power stations and industries that use water as a coolant.\n\npH measures the acidity or alkalinity of water. pH of rain water is about 5.5-6.0. Typically, natural water has pH 6.5-8.5. A pH<5 (acidic water) is most damaging to eggs and larvae of aquatic organisms. Most aquatic life (except for some bacteria and algae) cannot survive pH<4.Natural alkalinity is due to CO2(g), HCO3-, CO32- and OH-, carbonate rocks such as limestone and dolomite increase alkalinity. Alkalinity is increased by caustic substances from industry (KOH, NaOH), soil additives in agriculture such as lime Ca(OH)2, superphosphate which is mixture of Ca(H2PO4)2 and CaSO4, and soaps and detergents. Natural acidity is due to CO2(g), HPO42-, H2PO4-, H2S, Fe3+, other acidic metal ions, proteins & organic acids. Increases in acidity can be due to acids used in industry, acid mine drainage, acid rain.\n\nTurbidity\n\nUse a Sechi disc or 500mL of water in a measuring cylinder standing on paper marked with a black cross.\n\nTurbidity is a measure of water clarity. Suspended solids in water can stop light reaching submerged plants and can raise water temperature. Suspended solids often present in water are mud, clay, algae, bacteria and minerals such as silica, calcium carbonate and ochre (iron oxide). Suspended solids can be increased by the discharge of wastes (domestic sewage, industrial and agricultural effluents), leaching of wastes (from mines), and agitation (dredging or shipping).\n\nThis is a conductivity test of available ions in the water, including Ca2+, Na+, K+, Fe2+, Fe3+, HCO3- and ions containing P, S & N. High levels of Na+ is associated with excessive salinity and is found in many minerals. Potassium is incorporated into plant material and is released into water systems when plant matter is decayed or burnt.\n\nCollect 2 water samples, 1 for DO test, 1 for BOD test. Sample must be collected under water to ensure there are no trapped air bubbles.\n\nThe Dissolved Oxygen test measures the current oxygen levels in the water. The DO level varies with temperature. DO levels are highest in the afternoon due to photosynthesis and lowest just before dawn. DO is lowered by an increase in temperature (as from a discharge of hot water form a power station), increases in aerobic oxidation (due to increases in organic matter from sewage or due to inorganic fertilisers such as phosphates and nitrate with overstimulate algal growth). Water with DO<1ppm is dead.\n\nBiochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)\n\nThe first water sample from above is kept in the dark for 5 days at the temperature at which the sample was collected. Then the dissolved oxygen is determined using the Winkler titration method as above. Subtract the mass of oxygen obtained an day 5 from mass of oxygen on day 1 to determine the BOD (mg/L). Unpolluted natural waters have BOD<5mg/L. Treated sewage can have BOD 20-30 mg/L.\n\nBOD measures the rate of consumption of oxygen by organisms in the water over a 5 day period. Increases in BOD can be due to animal and crop wastes and domestic sewage. Untreated domestic sewage BOD~350 ppm Waste water from breweries BOD~550 ppm Waste water from petroleum refineries BOD~850 ppm Abattoir wastes BOD~2,600 ppm Pulpmill wastes BOD~25,000 ppm\n\nSalinity\n\nTitrate a known volume of the water sample with silver nitrate solution (2.73g AgNO3 per 100mL distilled water) using K2CrO4 as indicator. The end-point of the titration is given by the reddening of the silver chloride precipitate (AgCl(s)). Volume of AgNO3 used = chloride content in g/L.\n\nMany aquatic organisms can only survive in a narrow range of salt concentrations since salt controls their osmotic pressure.\n\nTotal Phosphate Test\n\n-acid digestion using concentrated H2SO4 and ammonium persulfate.\n-Titrate using NaOH and phenolphthalein as indicator\n-Use a few drops of H2SO4 to turn the solution clear again.\n-Add ammonium molybdate solution then solid ascorbic acid.\n-An intense blue complex of molybdenum blue is formed which can be measured colorimetrically.\nAbsorbency is measured at 882nm. (A field kit is available using a 'Smart' colorimeter)\n\nTotal Phosphate is used as an indicator of pollution from run-off in agricultural areas or domestic sewage. Concentrations of 0.2mg/L are common. Concentrations of 0.05mg/L indicate the possibility of eutrophication (increased nutrient concentrations) and algal blooms are likely. Natural phosphate is due to decayed organic matter and phosphate minerals.\n\nTotal Nitrogen test\n\nKjeldahl digestion\n-digestion with concentrated sulfuric acid, converting the nitrogen into ammonia sulfate\n-Solution is then made alkaline\n-liberated ammonia is distilled, and the amount determined by titration with standard acid.\n\nTotal Nitrogen is an important indicator of eutrophic waters, especially for those contaminated by animal wastes, fertiliser run-off and domestic sewage. Aquatic nitrogen is essential for the growth of organisms and is produced in natural processes including decay of proteins, the action of lightning, and the action of nitrogen-fixing bacteria on ammonia.\n\nMg2+\n-complexometric titration using EDTA at pH=10 (both Ca2+ and Mg2+ will complex with EDTA at this pH, [Mg2+] can be found by subtracting the results of this titration from the results of the first titration.)\n-OR potentiometric techniques using selective electrodes\n-OR Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS)\n\nCalcium ions are a major contributor to water hardness and are due to water running through rocks containing minerals such as gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O), calcite (CaCO3), dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2). Hard water has a noticeable taste, produces precipitates with soaps which inhibits lathering and forms precipitates (scale) in boilers, hot water systems and kettles. Temporary hardness (or 'bicarbonate hardness') is due to Ca(HCO3)2 which deposits CaCO3(s) as scale on boiling the water. Magnesium ion levels are often high in irrigation water and can cause scouring in stock. Ca2+ and Mg2+ can combine with Cl- and/or SO42- causing permanent hardness which can't be removed by boiling. Water can be softened by an ion exchange process using a solid material such as a resin or clay that is capable of exchanging Na+ or H+ for Ca2+ and Mg2+.\n\nMicroorganisms\n\nmicroorganisms in a water sample are counted under a microscope\nMethod for finding the number of coliform organisms in a water sample:\n\nFilter a known volume of water sample through a filter that retains microorgnisms\n\nTransfer the filter to a sterile petri dish containing appropriate agar and incubate at 35oC for 20-40 hours. Also incubate a control plate with agar only. Colonies will develop on the filter wherever bacteria are retained.\n\nEither visually, or using a microscope, count the number of coliform colonies. Express these values as CFU/100mL.\n\nMany protozoa, bacteria, viruses, algae and fungi are found in natural water systems. Some are pathagenic (typhoid, cholera and amoebic dysentry can result from water-borne pathogens). The excessive growth of algae (called 'algal bloom') can degrade water quality because it lowers dissolved oxygen levels thereby killing other living things. The level of bacterial contamination of water due to animal waste is measured by determining the number of coliform organisms such as E. coli\n\nHeavy metals in concentrations above trace amounts are generally toxic to living things. Trace amounts (<0.05 mg/L) of Zn, Cu and Mn are present in most natural waters. Zn and Cu may be present in higher levels in irrigation areas due to the use of galvanised iron, copper and brass in in plumbing fixtures and for water storage. In irrigation areas, acceptable levels are 0.2 mg/L for Cu2+, and 2.0 mg/L for Zn2+ and Mn2+."

While many consumers use a water softener so\nthey can enjoy the benefits of soft water, there is some confusion about whether\nsoftened water is safe to drink.\n\nSome consumers are concerned that drinking softened water will increase the\nlevel of sodium in their diet. Despite the myth, softening your water will not\nresult in salty-tasting water. Sodium bicarbonate, which is different from\nsodium chloride (table salt), is formed through the water softening process.\n\nThe amount of sodium added to water from the water softening process depends on\nthe hardness of the water supply. When very hard water (greater than 10 grains\nof hardness per gallon) is softened, only 20 to 40 mg of sodium is added to\nevery 8 ounces of water. For comparison, an 8-ounce glass of low-fat milk\ncontains about 120 mg of sodium, a 12-ounce can of diet soda contains from 20 to\n70 mg, and an 8-ounce glass of orange juice contains about 25 mg.\n\nThe majority of the sodium in consumers' diets - more than 90 percent\n- comes from sources such as processed foods and table salt. The recommended\ndaily allowance for sodium consumption is 2,400 mg.\n\nDrinking two quarts of softened water would only add only about 240 mg of sodium\nto your diet. Individuals concerned about sodium in their diet should consult\ntheir physician about effective means of reducing overall sodium consumption,\nwhich will probably involve diet change.\n\nIt is unlikely that a physician would discourage anyone from drinking softened\nwater.\n\nOf course, many of our water softener customers also use a Reverse Osmosis drinking water system\nwhich removes sodium as well as many other contaminates in their kitchens for the best combination of water conditioning methods."

For example in the past five years more than 35,000 feet of new pipe has been installed in the distribution system to expand or replace outdated, substandard lines and approximately $750,000 has been spent to line the wastewater lagoons with a synthetic material to protect the environment.\n\nWhat is wastewater?\n\nMuch of the water used by homes, industries, and businesses must be treated before it is released back to the environment. If the term \"wastewater treatment\" is confusing to you, you might think of it as \"sewage treatment.\" Nature has an amazing ability to cope with small amounts of water wastes and pollution, but it would be overwhelmed if we didn't treat the billions of gallons of wastewater and sewage produced every day before releasing it back to the environment. Treatment plants reduce pollutants in wastewater to a level nature can handle.\n\nWastewater is used water. It includes substances such as human waste, food scraps, oils, soaps and chemicals. In homes, this includes water from sinks, showers, bathtubs, toilets, washing machines and dishwashers. Businesses and industries also contribute their share of used water that must be cleaned. Wastewater also includes storm runoff. Although some people assume that the rain that runs down the street during a storm is fairly clean, it isn't. Harmful substances that wash off roads, parking lots, and rooftops can harm our rivers and lakes.\n\nWhy Treat Wastewater?\n\nIt's a matter of caring for our environment and for our own health. There are a lot of good reasons why keeping our water clean is an important priority:\n\nFisheries - Clean water is critical to plants and animals that live in water. This is important to the fishing industry, sport fishing enthusiasts, and future generations.\n\nWildlife Habitats - Our rivers teem with life that depends on shorelineand marshes. They are critical habitats for hundreds of species of fish and other wildlife. Migratory water birds use the areas for resting and feeding.\n\nRecreation and Quality of Life - Water is a great playground for us all. The scenic and recreational values of our waters are reasons many people choose to live where they do. Visitors are drawn to water activities such as swimming, fishing, boating and picnicking.\n\nHealth Concerns - If it is not properly cleaned, water can carry disease. Since we live, work and play so close to water, harmful bacteria have to be removed to make water safe about 60 percent of suspended solids from wastewater. This treatment also involves aerating (stirring up) the wastewater, to put oxygen back in. Secondary treatment removes more than 90 percent of suspended solids."

However, water reuse requires advanced wastewater treatment processes to achieve the standards required for reuse water. Membrane bioreactor (MBR) is one of the advanced wastewater treatment processes that is starting to replace the conventional activated sludge process (ASP) which is used to treat domestic, aquaculture, industrial and various other effluents. The conventional activated sludge process is comprised of an aeration tank where the biodegradable organic substances from the effluent are consumed by suspended microbial culture followed by a sedimentation tank to settle out the microbial culture from the suspension (Figure 1a). The MBR is constructed in one of the following two modes: (i) side stream MBR where the MBR is connected to the aeration\ntank externally (Figure Ib), (ii) submerged MBR where the MBR is submerged in the aeration tank (Figure 1c). In both modes the filtrate (or permeate) is obtained through the membrane either due to the available head or using suction pumps.\n\nID Code:\n\n11217\n\nItem Type:\n\nBook Chapter (Research - B1)\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nThis publication does not have an abstract.

I couldn't find the actual article but this is what wiki has to say.\n\nThe dihydrogen monoxide hoax involves the use of an unfamiliar name for water (\"dihydrogen monoxide\"), then listing some negative effects of water and asking individuals to help control the seemingly dangerous substance. The hoax is designed to illustrate how the lack of scientific literacy and an exaggerated analysis can lead to misplaced fears.[1] \"Dihydrogen monoxide\", shortened to \"DHMO\", is a name for water that is consistent with basic rules of chemical nomenclature,[2] but is not among the names published by IUPAC[3] and is almost never used.\n\nA popular version of the hoax was created by Eric Lechner, Lars Norpchen and Matthew Kaufman, housemates while attending UC Santa Cruz in 1990,[4] revised by Craig Jackson (also a UC Santa Cruz student) in 1994,[5] and brought to widespread public attention in 1997 when Nathan Zohner, a 14-year-old student, gathered petitions to ban \"DHMO\" as the basis of his science project, titled \"How Gullible Are We?\"[6]\n\nThis is what the original creator wrote:\n\nCONT AMINA TION W ARNING! Recently, it has been discovered that our water system has been contaminated with a hazardous chemical. This chemical is colorless, odorless, tasteless and dissolves completely in water. No action has been taken regarding this dangerous contamination. The substance is dihydrogen monoxide, and has the following properties: • It is used as an industrial solvent and coolant, and is used in the production of styrofoam. • It is used in many forms of animal research. • It is used in the distribution of pesticides. • It is an integral part of the operation of nuclear power plants. • It accelerates corrosion and rusting. • It contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape. • Inhalation of this substance has been shown to cause death. • In certain forms, this chemical can cause severe burns, cloud the atmosphere, and may contribute to the \"greenhouse effect.\" It can also damage concrete and glass, as well as the surfaces of roadways. It may also be related to electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes. • It may have been a factor in the destruction of the Space Shuttle \"Challenger.\" • It has been directly linked to thousands of deaths in third-world countries, especially those countries which do not have the resources to properly deal with the threat, or treat people who have come in contact with it. • Quantities of this substance have been found in our rivers, lakes, streams, oceans, reservoirs, and now our local water system. It has also permeated the atmosphere, and has contaminated ground water. • No current form of water purification can completely eliminate the deadly substance. • Our government has spent millions of dollars to try to control and contain this dangerous chemical. • Every day, hundreds of secret research facilities receive tons of it through a highly sophisticated underground distribution network. Many store large quantities for later use. • Several government agencies are tracking the degree of contamination throughout the world. • This administration has refused to ban the production, distribution, or use of this damaging chemical due to its \"importance to the economic health of this nation.\" Act now to prevent further contamination. Find out more about this dangerous chemical. What you don't know CAN hurt you and others throughout the world.\n\nHe apparently won a science fair due it too. I thought it was pretty funny.\n\nNo that's not what they were doing. They were just being told the facts and thought it was dangerous. The point was to show how people can twist things and make the public fear something that shouldn't be feared at all"

      "text": "The reason why sewage remediation is so important is because the wastewater that comes from the broken sewage lines contains harmful microorganisms that cause diseases. These pathogens can enter the human body in three ways that include hand-to-mouth contact, inhalation, and the skin contact. Even the pores that riddle the body can be openings in which the microorganisms found in the sewage can enter and cause problems in the body in the form of severe medical conditions and disease.\n\nThe risk of disease should be at the forefront of people's minds because it is quite expensive to see medical treatment for many of the diseases that can happen because of sewage contamination. Even though the water may seem clear and clean, it is a risk that should not be taken. Keep in mind that any kind of water that appears in the property comes from dubious sources. Furthermore, extra care should be taken when the water smells bad and or appears gray. That is a clear indication of contamination. In these cases, it is best to evacuate the area as soon as possible and call the professionals. Do not even attempt to take anything from the affected room because the water can aerosolize and affect even those items that appear safe.\n\nIf there is one thing that people should know about sewage, it is that it is considered as a high health risk that should be left to the professionals when it comes to its disposal and cleanup. The following is a list of some of the diseases that that can result from contact with sewage:\n\nCampylobacteriosis\n\nThis particular disease is one of the most common diseases that occur in the United States that cause diarrhea. It happens when the body ingests the bacteria called Campylobacter. Although this particular condition does not always result in symptoms, it can lead to cramping, nausea, bloody diarrhea, and even fever. In the most severe cases, the bacteria can travel to the bloodstream and compromise the immune system, which can lead to death. The onset of the symptoms of Campylobacteriosis usually happens two to five days after exposure to the contaminated sewage.\n\nCryptosporidiosis\n\nCryptosporidiosis is caused by a microscopic parasite called the Cryptosporidium paryum. This particular pathogen can be quite resistant even if it has lived out of the body for prolonged periods of time. This means that the disease can be quite resistant event to chlorine disinfection. Commonly known as crpto, the disease is can cause diarrhea, stomach cramps, and a slight fever.\n\nE. coli Diarrhea\n\nThis disease is caused by the Escherichia coli bacteria, which can be transmitted by water that contains fecal content. When a person comes in contact with it and ingests the bacteria, it can result in bloody diarrhea, cramps, nausea and vomiting. In extreme cases, the infection can lead to kidney failure. Those who have weakened immune symptoms such as those who have pre-existing medical conditions and the elderly are particularly susceptible to E. coli diarrhea. Also, children under the age of five can also be easily infected.\n\nEncephalitis\n\nNot all diseases caused by the sewage occur because of the fecal-oral route. Sometimes, the presence of the water itself can encourage the disease to happen. A species of mosquito called the Culex like to lay their eggs into polluted water such as sewage. The mosquitoes can then be a means of transfer of the viral disease called encephalitis. Some of the symptoms that can occur because of it include fever, stiff neck, convulsions and even paralysis. Babies are particularly vulnerable to the disease so extra care must be taken when it comes to them.\n\nGastroenteritis\n\nMore commonly known as the stomach flu, gastroenteritis is defined as the infection of the stomach because of a variety of viruses. These include the rotavirus, adenovirus, calicivirus, and astrovirus. Some of the symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, and aches in the body. The onset of the symptoms usually happen quickly and as little as a day after contact with the contaminated water. The infection can last up to 10 days and treatment includes the replenishment of the fluids lost by the body.\n\nGiardiasis\n\nCaused by the parasite called Giardia intestinalis, Giardiasis occurs quite commonly in the United States. The reason for this is that the parasite is quite resistant because it is protected by an outer shell that lets it survive even without a host for long periods of time. The symptoms of Giardiasis include diarrhea, stomach cramps, and a general feeling of weakness.\n\nHepatitis A\n\nHepatitis A is a viral disease that leads to jaundice or the yellowing of the skin, pain in the abdomen, and loss of appetite. Unlike other diseases, adults are the ones that are more symptomatic than children. The thing about Hepatitis A is that it tends to last for a long time and relapse. Usually, relapses occur over a period of a year.\n\nLeptospiroris\n\nLeptospirosis caused by a type of bacteria called leptospira. Some of its manifestations include high fever that can result in chills, pains in the body, and vomiting. Some of the physical traits of people with leptospirosis include red eyes and a rash. The onset of this particular disease is serious because it can lead to damage of the kidneys, meningitis, liver failure and even death.\n\nSalmonellosis\n\nA disease caused by the salmonella virus, salmonellosis causes diarrhea, fever, and cramping in the stomach. The onset of the virus can happen in as little as 12 hours after contact with the contaminated water. The illness can last up to week and it not uncommon for it to go away on its own and without the help of treatment. It is those with weak immune systems such as babies and the elderly that can experience salmonellosis in more severe forms such as an infection of the blood stream.\n\nShigellosis\n\nAlso known as bacillary dysentery, shigellosis is caused by bacteria such as the Shigella, Shigella sonnei, and Shigella flexneri. Although most people do not become symptomatic even with contact after the contaminated water, some can exhibit bloody diarrhea, fever and cramping within two days. Also, it can result in seizures for children under the age of two. Shigellosis usually only lasts for a week but it can last longer in infants or the elderly. It is important for people with Shigellosis to constantly replenish the fluids that are lost.\n\nTyphoid Fever\n\nThe bacteria Salmonella typhi can result in a medical condition called typhoid fever. This type of bacteria only survives in the bloodstream and intestinal tracts of people. It can be passed on to others through the stools of a carrier found in the sewage. Typhoid is a serious disease that can result in fevers as high as 104 degrees Fahrenheit, weakness, and coughing as well as other symptoms that include headaches and nausea. In some people, rashes may develop in the skin. Treatment of typhoid fever usually consists of antibiotics and rehydration.\n\nYersiniosis\n\nOne of the diseases that result from contact with sewage is because of rod-shaped bacteria called the Yersinia. It mostly affects children and can exhibit symptoms that range from fever to diarrhea. Those who have yeriniosis also often complain of cramping in the stomach. The pain is usually confined in the right side of the abdomen. Furthermore, rashes and joint pain can occur.\n\nCholera\n\nCholera is a kind of bacterial infection that is spread through contact with water that is contaminated by human feces, which is exactly what sewage is. The symptoms include extremely high fever and diarrhea. Often, the stool is accompanied by rice-shaped debris that is actually flecks from the colon. Cholera has a short incubation period which makes it important to get treatment quickly. Within a period of one to five days, it can already cause severe dehydration for the patient which can result in death. The most common treatment of cholera is oral rehydration although the fluids can be administered intravenously.\n\nAgain, it cannot be emphasized enough for property owners to take the problem of the sewage backup seriously. Also known as raw sewage, septic tank waste, and sewage sludge, these materials should not be touched or even attempted to be cleaned up. In this circumstance, the handling is best left in the hands of professionals who have the necessary equipment and training to do the disinfection properly.\n\nFinally, to avoid the experience of going through any of the diseases that were aforementioned, do not enter the property again until you have been given a go signal by the professionals conducting the work. The disinfection must be done thoroughly because many of the pathogens that sewage carries can be quite resistant even to bleach and chlorine. Thus, the cleaning must be completed and the room declared safe before habitation is again done on the room.\n\nBecause of the many health dangers that are associated with the presence of sewage in the home, it is important to act quickly and refuse to allow the dirt to last longer than necessary. For your safety and the safety of the loved ones, invest in a good plan that will ensure that the diseases caused by sewage are not situations that are dealt with. Through vigilance and presence of mind, the occurrence of these diseases can be avoided entirely."

Or in a calorifier where an electrical coil is used to produce the heat. These boilers tend to scale up very greatly if the water is hard, primarily if the temperature is high accordingly. Frequently, such boilers also start to rust after a few years and this is why stainless steel boilers are used to a greater extent today. Merus clears the scale in the boilers if used properly and this scale is then flushed out with the water. Existing rust deposits are partially dissolved and converted. At boilers heated electrically might occure the problem of less efficiency, if the coil gives a strong electrical field. These electrical heating systems may emit fields, which impair the\n\naction of Merus so only slight scale removal occurs. Generally, only the build-up of scale again is greatly reduced in such cases. See as well the case study Water in Fitness Clubs or a Public Pool in the city of Munich."

In a five-month project begining January 2004, final year B pharma students of Gupta College of Technological Sciences in Asansol, West Bengal did exactly that. The students had to undertake a project in order to fulfill the requirements of their undergraduate course. The high incidence of water borne diseases such as jaundice, amoebiasis and colitis in the Asansol sub-divsion of West Bengal's Burdwan district impelled them to analyse the region's surface and groundwater.\n\nA team of four -- Mrinal Kanti Ghosh, Arnab Mondal, Pranabesh Chakraborty and this author -- first collected water from different sources including the river Damodar, the main source of water supply of Asansol. Water from deep tube wells -- that are used for drinking and agricultural purposes in the area -- was also put under scrutiny, as was drinking water supplied to the local government hospital.\n\nThe samples were then put to different tests in the college laboratory; these included verifying quantities of salts such as chlorides, bicarbonates and sulphates (acute salinity renders water unfit for drinking) and ascertaining concentrations of chemicals such as nitrogen and phosphorous.\n\nThe researchers knew full well that arsenic poisoning of groundwater affects 19 districts of West Bengal. So they decided to check the samples for this chemical as well.\n\nLittle solace The concentration of the inorganic salts as well as chemicals such as nitrogen and phosphorous were well below the threshold level. Arsenic was absent in most samples, in a few samples it was present in small quantities -- far below the World Health Organization's stipulated limit of 0.05 micrgrammes per litre. Even dissolved oxygen levels showed no cause for alarm. But there was little solace. Coliform count of the samples was between 150-290 per millilitre (ml, see graph: Asansol's dirty water). This when the New Delhi-based Central Pollution Control Board specifies that coliform count in drinking water should not be more than 5,000 per 100 ml (50 per ml). Most alarmingly, water from taps in Asansol's district hospital was a high 290 per ml.\n\nThis explains The chances of bacterial contamination of water were quite rife. The researchers then decided to undertake a sugar fermentation test to check this out. Sure as hell, the bacteria was there. The samples were tested positive for E.coli, Shigella and Enterobacter.\n\nThese bacteria are known to affect the human intestine. The contamination could have been caused by sewage mixing with drinking water. It could also have been a result of careless water treatment. Let us not forget that such neglect has already been reported in the treatment of Kolkata's drinking water.\n\nCreate awareness Below-poverty line tribals constitute a major part of Asansol's population. They neither have the wherewithal to afford expensive water purifying devices nor are they aware of the contamination to adopt safety measures such as boiling water. Creating general awareness about water contamination could help improve matters. Proper sanitary measures, safe disposal of hazardous and biomedical wastes along with careful treatment of both drinking as well as sewage water by the government would go a long way in improving water quality and also the health of people of Asansol.\n\nAnamika Sengupta is lecturer at the Gupta College of Technological Sciences, Asansol, West Bengal"

Friendly bacteria are\nhaving their lunch in nitrate-laden drinking water with only a small burp to\nshow for it. A free lunch? It appears to be the case. The burp is harmless\nnitrogen gas that already makes up 80 percent of the air we breathe.\n\nThe Orange County Water District (OCWD) is operating the country's first and\nonly experimental treatment plant using bacteria and sulfur as a nutrient to\neliminate virtually all unwanted nitrate from a drinking water well. Faced\nwith the increasingly common problem of high nitrates in groundwater, OCWD\nresearchers developed a sulfur-based biological denitrification facility that\nuses ThiobaciIlus denitrificans, an autotrophic sulfur oxidizing\nbacterium, to reduce nitrate levels to 0.3 milligrams per liter, far below\nacceptable levels. The federal and state\nmaximum contaminant level for nitrate is 45 milligrams per liter. The beauty\nof the treatment system is the lack of residual materials that require\ndisposal or have the potential to contaminate the air, soil, or another water\nsource, said district officials. By-products are only clean water and harmless\nnitrogen gas.\n\nThis new, biological treatment technology also has the potential to\nsignificantly reduce the cost of water denitrification compared to current\nprocesses. Initial tests indicate as much as a 60 percent reduction in\ntreatment costs to remove nitrate from water compared to reverse osmosis, and\nabout half the cost of ion exchange processes. These two treatment\ntechnologies have been considered state-of-the-art up to this time.\n\nThe OCWD pilot plant is located in Garden Grove, California. It treats\napproximately 25 gallons of water per minute. Preliminary results indicate\ngreat success at nitrate removal, although the water currently is discharged\nto the sewer because of the experimental nature of the project. If the plant\nmeets technical, economic, and reliability goals, the next step will be a\nfacility that produces 250-500 gallons per minute. The current facility will\noperate as a pilot project for approximately two years in order to determine\nwhether a full production plant is warranted. The project is a cooperative\neffort among OCWD, Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, and the\nCity of Garden Grove."

It goes by many names including tibicos, sugar kefir, Japanese water crystals, California bees, African bees, balm of Gilead, ginger beer plant and vinegar bees.\n\nThe culture feeds on sugar, producing lactic acid, alcohol (or vinegar if left too long) and carbon dioxide gas, which in a sealed container, will carbonate the resulting beverage.\n\nThe bacteria and yeasts which occur in water kefir grains will vary depending upon the climate, hygiene conditions and other factors, but typically include Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Pediococcus and Leuconostoc bacteria with yeasts from Saccharomyces, Candida and Kloeckera being most common. Lactobacillus brevis has been identified as the species responsible for the production of the polysaccharide (dextran) that holds the grains in shape.\n\nFor the following recipes, use around 1/3 cup of wet water kefir grains. Remove some as necessary when they grow, maintaining between 1/3 cup and 1/2 cup of grains per litre of sugar water.\n\nIf desired, you may double the recipes as your kefir grains grow. Of course, you will also need to use a larger glass jar.\n\nAllowing the grains to come into contact with water that is 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 40 degrees Celsius may kill or harm your grains. The kefir culture can survive cool or even cold temperatures, but it has very little tolerance to heat. The ideal brewing temperature is around 70 degrees Fahrenheit or 20 degrees Celsius.\n\n1 litre or 1 quart of filtered water, a quarter of which has been boiled\n\n1/3 cup sugar (raw, white, brown, dark brown, rapidura, muscovado)\n\n1/3 cup wet (hydrated) water kefir grains\n\nIt is important to either filter the water or leave it to stand for 24 hours to remove the chlorine as otherwise the chlorine will inhibit the growth of the grains.\n\nPlace the sugar in the bottom of a glass jar which is 50% bigger than the amount of kefir you are brewing, i.e. 1.5 litres/quarts for the above quantities. Pour the recently boiled water onto the sugar and stir until dissolved. Add the remaining cold water, stir, then add the water kefir grains and cover with plastic wrap or place the lid on loosely so that air can escape as it builds up during the fermentation.\n\nFlavoring options which can be added during the fermentation process include:\n\nbanana (good source of potassium)\n\napple\n\nginger\n\nAllow the brew to sit in a cupboard for 1-3 days depending upon the temperature and how sweet you like it, then decant the liquid into bottles with a half teaspoon of extra sugar per single serve bottle (around 300ml) if you wish the end product to be carbonated, which will require an additional day or two's fermentation with the lid tightly sealed, otherwise decant and refrigerate or enjoy over ice straight away.\n\nFlavouring options which are best added after the grains have been removed include:\n\nbottled or frozen fruit juice or juice concentrates (add one part juice to four parts water kefir when bottling. Do not add any other sugar at this stage, there is enough sugar in the fruit to create a carbonated beverage).\n\npureed fresh fruit (for example peaches, lychees and pears)\n\ncordials\n\nherbal infusion (mix one part strong brewed cold herbal tea with one part water kefir)\n\nAlternatively you can use a juice or coconut water as a culture base instead of sugar water. Clear grape, apple and berry juices are good options.\n\nRemove the kefir grains by straining the liquid through a fine mesh (nylon is good), then add the flavouring to the strained liquid and allow it to ferment at room temperature for a further day before bottling or refrigerating.\n\nWater kefir is a good probiotic alternative for people who don't want to drink dairy-based kefir or tea-based kombucha"

This was done by shaking 3 gm. of the powders with an excess of water, throwing on a filter and permitting to drain quite thoroughly, and then weighing the moist powders. All experiments were made at the same time, so as to make the results comparable. They are shown in the accompanying table.\n\nCONCLUSIONSThe commonly used dusting powders do not differ very materially in their capacity for holding water. However, starch, kaolin and fullers' earth are more effective than chalk or talcum"

The hospital has a supply of bottled water for medications and is using bagged water for bathing. More bottled water has been ordered for the hospital. The Saint John Regional Hospital is also affected, but the hospital's water supply has been isolated from the city and the hospital is using its own reservoir.\n\nA boil water advisory is issued when the Department of Health receives information that indicates a public water supply is a health risk for consumers.During a boil water advisory, it is important that all water destined for drinking, preparing infant formulas and juices, washing fruits and vegetables, cooking and dental hygiene be held at a rolling boil for one minute. Unless advised differently by the Department of Health, under most circumstances it is not necessary to boil water used for other household purposes.\n\nAdults, adolescents and older children may shower, bathe or wash using tap water but should avoid swallowing the water. Toddlers and infants should be sponge-bathed, and caregivers need to ensure that no water is swallowed. Dishes and laundry may be washed in tap water, either by hand or by machine, unless advised differently by a Department of Health representative"

      "text": "1. Why do I need to filter my water?\n\nThe human body is 60 - 80% water. Every five to 10 days we need to replace all of our body's water to keep functioning smoothly, efficiently and to maintain good health. It is important to replenish our bodies water with clean, pure, filtered water. Our filters are long-lasting, reliable, and provide water filtered down to 1 micron (a human hair is about 100 microns) to prevent long-term health risks due to gradual buildup of toxins, heavy metals, chemicals and chlorine.\n\nMost municipal water systems are chlorinated to kill bacteria and viruses. However, the chlorine can form carcinogenic compounds, such as trihalomethanes and chloroform. Also, this water still has to travel through miles of pipes before it enters your home. The pipes are usually not clean and contain heavy metals from solder joints, fixtures, etc. The only way to ensure that your drinking water is free of contaminants is to filter it yourself in your home or office.\n\n2. What can I do to improve the safety of the water in my home?\n\nYou can install a home water filter. One of the easiest and most effective filtration devices is a system that treats water at a single point of use for drinking, cooking and watering plants. This can easily be installed as a countertop unit, or an undercounter unit with a separate faucet. It is also important to use a shower filter to remove chlorine while you shower.\n\n3. Isn't bottled water easier, cheaper and just as safe?\n\nIt is perfectly legal to bottle water from wells, springs and even public tap water. You could actually be carrying home water bottles containing the same low quality water that comes out of your faucet. Bottled water is not always free of contaminants either, in 1990 a test by the Suffolk County, New York Health Dept. found that 9 of 88 brands tested did not meet state and Federal drinking water standards, even Perrier had that recall due to Benzene contamination. Sometimes you can even taste and smell the plastic water bottle. Also if water is bottled and sold within the same state, it is not subject to EPA regulations. Finally, bottled water is much more expensive than a home filter system, averaging about a dollar a gallon in comparison to less than 10 cents a gallon.\n\n4. What about water pitcher filters or faucet-mount filters?\n\nIn our business, we refer to these as \"feel good\" filters. You get to \"feel good\" that you're doing something about your water quality, however, these small filter elements tend to be ineffective against everything but Chlorine, taste and odor. Also, they are very expensive to use and need frequent filter replacement.\n\n5. Why should I be concerned with filtering my shower water?\n\nYou can absorb more chlorine through your skin and lungs in one shower then you can in all the tap water you could drink in a day. Chlorine not only dries your skin and hair, studies show that long-term exposure to chlorine has been linked to various cancers, and, recently, to increased risk of miscarriage.\n\nFirst of all, let's review for the record what distilled water is — its water that has been turned into steam so its impurities are left behind. The steam is then condensed to make absolutely pure water. The process of distillation kills and removes all bacteria, viruses, heavy metals, and other organic and inorganic contaminants. Once distilled, the water is as pure as water can be.\n\nA number of myths — some quite extreme — have grown up over the years about distilled water. A quick Internet search today will take you to sites that put forth such views as \"distilled water leads to early death.\"\n\nThis is nonsense.\n\nOne claim holds that distillation removes all of water's beneficial minerals. While it's true that distillation removes minerals as well as various contaminants from water, we don't know that the human body can readily absorb minerals from water. We get our minerals from food, not water. By one estimate, you would have to drink 676 liters of tap water in Winnipeg to reach the daily recommended dose of calcium.\n\nNot only is distilled water not dangerous, it's the purest form of water possible!\n\n7. What is distilled water?\n\nDistilled water is water that has been heated to the boiling point so that impurities are separated from the water, which itself becomes vapor or steam. The steam is then condensed back into pure liquid form.\n\nThe impurities remain as residue and are removed. Pure Water Distillation Systems remove waterborne biological contaminants such as bacteria, viruses, organic and inorganic chemicals, heavy metals, volatile gases, cysts and other contaminants. Distilled water contains virtually no solids, minerals or trace elements. It is clean, natural and healthy. Steam distilled water is the standard by which all other waters are measured.\n\n8. My water tastes really bad, what is causing this and how can it be fixed?\n\nVarious odours and tastes may be present in water. They can be traced to many conditions. Unfortunately, the causes of bad taste and odour problems in water are so many; it is impossible to suggest a single treatment that would be universally effective in controlling these problems.\n\nTastes are generally classified in four groups - sour, salt, sweet and bitter. Odours possess many classifications. There are 20 of them commonly used and they are further classify terms of their intensity from very faint, faint, distinct and decided to very strong. If you are conscious of a distinct odour, without specifically seeking for such, the water is in need of treatment.\n\nIn many cases, it is difficult to determine what constitutes a taste and what constitutes an odour. The reason is obvious. Both the taste buds and olfactory organs work so effectively as a team, it is hard to realize where one leaves off and the other begins.\n\nIn a case like this sometimes the best thing is to go directly to distilled water.\n\n9. What colour is water?\n\nOrdinarily we think of water as being blue in colour. When artists paint bodies of water, they generally colour them blue or blue-green. While water does reflect blue-green light, it should appear colourless in the home.\n\nIdeally, water from the tap should have no colour. If such is the case, there are certain foreign substances in the water. The colour in water is primarily from vegetable matter and is extracted from leaves and aquatic plants.\n\nAll surface waters possess some degree of colour. Like some shallow wells, springs and an occasional deep well can contain noticeable colouring. In general, water from deep wells is practically colourless.\n\nHighly coloured water is objectionable. While colour is not a factor of great concern to your health, excessive colour lacks appeal from an aesthetic standpoint in potable water. In general, colour is reduced or removed from water through the use of filtration techniques.\n\n10. Our Lake has been contaminated by coliform bacteria. How can I make sure that the water is safe to drink?\n\nA. Water is the breeding ground for an almost unbelievably large variety of organisms. Water does not produce these organisms. It merely is an ideal medium in which they can grow. These organisms gain entry into water through a variety of sources. They enter the water supply from all sorts of natural causes, surface drainage and sewage.\n\nThe most effective and economical method of treating water for a household is to use ultraviolet light. The use of ultraviolet light is an attempt to imitate nature.\n\nSunlight destroys bacteria in the natural purification of water, but that takes a lot of time. Exposing water to pure ultraviolet light destroys any dangerous organisms in the water. To assure that the treatment works, the water must be free of any solids down to 5 Microns and must be filtered first. Otherwise, some bacteria will be protected from the germ-killing ultraviolet rays.\n\nSince ultraviolet light adds nothing to the water it will not creating taste or odour problems and has no residual effect on the water. These systems do require maintenance to ensure that sufficient ultraviolet energy is reaching the water while in the ultraviolet chamber.\n\nThis is a possible solution but there are others, it all depends on the individual situation.\n\n11. What is the difference between filtering, reverse osmosis (RO) and distilling?\n\nFiltering\nWhat filters do well . . .\nFiltering is the most cost-effective as a pre-treatment to your water. Filters range in size depending on how much water is required and can produce the largest quantity of water. Various types of filters can be used to solve any number of water problems. Washable pleated filters and poly-spun fiber filters are used to remove sediment from the water. Carbon filters can be used to remove colour and taste from the water. Other specialty filters can be added as they are needed to treat the water.\n\nWhat filters do not do well . . .\nFilters have the ability to remove particles as small as .5 microns, but such fine filtration is not economical for the whole house and seriously reduces water pressure. Water must also be treated for organisms before (chlorination used in municipal water supplies) or after (Ultraviolet light treatment) the filtration process.\n\nReverse Osmosis (RO)\nWhat Reverse Osmosis does well . . .\nReverse Osmosis is often referred to as micro-filtration. This process involves forcing contaminated water through a synthetic, semi-permeable membrane at very high pressure. RO at peak efficiency (when the membrane is new) reduces certain contaminants by 70 - 90%. The purity of the water depends on fluctuating water pressure, age (breakdown) of the membrane, and clogging of the membrane pores. RO works really well at removing salt from water when using a water softener.\n\nWhat Reverse Osmosis does not do well . . .\nRO systems use a large amount of water - anywhere from 6 gallons to get 1 gallon of treated water. Although the RO system uses no electricity, they can be quite costly to maintain. RO is not recommended when very high contamination of toxic chemicals is present. The RO unit may not be able to remove enough of the chemical to make it safe to drink. RO is also very susceptible to bacterial growth and should only be used on pretreated water.\n\nDistilling\nWhat Distillation does well . . .\nDistillation is a method where water is removed from the contaminants rather than trying to remove contaminants from the water. Distillation involves boiling water, capturing the steam, cooling it and condensing it back to liquid. Materials that have a higher boiling point than water will not rise with the steam. Most contaminates have a higher boiling point than water and therefore will not rise with the steam. Contaminates that vaporize before the water are vented off so only water vapor is left. A distiller will remove up to 99.5% of all contaminants in the water. Distillers are also very easy to maintain and clean.\n\nWhat Distillation does not do well . . .\nDistillers require energy to raise the temperature of the water. Although they are energy efficient, they do require a small amount of electricity, which is an ongoing cost. Distillers also have a difficult time removing volatile organic compounds (VOC). VOCs are man made chemicals that turn to steam and condense at the same temperature as water. Good quality distillers have built in features to remove VOCs. Heat dissipated from the condensation coils can raise the temperature in the room that the distiller is located in. Distillers are only really effective and economical for drinking water."

      "text": "Ultrasound Cleaning of Ceramic Filters to Aid Water Treatment\n\nThis short paper reviews recent research into the ultrasound cleaning of ceramic water filters, which may some day allow water treatment plants to purify water with ceramic membrane filters instead of traditional water treatment chemicals.\n\nEngineers at Ohio State University claim to have discovered how to clean high-tech ceramic water filters at low cost using ultrasound.\n\nAlthough the research is still in its early stages, they claim the technology may one day allow water treatment plants to purify water with ceramic membrane filters instead of traditional water treatment chemicals.\n\nHarold Walker, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering and geodetic science at Ohio State University said \"If water treatment plants could clean water with membrane filters, they could minimize the cost, safety and disposal issues associated with the use of harsh chemicals,\"\n\nResearchers are currently studying ceramic membrane filters, honeycomb networks of micro-channels separated by thin ceramic membranes. As water passes through the micro-channels, the ceramic membranes act to filter contaminants including clay, iron oxide, bacteria and viruses. However, over time these membranes become clogged and require cleaning.\n\nUltrasound and bubbles\n\nWalker took note of recent research involving ultrasound and bubbles. The idea, most recently reported by scientists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and their colleagues, is that sound waves can form and collapse bubbles inside a liquid, releasing heat and energy.\n\nTo test whether collapsing bubbles could clean a ceramic filter, the engineers submerged a filter in water that contained latex and silica particles. They used particles in a range of sizes to mimic the contaminants found in water treatment.\n\nThey used an ultrasonic probe to vibrate the water at 20 Kilohertz, a low frequency that is easily obtainable with typical ultrasound equipment. For example, the fetal ultrasound tests that women undergo during pregnancy employ much higher frequencies, in the order of 10 Megahertz. But that doesn't mean a 20 Kilohertz probe is less powerful, Linda Weavers, also assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering and geodetic science at Ohio State University, explained.\n\n\"Frequency has nothing to do with power. Think of it as bass sounds versus soprano sounds. Both can be louder or softer. Whether a sound is bass or soprano depends on frequency, whereas loudness and softness depend on power,\" she said.\n\nThe 20 Kilohertz vibrations caused bubbles to form and collapse, and kept the ceramic filter clean.\n\n\"The bubbles seemed to scour the surface of the filter,\" Weavers said. \"Where the bubbles collapsed, tiny water jets formed and flushed away the contaminants.\"\n\nThough the engineers are still not certain exactly how the process works, Weavers suspects that the jets sprang from vibrational nodes, locations along the surface of the filter where ultrasonic waves merge together and magnify each other.\n\nWith ultrasound as a cleaning method, water treatment plants wouldn't have to remove filters from use to clean them, Walker said. Loosened contaminants would wash away in an exhaust flow separate from the clean water.\n\n\"If you left the ultrasound running, you could clean a filter while it was still in use, and keep it from ever getting clogged in the first place,\" Weavers added.\n\nIf all goes well, Walker said, the technology may be ready for full-scale testing in a water treatment plant within the next few years."

(Photo: quinn.anya/Flickr)\n\nBottled water is healthy water — or so marketers would have us believe. Just look at the labels or the bottled water ads: deep, pristine pools of spring water; majestic alpine peaks; healthy, active people gulping down icy bottled water between biking in the park and a trip to the yoga studio.\n\nIn reality, bottled water is just water. That fact isn't stopping people from buying a lot of it. Estimates variously place worldwide bottled water sales at between $50 and $100 billion each year, with the market expanding at the startling annual rate of 7 percent.\n\nBottled water is big business. But in terms of sustainability, bottled water is a dry well. It's costly, wasteful and distracts from the brass ring of public health: the construction and maintenance of safe municipal water systems.\n\nWant some solid reasons to kick the bottled water habit? We've rounded up five to get you started.\n\n1) Bottled water isn't a good value\n\nTake, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks — and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.\n\nNow consider another widely sold liquid: gasoline. It has to be pumped out of the ground in the form of crude oil, shipped to a refinery (often halfway across the world), and shipped again to your local filling station.\n\nIn the U.S., the average price per gallon is hovering around $3. There are 128 ounces in a gallon, which puts the current price of gasoline at a fraction over 2 cents an ounce.\n\nAnd that's why there's no shortage of companies that want to get into the business. In terms of price versus production cost, bottled water puts Big Oil to shame.\n\n2) No healthier than tap water\n\nIn theory, bottled water in the United States falls under the regulatory authority of the Food and Drug Administration. In practice, about 70 percent of bottled water never crosses state lines for sale, making it exempt from FDA oversight.\n\nOn the other hand, water systems in the developed world are well-regulated. In the U.S., for instance, municipal water falls under the purview of the Environmental Protection Agency, and is regularly inspected for bacteria and toxic chemicals. Want to know how your community scores? Check out the Environmental Working Group's National Tap Water Database.\n\nWhile public safety groups correctly point out that many municipal water systems are aging and there remain hundreds of chemical contaminants for which no standards have been established, there's very little empirical evidence that suggests bottled water is any cleaner or better for you than its tap equivalent.\n\n3) Bottled water means garbage\n\nBottled water produces up to 1.5 million tons of plastic waste per year. According to Food and Water Watch, that plastic requires up to 47 million gallons of oil per year to produce. And while the plastic used to bottle beverages is of high quality and.\n\n4) Bottled water means less attention to public systems\n\nMany people drink bottled water because they don't like the taste of their local tap water, or because they question its safety.\n\nThis is like running around with a slow leak in your tire, topping it off every few days rather than taking it to be patched. Only the very affluent can afford to switch their water consumption to bottled sources. Once distanced from public systems, these consumers have little incentive to support bond issues and other methods of upgrading municipal water treatment.\n\n.\n\n5) The corporatization of water\n\nIn the documentary film Thirst, authors Alan Snitow and Deborah Kaufman demonstrated the rapid worldwide privatization of municipal water supplies, and the effect these purchases are having on local economies.\n\nWater is being called the \"Blue Gold\" of the 21st century. Thanks to increasing urbanization and population, shifting climates and industrial pollution, fresh water is becoming humanity's most precious resource.\n\nMultinational corporations are stepping in to purchase groundwater and distribution rights wherever they can, and the bottled water industry is an important component in their drive to commoditize what many feel is a basic human right: the access to safe and affordable water.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nThere's a simple alternative to bottled water: buy a stainless steel thermos, and use it. Don't like the way your local tap water tastes? Inexpensive carbon filters will turn most tap water sparkling fresh at a fraction of bottled water's cost.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nJoin the conversation\n\nMunicipal water is costing me $400 dollars a month from DWP, if we us any more water for drinking it will cost me another $200 dollars a month vs $10 a month with bottled water.\n\nThe municipal system is gauging the population, and it is ridiculous how much the municipal system is charging us for one of earth's free resources. So I vote for bottled water if it is the same as tap water; it's cheaper to drink than DWP's water!\n\nHow much are you spending for gas per month??? Gas being at $4.00 per gallon and bottled water being maybe $5-7.00 per gallon. Think of the savings when you buy water pitcher with carbon filter and a personal water bottle. Filter in pitcher purifies your water even better than bottled kind... Your pocketbook will look better. I don't believe water bill could be that high unless you water your lawn all day every day. Our water bill is less than $5 per month...\n\nWhere is everyone gettinf these prices from? I can buy a gallon if water for 99 cents from any supermarket in FL....... Yes, if you pay for gallons if water by the little bottles it could cost more; but, if i buy premium fuel it could cost. I applaude anyone that chooses water iver soda, and if they are thirsty while on the go rhen buy a gallon of water and a cup of ice and call ut day. I pay around 3.50 for regular fuel by the gallin, and 99 cents for water by the gallon.\n\nIf you are buying individual bottles at the ridiculous markup, then MAYBE bottled would cost you that much. However, if you smart, you would be buying in larger quantities (such as 5 gallon bottles) and paying most likely around $1.50 a gallon. This whole argument that bottled water costs more than gas is ridiculous. I wish my gas only cost me $1.50 a gallon! And a carbon filter is no where near the level of filtration that bottled water companies use. Most use reverse osmosis with ozone and uv sterilization.\n\nThe best option though is to find a good spring water so you also get the nutrients and minerals that your body need from its water without the nasty chemical that the city adds in and pollutants from the surface water sources that most tap water comes from. Which, by the way, a carbon filter will not remove.\n\nHow do you get away with spending only $10 a month on bottled water? (I don't know how much you pay for water in the States, but in Aus we pay on average $2-$3 for a 600ml bottle). Sounds like you need to drink more water, anyhoo - and tap water is always going to be cheaper!\n\nSorry but your post doesn't make any sense. You attribute your bill to drinking water when I suspect you bill reflects your usage for drinking, showers, dishwasher, laundry and of course your lawn. How you came up with another $200.00 if you drink tap water is just unfathomable. Please explain. There is no info regarding the number of people in your household and how much water they drink a day. The biggest 'use' of water is your shower and your toilets. I suggest you don't make blanket statements\n\nI am amazed at this one sided view of this article and the entertaining comments that follow.\nFirst of all, let's get this straight, tap water is poisoned, it's full of toxic chemicals, and please don't believe me, all you have to do is pay a few dollars and take a sample to a lab and test it out. You'll be surprised by how many chemicals you are drinking from that.\n2nd, I am tired of all the advertising and propaganda from water filter companies and steal bottle resellers, they are so quick to put\n\ntheir blurb in by telling us how bad bottled water is and then they recommend their product with a link, in fact, most anti-bottled water propaganda is from water filter companies, they must really missing their budgets.\n3rd, I am definitely not a fan of coke or pepsi or any of their products, in fact I'm not a fan of any product that does not add health/nutrition to the body.\nBUT, please, understand that the filtering process that these companies put their water through is by far much more complex than your $200-$2000 home machine, so you'll never get the same filteration or the same water quality, so stop comparing their bottled water to your tap or to your filtered tap water.\n4th, the only bottles that contain chemicals that leach into the water, eg, BPA, are the large home/office delivered bottles, NOT the bottles you buy from a convenience store. AND how can you be so concerned of these chemicals when the chemicals in the tap water you are drinking are way more toxic and dangerous than the ones from the bottle to start with.\nWe all need water to survive, it really annoys me to see ant-bottled water comments, because if there are no bottled water, then there's only unhealthy beverages left to drink, and unfortunately most people don't know what is healthy and what's not, and many are not aware of the effects of sweeteners, preservatives and flavours in foods are. People are so vulnerable to fall for unhealthy vitamin waters and sports drinks, etc.\nThe best water to drink is natural mineral water from a tested and an approved spring, but since we all don't live next to a spring, the next best thing is bottled natural mineral water, only bottled water with the words \"natural mineral water\" is protected under international laws to be bottled from the source and adulterated or processed. These waters are normally slightly alkaline and have natural minerals which are beneficial to our health, unlike RO, or spring water that is dead water.\nAs far as where the bottles end up, this is not the problem of the bottle or the bottlers, this is a human problem. BUT at least the bottles are recyclable, water filters are NOT, they end up in landfills.\nMy advice is do your own research and drink the healthiest water you can get. If you want to save money, get a filter, if you want to save your life, drink natural alkaline mineral water.\nIf you think you are saving money drinking tap water, you wrong and ignorant because YOU WILL GET SICK and it will cost you more to get your health back if you don't get a terminal disease or die.\n\nIt's not just the water. If the water is not healthful enough you should be taking that up with your municipality. But what about all the trash that the plastic causes, all the damage and the ingestion of plastics by fish and then of course up the food chain to us? Think about that for a while.\n\nYou are absolutely right! How many people would be buying a soda or some other unhealthy drink if there wasn't an option for bottled water? At least people are trying to make a healthy choice. And there are bottled water companies who are providing a much healthier SPRING water and being eco friendly in the process. Plus, there are companies who even provide a 5 gallon option in BPA free plastic bottles. People shouldn't bash the industry as a whole, but try to make a more informed decision about\n\nI try to live a healthy and informed lifestyle, and in doing so, I try to do a lot of research. As I was reading this article, I was disappointed to see how one-sided and opinionated.\nI saw the documentary 'Food Inc.' (and learned a lot), and because of this article, I will watch the recommended documentary 'Thirst'. I know many commodities (such as food and bottled water), have been grossly corporatized, and it's very unfortunate, because many consumers are misled, misinformed, and misguided (\n\nbiased research/reports/articles, aggressive media campaigns, subjugating competitors), but that's not reason enough to say don't drink bottled water, and drink tap water instead (which are two unfounded statements).\nYour reason number 1) Saying bottled water isn't a good value - what basis do you have to determine bottled water's value? You generalize ALL bottled water (which in itself is not fair to do), then skip all other variants of bottled water going right to Pepsi's Aquafina and Coca-Cola's Dasani, then disqualify your generalized version of bottled water by saying, \"These two brands are essentially filtered tap water\" (Many other companies providing bottled water use the same type of source - municipal water), then you fix their price at $1 for a 20oz. bottle (which you suggest is a good deal for that particular product. Note that many brands of bottled water can be purchased for $1/gallon - including Crystal Geyser and Arrowhead. This is VERY common), then you compare it to your estimated U.S. national average price of $3/gallon of gasoline (Site your source. Who said this, when was the study done, how was the study conducted, what type of gasoline. I'm surprised you didn't start comparing it to milk). There are so many things wrong - in just your reason number one.\nYour reason number 2) So your saying the bottled water industry is not regulated? Under-regulated? How/why does it fall under FDA regulatory authority? What is/isn't monitored/regulated by the FDA? What type of water falls under your statistic of 70%? Is it ALL bottled water? (Note: I would like you to expand on this as I'm curious and want to be well informed). You say, \"there's very little empirical evidence that suggests bottled water is any cleaner or better for you than its tap equivalent\". First, not all tap water is the same (just like not all bottled water is the same). Second, your supposed lack of evidence saying bottled water is cleaner or better than tap doesn't necessarily mean it's the same.\nYour reason number 3) Yes, plastic itself is polluting, and can be toxic (BPA). But don't discredit bottled water because of it. Instead, suggest recycling, or using glass bottles (here, suggesting filtered tap water is a viable alternative, albeit, not as healthy). We as a society do need a stronger campaign against plastic pollution.\nYour reason number 4) This is an interesting idea, but I'm not sure it's a strong argument.\nYour reason number 5) Yes, I agree bottled water has been corporatized. I don't like it either.\n\nActually, municipal water is legally tested for bacteria every four hours whereas bottled water is only tested weekly. Even then, if the bottled water is being sold within the same state as production there are no obligatory safety standards WHATSOEVER. That 'filtration' you go on about doesn't necessarily exist.\nAnd the packaging your talking about (polyethelyne terephthalate) IS found in all bottled water packaging - it's the most cost efficient and easy to produce and it DOES leach into your 'pure\n\nspring mountain' water. In fact it'll probably leach into your water before you even pick it up off the shelf.\nAs for bottles ending up in landfill, by buying bottled water you are creating a market for it. You are the cause for over-production.\nWhen tonnes of polyethelyne end up in landfill every year you don't quite understand the impact your excessive-consumerist American demands are having on the rest of the world. And to top it all off, you pay LESS for petrol in your car then you do for bottled water.\n\nI cannot believe how one-sided and extremely ignorant your thoughts are. clearly you have no consideration for the environment because if you did you would realize how much plastic is building up in the oceans and our landfills. for the same price you can also take a sample of bottled water to get tested at the lab and realize how many chemicals are in there. for the sake of the environment is is that hard to get a filter, yes they do work, and are you that big of a baby where you cannot withstand\n\na few harmless chemicals in your tap water? many generations have done it before us and they turned out just fine. stop being so selfish i was utterly shocked to see a comment so ignorant on this website.\n\nI used to feel the same way. Until I realized how much crap is in our public water. The kids today have a lot more to worry about than previous generations. There wasn't as much as a concern about all the drugs being dumped in our system, all the contaminants, not to mention the frack water thanks to the gas drilling. Now there is a mention of dangerous levels of radium. Plastic can be recycled. If I had an option to save a couple dollars on water or save my child's health, well the answer is obvious.\n\nWater from the tap is not unsafe. It has been filtered and tested beyond the standards of bottled water. If you really do not feel comfortable drinking tap water then you can clean it more with iodine or bleach. A few drops will do the trick. Also if the water has a chlorinated taste then you can let the water sit out on the counter for a couple days and the chlorine should dissipate.\nProblems with bottled water are way more serious than a taste factor with your tap water. Bottled water has chemicals\n\nthat leach into the water from the plastic bottle. The chemicals from the plastic in the water will cause cells in your body to mutate and form cancerous cells. I don't know of anyone that wants cancer.\nAlso when you throw away the bottle, where do you think it goes?? It doesn't just disappear. It collects in landfills and where ever people throw them. Plastic does not break down very quickly, in fact it will probably be around longer than your grand children's children.\nJust do the world a favor and drink your damn tap water.\n\nThis article provides a decent overview of some of the basics of what is wrong with bottled water. I wanted to point out from a health standpoint that bottled water coolers have some serious sanitation and contamination issues. In addition to the cost of bottled water, chemicals such as BPA are known to leak out of the plastic used in the 5 gallon jugs. More so, changing the bottles exposes the water to airborne contaminates and whatever germs/dirt that are on the hands of the individual that preforms\n\nThere are companies that are using PET bottles now for the 5 gallon bottles which are BPA free. And if you have seen a water cooler in the past 10 years, you would know that the new design makes it impossible for any contaminants from ones hand to get inside the cooler as they have a closed top and a probe that goes inside the cap on the bottled to extract the water. However, the filtered water coolers usually aren't getting service regularly and have been linked back to many sicknesses in office\n\nI reuse my plastic water bottles many many times and the I recycle. Yes I have heard the rumors that the plastic leaches some chemical that will kill me but I will make that sacrifice for the env. And plastic water bottles are very easy to recycle. As opposed to:\nI meet many people who complain about plastic water bottles and when I ask what they use they say \"a reusable bottle\" (that's what my plastic one is..) And if I ask them what is it made of they can't tell me. Many of these bottles have\n\nmultiple metals which are hard to separate. They include lids and bases and liners that contain more plastic then 100 water bottles.\nPlease before you jump on this \"I hate bottle water\" bandwagon consider the whole picture and the alternatives.\nReuse!!!!! Recycle!!!! Don't be fooled or blind.\n\nalright well since u reuse the chemical plastic i would like to say one thing , all your doing is digging up your own grave. Also they rarely recycle water bottles the companies dont want tha. They downcycle them meaning they either end up in landfills and stay thee for thousands of years or they burn them realsing harsh chemicals into the sair: by the way incase you didnt know is toxic pollution.\nAnd they mighjt recycle the prduct into lower quality products that will just be thrown out later..."

In Japan,\nthis water is known as \"functional water\" and is produced from a device known as\na water ionizer. This device is used in many homes and hospitals to help treat\nand prevent such conditions as acid reflux, arthritis, diabetes and many other\ncommon ailments that we consider to be the inevitable result of aging.\n\nSince 2003, this water has been available in the USA for\nhome use, through a machine called the Leveluk SD-501, manufactured by a company\ncalled Enagic. This small profile countertop device connects to your faucet and\nprovides ionized, alkalized, anti oxidizing Kangen Watertm.\n\nPlease call us at (800) 219-7368or\nE-Mail us with Kangen Watertm as the subject.\n\nAnti-aging and Alkaline\nDiet\n\nMr. Sang Y. Whang is a successful inventor, scientist and\nengineer. He explains the health and anti-aging process in his book,\nReverse Aging. Below is an excerpt from that book.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn order to learn how to get younger, we must understand the\nprocess of anti-aging and alkaline diet.\n\nHandling natural health improvement devices developed in\nJapan for a few years, I have witnessed as well as personally experienced\nmany mysterious phenomenon in the reverse aging effect.\n\nBeing a scientist, engineer, and inventor, I have tried to\nunderstand and explain the phenomenon scientifically, applying the scientific\nprinciples of those non-drug, natural health improvement devices. During the\ncourse of the study, I came to a realization of what the human aging process is\nabout. The greater news is that, with this new theory, the anti-aging process\ncan be explained, and anybody can get younger if he or she so desires.\n\nThe Aging Process\n\nWe get old because we are not disposing of all the internally\ngenerated wastes and toxins, and accumulate the leftovers within our body.\n\nFor our body to function and to maintain body temperature, we\nburn nutrients within our cells. The main ingredients of all foods, expensive or\ninexpensive, gourmet or junk, vegetable or meat, alkaline or acid, are either\ncarbohydrates, proteins or fats. And they are nothing but the combinations of\nfour elements: carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen.\n\nAfter these nutrients are burnt (oxidized) in the cells, they\nall turn into organic acids: carbonic acids, uric acids, lactic acids, fatty\nacids, ammonia, etc. Fats are acidic even before oxidation. The Chinese word for\noxygen is written with two characters, \"sahn-so\". They literally mean \"acid\nroot\".\n\nThese acidic wastes and toxins are disposed out of the body\nin liquid form, as urine or perspiration, after first being dissolved into the\nblood. Every element within our body was placed there by the blood and can come\nout of there by first being dissolved into the blood and being carried out. If\nanyone looses ten pounds by any dietary means, it can be said that most of that\nten pounds came out through the urine.\n\nUnfortunately, due to our life styles and environments (ie:\ntoo much ingestion, over-work, over-indulgence, not enough rest, staying up\nlate, not enough exercise, inadequate water consumption, smoking, pollution, low\nalkaline diet, etc.) the body cannot get rid of all the acidic waste products\nthat generates within. We accumulate these left over waste products somewhere\nwithin our body. This is the process of getting old.\n\nTo make matters worse, mixed with these\norganic acids are inorganic acid minerals such as chlorine, phosphor, and sulfur\nthat come in with most of our acidic foods: meat, grains and root crops. We\ndon't eat enough of alkaline diet (anti-aging) foods such as fruits and\nvegetables that contain inorganic alkaline minerals such as calcium, magnesium,\nsodium, potassium, etc.\n\nAlthough the amounts of inorganic\nminerals are small compared with the organic acid wastes that the body produces,\nthey contribute more towards the acid side. However, one more important thing to\nnote is that even if one does not eat any acidic food at all, as long as\ncarbohydrates and proteins are consumed, the body produces much more acidic\nwastes than the inorganic alkaline minerals can counteract.\n\nWe are born with high alkaline blood pH\nof 7.44. As we get older, the blood pH drops down to 7.35 or below. The blood pH\nreferred to here is the artery blood pH. The difference of 0.09 in pH value\nseems very small but since pH is logarithmic, the amount of hydroxyl ion\n(OH-) in 7.44 pH is 1.23 times that of 7.35 pH, because 10=1.2303.\n\nThe hydroxyl ion (OH-) is an oxygen\ndonor while the hydrogen ion (H+) is an oxygen taker. In other words, young\npeople carry 23% more of the oxygen donors in their blood than older people. No\nwonder they are more energetic.\n\nUric acid is nearly insoluble in water,\nalcohol, and ether, but soluble in solutions of alkaline salts. In other words,\nit becomes soluble in alkaline water. Arthritis and gout are caused by uric acid\ndeposited between the joints, non-dissolved due to the low alkalinity of an\nolder person's blood. Drinking acid free alkaline water will gradually elevate\none's blood pH and the gout will disappear naturally.\n\nAs we live with poor waste disposal\nsystems for a long period of time, some parts of our body build up more acids\nthan others, and they can clog up capillary vessels around those acidic areas.\nThis causes some organs to function in a sluggish manner. We feel tired and run\ndown sometimes for no reason what so ever, and adult diseases such as high blood\npressure, arthritis, diabetes, asthma, allergies, etc. start to set in. We\nsimply accept these phenomena as \"getting old.\""

      "text": "This is the third in a series of articles written on local drinking water sources and the Source Water Protection Program being implemented by the City of Seabrook.\n\nOne of the most basic needs of any community is safe and clean drinking water. That's why the City of Seabrook and other communities throughout the region have joined in on a group effort to develop and implement a local Source Water Protection Program.\n\nInstead of remediation, added chemical treatment, and investment in new technologies after a contamination event, protecting the source from contamination can be much more cost effective. If harmful pathogens and chemicals are kept out of the aquifers, lakes, and rivers that we use as drinking water then the risk to human health is lowered significantly. This first barrier – source water protection – is not the only barrier to safeguard human health against waterborne contaminant threats. Yet it is an important first step that can save money and decrease risks to human health.\n\nAs individual citizens, we all have an important role to play in the protection of our drinking water. Protecting our drinking water begins at home. How do your personal habits affect our drinking water? The first question to ask yourself is \"Where does your drinking water come from?\" While it does come from the faucet, the actual answer is the Gulf Coast Aquifer along with surface water.\n\nYou may be surprised to learn that the way we dispose of products we use in our home or farm can contribute to the contamination of our community's drinking water. You may be even more surprised to learn that a number of the products we use at home contain hazardous or toxic substances. The truth is, products like motor oil, pesticides, left-over paints or paint cans, flea collars, weed killers, household cleaners, and even a number of medicines contain materials that can be harmful to our drinking water.\n\nThe average American disposes of approximately one pound of this type of waste each year. Although the amount of any of these substances that you pour down your drain, put in your trash, or dump on the ground or into a lake may seem insignificant to you, try multiplying it by the number of people in the surrounding cities and towns.\n\nDon't Pour It Down the Drain! Anything you pour down your drain or flush down your toilet will enter your septic system or your community's sewer system. Using this method to dispose of products that contain harmful substances can affect your septic system's ability to treat human wastes. Once out of sight, these harmful substances can eventually contaminate both ground and surface water. In addition, most community wastewater treatment plants are not designed to treat many of these substances. Thus, they can eventually be discharged into surface water and cause contamination.\n\nDon't Put It in the Trash! In general, community landfills are also not equipped to handle hazardous materials. As rain passes through the landfill, the water can become contaminated by these products and eventually carry them into the groundwater and surface water.\n\nDon't Dump It on the Ground! Hazardous wastes that are dumped on or buried in the ground can contaminate the soil and either leach down into the groundwater or be carried into a nearby body of surface water by runoff during rainstorms.\n\nWhat Can I Do? Get informed and get involved! Communities can make a difference. If you think one person can't change the system, help form a group. You, alone or as a part of a group, can help educate your family, friends, and neighbors about the importance of safe drinking water in your community. Those interested in learning more can contact the City of Seabrook at 281-474-3286."

What is it suddenly a big cash cow when someone makes it all artsy and attaches some feel good message to the design?\n\nBah, imagine if it was 3D printed? The stream of jizz from the whacko technofetishists would be visible from Jupiter. Guaranteed some fruitcake would come along and ask if it will work on Mars and when we are sending a 3D printer there...\n\nBig time distillation or reverse osmosis needs lots of electricity.

Lets not forget that they are probably poverty stricken for a reason. Wars, bad government, or just extremely bad luck. What seems a simple project to us is often just impossible where its needed.\n\nAn easily made, easily moved, easily copied distilling bottle which provides drinking water from waste material is a start. Especially if it can be made more efficient than a sand pit. If they can line up dozens of the things in battery, it will just have to do.\n\nhalB:What the hell are poor people doing in an area where there isn't enough fresh water to grow crops, let alone keep them alive?\n\nWar, drought, economic unrest, it can happen in any society. Imagine living where you are when one day the money stops coming and the lights go out. This is most of the worlds reality.\n\nThe problem isn't just water, or fresh water, but \"clean\" water. Most of what you'll find nearby is contaminated. Storage methods in poverty stricken areas can be of extremely poor quality, or there may be no storage at all. Often they've been drinking from a river where someone upstream thought it would be a great idea to take a dump in it. They don't have the money or know how to treat their water chemically or run it through a filter. They use it as they find it, microbes and all.\n\nbelgianguy:I get the previous comments regarding the fact that this is based on already well-established technology (though implemented in an interesting way, I think, due to the use of internal pressure to direct the steam into the lower section rather than just using gravity) but your comment makes less sense. The only \"price\" in these, is what it takes you to make one. There are no \"parts\" to go missing because you can't buy one of these things. There is no equivalent of a \"Genius Bar\" because you build the thing yourself. You get the plans and make one from whatever is available, modifying the plans as necessary to fit your particular situation.\n\nI'm not sure why all the butthurt in this thread. The dude came up with a slightly novel way of doing evaporation distilling and then packaged it as a plan that can be utilized and modified by anyone if they so choose. What's with the poutrage?\n\nhalB:The problem with the logic is that there is people that will shoot them if they get too close. So, you're kinda forced to make the best of the situationIt seems there's a good reason you're not helping solve the world's problems. Where do you want to get plastic sheets for people dying of thirst in 3rd world countries?\n\nThe whole point of this is that it's something that can be built and used by the people who need it with zero cost, shipping or impact. One guy can show another guy who to build it and it's self perpetuating. Yes, evaporation is as old as the sun. That's not the point.\n\nI'd think it would be easier to just set up a small off shore rig designed to convert wave motion into electricity to boil the water. More expensive up front, but with better results over all.\n\ntzzhc4:If this is open source where the hell are the plans? I want some schematics so I can have my wife make one (my wife is a potter).\n\nThere's a bit of information here but I couldn't find any actual plans or parts lists. I'm also not convinced that the device would work as well as he says.\n\nHe talks about boiling the salt water to produce steam. Sure, a black surface in the sun will get hot but will it actually reach the boiling point without using reflectors to concentrate the light? And wouldn't a clear plastic top with a black bottom plate be a much better way of transferring heat to the water than the opaque container he's using?\n\nYou could get around the boiling-point issue by sealing the system completely and adding a small mechanical vacuum pump to remove most of the air, but I didn't see any mention of that on his site.\n\nAlso he shows how you remove the pan of fresh water, but doesn't mention that you need to dump out the leftover brine from the top section. Not a big deal, but it is an extra pail of water you need to haul around each day.\n\nHe does not say \"boiling\", simply pressure increases in a boiler as temperature rises, and steam, by which I assume he means evaporated water, is forced out, free of salt. I imagine boiling is not as necessary as with fresh water since bodies of salt water tend to flow.\n\nLooking at the object in the video, there appears to be a plastic sealing cap and some machined metal parts (could be hand produced, but I am not sure how frequently local metal workers would have had to produce such materials), which are not as widely available as stated.\n\nI remember when we learnedsat1va:I remember when we learnedOne of the big concerns is how to make something in desalinating a significant amount of water without needing the clear plastic film. Needs to be materials which absorbs the heat in a design which both separates the evaporated water while not allowing the heat to escape, because this needs to produce about three liters of water per person per day. Low production costs, low maintenance costs, available materials, simple production, and effectiveness make this a design task harder than people seem to believe.\n\nSo...guy improves on existing designs/theories and comes up with a potentially helpful, if not exactly groundbreaking device that might improve some people's lives, all while not profiting from it in any way?

Financially, it just doesn't make sense - some media commentators have gone so far as to call it a con. This year, Australians will spend half a billion dollars on bottled water. Every time a consumer buys bottled water, they are being price gouged. The charge for one litre of bottled water is up to 2,500 times the cost of tap water.\n\nThe increase in bottled water's popularity has also given rise to major environmental problems. For one thing, Australia is drowning in a sea of plastic bottles, which create massive amounts of landfill and litter our streets. And significant resources are needed to bottle, transport and refrigerate water, especially if that water is imported from overseas.\n\nThe manufacture of bottles for water squanders a non-renewable resource - oil. The road and air miles generated by transporting bottled water are a significant generator of greenhouse gases. The refrigeration needed for bottled water also causes emissions. And bottled spring water can sometimes put unsustainable pressure on natural aquifers.\n\nFrom a quality point of view, Australians are able to drink some of the best tap water in the world. But where people are unsure of their local tap water quality, switching to filtered tap water is an environmental and financial win-win for everyone."

Because it is chemically identical to non-radioactive iodide, the human body cannot distinguish it – which is what allows it to accumulate in the thyroid and eventually lead to cancer,\" says Dr. Joel Pawlak, associate professor of forest biomaterials. \"The material that we've developed binds iodide in water and traps it, which can then be properly disposed of without risk to humans or the environment.\"\n\nThe new material – a combination of hemicellulose, a byproduct of forest materials, and chitosan, crustacean shells that have been crushed into a powder – not only absorbs water, but can actually extract contaminates, such as radioactive iodide, from the water itself. This material, which forms a solid foam, has applications beyond radioactive materials. Pawlak and fellow researchers found that it has the ability to remove heavy metals – such as arsenic – from water or salt from sea water to make clean drinking water.\n\n\"In disaster situations with limited-to-no power source, desalinating drinking water is difficult, if not impossible. This foam could be brought along in such situations to clean the water without the need for electricity,\" Pawlak says. \"This material could completely change the way we safeguard the world's drinking water supply.\"\n\nThe foam, which is coated on wood fibers, is used like a sponge that is immersed in water. For smaller-scale applications, the foam could be used in something like a tea bag. Or on a larger scale, water could be poured through it like a filter"

      "text": "Author Anya Saretzky\n\nDuring the recent boil water advisory, I cowered in fear of what mysterious death-inducing microbes might be lurking in the innocuously clear water flowing readily from my faucet. My housemates and I threw huge pots of water on the stove and hoped for the best. Using boiled water to drink, wash dishes, and brush my teeth was extremely inconvenient — but it made me think about people who do not have access to clean water (let alone a running faucet) as a fact of life. Water has been declared a human right by the United Nations, and yet over a billion people lack access to clean water. It is staggering that so many live without one of life's most basic necessities. Americans easily forget that the municipal water system we so readily take for granted would be considered an unthinkable luxury for a large proportion of the globe. While we should be thankful for what we have, it seems callous not to make an effort in assisting those who are so dramatically less fortunate.\n\nAmericans spend around $10 billion on bottled water every year. We are paying for water in a form that is not only environmentally irresponsible but also unnecessary health-wise. In most communities in the United States, municipal tap water is of the same quality as bottled water. For those not convinced, buying a water filter will further purify their tap water. Drinking Water for India, a Lawrenceville-based, student-run nonprofit, builds wells in Indian villages for $1,000 each, serving some of the 200 million in the country who do not have access to clean water. If instead of spending $10 billion on redundant water we shared this disposable income with those who actually are in dire need of water access, 200 million Indians' water needs would be met — using only a one hundredth of the money we spend unnecessarily on bottled water.\n\n*Please visit DrinkingWaterforIndia.org or find a member of TCNJ's Amnesty International, or Water Watch to donate the dollar you were about to spend on a bottle of water to someone in genuine need.\n\nEt tu, Mr. Higgins?\n\nBy ANYA SARETZKY\n\nAn anonymous source from within So­dexo management told The Perspec­tive that the Library Café throws away \"at least ten pounds\" of uneaten food each evening, while across campus, dining services as a whole wastes over 150 pounds on a daily basis. The source would be fired if he or she were to give students free food after closing – and has been reprimanded in the past for at­tempting to do so. The source points out the glaring hypocrisy in Sodexo's enthu­siastic promotion of canned food drives while, simultaneously, unspoiled food that could easily be sent to local pantries is intentionally wasted.\n\nThough The College of New Jersey has distanced itself from Trenton by name, we nevertheless reside mere blocks away from a city in which nearly one in four indi­viduals live below the poverty line. Throughout the nation, the effects of the recession have re­sulted in a greater dependency on food stamps; today, an eighth of Americans and a quarter of children rely on government aid to feed them­selves. To those of us with unlimited college meal plans, our most pressing food-related problem may be the soggy quality of Eickhoff's grilled cheese. But hunger is a constant concern for millions of Americans, many of them TCNJ's close neighbors.\n\nJohn Higgins, general manager of So­dexo Dining Services, once again de­clined to comment for this article. Thus, the official rationale for allowing this shameful amount of food waste could not be ascertained; one might argue, however, that liability issues could arise if unused food were to be donated. But such objections have long been rendered obsolete. The Bill Emerson Good Samari­tan Act provides legal protection to donors that contribute food to nonprofit organi­zations in good faith. As our anonymous source rightly wonders, \"what are they los­ing by letting someone eat a meal?\"\n\nTo be sure, Sodexo is not alone in wast­ing food. Nationally, forty to fifty percent – over twenty-five million tons – of all food produced is never eaten. The United Nations Food Programme estimates that this waste alone could feed every hungry person in Africa. Considering that over a billion people in the world are living in hunger, with 3.5 million dying as a result of under-nutrition every year, it seems of little inconvenience to send a few dozen paninis to the Trenton Area Soup Kitchen.\n\nApart from the ubiquity of unnecessary hunger that could be easily remedied with the elimination of waste, guided food management is crucial in staving off cli­mate change. Indeed, the production of meat alone creates more greenhouse gas emissions than all forms of transportation combined, and the United States could cut its environmental impact in half by elimi­nating food-related waste.\n\nBy redirecting these pounds of perishables from the garbage can to the mouths of hungry people, TCNJ could also limit its contributions to toxic landfills, where food cannot decompose sustainably. What is the most sustainable way to dis­pose of food, you ask? Return it to the earth by composting. Unlike Princeton, Brown, Cornell, and Harvard, our \"pub­lic Ivy\" condemns all of its food waste to landfill doom. As TCNJ's paninis rot in heaps of garbage, they exude methane gas, which is twenty times more harmful to the environment than carbon dioxide.\n\nWhat is particularly tragic is that climate change, exacerbated by needless food waste, will actually worsen the problem of food insecurity in the developing world. By 2050, cli­mactic shifts will be responsible for decreased agricultural yields of up to twenty-two percent in Sub-Saharan Africa alone. As a result of this global decline in food produc­tion, ten to twenty percent more people worldwide will go hungry, with an estimated nineteen mil­lion children suffering from malnourish­ment.\n\nAs evidenced by its emphatic calls for canned food donations, Sodexo is clearly well aware of the needs that exist with­in our community. Unfortunately, the huge amount of food waste generated by dining services belies whatever com­mitment they purport to have made; So­dexo's claim that \"Dining Services at The College of New Jersey is on the forefront of implementing sustainable initiatives into its operations\" seems laughable in light of these ongoing practices. With each sandwich it sends to rot every eve­ning, Sodexo is carelessly throwing away its potential to facilitate positive environ­mental and humanitarian change.\n\nIn 2006, the overwhelming majority of emissions on campus came from heating and electricity, creating 39,649 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. This figure is equal to 87,412,096 pounds, or the amount of greenhouse gases generated by 7,625 cars in an average year. What can be taken from these statistics? The simple act of turning out the lights when leaving a room or shutting down a computer when logging off will have marked positive effects on our college's contribution to curbing climate change. While this may seem obvious, an evening stroll through campus or a visit to a deserted computer lab reveals that many individuals are not cognizant of the benefits of reducing energy use. Lights can be seen shining from windows every night and throughout the weekend in empty academic buildings and barren residential common rooms. Additionally, it is an anomaly to sit down to a computer that has to actually be turned on, even early in the morning when presumably no one has used it all night. After a recent Saturday visit to three of Holman Hall's computer labs, I found that only two of the sixty-one computers not in use had been shut down. Not surprisingly, the lights were on in two labs with no occupants. Judging by the energy usage in Holman, one would think there was a band of ghostly graphic designers in the building, working furiously to meet otherworldly deadlines. With the pressing need to act promptly to halt climate change, it is not much to ask to switch off lights and shut down computers.\n\nThe benefits of foods from local farms are manifold: transporting fruits and vegetables fewer miles results in less transportation-related carbon emissions, and food from small farms is less likely to be tainted with pesticides."

As long as you clean the bottle before reusing it (just as you should when reusing anything), it is perfectly safe.\n\nPlastics are generally clean materials, so plastic bottles aren't any more likely to contain bacteria than any other kinds of packaging. Bacteria thrive in warm, moist environments, so any bottle can be home to bacteria if reused without cleaning first.\n\nSo why is it thought that plastic bottles are unsafe to use? Mainly, because of a hoax email that circulated around the internet. It claimed that dioxins form in plastic bottles when reused, which is simply untrue.\n\nThe fact is there is no scientific basis for the claim that they're unsafe to reuse, and that it's really just an urban legend."

      "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nThe average tap water measures 3,000 to 4,000 Bovis, in the negative range. Bottled waters have been measured up to 5,000 Bovis, still negative. The neutral point for the human body is about 6,000. This low Bovis level of water (or of any liquid or food) actually robs your body of energy when you drink it, although this negative level water is still essential for life, so that you stay hydrated, etc.\n\nRelatively inexpensive conductivity meters are available. They will give you an approximation of your TDS in your water and fertilizer mix. The short answer is yes, unless you have a sodium-based water softener.\n\nBottled vs. tap water. Municipal water is used as a source for approximately 25% of the bottled water sold in the United States. However most of this processed water has gone through significant processing such as reverse osmosis, deionization, activated carbon filtration and other treatments. Often it is packaged as \"purified\" or \"drinking water\". If the water has not been substantially altered, then it must state on the label that the water comes from a municipal water source.\n\nShort answer--No! There are a number of \"nasty\" micro-organisms, especially acanthomeba (sp) which likes feeding on corneal tissue. Storing lenses in water also defeats the purpose of using a disinfecting solution as there is no disinfection occurring. If anything you are exposing your lenses to more potentially dangerous microorganisms.\n\nYes. It would be extremely difficult for a bioterrorist to contaminate our drinking water supplies to cause widespread illness. Huge amounts of water are pumped daily from our reservoirs, most of which is used for industrial and other purposes. Anything deliberately put into the water supply would be greatly diluted. Poisoning water supplies would require truckloads of biological or chemical agents that are difficult to produce and relatively easy to detect.\n\nTap water is not automatically safe. It may be contaminated with chemicals, bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and dirt. Have your tap water tested by a laboratory. Then ask a water company to design a filtration and purification system based on the lab results. If your water comes from a well, it may be necessary to have it softened, which means eliminating hard elements like calcium, iron, and magnesium.\n\nWATER FILTERS: One way to avoid fluoride from the tap is to purchase a water filter. However, most water filters will not effectively remove fluoride. For instance, Brita filters will NOT remove fluoride. The two types of filters which will reliably remove more than 90% of the fluoride are reverse-osmosis filters and activated alumina filters. Thus, if you are looking for a filter to remove fluoride, make sure it uses \"reverse-osmosis\" or \"activated alumina\" technology.\n\nOur Water Quality Assurance Lab will be able to assist you with concerns about the taste of your water.

      "text": "Waste water contains a lot of chemical pollutants as well as dissolved solids and suspended solids. The major contributor of pollutants is industrial waste water.\n\nWaste water can be purified by the following ways:\n\n1. Primary treatment\n\n2. Secondary treatment\n\n1. Primary Treatment:\n\nThe purpose of primary treatment is to remove pollutants like large, floating and suspended solid materials, grit, oil and grease, etc.\n\nThe large floating rubbish like sticks, rags, cans, cloth and various other objects are removed by screening. The screens are generally made up of steel bars spaced very few centimeters apart, followed by a wire mesh screen with smaller openings compared to the opening of steel bar assemblage. The collected materials are now disposed off.\n\nHowever, if a comminute is used, it will cut the large materials into very small pieces and at a later stage can be settled in the grit chamber.\n\nAfter screening, the waste water is passed into a grit chamber and time just sufficient for the heavy materials, like sand, grit, etc., to settle down is allowed. The settled materials can be disposed off in the land fill.\n\nFrom the grit chamber, the waste water is now allowed to pass through primary settling tank or 'primary clarifier'. The flow rate is now reduced with a detention time of about two to three hours and most of the lighter suspended solids settle down because of gravity.\n\nThe settled solids are generally circular in shape and the waste water flows horizontally. The settled suspended materials can then be removed by mechanical scrapping into hoppers and are pumped out subsequently. In the overall process, about 60 per cent of suspended solids and 40 per cent BOD can be removed.\n\nHowever, finely divided suspended solids and colloidal particles cannot be removed by this process. Under this condition, mechanical flocculation and chemical coagulation can be employed.\n\nIn mechanical flocculation, the finely divided suspended solids are allowed to coalesce by rotating paddles with sufficient detention time. Later on, they get separated with settlement due to gravity.\n\nIn coagulation process, chemical coagulate like alum or hydrated lime is added and for making the process more efficient, coagulant aids like activated silica or polyelectrolyte can be used and colloidal suspension can easily be removed.\n\n2. Secondary Treatment:\n\nThe purpose of the secondary treatment is to remove the finely suspended solid, dissolved solid and BOD which still remain after the primary treatment. The BOD is removed by biological processes using bacteria and other microorganisms. The processes may be aerobic or anaerobic.\n\nThus, in the secondary treatment, oil, grease and organic matter (BOD) are removed to the largest extent. The complex cell tissues thus, formed can be removed by agglomerating them and finally settling out.\n\nThe effluent from the primary sedimentation tank is first subjected to aerobic oxidation in systems like trickling filters, rotating biological contractor, active sludge units and oxidation ponds. The sludge obtained in the primary sedimentation tank, is allowed to undergo anaerobic oxidation in the sludge digesters.\n\nAnaerobic decomposition is generally employed for digestion of sludge. However, organic wastes from dairies, slaughter houses, etc., can also be treated by this method. The efficiency of both aerobic and anaerobic decomposition depends on many factors such as:\n\n1. Temperature 2. pH 3. Concentration of wastes 4. Nature of waste.\n\nIn the secondary treatment, the decomposition is done under controlled conditions in the treatment plant itself and about 85 per cent BOD and suspended solids can be removed efficiently.\n\nHowever, neither the primary nor the secondary treatments are effective in removal of nutrients, dissolved materials and biologically resistant materials. Under such circumstances, tertiary treatment is required.\n\n(a) Trickling Filters:\n\nThe trickling filter consists of circular filter beds usually about 1.5 m deep and is surrounded by circular brick wall. The beds are made up of materials like rocks or plastic materials.\n\nThe diameter of the material varies from 3 to 10 cm. The spaces between the rocks or plastic materials are sufficient to allow air to circulate and aerobic conditions are thus maintained.\n\nThe incoming waste water after the primary treatment now can be sprayed over these circular filter beds by a rotating distributor.\n\nThe rotating distributor is a metallic pipe with holes along its length and the waste water emerges in horizontal jets. The bottom of the filter is provided with a floor of perforated tiles through which incoming air passes.\n\nThe individual rocks in the bed are covered with a gelatinous film consisting of bacteria, algae, fungi, protozoa, worms, insects, etc. The BOD in the incoming waste water is absorbed in the bed surface and undergoes aerobic decomposition by these bacteria or microorganism.\n\nWith increase in the thickness of the film, a part of it gets attached and carried away along with the treated waste water to a secondary settling tank and is removed finally. The sludge so obtained is now pumped to the sludge digestion unit.\n\nThe efficiency of trickling filter depends on temperature, pH, nature of the waste, uniformity of loading of the waste matter and air supply.\n\nIf there is lack of oxygen in the trickling filter, then wrong type of organisms will develop and many toxic materials will be included in the final effluent.\n\nThus, the bed should provide a home for a wide variety of organisms including bacteria, protozoa, fungi, worms and insects. The upper surface will also be colonized by algae.\n\nTrickling filters are very simple to operate and BOD can be removed to the extent of 65 to 85 per cent. However, it is costlier and efficiency decreases if effluent of high BOD is passed continuously. Such problem can, however, be overcome if high BOD is replaced by low BOD occasionally.\n\n(b) Rotating Biological Contractor (RBC):\n\nAn RBC consists of a series of closely spaced circular plastic disks (diameter, 3.6m) and is attached to a rotating horizontal shaft.\n\nThe arrangement is so designed that about 40 per cent of each of the circular plastic disk is submerged in the tank containing waste water which needs treatment. The circular disks are covered with gelatinous film consisting of bacteria, fungi, algae, worm and insects.\n\nAs the RBC rotates, the submerged portion adsorbs organics (BOD) and when they come out they are exposed to atmospheric oxygen.\n\nUnder such condition, there is no scarcity of oxygen and the process becomes very efficient. The device is easy to handle and can be operated under high load conditions not possible by trickling filter. Compared to trickling filters, higher rate of BOD removal is achieved in RBC.\n\n(c) Activated Sludge Process:\n\nIn the activated sludge process, the effluents from the primary sedimentation tank and recycled bacteria and other microorganisms (bio-organisms) from the secondary settling tank (the activated sludge), are collected in a tank called aeration tank.\n\nThe object of the process is to provide sufficient amount of oxygen for complete aerobic decomposition of the wastes. To do so, air with oxygen is pumped into the mixture and thoroughly agitated by mechanical stirrers. The water is kept in constant turbulent motion in the aerated tank (concrete tank).\n\nAfter about 3 to 6 hours of aeration (for sewage) and 6 to 24 hours of aeration (for industrial waste), the agitated effluent water again flows to the secondary tank and the effluent is separated from the sludge by settling and is discharged.\n\nSome part of the sludge is recycled again to the aeration tank, so as to maintain effective microbial population for fresh treatment, the remaining sludge can be processed and disposed of. The BOD removal from the waste water can be as high as 95 per cent. Sludge Treatment\n\nIn the activated sludge process, the BOD and suspended and dissolved solids are removed to a greater extend from the waste water and then that water is released to be used as a good water source.\n\nThe remaining matter to be disposed off is only sludge (mixture of solids and water). The sludge can be dried up and used as fertilizer or it can be dumped into the sea. Whatever be the way of disposal, it must be environment friendly.\n\nAnother effective measure of sludge disposal is the digestion of the sludge under anaerobic condition at 35°C. Under anaerobic condition, the microorganisms convert the organics into simpler carbon dioxide, methane gas and many other stable products.\n\nThe methane gas has fuel value and can be utilized to warm digestion tank. It is to be noted that methane forming bacteria are extremely sensitive to temperature, pH and oxygen and thus, proper condition should be maintained for sludge treatment.\n\nThe digested sludge still contains lot of water. The water can be removed by pumping sludge into drying beds or by the process of incinerators. The digested and dewatered sludge is inoffensive. It can be used as soil conditioner or disposed of in a land fill"

While the EPA suggests only 20 mg/L or less content for people on low sodium diet, the water has been seen to contain some 60 mg/L to 200 mg/L of sodium.\n\nIt is being said that the amount of the sodium is not harmful for health however. But, the same can bring a change in the colour and smell of the water as well as in its taste. Also, though sodium is not taken as a primary or secondary contaminant, people with high blood pressure or suffering a kidney disease are being warned to pay special attention.\n\nThey are being suggested by the Department of Health and Hospitals to consult their health care providers for levels of sodium as well as chloride before using drinking water supplied by systems in this parish.\n\nHowever, Plaquemines Parish itself on the other hand is making endeavours to lessen the amount of sodium in the water"

The device, called a SolarBall, is designed to help people in developing regions access clean water.\n\nThe Solarball works by absorbing the heat from sunlight, which causes dirty water contained inside to evaporate. During the evaporation process, contaminants are removed from the water, leaving behind condensation that can be collected and stored for drinking."

      "text": "How And Where To Store Water\n\nWhat would you do if your water supply became contaminated? Natural disasters can interrupt the flow of clean water. Following a disaster, some people may not have access to food and water for days or weeks. You can live for days without food, but you must have water or you will dehydrate. Whenever there is a crisis, water is the first thing to go.\n\nAmount Of Water To Store\nEach person in your family will need a 72-hour emergency supply of water. This is approximately one gallon per person per day, or three gallons, plus an additional three gallons for washing, cooking, sponge bathing, laundry, dishes etc.\n\nI recommend a three-month supply of water if possible. This is approximately 90 gallons per person for drinking and 90 gallons for extra cooking and washing. Children, nursing mothers and sick people may need more. Store a little extra for them. There are several ways to store this much water.\n\nContainers\nMany types of containers can be used for water storage. My favorite way to store water is in heavy plastic or glass containers.\n\nMake sure all containers used for water storage are food grade with a high quality PET rating and have never previously held chemicals or poisons. All containers need to be cleaned thoroughly because whatever was in the container will leach into the water and make it taste bad. Bottled juices or soda etc… should be rinsed thoroughly.\n\nAll stored water needs to be checked occasionally for cloudiness and leakage. If the water looks or tastes bad then change it. If you have any questions about the purity of the water, then purify or boil it before using. If the water tastes flat, you can pour it back and forth between containers to aerate it or whip it to introduce more oxygen into the water.\n\nHeavy Glass Or Plastic: Glass canning jars, glass containers and two liter soda bottles work the best. Gatorade, apple juice or cranberry juice bottles are great also. I save every heavy plastic jug that comes into my house and I store them in my basement as well as the garage. I fill them with water to about one inch from the top to allow for expansion in case the bottles freeze. I seal them with tight-fitting lids.\n\nBleach Bottles: Plastic bleach bottles can be used by filling the bottle with water and sealing it with a tight fitting lid. It is recommended that you do not drink the water stored in bleach bottles. You can use the water for cleaning or washing hands. Label it with a black marker. Keep these away from children so they don't accidentally confuse the real bleach with water and drink it. Bleach will dissipate after a certain amount of time if the lid is taken off the container and it is left exposed to the air.\n\nBottled Water: Bottled water can be purchased in grocery stores. They come in boxes and can be stacked. You can purchase larger quantities at discount prices.\n\nTap Water: Tap water that comes from a municipal water system contains enough chlorine to be safe for long term water storage. Just fill your containers with tap water and store then away from sunlight, preferably in a cool dark place like a basement or garage.\n\nPolyethylene Barrels: Commercial water storage barrels are available and they come in several sizes. To store a large amount of water, 55 gallon drums made from plastic polyethylene can be obtained at most food storage companies. If you use a 55 gallon drum, and fill it with water, it will be so heavy that it cannot be moved, so it will need a permanent location. You will also need a pump or spigot to get the water into smaller containers.\n\nThere are smaller drums that hold five to six gallons of water. They weigh about 40 pounds and need a pump also. These are nice because they can be moved more easily that the 55 gallon drums.\n\nGlass Containers: Water can be stored in quart size jars sealed by the water bath canning method. Fill the jars with water leaving a head space of about one inch, then tighten the lid and ring onto the jar. Boil the jars in a water bath or use a steamer canner. Store the jars with cardboard in between so they don't break. If you are using a boiling water bath be sure to put a wire rack on the bottom of the kettle so the jars do not touch the bottom and break. Pint jars require 20 minutes boiling time, quart jars require 25 minutes. You can also pour boiling water into a canning jar and seal it with a lid and ring that has been boiled in water. Let it set on the counter until it cools off and it will automatically seal itself.\n\n250 gallon super tanker: This large cylinder shaped water tank is ideal for tucking away in a corner of a garage or room. You will feel safer with having a larger quantity of clean safe water to use. This 250-gallon or 125-gallon water tanker is shaped to easily fit through doors or set on the floor of your garage. With two locations for nozzles and being set up to be gravity fed, there is no need to worry about pumps. The larger tanker is equipped for 250 days of water storage (based on one gallon per person per day).This super tanker is sold on my website  and is shipped from Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nMilk Jugs: Milk jugs are not good containers to store water in. After about six months they start to biodegrade, collapse and leak. Even the 1 gallon blue containers that you can fill up at grocery stores don't last for very long. They are not heavy duty enough. You will have a big mess. I've tried this method and I don't like it.\n\nWhere To Store The Water Supply\nStore your water supply in several locations so you can get to it easily. I like to store most of my water in smaller containers because it's much easier to carry around. Just recently, we had an opportunity to use our stored water. A main line up the road from our house broke and the water was shut off for most of the day. We put two-liter bottles of water in every bathroom for brushing teeth and washing hands. We put several in the kitchen for cooking and cleaning. The towns' people were calling each other to warn everyone about this problem. As my friends all called me, I was happy to report that I had plenty of water stored and our family would be fine.\n\nI can't emphasize enough the importance of storing clean water for emergencies. If you use contaminated water for drinking or cooking, it can cause many different symptoms like stomach aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever and even death. Life threatening illnesses include hepatitis, cholera, amebic dysentery, viral infections and typhoid fever. It's much better to take precautions and disinfect your water before you use it.\n\nAfter A Disaster\nIn an emergency situation, immediately shut off the water supply to your home. It's a good idea to locate the shut off valve before you need it and teach everyone in the family to do it immediately after a disaster. The main gas valve must be shut off also. You can drain the pipes and collect the water that is left in your water lines. Just turn on the faucet that is located in the highest room of the house to let air into the lines. Draw the water from the lowest faucet of the house.\n\nSupplemental Sources of Water\nThe water in the hot water heater is available for use. Be sure to shut off the incoming water or intake valve to prevent the contaminated water from mixing with the safe water. To take water out of the tank, open the drain valve. A hose can be attached to this valve and the water drained into containers.\n\nThe water in the tank of the toilet, not the bowl, can be scooped out and used if needed.\n\nLiquids for drinking can be obtained from canned fruits, juices, vegetables and soft drinks, or anything that has been water-packed in the canning process.\n\nSnow can be melted and rain water can be used, if you have a collection barrel. Be sure to disinfect the water before drinking. Boiling it vigorously for five minutes will kill all bacteria.\n\nSwimming pools or spas contain treated water. Boil it before using. Lakes, streams, ponds, rivers and ditches contain water that can be used if it is clarified and treated with one of the methods I'll describe below. To clarify, strain the water through a cloth placed over a bowl or pot. This will take out impurities.\n\nAs water sits over time, disease organisms tend to die. So the longer it is stored the safer it becomes and the less chance it contains bacteria, if it has been safely stored using one of the following methods. But remember, there is no way to purify water that has been contaminated with radioactivity.\n\nBoiling Method: The safest method of purifying water is to boil it vigorously for five minutes. To improve the taste of the water after it has been boiled, pour the water from one container to another and aerate the water. Do not use cloudy water if you have a choice between clear or cloudy. Cloudy water is caused by bacterial growth. Cloudy water must be strained through a cloth to remove the particles. Then boil or treat the water with chemicals.\n\nChemical Sterilization Using Bleach: You can purify water by adding any household bleach that is not more than 1 year old. Bleach loses its effectiveness after a year. The most common bleach solutions contain 5.25 percent sodium hypochlorite. Add the bleach solution to the water and mix thoroughly by stirring or shaking it. Then let it stand for 30 minutes so the bleach can do its job. Do not use lemon scented or perfumed bleach.\n\nThe following table shows the proper amount of bleach to add to the water.\n\nAmount of water\nto Purify\n\nAmount of bleach to add to clear water\n\nAmount of bleach to add to cloudy water\n\n1 Quart\n1 Gallon\n5 Gallons\n\n2 Drops\n8 Drops\n½ Teaspoon\n\n4 Drops\n16 Drops\n1 Teaspoon\n\nTincture Of Iodine: You can use ordinary 2 percent tincture of iodine, which you may have in your medicine cabinet. To purify small quantities of water add three drops of tincture of iodine to each quart of clear water or six drops to each quart of cloudy water. Stir well and let it stand for 30 minutes. This water will be a brownish red color and will have a slight taste of iodine. Pregnant women and people with thyroid problems should not use this method.\n\nWater Purification Tablets: Water purification tablets release chorine or iodine to purify the water. You can purchase them at most sporting good stores or drug stores. These tablets have a shelf life of five years unopened.\n\nHalazone Tablets: Halazone tablets for emergency water disinfection are commonly carried by emergency medical technicians or paramedics. They can be purchased in drug stores. The shelf life of these tablets is only two years, so check the label to see how long it has been on the drugstore shelf before you purchase it. Keep these tablets tightly sealed. If the tablets turn yellow or smell bad, do not use them. Again allow the water to stand at least 30 minutes before using it. This gives the chemicals time to work.\n\nHome Purification Devices: Do not rely on water purifiers to substitute for stored water. If you use a water filter or home purifier you must still purify the water by boiling or using a chemical. Reverse osmosis devices and home distillers cannot be relied upon to remove grossly contaminated water. Even though these devices are not reliable to remove contamination, they can remove chlorine or iodine after the water has been safely disinfected. Using a water purifier will greatly improve the taste of the water.\n\nION: ION is a stabilized oxygen product that I have found to be very effective in water treatment. Many studies have been done on this product and it is concluded that ION will kill giardia, cholera and dysentery within a few minutes. It doesn't have any of the harmful side effects that are associated with chlorine or Iodine. ION is a high concentration of oxygen.\n\nHigh levels of oxygen will kill harmful bacteria. The name ION stands for ions of oxygen with a negative charge. By removing the positive charge from the water the process creates stabilized nontoxic oxygen. Anaerobic pathogens or infectious microorganisms in the water cannot survive in the presence of oxygen. ION will not harm the normal flora in our bodies. ION can be taken every day (five drops per 8-ounce glass of water). This will help boost the immune system by introducing stabilized oxygen into the bloodstream.\n\nMy husband and I take ION to Mexico and other countries when we go on vacation. We use it in all of our drinks. We do not get sick while others in our group do.\n\nBecause ION is nontoxic, it can be used medicinally and can be used every day to prevent illness. It can also be applied topically on wounds to kill any harmful bacteria. It's great to put in the medical kit. One bottle of ION will treat 110 gallons of water. To use, add 20 drops of ION to a gallon of water. It's small enough to carry in a purse and use every day.\n\nThere are many kinds of toxins that ION will neutralize. Bee stings and bites from spiders or snakes are all toxic. Dropping ION on the injuries will neutralize them almost immediately. ION can be mixed with Tea Tree Oil or as a carrier to help drive it deep into the skin.\n\nION should not be used full strength. Diluting it down with water (five drops of ION to 8 ounces of water) is the best way to use it. If you water your plants with the diluted ION water, they will thrive and grow bigger.\n\nIt can also help you if you suffer from a bacterial or viral infection. During times of sickness caused by a bacterial or viral infection, take 50 drops every three hours diluted in a glass of water. The ION goes into the stomach and fights the bacteria or virus.\n\nTo purchase ION go to my website  Click on ION water purification. Double click on the picture of the ION and all the information will come up on the many medicinal uses as well as water treatment. If you purchase 10 bottles at a time you can get a discount. If you purchase 25 or more bottles you can buy it wholesale.\n\nThis information was taken from my books Food Storage 101. Where do I begin? and Emergency Food Storage and Survival Handbook. To purchase any of the seven books I have written or purchase dehydrated food that has been sealed for long term storage in 1-gallon cans or 5-gallon buckets, please check out my website at  My next article will cover dehydrated food, what to store how much to store and why you should make dehydrated food part of your long term storage plan.\n\n— Peggy Layton\n\nRate this:\n\nPeggy Laytona 'germicidal' lamp. Basically, it is a 15 watt fluorescent lamp without the fluorescence and with the glass tube replaced by quartz. Quartz will pass UVC, glass will not. The lamp provides visible light, UVA, UVB, and UVC (which is ionizing radiation). When it is on, you can smell the ozone it creates from the oxygen in the air. If you want to sterilize water, put it in a quartz container near the lamp when on. Note that you must NOT LOOK AT THE LAMP when the lamp is on without eye protection. UVC is very dangerous and direct eye exposure will cause blindness. Welding goggles work. Wrap around sun glasses certified to filter out UVA, UVB & UVC and absolutely prevents any direct or reflected UV from entering the eye should also work.\n\nIt does not \"make\" water from air, it is a dehumidifier that extracts water vapor from air.\n\n krys\n\nFOOD GRADE hydrogen peroxide 35% can be purchaed at several places in the U.S. I obtained mine from Florida. $89.00 for 2 gal.I googled for it.They send it in food grade soi=lid white gal. containers.w/a colbalt blue bottle to carry some with you.\nJames is right on the ultraviolet \"A\" and \"C\" band light, ozone, and high-voltage pulsed electro-sterilization of water also work VERY well.

Wondering if it's alright to put it in a garage. In the Texas summer that garage can get up to 100+. Still safe and fit to drink?\n\nGranny Mae\n\nDennis P,\n\nYes it is safe and the garage would be a good place for your water! It is safe to drink. Just read my previous post. Don't store your fod supply outside in the garage though. It is too hot for that. Keep it in the house. If you have a basement that is good just don't sit things on the cement floor, instead put down some boards and put your supplies on them. If you need to store it in the house let me know and I can give you a lot of suggestions on where to put it out of sight ! Please don't wait, get started now !\n\nGranny Mae\n\nAlso, plain clorine bleach or pool clorine is what you can use to make your water safe. It is inexpensive and good to store anyway for lots of purposes in an emergency situation. Also store some vegetable seeds that you could plant a garden with. Store them in the freezer in a water proof container. Heirloom seeds are the best as they reproduce more plants from saved seeds that are true to the original food ! Anyone can plant a garden in their back yard and even incorporate some things in pots and in with flowers. For instance plant garlic around your roses ! Roses love garlic ! I can't stress enough people to start right now to get self suficient.\n\nVic\n\nThis is a good article. I've been storing water for a few weeks – and using gallon milk jugs – I guess i have been doing it wrong. We don't drink sodas much or jarred juice – so I guess I will have to start purchasing something else.\n\nThe article mentioned that milk containers only last about 6 months, but I didn't read in this article for proper containers how long will the water stay good?\n\nKitty\n\nTap water will stay SAFE long term, but it will degrade in taste. taste test your water every so often and replace as needed.\n\nif you are in a survival situation and want to aid the taste of water that's why lots of people store koolaid, but you can also use it for tea, coffee, or just pour the water from one container to another back and forth for several minutes from a high height to add air back into the water.\n\nFWIW, Kitty\n\nGranny Mae\n\nVic,\n\nI have been storring water for several years now and I have no problem with it. My husband and I found a place that gets food grade 50gal. drums from a place that uses fruit syrup. We have bought 8 or 10 of them and washed them well with dish soap and rinsed real well, then put them on our carport and filled them. Because we have well water we decided to add clorine bleach to them when filling and then we closed them up. We added 5 teaspoons of bleach to each barrel. After two years we emptied them and used the water on the garden and plants and refilled the drums and added the bleach again. I don't think we needed to change the water but we did. It doesn't hurt anything either way. My barrels are outside and under the carport where they don't get any sun. Living in the south they do get warm but that doesn't seem to bother them that I can see ! We originally got the barrels because we were in a drought and were afraid that our well would go dry and we would need water till we could get another well drilled. I have never regretted doing it. I feel safer. If you want to know what it would be like to have a EMP attack and what to do after to survive then you need to read the book ONE SECOND AFTER ! It is a great discription of what we would be facing and what to think about for a food storage, emergency supplies, lights and water and a lot of things you just don't think about till it is too late. We live in a very different world today with threats of monetary collapse, terrorist attacks and the possibility of a dirty bomb and on and on. Now is the time to be ready for anything. I use to be afraid untill I decided to get ready to live through it and survive. I have my family ready. I make my own storage food and have found ways to store a lot od foods in this double-wide that I live in. There is no room for storage in these homes but I have made room. There is enough food in this house to feed my family and even an occasional neighbor too. I just keep adding to it. I have also stored bath soap, laundry soap, toothpaste, toilet paper and just about anything else you can think of. The paper products and soap are stored in a storage shed along with anything else that won't be ruined by the heat, everything else is in the house. I switched to cloth napkins to save money. I can wash them and also handkerchief. They too can be washed and reused. There are some things that will store a long time and some that won't. For long term storage I suggest you by the freeze dried powdered shortening. Oil will only store for maybe a year. It has a tendency to go rancid and so does shortening like Crisco. You must use them and replace them on a regular bases. I also have oil lamps and got a book that tells me how to make lamps using olive oil which I think you could most likely use any food oil if need be ! Anyway I am enjoying doing this now and I'm not afraid anymore ! Try it yourself and see if you don't feel better about being prepared too !\n\nLorie\n\nWhere exactly did you find the food grade barrels? Where should one look for that type thing?\n\nHunger and Thirst for Righteousness\n\nFor food grade barrels, buckets and drums, look in Craig's List. Usually it mentions if it is food grade and sometimes states what it had originally stored in the containers.\n\nindependant thinker\n\nWhere I live there is a flea market that has the 55 gallon food grade barrels as well as 300 gallon food grade tanks available. The barrels are blue plastic and the tanks are milky white colored much like 1 gal. milk or water jugs. The tanks are also on a pallet with a steel tube frame around them and have a valve already on them.\n\nHi,\nSee jimhumble.org he has a section on water purification using Sodium Chlorite, and his distributors/makers of Water Purification Drops are sold worldwide.\nIt works fine for various reasons, in fact many water suppliers use Sodium chlorite to purify their water! (Ignore the current hype abput it being bad for you that is Big Pharma rubbish1)\nBest regards\nDonald walton\n\nCarol J\n\nI have kept any gallon water bottles I get at the store and refill them from my Brita pitchers. Since I use that water for the cats and dog as well as myself, I try to have several gallons filled. At the moment I also have 4 cases of 16 oz. bottles I got on a bogo deal, and they are stored in a cupboard. Never thought about maybe needing water, just wanted to make sure I had plenty of \"safe\" water. Oh, yes, I also have 3 5 gallon buckets of water left over from when my pipes sprung a leak and I had to use these for the bathroom. The empty containers from cat litter are perfect for this.\n\nVic\n\nThis article stated that water stored in gallon milk containers aren't good for long – but stores sell bottled water in what seems to be the same grade of plastic for a gallon.\n\nKitty\n\nThat's because they assume you'll use it sooner than 6 months, also because if it was suitable for long term storage you would refill them and have your own water and not need to buy again from them.\n\n Joe H.\n\nVic,\nI don't know if you like Arizona green tea, but their gallon jugs are about 4 times as thick as the thickest milk jug! I filled them with water last year to keep my tarps on my wood pile down and even when they froze solid they didn't break!!\n\nindependant thinker\n\nIn my area there are some 300 gallon food grade containers that are roughly cubical available. I purchased mine originaly to store rain water for my garden but they also work wonderfuly for storing water for personal use.\n\n i41\n\nWhen I worked over in Gillette Wyo. when you turned on your faucet methane gas would always vent off for a bit before water showed up. Same as it does in some places in MT. If the green weinies would allow the use of more drilling, instead of wasting money on windmills and fairy dust batteries. We would have plenty of energy and put more people to work. As for storing water we use 55 gallon blue water barrels, and we check them every 6 months for water taste. Usually we change out the water at 3 months first time use, 6 months the second, and 1-2 after that, get rid of any plastic smell. Also we have a fiverglass 2500 gallon tank on a trailer we keep filled for reserve or firefighting.\n\nbarbm\n\nyou can seal canning jars by turning them upside down which allows the boiled water to heat the seal. i do that when i make jelly. you can hear them pop as they seal. doesn't work for veggies or for very long-term storage, but works great for making a few jars from my fig and blueberry bushes. we eat it quickly enough to keep any bacteria from forming.\n\nJames\n\nAlthough the article had some excellent points, it failed to mention that ultraviolet \"A\" and \"C\" band light, ozone, and high-voltage pulsed electro-sterilization of water also work VERY well. Natural sunlight contains high levels of UV-A, and in some third-world countries, glass and plastic bottles are placed upon sheets of aluminum, to help intensify the radiant UV energy. In about 4 to 6 hours, the water in the continers becomes \"sterile\". I realize that this may conflict with the information in the article that says to keep the water in a \"cool, DARK place\", but years of scientific evidence proves otherwise!\n\nvicki\n\nThe cool dark place is more for AFTER sterilization\n\njopa\n\nThis is a good article for everyone to be aware of now that the producers of natural gas are using a method of pumping chemicals into the ground to extract natural gas.The method does work to get out the natural gas but the chemical pollutants are also contaminating drinking water.I am pretty sure most peoplr have seen the video of the guy lighting his kitchen faucet water and the ensuing ball of fire.\n\n everett\n\nnegative charges can not exist as \"stable\" in the human environment unless positive charges are also in the solution to balance it out !\n\nIt sounds like a weak solution of FOOD GRADE hydrogen peroxide. I say weak because food grade H2O2 must be diluted to a much greater strength. One should not use 'regular' hydrogen peroxide because it is not pure enough for consumption, even when diluted. FOOD GRADE is normally 35% and it is somewhat difficult to obtain and it is not cheap. It must be kept in darkened bottled and refrigerated for the longest use.\n\nreeves\n\nMilk jugs work just fine. Clean and air them thoroughly before filling with tap water, and store them in rows and stacks in the Garage. Also keep a hand operated can opener and as many vacume-sealed cans of food as you have room for. Store in the Garage.\n\nRichard Pawley\n\nThe trick is in cleaning them with hot soapy water and rinsing them thoroughly. I use a particular milk brand that is free of artificial bovine hormones and which has a thicker plastic than most (not all do). Wal-Mart sells a seven gallon blue plastic water container with a \"spicket\" for camping for about $10 (it used to be $6) and I find it very handy. I also obtain five gallon containers that once held honey or agave syrup from the local health food store. The ones that contain pickles and olives and cheese are hard to clean and take quite a while to deodorize but they work well too. I've found that after thoroughly washing with soap and water the honey containers still smell sweet but after storing water for a month or so that disappears. These are also good for storing grain in their air tight rubber gasket sealed lids, and I even have 15 bags of cereals, removed from their original boxes, with a pin prick in their inner bags – I press out all the air and put a piece of tape over the hole (be careful not to make two holes through the entire bag unless you cover them both) and that is part of my emergency food supply. Of course mine are organic cereals. MaraNatha and Smuckers both sell peanut butter in reusable glass jars that are air tight with a built in rubberized lid. With 20% inflation most likely next year (due to all the money the last congress has squandered in the past four years) and some 200% forecast for the future for food, fuel and imported goods, the time to prepare is now. God bless you.\n\nVic\n\nI agree with you. It's a must to store water and some dry goods. I hate to say it though. I can't believe we have to do this. I just pray our newly elected officials don't let us down and our country begins healing. God Bless you and all as well.\n\nVic\n\nI've been using milk containers, but the writer of the article states they aren't good, because they only last about 6 months. I also have a hand operated can opener in my garage with my canned goods.\n\nGranny Mae\n\nIt is not a good idea to store your food storage in the garage ! It is subjected to a lot of highs and lows in temperature and will not last long. My friend did that and has lost most all her storage. That was a lot of money down the drain and it would have been a shame if she had not found out till she needed it! Please don't store food in the garage! A basement is great if you have one but if not you should keep it in the house where you can maintain a constant temp. Or as close to constant as possible. 38 to 40 degrees is wonderful if you can get it but most can't so try not to let it get higher than 78 degrees !\n\nCliffystones\n\nGreat information!\n\nI just wanted to add a quick warning. Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon. If you do decide to buy large storage barrels or commercial tanks, be sure the floor your are going to fill and store them on can handle the weight!\n\nIt would suck to find out your basement's concrete floor wasn't poured over well compacted soil.\n\nrishi dwivedi\n\nYou wil not believe I read EVERY word with keen interest and like a blotting paper. I have a New Invention from Wellan Energy Solutions (look up the Google search for Wellan Energy)\nwhich is a simple ring that you can install with a screw driver in the incoming pipe. It neutralizes clorine and other impurities, kills bacteria/algae and also keeps the filtration unit's RO filter clean for years. I have had it in my home for 4 years now and never had to replace the RO filter. Normally it was necessary to change this filter at least every 6 months. The water tester has since shown a reading of only 11 ! )Just for your information\n\nBob Wire\n\n\" \"How can the shelf life of water be increased?\"\n* Answer: To increase the shelf life of water stored in translucent containers, group the containers together in dark plastic bags to keep out the light. Polyethylene plastics (water, milk, and bleach bottles) can be permeated by hydrocarbon vapors. Store your water supply away from gasoline, kerosene, pesticides, or similar substances.\n\nNOTE: I have stored our water (mostly in four-liter milk jugs) in two different home locations, in case we are unable to access one stash. Approximately half is stored in the basement, while the other half is stored in our upstairs chest freezer. These frozen jugs of water help to improve the efficiency of our half empty freezer, and in the event of a power outage will help to protect the food from thawing. After an earthquake, the jugs can be used in a freezer to provide us with an icebox.\n\nI have to agree wholeheartedly with storing milk jugs full of water in the freezer. We average a couple of power outages every year, usually in the summer. With the jugs of frozen water in the freezer we are good for at least 2 days before the temps start to rise, even in the summer.\n\nI bought a 4000 watt gen set a couple of years ago and have used it quite a few times now. To ensure the gas is fresh I fill it with 100LL aviation gas. Av gas is good for three years minimum unlike auto fuel that starts to break down in as little as one month in warm weather.\n\n frank\n\nAnd you can listen or call to Gary Null for more information\n\nMark Matis\n\nFor those of you who have lawn sprinkler systems, water storage is not much of an issue as long as you have a pitcher pump: \nThere are many more sources like that, with most in a similar price range. MAKE SURE you have the correct adapters to mate to your wellpoint BEFORE you need it.\n\nThere are also hand pumps that will work with deep wells, but they tend to be more expensive.\n\nAngel Wannabe\n\nMark, Question, where do we go for pumps that will tap an artesian well over 200 feet?\n\nBob & Peggy, Thanks be to you both for all of your valuable information. I like my ducks in a row while no one wants to figure on the worst happening you've go think about it whether you want to or not. Being prepared is a mainstay__and everyone should take the responsibility upon themselves__ I've printed off several copies of your information and passed it out. I love the looks I get, when I do, most of them think I'm a loon!_It's all ok__ If anything goes down, weather or a collapse__ at least our home can run efficiently and we can help others out as well!"

      "text": "Technologies for the Provision of Basic Infrastructure in Low-income Settlements (HABITAT)\n\nV. Appropriate infrastructure technology for low-income settlements\n\nA. Aims\n\nB. Water-supply technology\n\nC. Sanitation technology\n\nD. Solid-waste management characteristics solid waste\n\nB. Water-supply technology\n\nProviding a water-supply system for a community involves tapping\nthe most suitable source of water, ensuring that the water will be tit for\ndomestic consumption and supplying it in adequate quantities.\n\n1. Water quality and quantity\n\nAs indicated above, water-quality standards for domestic\nconsumption in developing countries generally follow closely or are the same as\nthe WHO International Standards for Drinking Water. However, it has often been\nsuggested that these standards might be difficult to achieve under certain\nconditions, where there is only one source of water and the cost to treat the\nwater to the required standard is unaffordable. While it is possible that the\nhuman body can develop tolerance to physical or chemical elements in the water,\nit is not advisable to assume that it can also acquire immunity to water-borne\ndiseases. However, some authors and countries are proposing and adopting\nbacteriological water quality standards less stringent than those of WHO, with\nthe object of eliminating the need for final disinfection. In rural areas\nparticularly, the complexity of chemical dosing and the cost of chlorinating\nchemicals will make the chance of maintaining continuous disinfection rather\nsmall, and the health risk of accepting upgraded but unchlorinated water supply\nmust be balanced against the problems and costs of maintaining continuous\nchlorination. Supplying slightly polluted water without disinfection will also\nincur additional increased costs for storage and boiling water in the home, and\nthese should be offset against the cost of ensuring a completely safe supply.\nThe new WHO Guidelines take these factors into account and provide realistic\nobjectives in terms of the level of pollution which affects human health in an\nunacceptable manner. Flexible approaches to bacteriological standards have been\nfollowed, for example, in the Cameroon Community Development Project and in\nChina.\n\nStandards for the quantity of water to be supplied cannot be\nuniform over different regions, since they are subject to particular physical\nand socio-cultural conditions. Water demand or water consumed also depend on the\ntype of service provided. Thus, in areas with household connections, the demand\nwill tend to be higher than in settlements provided with communal water taps. It\nhas also been confirmed that the distribution of communal taps and the walking\ndistance from any household will have an effect on the level of water\nconsumption. However, designers should be aware that, beyond a certain point,\nany increase in the number of communal water taps will not have a significant\neffect on consumption levels. Many surveys of water consumption and use have\nbeen carried out in several parts of the world, and based on these it is\npossible to estimate that average levels of demand in lowincome settlements\nrange between 20 and 40 lcpd for communal taps with maximum walking distances of\n200 metres and from 40 to 60 lpcd for household connections. The demand for\nmultiple household taps is likely to be slightly higher.\n\n2. Water sources\n\nWater is available in the atmosphere, underground, in rivers and\nlakes and in the seas In theory and in practice, any of these sources can be\ntapped for domestic water supplies, but the cost implications must be\nconsidered.\n\nRainwater harvesting and condensation of water from the\natmosphere\n\nWater in the atmosphere can be tapped through the mist or air\nmoisture or through rain-catchment. Chile and Peru are carrying out\ninvestigation condensation of to recover water held in coastal fogs quite common\nin that region. Pilot structures for the catchment of air moisture have proved\nthe feasibility of this technology where other water sources are not available.\nOther countries, such as China, Cyprus and Kenya. have traditional techniques\nfor moisture catchment, but much work needs to be done on this technology before\ncost effective systems can be developed. The interception of rainwater before it\nreaches the ground has the advantage that the water may be collected with\nminimum contamination. The amount of water which can be collected is determined\nby the amount of rainfall and the size of the collection area The use of roofs\nfor water collection is widespread in developing countries with regular\nrainfall, and, under satisfactory climatic conditions, collection of rainwater\nfrom roofs can supplement other water sources at minimal cost.\n\nSome people object to the use of rainwater because of its\ncontamination with bird droppings, dust and other deposits on the roof. This\nobjection can be overcome by the installation of simple devices to separate the\nfirst flush of water from the remainder to be stored. In countries such as\nChina, courtyards have been used to collect rainwater, but, in these cases,\nthere is the risk of contamination, and the water has to receive some type of\ntreatment before its use for domestic purposes.\n\nGround catchments are ideal for collecting surface runoff, and,\nif this technique is adopted, the ground is usually compacted and often coated\nwith a non-toxic material to reduce water loss through seepage. This type of\ncollection requires a degree of protection of the catchment area to prevent\ngross pollution of the water.\n\nRainwater is normally stored in depressions or specially built\ncontainers (traps), and the collected water can be treated using silt traps and\nsand filters prior to storage. There is a whole array of above-ground and\nbelow-ground reservoir designs, and their suitability for a particular situation\nmust be decided on the basis of quality and cost. Water harvested through\nadequate catchment arrangements does not normally require disinfection. The WHO\nInternational Reference Centre (IRC) in The Hague has produced a training module\non rainwater harvesting for drinking-water supply.\n\nSpring tapping and protection\n\nSprings with a regular flow of water constitute one of the most\neconomical sources of water for domestic use. In the Latin American highlands,\nspringwater supplies account for a large percentage of rural water supplies and\nthey are also common sources in Asian and African countries. Since most springs\nproduce uncontaminated Groundwater there is no need for disinfection or any\nother treatment. Civil works consist basically of concrete or masonry structures\nto intercept the water at the point at which it surfaces, and the same structure\nis designed to protect the water from external contamination, avoid clogging of\nthe spring \"eye\" and intercept silt or other material which might otherwise pass\ninto the water-distribution system. Spring catchment units require little\nmaintenance that cannot be done by unskilled personnel. However, the yield from\nsprings is normally small, and their use for the supply of water to large\nsettlements is not feasible in most cases.\n\nGroundwater\n\nGroundwater is normally free of bacteriological contamination\nand, although its chemical characteristics vary from one source to another, its\nuse does not present a health hazard, unless there are extremely high\nconcentrations of dissolved solids or specific elements. Groundwater is normally\nabstracted from wells or infiltration galleries, and the type of well and the\ntechnique adopted for its construction are dictated by ground conditions,\ncharacteristics of the aquifer and costs.\n\nLarge-diameter excavated wells normally have a circular section\nand are lined with masonry or concrete, or have wooden walls. Such wells are\nadopted where it is not possible to obtain or maintain the drilling and pumping\nequipment necessary for small-diameter wells, where it is desired to use a type\nof water-raising system requiring more space than is available in a\nsmall-diameter well, where there are cheap labour and local skills, where the\naquifer is not very deep, or where it is necessary to store water in\nlow-permeability aquifers. When compared with small diameter wells,\nlarge-diameter wells have the disadvantages of requiring long construction\nperiods, posing safety hazards during construction and operation, being easy to\ncontaminate and giving generally low production rates.\n\nThere are many construction techniques and types of equipment\nfor small-diameter wells, sometimes called tubewells. The elaborate methods\nrequiring sophisticated drilling equipment and skilled labour will not be dealt\nwith in this review. A summary of methods for drilling small-diameter wells is\ngiven in table 11.\n\nWells, whatever the type, have to be located and protected to\nminimize the risk of pollution through direct access of contaminated surface\nwater, seepage of contaminated water from the surface, infiltration of polluted\ngroundwater, access of refuse to the well shaft, or unsanitary water-drawing\nsystems. Only rarely will groundwater require treatment, and, if it does, this\nwill mainly take the form of disinfection. Low-yield wells serving low-density\nhuman settlements normally have the water abstraction and distribution system at\nthe surface, immediately above or beside the well. Under these conditions, the\ncriteria for their operation follow similar principles to those for communal\nwater taps, in addition to the physical factors mentioned above. High-yield\nwells normally require supply reservoirs and piped distribution systems, and\nrequire the installation of sophisticated pumping equipment.\n\nTable 11.Summary of methods for\ndrilling small-diameter wells\n\nThe systems for drawing water from wells can be classified as:\nhand devices using buckets or similar containers; hand-operated pumps; or\nnon-hand-operated pumps. Hand devices using buckets are used in large-diameter\nwells. Despite the fact that several systems have been developed to avoid direct\ncontact between the bucket and the drawer of water, the risk of polluting the\nwell water is still high.\n\nHand pumps can easily be installed on either large-diameter or\nsmall-diameter wells to deliver water above the wells. Most of these pumps are\nof the constant-displacement reciprocating-piston type and, therefore, are easy\nto manufacture, install and maintain. Hand pumps are widely used in developing\ncountries, and many, including Bangladesh, India, Malawi and the United Republic\nof Tanzania, are implementing large rural water-supply programmes based on this\ntechnology. In general, hand-purmp programmes in Latin America are not as\nintensive or as well developed as those currently being implemented in Africa\nand Asia. There are many designs for hand pumps, some better than others, but\nthe basic characteristics of a successful hand pump are that it can be\nmanufactured and maintained locally, requires a minimum of maintenance and is\ndurable. The important principle when implementing a hand-pump programme is to\nensure that there will be the institutional capacity (if possible, with\ncommunity participation) and financial resources to take care of the inspection\nand maintenance of the pumps. A pump design should be chosen on the principle\nthat parts which wear out often should be inexpensive and easy to replace by\nunskilled personnel. The World Bank has supported a programme of testing hand\npump designs to arrive at a ranking of available pumps on the basis of\nvillage-level operation and maintenance (VLOM) criteria.\n\nThere are several combinations of non hand-operated pumps and\ncomplementary driving systems or power sources. First, pumps can be of the\nconstant-displacement type (reciprocating piston pumps, rotary pumps and\nhelical-rotor pumps) or of the variabledisplacement type (centrifugal pumps, jet\npumps etc.). All these types have their advantages and disadvantages and a set\nof situations or uses for which they are most suitable. Most of them, at\npresent, are not manufactured in developing countries, tend to be costly and\nrequire skilled personnel for their maintenance - all factors limiting their use\nin developing countries. The type of energy available is one of the factors\naffecting the design of pumping units, and, apart from human labour, the main\nsources of energy are wind, solar energy, conventional electrical supplies and\nintemal-combustion engines.\n\nWind is a cheap source of energy worthy of consideration in\nsmall water-pumping systems. Windmills have a relatively high capital cost, but\nrecurrent costs are low, and the level of technology is suitable for low- income\ncommunities with unskilled labour Solar energy is a promising alternative to\ntraditional energy sources especially in regions with good solar irradiation\nEnergy from the sun is captured and transformed into electrical energy through\nthe use of arrays of photovoltaic cells. The only drawback with this renewable\nenergy source is the cost of the equipment and the experimental nature of many\nof the systems designed to harness it Both wind and solar energy sources are\nsubject to atmospheric factors in their operation, and, since the reliability of\nwind and solar energy is based on average statistical factors. water supplies\ndepending on these forms of energy should be designed with safety factors which\nare mainly reflected in the storage of water. Electrical motors and\ninternal-combustion engines have been used for many years, both in developed and\ndeveloping countries, but, in spite of the fact that they are not considered to\nbe sophisticated equipment, they still require skilled personnel and\ninstitutional back-up for their maintenance. internal-combustion engines require\nmore maintenance than electric motors and must always be attended by an\noperator. Another consideration is their high initial cost, as well as the costs\nof spares and fuel or electricity. When studying energy sources for a\nwater-pumping system, it is important that the economic comparisons consider the\nwhole water-supply system and not only the driving units of power source.\n\nFresh surface water\n\nAt present, surface water constitutes the main source of water\nfor domestic and industrial consumption. Water from rivers and lakes has a\ngreater chance of being polluted than the other sources already considered, and,\ntherefore, surface water for domestic consumption almost always requires some\nform of treatment.\n\nTechniques for surface-water catchment are not necessarily\ncomplicated but they normally involve civil works, and thus technical\nsupervision is often required. One way of reducing the pollution load when\nabstracting surface water is to construct at infiltration gallery under the bed\nof or alongside the body of the surface water.\n\nSea water\n\nSea water has a dissolved-solids concentration of approximately\n3 to 4 per cent (30,000 to 40,000 mg/l). Because of its high salinity, sea water\ncannot be used directly for drinking purposes or for preparation of food.\nHowever, it can be used for other domestic tasks such as flushing toilets and\nwashing clothing and utensils.\n\nThis is now practiced in places such as Fiji and Hong Kong and\ncould be introduced in other coastal settlements to supplement scarce freshwater\nsources.\n\nWater with high salinity can be treated to drinking water\nstandards, although, of the several processes available, most involve\nsophisticated equipment and are beyond the economic and institutional capacity\nof the majority of developing countries.\n\nDesalination can be accomplished in at least five different\nways: distillation; freezing, reverse osmosis; ion transport; and chemical\nmethods.\n\nOf these methods, only distillation so far offers the\npossibility of using a low-cost technology. Several countries have experimented\nwith and used solar stills to treat sea or brackish water, including Australia,\nIsrael, Mauritania, the United States of America, and several North African\ncountries. A solar still consists basically of a basin in which a black porous\nplastic wick floats, with a sloping cover of lightweight glass sealed at the\nedges. The sun's rays pass through the transparent cover with little reflection\nor absorption and are converted into heat when they strike the black surface.\nWater evaporates from the wick, and the vapour diffuses to the cover where it is\ncondensed to liquid which drains into a trough. The main disadvantages of solar\nstills are the low yield of distilled water per unit area and an absolute\ndependence on weather conditions. Solar stills have, however, proved successful\nwhen supplying individual households or small communities, owing to their low\ncost and relatively simple maintenance requirements. For large settlements, the\nrequired area of evaporation, extensive pipework and complex maintenance make\nsolar stills an inconvenient choice.\n\n3. Water treatment\n\nNeed for treatment\n\nOne of the criteria for selecting a water source is the quality\nof the water, and designers tend to favour sources that require a minimum of\ntreatment. As mentioned before, groundwater or water from springs usually\nrequires little or no treatment at all. In most cases, treatment is reduced to\ndisinfection and, occasionally, to the removal of iron and manganese by\naeration. With surface water, the situation is quite different: suspended\nmatter, dissolved inorganic matter.\n\nOrganic matter causing colour and taste and, finally, pathogenic\nand disease-carrying organisms are typical contaminants. These undesirable\nmaterials should be removed, taking as criteria health impacts, costs and the\neffect of treatment on consumer demand. The first decision to be taken by the\ndesigner of a water supply is whether to treat the water or not, taking into\naccount the facts that water treatment tends to complicate the operation of a\nsystem and to increase costs. For these reasons, treatment processes should be\nincluded only when strictly necessary to bring the water to realistic,\naffordable and potable levels of quality.\n\nStorage\n\nSimple covered storage can help in the removal of the\nschistosome larvae (bilharzia) in developing countries where schistosomiasis is\na problem To achieve this. water should be stored for two days and protected\nfrom further external contamination In medium sized water supply systems\nhowever, protected tanks of this capacity might not be feasible Large storage\nreservoirs are normally designed as part of impounding systems but they are\nmainly unprotected and subject to pollution However, open reservoirs have\nbeneficial effects in reducing the concentration of suspended solids and\npathogenic micro-organisms. The \"treatment\" capacity of storage units should be\nevaluated for each particular case, even though the storage volume is primarily\ndetermined by water-flow regulation considerations. and \"treatment\" is an added\nbenefit.\n\nSedimentation\n\nSedimentation is normally adopted as pre-treatment before\nfiltration.The main objective is to eliminate solids by plain gravity\nsedimentation or, when this is not possible. encourage the formation of large\nsettlable solids by the addition of coagulants to the water Sedimentation in\nitself is a simple process but requires specially designed basins The addition\nof coagulants represents a substantial increase in capital and maintenance\ncosts. because it is necessary to buy the chemicals. store them and provide\nfacilities for their dilution dosage and mixing In addition the correct dosage\nof chemicals as a function of the flow or volume of water to be treated and\nwater quality must be determined. These characteristics of raw water are\nconstantly changing during the normal operation of a treatment plant requiring\nthe regular assessment of water quality and corresponding changes in chemical\ndosage. It has been observed in many rural treatment plants in Africa and Latin\nAmerica that chemical dosages are not applied correctly, leading to wastage of\nchemicals or to low quality of the water supplied The sludge collected in\nsedimentation basins has also to be disposed of by a sanitary method thus\ncreating additional problems in larger water undertakings or where there are not\nsuitable places for studge disposal\n\nThere are several ways to overcome some of these problems but,\nunfortunately they are of very restricted application. In certain rural areas of\nIndia and Africa. plant coagulants are used instead of chemicals, thus reducing\nthe cost of coagulant and its storage and, in addition reducing the amount of\nsludge produced. Sedimentation basins can be increased in size and made less\nexpensive by the use of local building materials and appropriate building\ntechnologies, and the same can be said of the mixing and dosing unit\n\nAnother option its the complete elimination of sedimentation\nbasins by adding coagulants directly before filtration This technique requires\nnon-conventional filter systems which will be discussed later Finally, under\ncertain conditions sedimentation basins card be replaced by coarse media pre-\nfilters or roughing filtration Even so, for large water supply situations, there\nis no well-tested alternative to treatment by coagulation, and the problems of\noperation also remain\n\nFiltration\n\nTechnical literature normally classifies filters into two\ncategories - slow sand filters and rapid filtration units. Slow sand filters\n(SSF) are widely used in rural settlements all over the world. They can\neliminate turbidity and at least 99 per cent of the bacteria and viruses in\nwater, through a process of mechanical straining and biological activity in the\nsurface of the filter. Among the main advantages of SSFs are: low capital cost\nand easy construction; simple maintenance and low recurrent costs; no energy\nrequirement; acceptance of reasonable variations in raw-water quality;\nelimination of water wastage; and, in most cases, elimination of the need for\ndisinfection of the effluent. The cost of an SSF can be reduced by the use of\nlow-cost building materials and techniques or by the use of innovative\ntechnologies such as the filter media in the two-stage filter, developed at the\nAsian Institute of\n\nTechnology in Bangkok, which has been installed in the\nPhilippines, Thailand and Viet Nam. 3 In this filter, the first stage (coconut\nfibre) serves as a roughing filter' and the second stage (burnt rice-husks) is\nsimilar to an SSF. Coarse-media pre-filters can be used to replace sedimentation\nusing coagulants, and research on this system has proved that 60-70 per cent of\nthe suspended solids and 80 per cent of the conform organisms in raw surface\nwater can be removed.\n\nIn rapid filtration units (RFU), water passes through a bed of\nsand or other filter medium by gravity or under pressure. These filters rely on\nmechanical straining for the removal of suspended solids and some organisms.\nWhen the filter medium becomes clogged, it is cleaned by backwashing. This\nsystem requires skilled personnel for its operation, is relatively expensive,\ninvolves fairly elaborate civil works and pipework, and requires the use of\nmechanical equipment such as backwashing pumps. Backwashing water represents a\nsubstantial amount of the production - approximately 4 per cent - and, in places\nwith scarce water resources, this might not be acceptable. There are many types\nof RFUs which can be used, depending on the direction of flow, type of filter\nmedium, system of backwashing, system of filter control (flow or heady, type of\npre-filter treatment etc. The current level of technical development of RFUs\nmakes them unsuitable for water treatment to supply low-income rural and urban\nsettlements in developing countries, where the community must provide operation\nand maintenance.\n\nDisinfection\n\nThe disinfection of water aims at the inactivation of pathogenic\nmicro- organisms and the provision of residual protection to the water against\npossible contamination during its transport from the point of treatment to the\nconsumer. There are several techniques for disinfection, with the application of\nchemical disinfectants (especially chlorine compounds) being the simplest and,\nso far, the cheapest method for consideration in supplying water to low-income\nsettlements in developing countries. Simple chlorinators which dose chlorine\ncompounds at constant rates can be made using very simple technology but they\nneed to be calibrated properly for efficient use. Disinfection using chlorine in\npure gas form requires complex equipment and presents problems in the\nacquisition, transporting and storage of chlorine. Further, its use is not\nappropriate without skilled personnel and adequate institutional back-up.\n\nDisinfection is mainly applied to surface waters, and it is\nessential for turbidity to be reduced to acceptable levels if disinfecting\nchemicals are to be effective.\n\nSmall-diameter wells do not normally require disinfection, but,\nit it is decided to disinfect, this has to be done at certain points in the\nstorage or distribution system.\n\nSo far, there is no reliable and efficient method discovered for\ndisinfecting small- diameter wells equipped with a hand pump. For large-diameter\nwells, experiments have been conducted with the \"pot chlorinator\". This consists\nof a porous or perforated container which contains bleaching powder (any other\ndry chlorine compound can also be used) mixed with sand. The container is\nimmersed under water in the well, and the chemical is released slowly. The use\nof these chlorinators has proved successful in countries such as China and\nIndia, but gross contamination of shallow wells will not be controlled using\nthis technique.\n\nHousehold treatment\n\nIf it is decided not to treat or only partially to treat\npolluted water before distribution to the consumer, it is obvious that water\nmust receive household treatment, if health risks are to be avoided. The\nobjectives and principles of household treatment are similar to those in water\ntreatment facilities. The planner should acknowledge that, by transferring the\ntreatment function to the household, he is also transferring costs. The\nclarification of or removal of turbidity from water at the household level can\nbe achieved by filtration, storage, coagulation or sedimentation.\n\nTraditional filtration is practiced in several countries of the\ndeveloping regions - e.g.. Bangladesh, Ecuador, India, the Islamic Republic of\nIran, and Sudan. The filtration process normally involves passing water through\nsieves, cloths, vessels of dry or porous stones, or plant material. In some\nareas of Nigeria and Sudan, water is stored for five months before use, allowing\nfor sedimentation and natural purification. Short-term storage, for 12 to 24\nhours, to allow sedimentation is also practiced in countries such as Kenya as a\npre-treatment for further purification.\n\nThere is a great variety of plant material that can be used to\nproduce coagulation, but this treatment is only feasible for small volumes of\nwater where there is a constant supply of appropriate raw material.\n\n4. Distribution system\n\nWhen water is not supplied to the consumer directly from the\nsource, it is necessary to construct a water-distribution system that will bring\nwater close to every household. Since the distribution network is one of the\nmost expensive items in a water-supply system, the standards for design and\nservice level should be carefully studied and chosen for every situation. The\nchoice of service level, which can range from a simple water main and a few\ncommunal water taps to a complex network with multiple house connections. must\ntake into account: the quantitative and qualitative water demand; the investment\nand running costs; the ability of the consumers to pay the real price for the\nwater; the financial resources available for investment or subsidies; and the\ncapacity available for managing the installations.\n\nIn most instances, national governments or local authorities\nhave standards and codes of practice which regulate the design and construction\nof the different components of a water-supply system. Most of these standards\nare extremely conservative, specifying levels of quality in materials and\nequipment that make low-cost projects unacceptable. It is essential that current\ncodes of practice, which fix required storage volumes, minimum pipe pressures,\nconsumption peak factors etc., be revised to allow flexibility and leave room\nfor modification or variation, based on the study of individual physical and\nsocio-economic conditions for a particular water-supply system. Several methods\nhave been devised to optimize the service level, the standards and the technical\nparameters of a water supply system as a function of cost and user-convenience.\nLow-cost design or technology is not synonymous with a low-quality product, and\nplanners should strive to achieve the correct balance between these\nconsiderations.\n\nAn appropriate water-distribution system is the result of\ncareful decisions regarding service levels, use of cost-effective materials and\ntechniques, and design of the different components of the distribution system.\nThe basic knowledge to achieve this goal is available, but what is needed is\nfilm political and institutional commitment to apply it in the\nproject-implementation process. Currently, common knowledge and practice\nindicate that water supply through communal water taps (or standpipes) is\ncheaper than through individual house connections. Thus, a very simple standpipe\nfor use in rural areas should cost $20-$50, and a standpipe for urban use, with\nconcrete support construction, two to four taps and a platform with a drainage\nfacility, is likely to cost $200-$500. 2 However, data from 27 countries show\nthat standpipes are very often over-designed and cost much more than commonly\nestimated. Consequently, attention should be paid to the design, cost, location\nand level of service to be provided from standpipes. The relatively high cost of\nsome standpipe systems implies that it should be possible to upgrade the\nwater-supply service to house connections, thus making it possible to achieve,\nwith only a marginal increase in cost, better cost recovery (tariff collection),\nless water wastage, less risk of contamination, and saving in productive time\ndedicated to water collection.\n\nFinally, special attention should be given to existing\nwater-distribution facilities when upgrading low income settlements. It is well\nknown that water wastage in the distribution system sometimes amounts to a\nsubstantial proportion of the produced water. Investment in the repair of leaks\nand control equipment can often increase the amount of water available to\nconsumers at a minimal\ncost."

      "text": "Private water supplies\n\nPrivate water supplies include water:\n\nfrom groundwater sources\n\ndrawn from privately owned boreholes or wells\n\ntaken from surface water such as springs and streams\n\nThe Private Water Supplies Regulations (England) 2009, together with the Water Industry Act 1991, apply to all private water supplies intended for human consumption, whether this be for drinking, washing or food production. The aim of the regulations is to ensure that all private water sources are safe and free from contaminants.\n\nDo these Regulations affect me?\n\nYes: if the water supplies for your accommodation, self-catering establishment, caravan park or food production premises come from a private supply.\n\nDo these Regulations affect me?\n\nThe 2009 Regulations require that each local authority must record the number of private supplies in its area, and for each supply must record:\n\nthe name of the supply, together with a unique identifier\n\nthe type of source\n\nthe geographical location using a grid reference\n\nan estimate of the number of people supplied\n\nan estimate of the average daily volume of water supplied in cubic metres\n\nthe type of premises supplied\n\ndetail of any treatment process, together with its location\n\nthe name of the Health Protection Agency in whose area the supply is located.\n\nAfter the initial assessment, the regulations require local authorities to monitor the supply on an ongoing basis. The regularity of the sampling will vary depending upon the volume of water used, from once a year for supplies of less than 10 cubic metres per day to 34 times a year for supplies of up to 10,000 cubic metres per day.\n\nIn addition, the local authority must also undertake a thorough risk assessment of each supply at least once every five years.\n\nCost of samples\n\nThe local authority will contact the person responsible for the supply (this may be the landowner, a person using the water, or a person representing a group of water users) about sampling. The Regulations set out the maximum amounts that a local authority can charge for undertaking risk assessments, taking and analysing samples, and providing authorisations to use a private water supply.\n\nThe bill will be sent to the person responsible. If an authority decides to carry out tests over and above those required by the regulations, it has to bear the costs of these tests itself.\n\nIf test results show that the water is unwholesome, because it fails to meet the standards or other requirements, the local authority can insist the water supply is improved. If any private supply of water intended for human consumption constitutes a potential danger to human health, a local authority acting under these Regulations will serve a notice to the responsible person. It is an offence to breach this notice. However, the Regulations establish an appeal process is you wish to challenge a notice.\n\nNote: The Government is currently considering amendments to the regulations due to concerns being expressed that the testing regime being imposed by some local authorities is disproportionate to the risk.\n\nThe resale of gas and electricity\n\nMaximum resale prices\n\nIf you are reselling gas and/or electricity that has already been bought from an authorised supplier, the amount you can charge your customers is limited by the 'maximum resale price rule'. This mean that the most you can charge a customer for the supply of gas or electricity is the amount that you yourself have been charged by your gas or electricity supply company. Put another way, you can only sell gas or electricity to your guests on a non-profit basis.\n\nAs the provisions relating to the maximum resale prices for electricity and gas are reviewed from time to time, you should also occasionally check the Ofgem website (see Further guidance below) to see whether there have been any changes.\n\nDo maximum resale prices apply to me?\n\nYes: if you make a specific charge to your customers for gas or electricity, whether or not you use individual meters to record their consumption. The rule typically applies to self-catering accommodation and caravan sites, although it affects all forms of accommodation where separate charging occurs. If you overcharge for electricity or gas, your customer can ask for a refund of the excess and can pursue the matter in the small claims courts if necessary.\n\nNo: if you do not make a specific charge for electricity and/or gas (eg if customers are charged a single rental figure for fully inclusive accommodation). The rule does not apply to any gas or electricity that is used in your own facilities, eg in a laundry room or shower block on a caravan park. Charges for the fuel used in these situations must be billed separately.\n\nNote! Your customers have the right to seek advice from Consumer Focus should they believe that they are being overcharged. The Consumer Focus contact number is 08454 040506 (\n\nAs the provisions relating to the maximum resale prices for electricity and gas are reviewed from time to time, you should also occasionally check the Ofgem website (see Further guidance below) to see whether there have been any changes.\n\nPrice of energy units\n\nIf you are charged a single unit rate for gas or electricity by your own supplier, you must charge your customers the same rate. If the unit rate varies, eg if you pay on an economy 7 type tariff, or prices vary on a seasonal basis, you will need to calculate an average price for each unit used.\n\nA copy of the explanatory publication, The resale of gas and electricity- guidance for resellers is available to download from the Ofgem website. This gives further information and includes example resale price calculations.\n\nStanding charges\n\nIn addition to the charge for units used, many authorised suppliers levy a standing charge to cover the cost of maintaining your connection and billing you for the fuel. You can recover this from your customers – the individual sums need to be calculated according to the number of units of electricity used by each consumer. Once again, the Ofgem publication gives further guidance.\n\nWaste Collection\n\nIf you pay business rates then, unless you qualify for the exemption under the Controlled Waste Regulations 2012, you will need to pay for a commercial waste collection service either through your council or with a private contractor. The Controlled Waste Regulations provide an exemption from waste disposal charges for small businesses that:\n\nwere operating prior to 6 April 2012 and were eligible for free waste disposal at this date; and\n\nare eligible for Small Business Rate Relief (ie., the property has a rateable value of less than £12,000)\n\nNote: Waste collection charges comprise two components – a charge to collect the waste and a separate charge to dispose of the waste. Therefore, even if you qualify for the exemption from waste disposal charges, you will still need to pay for your waste to be collected."

      "text": "Traditional Water Sources\n\nMany people in Kathmandu suffer from stomach ailments and waterborne diseases. It is a well established fact that the major factor causing such problems is contaminated water. The problem becomes an acute one when various impurities are found to seep into the supply system. This type of contaminated water, even if it is boiled, is unsafe to drink.\n\nThe supply of such drinking water undermines the health of the citizens. This leads to a greater number of sick people and hence more has to be spent on public health facilities. It would be advisable to purify the water before supplying it to the consumers. Besides, a new strategy is called for to tackle the shortage of drinking water; perhaps two pipe connections could be provided to each consumer, one for drinking purpose and the other for gardening or such other use. This type of system will remove, to a great extent, the use of drinking water for other purposes. If greater attention is paid to improving the quality of drinking water supplied in the valley, it will greatly reduce the cases of waterborne diseases."

      "text": "Should You Have Your Water\nTested?\nWhether to have your water tested is a serious question that concerns\nyour health and that of your family. Your water should be safe to\ndrink and acceptable for all other household uses. Contaminated water\ncan cause illness and perhaps even death. In addition, a variety of\nless serious problems such as bad taste, off-color, odor and staining\nof clothes or fixtures are symptoms of water quality problems.\n\nEven water that appears problem-free and crystal clear may not be safe\nor acceptable. Even so, not all people need to test their water.\nTesting for all possible contaminants is impractical and\nunnecessary.\n\nWhen Should You Test Your\nWater?\nWhether you have a public or private water supply, you should have\nyour water tested if the following situations arise:\n\nSituation\n\nTest\n\nFamily members or house guests have recurrent incidents of\ngastrointestinal illness.\n\nTest for coliform bacteria, nitrate\nand sulfate.\n\nHousehold water plumbing contains lead pipes, fittings or\nsolder joints.\n\nTest for pH, corrosion index, lead, copper,\ncadmium and zinc.\n\nYou are buying a home and wish to assess the safety and\nquality of the existing water supply.\n\nWater leaves scaly residues and soap scum and decreases the\ncleaning action of soaps and detergents.\n\nTest for\nhardness.\n\nWater supply equipment (pump, chlorinators, etc.) wears\nrapidly.\n\nTest for pH, corrosion index.\n\nPublic vs. Private Water\nSupplies\nMany homeowners get water simply by turning on the faucet and making a\nmonthly payment to a municipal or other local water system. They use\npublic water supplies in which individual households are connected to\nthe same water system. Public systems draw water from rivers,\nreservoirs, springs and groundwater wells.\n\nIn private systems, individuals or individual households provide their\nown systems. Most private drinking water comes from wells, sometimes\nfrom springs and ponds.\n\nIf your water comes from a public water system, your water is tested\nregularly for contaminants that are covered by federal and state\nstandards. These contaminants include pathogens, radioactive elements\nand certain toxic chemicals. However, some public water supplies may\nhave water quality problems caused by inadequate treatment facilities\nor distribution systems. Some rural water supply districts do not have\nenough money to hire trained specialists or to comply immediately with\nexpanding government requirements. In addition, corrosive water or\ndeteriorating household pipes may add contaminants to drinking water\nafter it enters the house.\n\nIf your drinking water comes from your own well, you alone are\nresponsible for ensuring its safety. Routine testing for a few of the\nmost common contaminants is highly recommended. Even if your water\nsupply currently is pure and safe, regular testing can be valuable\nbecause it establishes a record of water quality. This record can be\nhelpful in solving any future problems and in establishing or\nassessing damages to your water supply.\n\nTesting Private Water\nSupplies Routine Tests -- The following testing frequencies are\nguidelines. Test more often if you suspect a problem with the quality\nof your water supply.\n\nOnce each year, test for coliform bacteria, nitrate, pH\nand total dissolved solids (TDS). The best times to test for these\ncontaminants are during spring or summer following a rainy period.\nThese tests also should be conducted after repairing or replacing an\nold well or pipes and after installing a new pump.\n\nIf a new baby is expected in the household, it is a good\nidea to test for nitrate in the early months of pregnancy, before\nbringing the infant home and again during the first 6 months of the\nbaby's life.\n\nSpecial Situations -- Where you live, and what is next to where\nyou live, can sometimes affect the quality of your water. If someone\nin your family becomes ill or if the taste, odor or color of your\nwater changes, your water supply may be contaminated.\n\nSituation\n\nTest\n\nYour well is in an area of intensive agricultural\nuse.\n\nTest for pesticides commonly used in the area, coliform\nbacteria, nitrate, pH and TDS.\n\nYour water smells of gasoline or fuel oil and your well is\nlocated near an operating or abandoned gas station or near buried fuel\nstorage tanks.\n\nTest for fuel components or volatile organic\ncompounds (VOC).\n\nYour well is near a road salt storage site or a heavily salted\nroadway and the water tastes salty or corrosion appears on\npipes.\n\nTest for chloride, TDS and sodium.\n\nCollecting Test Samples\nMost testing laboratories or services provide their own sample\ncontainers. Use the containers and carefully follow the laboratory's\ninstructions for collecting, preserving and handling water samples.\nSamples for coliform bacteria testing must be collected in sterile\ncontainers under sterile conditions. Some collection procedures call\nfor water to run from an inside tap for several minutes before you\nfill the sample containers. Other instructions ask you to collect\nsamples in the morning, after water has been confined in the pipes\novernight. Samples should arrive at a laboratory within 24 hours of\ncollection.\n\nLaboratories may sometimes send a trained technician to collect the\nsample or to analyze the sample in your home. Ask if this service is\navailable. You may obtain better samples and therefore more reliable\ntest results.\n\nRecord all your water test results as a reference for future testing.\nEven slight changes in contaminant concentrations are good indicators\nof new water problems. By comparing recent test results with past\nresults, you may discover you need a change in treatment or that a\ntreatment device is working poorly.\n\nTesting Services\n\nPublic water supply systems are tested regularly for primary\ncontaminants, monitored for levels of sodium and certain unregulated\nchemical contaminants and examined for corrosion in the water\ndistribution system. They will provide water quality reports upon\nrequest water testing services.\n\nBe wary of companies offering \"free home water testing.\" Some of\nthem may be interested only in selling you a water treatment device,\nwhether or not you need it.\n\nContact the Extension agent in your county for information about\nwater testing in your area.\n\nThe Authors -- Ernestine Porter is Extension textiles and clothing\nspecialist, Roy Taylor is Extension agricultural engineer and Robert\nL.

      "text": "There is a very low level of naturally occurring fluoride in Park City's water (see Water Quality in Your Area). The Park City Water Department does not add fluoride.\n\nQ: Why do water mains sometimes break?\n\nA:\n\nMost of the water mains in Park City are made of iron, which makes them affordable and reliable. These water mains can last a long time if they do what they were made to do, transport water from one place to another. However, aging pipelines experience cracks and joint failures from time to time as a result of their age combined with small amounts of settling in support base.\n\nChances of breaks can be exacerbated by high pressures that occasionally occur due to the complex system of pressure zones in Park City. The Park City Water Department staff proactively perform monthly checks, maintenance and repair of all pressure reducing valves in the city to preclude breaks directly related to high pressures.\n\nUnfortunately, water line breaks cause interruption of water service, damage to property, messy streets, and sometimes temporarily cause discolored water delivery to our customers. Water Department staff are on-call 24 hours a day and respond as quickly as possible to keep outages to a minimum.\n\nQ: Who controls my water's quality?\n\nA:\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in Washington, D.C. sets national drinking water standards to protect public health. These standards are enforced in our state by the Utah Division of Drinking Water.\n\nDepending on the regulation, Park City submits quality test results to the Division of Drinking Water on a monthly or annual basis to prove that we are providing water that meets all of the standards. All samples are analyzed in state approved labs. If there were ever a serious water quality problem, the state would immediately be notified and they would oversee our response and corrective actions.\n\nQ: How hard is my water?\n\nA:\n\nThe hardness of water is determined by the calcium and magnesium carbonates naturally dissolved in it. Across the U.S., there are waters that are very soft (low in carbonates) and waters that are very hard (high in carbonates).\n\nHardness is measured in parts per million or grains. Soft water has about 1 grain of minerals per gallon. Moderately hard water has about 3 to 7 grains of minerals per gallon. Very hard water has over 10 grains per gallon.\n\nArea of Park City\n\nHardness\n\nParts per Million\n\nGrains per Gallon\n\nUpper and Lower Deer Valley\n\n280 - 320\n\n16 - 19\n\nOld Town\n\n200\n\n11\n\nThaynes, Park Meadows, Prospector\n\n575-625\n\n33 - 37\n\nQ: Can I get my water tested?\n\nA:\n\nThe Park City Water Department tests the water supplied to the city consistently. We run tests throughout the system, every day in compliance with EPA and Utah Division of Drinking Water requirements. In addition, we collect samples for numerous constituents in eight representative areas of the city so that data for the quality of water that is delivered to your service is readily available. You can access this information on this site at Water Quality In Your Area.\n\nIt is not necessary to have your water tested. However, if you desire to have your water tested, the Park City Water Department will be glad to recommend local labs that are certified by the Utah Division of Drinking Water.\n\nQ: Why are there particles in my tap water?\n\nA:\n\nParticles can come from a variety of sources. One of the most common sources is the hot water heater. Other sources that generate black particles in tap water is the disintegration of rubber materials used in plumbing fixtures. Gaskets and o-rings can disintegrate over time and collect in toilet tanks and around faucets."

      "text": "Danger in our water? Here in the United States, it's not something we often think about. We turn on the tap to fill our cups or cooking pots. We are privileged with this luxury to get clean water immediately at the turn of a handle. If we can afford it, we may even use a filter such as Brita or Pur, and think that we are drinking good water because it filters out some of the junk and makes the water taste better. Maybe we go to the store to purchase bottled water, but there is no telling where that water came from. Many bottled water sources actually come from city tap water. (If you would like to see how your bottled water measures up, check out the EWG's bottled water score card.) The truth is; however, that these \"precautions\" do not filter out what we should most be concerned about: Fluoride.\n\nFact:\"Most developed countries, including Japan and 97% of the western European population, do not consume fluoridated water.\" Source:Fluoride Action Network Some of you might think this doesn't apply to you because you drink well water, or maybe you already have a reverse osmosis system in your home. Actually, none of you are safe from fluoride either, but we'll get to that in a minute.\n\nBut wait. Isn't fluoride supposed to be \"good\" for us? I mean, that's what we are told by the ADA and Public Health Department. Even our own dentists recommend that we get topical fluoride treatments, especially for our kids. You want your kids to have healthy, strong teeth right? But what if I told you that you and your kids do not need any of this in order to have good oral health. 'Gasp!' It's true! If you eat right and brush your teeth with homemade toothpaste or a fluoride free version, you will have healthy teeth. Okay so not everyone eats right and brushes as often as they should. What about them? Well, if their dentist thinks they should have a fluoride treatment, that's the individual's choice to make. Just like you have a choice whether to purchase fluoride toothpaste or not. Have you looked at the back of your toothpaste tube lately? If you are using a kind that contains fluoride, it will have some drug facts and warnings. That's right. I said drug facts. Fluoride is a drug and a harmful one at that. With most drugs, the body is able to metabolize and excrete the excess waste, if you have proper kidney function that is. Fluoride though doesn't leave the body easily. It really likes calcium. It floats through the bloodstream searching for something to bind to and heads for the bones. Once there, it's stored up ready to expose the individual over and over again to this toxin by way of osteoclast and osteoblast activity. This brings forth my first protest against it's use in the water supply. Why is our government allowing the practice of adding a drug to our water? A drug that is regulated by the FDA in toothpaste but not in my water? I'm a Registered Nurse, and I know what is required of me before I administer any medication. The six rights of drug administration were drilled into my head over and over again in nursing school.\n\nSix Rights of Drug Administration 1. The Right Person 2. The Right Drug 3. The Right Dose 4. The Right Time 5. The Right Route 6. The Right Disease Document Now I find it quite shocking that none of this applies to the drug fluoride. I wouldn't dare give an adult dose of Tylenol or Morphine to a small child. That could be deadly. So why is it that it's okay to throw some fluoride in the water without considering any of the 6 Rights? It's unethical and violates informed consent.\n\nOn the back of your fluoridated toothpaste the FDA warning states to use a \"pea size\" amount and if more than that were to be accidentally ingested, it could have serious health consequences and poison control should be called. Do you know how much is in a glass of water? In the video, Your Toxic Tap Water, Dr.Paul Connett, Professor of Chemistry at St. Lawrence University states that \"A pea sized amount of fluoridated toothpaste contains about one quarter of a milligram of fluoride. Now, we fluoridate at 1 part per million. That's 1 milligram per liter. A quarter of a milligram of fluoride would be in a quarter liter of water or 250 milliliters or one large glass of water.\" You can see his exact statement beginning at 25:00 minutes into this video. It's a good one, so I do recommend you watch it in it's entirety.\n\nSo hopefully we now all agree that yes, fluoride is a drug, and with every drug, there are side effects. Health Dangers of Fluoride\n\nThere may be many health effects that we haven't discovered yet that are caused by excessive fluoride. If we look back through data on when fluoridation started, I wonder if we would find correlations between mass fluoridation and heart disease or autism or ADHD.\n\nI wonder how many mothers go home from the hospital after having a baby and are not told that they shouldn't use tap water in their baby's bottle. I don't think many people consider this. So I'm telling you, please do not use tap water in your baby's bottle. You need to use fluoride free water. Never buy the nursery water that contains fluoride! The only way to filter out this harmful chemical is to buy a reverse osmosis system or the Big Berkey with the fluoride filters. Berkey PF-2 Arsenic and Fluoride filters work in conjunction with their other filters. In order to get the fluoride out, you have to buy the PF-2 filters along with the Black Berkey filters. Remember how I mentioned that those of you with well water, reverse osmosis systems, or fluoride filters, still are not safe? That's because most of our country fluoridates their water. Just because you filter at home (which is still better than not) doesn't mean you're not getting fluoride from other sources such as wine, beer, fruit juices, soda, soup, soup broths, tea, even meats. Manufacturers are most likely using fluoridated water to make your foods. (Another reason to avoid processed foods.)

      "text": "(dry) taste in my mouth because the only water available to drink was bottled water!\n\nBottled water wastes fossil fuels and water in production and transport, and when the water is drunk the bottles become a major source of waste. It takes more than 47 million gallons of oil to produce plastic water bottles for Americans every year. Eliminating those bottles would be like taking 100,000 cars off the road and 1 billion pounds of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Each one of those bottles required nearly five times its volume in water to manufacture the plastic and may have caused the release of nickel, ethylene oxide, and benzene. Then, rather than being recycled, 86 percent of them are thrown away. Breaking down these plastics can take thousands of years, while their components seep into our water supplies.\n\nWhat's worse, a significant proportion of bottled water is simply tap water which has been bottled! No, really. Both Aquafina from PepsiCo and Dasani from The Coca-Cola Company originate from municipal water systems, for example!\n\nDespite all that, an estimated 50 billion bottles of water are consumed per annum in the US and around 200 billion bottles globally.\n\nCome on SAP. You are working hard on improving your sustainability message. And by and large are doing a good job at it but really, bottled water? In 2009?\n\nHere's my challenge to SAP (and all conference organisers) – make commitment that you will never again run a conference at a venue that can't provide water dispensing machines, instead of bottled water.\n\nSeriously, if you are negotiating with a venue about holding your event and you mention that that is a dealbreaker, they'll provide the machines.\n\nTom – you are right. Bottled water should have no place on the menu in this day and age.\n\nLets not forget the elephant in the living room here though – air travel. A typical delegate flying roundtrip within Europe would have to drink around 2500 bottles of water to match the damage done to climate by flying there.\n\nYou are absolutely correct to point out that the air travel by delegates has a much higher carbon footprint than the bottles. However, you need to remember that bottled water does much more damage than just the CO2 emitted in its production and transportation. There is also the environmental damage from the PET bottles themselves, not to mention the detrimental effects on our health of drinking from these bottles.\n\nAlso consider that most delegates didn't have a choice of how they travelled to the venue. Had there been water dispensers available, they would, at least, have had a choice not to damage the environment by merely having a drink.\n\nHowever, I disagree that conference delegates, whatever the event, in general have no choices to make when it comes to travel. First, delegates can increasingly choose virtual options and avoid the travel completely and we should encourage the professional conference business to develop these options and enhance the virtual experience.\n\nNext, people can be creative and choose taking train transport where possible. Its more viable than you think. I'm planning a trip to London next week and I am going to try to take the train. I found it takes only 90 minutes longer door to door and I can keep working and be more productive enroute.\n\nFinally, it is possible and important to consider which carriers operate more efficiently when we do have to fly. Real information in this regard is becoming more available in the market place and as consumers we should demand it"

It's in every can of pop, every bottle of beer, even in boneless chicken and our food,\" she said.\n\nThe type of fluoride introduced in 1951 is not the same as what is being used now, with a more dangerous version introduced in 1980, she added. \"And there are typically no warnings; there's no warnings on our water bills that mothers should not be using tap water to prepare milk and that no one under three should consume fluoride. Because it's in everything, we have no idea how much we're consuming.\"\n\nShe said fluoride can contain other harmful agents, such as arsenic, mercury or lead and can affect the body in many different ways.\n\n\"It can affect your kidneys, it can affect your bones. Fluoride poisoning feels a lot like arthritis and accumulates in the body and can affect IQ and the thyroid,\" Bednar said.\n\n\"And the list goes on. We simply should not be swallowing this; brush and spit and that's it.\"\n\nBednar said it is a movement that is starting to gain legs in the province and country, with as many as 46 towns, cities or municipalities cancelling drinking water fluoridation including the City of Orillia, which cancelled their program this past July.\n\n\"There are thousands of reports out now, the latest major one came out in July by Harvard University and we are really only just learning the effects fluoridation has on us,\" she said. \"We know it's going to be an uphill battle, but if we can educate the public about our concerns, that's the start.\""

      "text": "Navigate\n\nWater\n\nWater is often called the \"universal solvent.\"Courtesy ofKelly A. Quin.\n\nWater is a chemical compound composed of a single oxygen atom bonded to two hydrogen atoms (H2O) that are separated by an angle of 105°. Because of their polar covalent bonds and this asymmetrical bent arrangement, water molecules have a tendency to orient themselves in an electric field, with the positively charged hydrogen toward the negative pole and the negatively charged oxygen toward the positive pole. This tendency results in water having a large dielectric constant, which is responsible for making water an excellent solvent. Water is therefore referred to as the universal solvent. Water can be reused indefinitely as a solvent because it undergoes almost no modification in the process.\n\nBecause mineral salts and organic materials can dissolve in water, it is the ideal medium for transporting products of geochemical weathering as well as life-sustaining minerals and nutrients into and through animal and plant bodies. Brackish and ocean waters may contain large quantities of sodium chloride as well as many other soluble compounds leached from Earth's crust.\n\nThe concentration of mineral salts in ocean water is about 35,000 parts per million. Water is considered to be potable (drinkable) only if it contains less than 500 parts per million of salts.\n\nHydrogen bonding, which joins water molecule to water molecule, is responsible for other properties that make water a unique substance. These properties include its large heat capacity, which causes water to act as a moderator of temperature fluctuations due to variations in solar illumination, its high surface tension (due to cohesion among water molecules), and its adherence to other substances, such as the walls of a vessel (due to adhesion between water molecules and the molecules of a second substance). The high surface tension makes it possible for surface-gliding insects and broad, flat objects to be supported on the surface of water. Adhesion of water molecules to soil particles is the primary mechanism by which water moves through unsaturated soils.\n\nHydrogen bonding is also responsible for ice being less dense than water. If ice did not float, all bodies of water would freeze from the bottom up, becoming solid masses of ice and destroying all life in them. In addition, from season to season, frozen water bodies would remain frozen, resulting in large changes in climate and weather, such as decreased precipitation due to reduced evaporation. Ice floats because as the temperature of water is lowered the tendency of water to contract as its molecular motion decreases is overcome by the strength of hydrogen bonding between molecules. At 4°C (39°F), water molecules start to structure themselves directionally along the lines of the hydrogen bonds, at angles of 105° As the temperature drops toward 0°C (32°F), spaces develop between the lines until the open, crystalline form characteristic of ice develops. Its openness produces a density slightly less than that of liquid water, and ice floats on the surface, with approximately nine-tenths submerged.\n\nWater is the only common substance that occurs naturally on earth in three different physical states. The solid state, ice, is characterized by a rigid crystalline structure occurring at or below 0°C (32°F) and occupying a definite volume (found as glaciers and ice caps, as snow, hail, and frost, and as clouds formed of ice crystals). At sea level atmospheric pressure, the liquid state exists over a definite temperature range 0°C to 100°C (32 to 212°F), but is not rigid nor does it have a particular shape. Liquid water has a definite volume but assumes the shape of its container. Liquid water covers three-fourths of Earth's surface in the form of swamps, lakes, rivers, and oceans as well as found as rain clouds, dew, and ground water. The gaseous state of water (water vapor) neither occupies a definite volume nor is rigid because it takes on the exact shape and volume of its container. Water vapor (liquid water molecules suspended in the air) occurs in steam, humidity, fog, and clouds.\n\nDuring phase changes, one phase does not suddenly replace its predecessor as the temperature changes, but for a time at the melting or boiling point, two phases will coexist. As water changes from the gaseous form to the liquid form, it gives off heat at about 540 calories per gram, and as it changes from the liquid form to the solid form, it gives off about 80 calories per gram. The turbulence of thunderstorms is in large part due to the release latent heat of water especially as water condenses into water droplets or into crystals of ice (i.e., hail).\n\nPressure affects the transition temperature between phases. For example, at pressures below atmospheric, water boils at temperatures under 100°C (212°F), therefore food takes longer to cook at higher elevations.\n\nWater is a major geologic agent of change for modifying Earth's surface through erosion by water and ice."

      "text": "Posts Tagged 'septic tanks'\n\nHouseholds may still be running on bioseptic tanks even if we live in a day and age where large scale wastewater treatment plants are readily available. Septic systems were servicing 26.1 million housing units in 2007 and this is based from the statistics from the US Environmental Protection Agency. It is important that a maintenance schedule be applied considering that you are still using a septic tank system in your home so continue reading this.\n\nA long lifespan is usually associated with bioseptic tanks. They can easily last you for a lifetime but you need to apply a proper maintenance schedule. By following several simple guidelines, it will be possible for you to maintain the best performance of your tanks. Further education on the subject of water tanks can be found at Septic Tank.\n\nWhat comes into play in this particular situation is the saying 'Prevention is key'. When it comes to this, it can easily be applied to bioseptic tanks. A longer lifespan is possible when it comes to your tank but you need to see to it that you only use safe cleaning products at home.\n\nApart from cleaning products that read 'dangerous' or 'poisonous on' the back labels, you should also stay away from dish washing liquids. Passing through the bioseptic tanks is all the water that goes down your drain and this is what you should not forget. For your septic tank system, if you want to avoid any damages, avoid cleaning agents which have corrosive and poisonous ingredients.\n\nIt is possible for your bioseptic tanks to have some form of physical damage if you use cleaning agents that contain poisonous chemicals and these can also be fatal to the bacteria inside them. It is a less effective system that you will end up with if you decrease the bacteria count inside the tanks since the solids in the wastewater are broken down by these microorganisms. Here, the components inside your tank are being broken down but they are doing so at a slower pace and this can eventually lead to clogging and leakage problems. This article is about water tanks and more info found at Septic Tanks Prices.\n\nTo counter this, people utilize sink grinders. You should never mix the workings of sink grinders with that of bioseptic tanks. What sink grinders do to the food waste products is slice them into very small pieces and this actually translates to more work for the microorganisms in your septic tanks.\n\nThere is more work for the septic bacteria when the sink grinders used in homes make more solid waste for them to deal with and break down requiring more time to be used up. If breakdown processes take a longer time to accomplish, expect problems with your septic systems. Problems with clogging and leakage normally result from the use of sink grinders.\n\nDo consider several simple guidelines in order to ensure that your bioseptic tanks are performing at their best. With regard to your drainage septic field, avoid growing plants near this area. In this case, what you have is the area where the septic system releases the clear liquid from wastewater.\n\nThe first thought that comes to mind is that this will make for nutritious soil but it will not. Keep in mind that plants have roots that can grow thicker and stronger in time. Due to this, the roots of the plants can damage the pipes connected to your septic system.\n\nSeptic tank additives aid the internal bacteria that work hard in your bioseptic tanks and so you should consider purchasing these for the active microorganisms. Numerous companies actually offer routine check ups and debris removal for the septic tank systems you may have at home. If you have bioseptic tanks, these maintenance steps and preventive measures will ensure that your tanks last for a very long time.\n\nWhen it comes to street cleaning, this is an expense that cannot be handled by some municipalities. Expect to pay around 70 to 150 thousand dollars when you spend for street sweeping efforts in your area since you need to buy a number of water tanks and prices depend on the design of these tanks and such vehicles also need all sorts of equipment for them to be fully functional. Here is where maintenance engineers and local representatives are looking for methods of bringing the costs down.\n\nConsidering how most cities cannot afford street cleaning equipment, they need ways to bring down the costs involved to avail of the service and this can be done if they go with portable equipment which can be used with old vehicles that are still functioning and the same goes for the rectangular water tank which they can use with dump trucks or flat beds. In line with this particular tank, you can use it with a high powered pump not to mention various spray and cleaning elements as well and what is amazing with its water spray delivery system is that it is self sufficient. Options have been included in this tank in order to allow the varying needs of cities to be complied with. Articles on water tanks like this can be viewed at septic tank.\n\nThere are specific spray nozzles like the duck bill or fan that can be used for all types of cleaning apart from street cleaning as these have been proven to work effectively for dusting landfills, removing the stink from sewers, and even removing the salt that tend to form on bridges. Firemen can easily store water in these portable tanks to serve as reserves for certain situations. It is possible to customize a tank in such a way that coatings are added to prevent damage by rust, corrosion, brine, and other chemicals but when it comes to the size, you will have a number of readily available options to choose from usually within a gallon range of 1000 to 4000.\n\nIt is important that all equipment are cleaned in this case so you need a high powered hose. Depending on the need, a tank can be gravity run or pressure run and the latter is normally used for high volume spraying. Here is where cab controls are used and this allows for easy system operations and any source of water can be used to fill it up.\n\nThe crews working with the ten brand new 2500 gallon tanks of the Missouri DOT were all tremendously pleased by the kind of performance that they got out of these machines. Aside from an increase in the level of pressure for the sprays, the only other concern of the people pertained to having front spray bars. When it comes to these tanks, they have fitted each one over a dump truck and they are used to deal with decks, bridges, curbs, and islands. Visit sewage treatment systems to learn more about water tanks.\n\nMost of the time, you can expect a city to have several trucks and the like on hand and if this is the case then a small cleaning budget will not be a big deal since you can simply purchase portable water tanks to line the trucks with. If you are dealing with multiple districts, it would be better if each one was provided with the same kind of equipment and this is something you need to consider. You can lessen more than just your equipment costs with this standard piece of equipment that is made to be more affordable than other options in the market.\n\nLandfills tend to make dust and lots of it and this was the problem for one waste management company in Bristol and their site manager thought of putting a tank onto a roll off truck that they had to use for this particular task. When it comes to the landfill, they had a lot of land area to cover and the tank was able to work on the entire area effectively so dust was no longer an issue. Non stop work is possible for the trucks during the hotter days of the year.\n\nThere were no problems getting the tank on and off the trucks when they needed to be used and in this case, the tank was all they needed. The people were able to use the truck for other types of jobs around their locale. Available pieces of equipment were made use of in this case and it benefited them greatly since they did not have to buy water tank trucks of any sort and this is how they managed to save money not only on maintenance and insurance but also on license fees and the like.\n\nContact Us\n\nSeptic Tank Pumping\n\nSeptic Tank Pumping on a regular schedule will improve your system's efficiency and"

Algae blooms tend to occur during the warm summer months. Although non-harmful, by-products of this algae bloom have created an unpleasant taste and odor in the stored water. It is important for residents to know that the algae does not present health or safety issues. Steps have been taken by both the City and CCWD to address the problem. CCWD has treated the source water to bring the algae under control, and the City has adjusted the treatment process to control taste and odor in customers' drinking water. Over a short period of time, this two-pronged approach is expected to resolve the issues.\n\nThese algal tastes and odors are purely aesthetic and pose no health risks. These tastes and odors are more noticable in hot water, rather than cold. To reduce unpleasant taste and odor for drinking, fill a pitcher and chill the water. This practice also conserves water by avoiding running water through the tap until it is cold."

Residents\n\nPosted:\nWednesday, October 31, 2012 1:12 PM EST\n\nONLEY, Va.- Health officials are warning Eastern Shore of Virginia residents about risks to their water supply and septic systems due to Hurricane Sandy.\n\nThe Virginia Department of Health said hurricanes, especially if accompanied by a tidal surge or flooding, can contaminate the water supply. Drinking contaminated water may cause illness. Individuals cannot assume that the water in the hurricane-affected area is safe to drink. If your well has been flooded, it needs to be tested and disinfected after the floodwaters recede.\n\nQuestions about testing should be directed to the Eastern Shore Health District at\n\n(757) 787-5880, (757) 824-6211 or (757) 442-6228.\n\nThe health department offers the following water safety tips:\n\nWATER FOR DRINKING AND COOKING\n\nSafe drinking water includes bottled, boiled or treated water. The following are guidelines to ensure your post-storm water supply is safe for use.\n\nDo not use contaminated water to wash dishes, brush your teeth, wash and prepare food or make ice.\n\nDrink only bottled, boiled or treated water until your supply is tested and deemed safe.\n\nBoiling water kills harmful bacteria and parasites. Bringing water to a rolling boil for one minute will kill infectious organisms (germs).\n\nWater may be treated with chlorine by mixing eight drops (1/8 teaspoon; about the size of a dime) of ordinary household bleach (free of fragrances and additives) per gallon of water. Mix the solution thoroughly, and let stand for about 30 minutes. However, this treatment will not kill parasitic organisms that may have entered a flooded well. Iodine tablets available at sporting goods stores may also be used.\n\nContainers for water should be rinsed with a bleach solution before reusing them (one tablespoon bleach per gallon of water). Use water storage tanks and other types of containers with caution. For example, fire truck storage tanks as well as previously used cans or bottles may be contaminated with microbes or chemicals. Do not rely on untested devices for decontaminating water.\n\nHOW DO I DISINFECT MY WELL?\n\nIt is important to disinfect both well and plumbing water with ordinary household bleach to ensure that all infectious agents are destroyed. If you have water treatment devices, remove all membranes, cartridges and filters and replace them after the chlorination process is completed. The amount of chlorine determines the length of time you allow the bleach to remain in your system.\n\nThe health department recommends the following steps to disinfect a contaminated well:\n\nIf the water is discolored before adding the bleach, run the water until it is clear for up to 10 minutes.\n\nTurn off and then drain your hot water heater— bleach is not effective in water above 105 degrees.\n\nRemove and replace charcoal filters after the disinfecting process is completed.\n\nTo avoid adding contamination to the well during disinfection, clean the work area around the top of the well. Then, remove grease and mineral deposits from accessible parts of the well head and flush the outside surfaces with one-half cup of bleach in five gallons of water. Turn off the pump. Remove the cap or the well plug on the rubber seal. There are many types of well caps and plugs. If you have questions, you should contact a licensed well driller. If you have a submersible pump, you may also want to contact a licensed well driller for advice on disinfection procedures.\n\nThe recommended amount of bleach varies depending on the amount of water in the well. However, a half gallon of ordinary unscented household bleach should be adequate for most home wells. Try to coat the sides of the casing as you pour. If you get bleach on the pump or wiring, flush it thoroughly with fresh water to prevent later corrosion.\n\nRe-cap or plug the well opening and wait 30 minutes.\n\nTurn on and, if needed, re-prime the pump. Open all of the faucets on the system one at a time. Allow the water to run until there is a noticeable smell of bleach. You may also want to flush the toilets. If you have outside faucets, you may want to direct the water away from sensitive plants. If you cannot detect a bleach odor, repeat the disinfecting process.\n\nTurn off all of the faucets and allow the bleach to remain in the system for at least four hours, although overnight is preferable"

Experience has shown us that the costs of not disinfecting drinking water are measured in much more than just dollars and cents.\n\nIn 2008, the city of Alamosa, Colorado suffered a waterborne disease outbreak that killed one person and sickened more than 1,300 of the town's 8,900 residents. Prior to the outbreak, Alamosa, armed with a state disinfection waiver, chose not chlorinate its water. A state report following an investigation determined that animal waste likely contaminated a compromised holding tank, leading to the outbreak. Routine drinking water chlorination would have prevented this outbreak. Since 2008, the Colorado health department has withdrawn more than half of the disinfection waivers statewide and today Alamosa is chlorinating its drinking water.\n\nEleven years ago in Walkerton, Ontario, seven people died and more than 2,300 became ill after E. coli and other bacteria infected the town's water supply. A report published by the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General concluded that, even after the well was contaminated, the Walkerton disaster could have been prevented if the required chlorine residuals had been maintained.\n\nThese two cities learned the hard way that waterborne diseases don't just go away – they must be eradicated by using disinfecting agents like chlorine. Handing out disinfection waivers is the equivalent of giving waterborne diseases a free pass into thousands of Wisconsin homes. A little chlorination goes a long way toward wiping out some of the nastiest bugs including E. coli and salmonella.\n\nDuring the 20th century, the dramatic increase in life span from 49 years to 76 years is widely credited to public health achievements, including the control of infectious diseases through the chlorination of drinking water. Safe drinking water has saved lives and lessened the burden of disease on millions of people, especially children in the country. We understand budgets are tight, but any savings that can be achieved by not disinfecting water could easily be offset by higher healthcare costs associated with treating Wisconsin residents with waterborne diseases and, even worse, any potential lives lost.\n\nMore than a billion people around the world have no access to safe drinking water through their public infrastructure. For them, it's not a voluntary gamble; they simply have no choice. There's no excuse for choosing to add more than 200,000 Wisconsin residents to their ranks.\n\nChris Wiant, M.P.H., Ph.D., is president and CEO of the Caring for Colorado Foundation.

The outer case of the straws is made of sturdy PES (Polyethersulfone) and the outer casing of the SureAquaBottle+ is polyethersulfone.\n\nWater is sucked up through the membrane passing into the inner core of the filter straw. Because water molecules are less than 0.2 microns water is able to easily pass through the membrane, however, because bacteria cells are larger than 0.5 microns they are unable to pass through the membrane and are trapped in the body of the filter, resulting in the removal of 99.9999% of bacteria as SureAquaStraw. Parasitic cysts are similarly trapped. A light shake of the filter after use, and a periodic clean leaves the straw clean and reusable for up to 500 liters (132 gallons) of water. The SureAquaStraw+ and SureAquaBottle+ use the filtration level of 0.01 microns therefore capturing bacteria to a level of 99.9999% AND viruses to a level of 99.99% and filtering a volume of upto 1,000 litres (264 gallons).\n\nFiltration occurs immediately as you sip the drinking water up, and the system and mouth piece is designed to be suitable for children as young as 3.\n\nSureAquaCorp products do not use chemicals, carbon or iodine for filtration and is therefore universally safe."

      "text": "Archive for the 'Water' Category\n\nIron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency in the world. Although many believe that anemia and iron deficiency are synonymous (as I did until a few weeks ago), iron deficiency is but one cause of anemia. Iron deficiency and anemia are both associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality and pose a real threat to women in the developing world.\n\nScientists have shown that iron-fortified water and cooking with cookware can both lead to improved iron status but few believed that natural sources of iron in groundwater could offer iron in the correct state, and in high enough concentrations, to have nutritional benefits. That is, until researchers from a large nutrition study in Bangladesh, JiVita, noted that women in their target area had much lower prevalence of anemia, iron deficiency, and iron deficiency anemia than much of the country. They started to ask themselves what makes this population different. They failed to attribute these discrepancies to demographics, differences in dietary intake of iron, and differences in the prevalence of other infections/diseases. Next they turned to the women's water source.\n\nThis population almost exclusively drinks from groundwater through tubewells. Despite the high variability of groundwater iron concentration in Bangladesh, they found a median total iron concentration of 16.7 mg/L - greater than other parts of the country with higher iron deficiency prevalence. The team estimates that women in the study ingest ~42 mg/day of total iron and expects a 6% increase in ferritin concentration for every additional 10mg/day.\n\nSo in short, it seems that groundwater iron can offer nutritional benefits to women. These nutritional benefits may in turn reduce mortality and morbidity associated with iron deficiency and anemia.\n\nSo why do I think this is interesting?\n\n1. This may be important to consider when treating water in areas with high concentrations of iron in their groundwater. In Bangladesh, what is the impact on nutrition of all the technologies that remove iron at the same time as arsenic?\n\n2. Will iron concentration in groundwater now play an important role in nutrition studies?\n\nIf you want to learn more about this, here is a great presentation by Rebecca Merrill who did a large part of this research for her doctoral dissertation.\n\nWith all the buzz about using cell phones in the field of development I decided to do a quick review of the different ways people have attempted to use cell phone technology to improve water sanitation and/or hygiene related access.\n\nWhen we talk about cell phones for water and sanitation we are talking about a broad range of uses and technologies. On the simple end we can use basic cell phones to transmit data through sms (text messages) or voice. We can get more fancy and utilize smart phones that run more serious operating systems and have powerful features like internet connectivity, gps, and cameras. Here are some examples of how people have started using cell phones to improve WASH services in Africa and Asia:\n\n1. Community Led Total Sanitation Tracking via SMS – In a World Bank WSP funded project in Indonesia, Health Officers and Sanitarians started using SMS to report on baseline conditions and progress on the path towards Open Defecation Free Communities. The officers text in the number of latrines contructed and other key information to a SMS server which processes the information and puts it into some sort of database. According to WSP they will plan to replicate this in 29 districts in the Province.\n\n2. Q&A – IRC International Water and Sanitation Center piloted an SMS based Question and Answer service to link communities and individual users with information related to their water supply. Questions submitted via SMS are (or were) answered by one of the members a Water and Sanitation Network. Questions ranging from the costs of spare hand pump parts to inquiries about low pressure in a piped system in Dar es Salaam have been answered by this service. This pilot project started back in 2005 and I have not received any response by the operators whether they are still in action.\n\n3. Water from Cell Phones – Grundfos, the Danish pump company, launched a new business model called LifeLink. LifeLink is a small water enterprise (see previous post on SWEs) that uses cell phones to transfer \"water credits\" from the user's bank account to that of the pump operator. Lifelink constructs a solar powered water kiosk in a community and when someone wants to buy water they add credits to their account thorugh a simple text message transaction. The kiosk displays the users balance after they swipes some sort of pass. After that they are free to have as much water as they can afford.\n\n4. Information Broadcasting – A number of programs throughout Africa and Asia have attempted to use SMS to broadcast information about everything from handwashing to water conservation.\n\nThese four cases are surely not comprehensive but give good examples of what people have used phones for in the WASH sector. I think we can break these uses down to the following:\n\nMonitoring and evaluation – Cell phones can be used to collect information and relay data back to some central location. This fucntionality can be extremly useful for tracking progress of work and maintaining transparency.\n\nInformation Services (to end user) – People can get information by calling or texting a specified number (in addition to the example above check out google sms in Uganda).\n\nGateway – The cell phone can act as a mechanism to enable a service (think about the Grundfos example above).\n\nTo date none of these projects have really gone to scale. As you could imagine there are some huge barriers to success including poor cell phone networks (including poor coverage and a lot of system downtime). I have a few ideas of my own on how to enhance WASH service delivery with cell phones and hope to post them in the coming weeks.\nAny other interesting cell phone based projects? Post them in the comments section.\n\nWhat do PepsiCo, GE, Rotary Club, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, ARD, and Tata Trust all have in common?\n\nAn interesting group of academics, private sector representatives, and people from Governmental/International Organizations came together last week to discuss the Small Water Enterprises (SWEs). What is an SWE? SWE refers to the management of water as a business, for or non-profit, by non-state entities. SWEs provide opportunities for supplying safe water to many underserved populations throughout the world but also raise ethical challenges.\n\nA small water entrepreneur at work\n\nFrom a company in Ghana packaging and distributing drinking water sachets to a community owned high-tech membrane treatment plant kiosks in India, SWEs come in many forms. Small water enterprises illustrate one solution where governments fail in providing safe water to communities. Where do governments fail? We find examples everywhere, from far away hard to reach rural areas to urban slums…Who will supply water to an \"illegal\" squatter settlement? Will a government fulfill their duty of providing water while in the same action recognizing and investing in an illegal settlement ?\n\nBy definition, SWEs do not require economic viability on their own. Some models rely on subsidies while others are run for profit. The users of SWEs often pay more for their water than those served by public utilities (think economies of scale). While paying more for their water, these users may also receive an inferior product. Recent reviews of existing SWEs (see links below) cite the lack of regular water quality monitoring as a serious barrier to successful growth.\n\nIn thinking about what would happen if SWEs take off (some would argue they already have), my continually reverts back to two realities:\n\nReality #1: SWEs gain traction throughout the world through financing schemes and recognition by governments. They end up serving the majority of people in previously underserved in communities but the most vulnerable are left out (or they are taken care of in some communities with stronger cohesion and social mechanisms).\n\nThe people with any political capital in places served by SWEs are probably able to afford the water. Is it likely that they would continue to lobby for water if their needs are met? Will politicians really see the needs in these communities or will it be masked by the coverage of SWEs? Will the government have any real incentives to invest in water utilities in these areas after most of the people are covered by an SWE?\n\nReality #2: SWEs gain traction throughout the world and communities are slowly lifted out of poverty. This leads to a wealthier community with few people who cannot afford the water and stronger communities that will take care of their poor. (a bit too simplistic and reductive but it will work for this blog)\n\nWhat concerns me the most is SWEs leaving the most vulnerable behind. Pro-poor policies within certain governments who choose to recognize the legitimacy of SWEs could help with this – but do you really think it could happen?\n\nSWEs can provide some amazing opportunities to get safe (not just \"improved\") water to people who need it, but in the long run will this come at a cost to these very same people? As SWE popularity increases with entrepreneurs, international organizations, and private companies , we will just have to wait and see (hopefully set up some useful studies too).\n\nI just went through some old photos of my time in Northern Uganda and found this great one.\n\na waste of 5000 USD in Otara, Northern Uganda\n\nIf you can't tell, the borehole in the foreground had just been drilled despite the fact that there is one <50 m away in the background (and neither one was dry or had water quality issues)…This is what happens when people stop using their brain and forget to talk to one another!\n\nThe terms myopia and myopic (or the common terms short sightedness or short sighted) have also been used metaphorically to refer to cognitive thinking and decision making that is narrow sighted or lacking in concern for wider interests or longer-term consequences.\" -Wikipedia (8/9/09)\n\nAfter drilling millions of tube wells to save people from the morbidity and mortality related to gastrointestinal illnesses, UN agencies and the Bangladesh Government realized that they had exposed millions of people to arsenic. This arsenic shifted the causes of illness and death related to water to other ailments like cancer (lung/bladder/skin). Most of you know how this happened but in case you don't…They simply didn't test the water for Arsenic!!!\n\nWith so much focus on dealing with the arsenic problem, are we forgetting about other potential toxicants in the water? This study seems to suggest we may be – at least in some parts of Bangladesh. The government of Bangledesh is focused on testing each and every well for As but does not look at many of these other elements mentioned in the article (it should be noted that Arsenic probably poses the biggest threat to the population but the possible effects of the others are by no means negligible). The authors note that in wells exceeding limits for As Uranium was not often found in quantities above the limit. However, the household treatment technology that many use to remove arsenic could actually increase the dissolved Uranium concentration (by making otherwise insoluble form soluble)….\n\nThis type of myopia happens all the time the water and sanitation sector. We want to focus only on provision of clean water but don't want to think about the multiple other pathways for enteric pathogen transmission. We focus on toilets but forget that there is no readily accessible water to wash hands….Hopefully it won't take another mass poisoning for us to wake up and look at the big picture.\n\nCheck out the article it is pretty interesting (oh and try to estimate the carbon footprint of the samples that made their way from India to Dubai to France to Vermont,USA)\n\nTom Clasen from LSHTM recently prepared a paper for the WHO entitled \"Scaling Up Household Water Treatment Among Low-Income Populations\". In this paper he reviews research and interventions (scale and effectiveness) related to Household Water Treatment (HWT). Boiling, Chlorine Disinfection (NaClO and NaDCC), SODIS, and filters are the main technology focuses of this insightful document.\n\nClasen comes up with some interesting stats on global use of HWT technologies.\n\nHWT Method\n\n2007 Use/Scale\n\nNaClO (SWS)*\n\n7.6 billion litres [60% of sales in 3 countries!!]\n\nNaDCC*\n\n2.86 billion litres [majority of sales in Kenya]\n\nCeramic Filters\n\n2.6 billion litres\n\nBiosand Filters\n\n1.3 billion litres\n\nSODIS\n\n2.1 million users (estimate litres as you wish..5 l/p/d? 10? 20? 40?)\n\n*does not include emergency use, (2007 statistics)\n\nAlthough these numbers seem huge (well, they are quite impressive), it is important to keep them in perspective. More than 350 million people rely on boiling (not including much of China and other Asian communities who boil) and the UN Joint Monitoring Program estimates that nearly 900 million people still rely on unimproved sources of drinking water. How are we going to bridge this HUGE gap?\n\nWe have all heard the buzz phrase \"SCALING UP, \" and many have asked ourselves what that means with respect to water and sanitation interventions. No it is not just a word UN and development agencies toss around for kicks (well may be it is…I once heard people talking about scaling up scale up activities!). Fortunately, Clasen talks a lot about what it means to scale up water interventions and suggests that \"coverage\" is an important metric but not the ultimate one. It may be necessary but NOT sufficient for true health benefits of household treatment to impact the target populations. What we are concerned with in \"Scaling Up\" is not only coverage but uptake. Uptake is really the challenge for all of us and we don't like to measure it too often (it is much harder than figuring out presumed coverage)…We can come up with great technologies but can we make them affordable, desirable, and usable? Think about all of the great ideas out there like the Lifestraw and Lifefilter (and other technologies reviewed in the Clasen Paper)….what is going wrong?\n\nIn light of the current situation Clasen highlights some key constraints the must be overcome to scale up any HWT intervention:\n\n…These [constaints] include 1) the persistent belief that diarrhoea is not a disease; 2) scepticism about the effectiveness of water quality interventions; 3) special challenges associated with uptake, including low aesthetic appeal for consumables, high up-front cost, the need to replace components for durables and the need to continuously use the product, even in the face of disease through other transmission pathways; 4) public health suspicion of the agenda of commercial products and strategies; 5) the orphan status of HWTS at the public sector level, with neither the water sector nor the health sector willing and able to assume ownership of the intervention; 6) minimal public sector participation in the promotion of HWTS; 7) a lack of focused international effort and commitment to advance HWTS; and 8)perceived policy conflict with efforts to promote piped-in water supplies.\n\nIn learning how to overcome some of these issues the paper looks at other interventions that have been successfully implemented at a large scale including Oral Rehydration Salts, Treated Bednets, and Guinea Worm Filters. How did people start to accept these technologies, recognize their inherent value, and begin to use them correctly? Can these experiences translate to the challenge of providing clean water? There are a lot of differences but Clasen suggests we can learn from their failures and successes.\n\nClasen goes on to argue that we will not meet the needs of the global poor with current technologies combined with current intervention strategies.\n\nThe gap between where we are and where we need to be is too great, given the urgency of the need. What is needed is a breakthrough. The largely public health orientation that has brought HWTS to its present point now needs to enlist the help of other experts: consumer researchers, product designers, educators, social entrepreneurs, micro-financiers, business strategists and policy advocates. The private sector is one obvious partner; it possesses not only much of this expertise but also the incentive and resources to develop the products, campaigns and delivery models for creating and meeting demand on a large scale. At the same time, market-driven, cost-recovery models are not likely to reach vast populations at the bottom of the economic pyramid where the disease burden associated with unsafe drinking-water is heaviest. As WHO ultimately concluded in the case of insecticide-treated mosquito nets, mass coverage among the most vulnerable populations may be impossible without free or heavily subsidized distribution. For this population segment, the public sector, UN organizations and NGOs that have special access to these population segments must engage donors to provide the necessary funding and then demonstrate their capacity to achieve both scale and uptake. Governments and international organizations can also help encourage responsible action by the private sector by implementing performance and safety standards and certification for HWTS products; reducing barriers to importation, production and distribution of proven products; and providing incentives for reaching marginalized populations.\n\nHe finishes with a number of suggestions on how we can accelerate the scale up of HWT approaches.\n\n1. Focus on the users.\n2. Develop and use partners.\n3. Improve and expand on boiling.\n4. Continue to pursue non-commercial strategies.\n5. Continue to pursue market-driven strategies.\n6. Leverage existing local strengths.\n7. Initiate and use relevant, practical research.\n8. Overcome public policy barriers to advancing HWTS. The Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) of WHO and the United Nations Children's Fund should clarify the contribution that safe and effective HWTS can make towards advancing health, even though, for policy and methodological reasons, it should not count towards the MDG water target. National governments should embrace the intervention while they work to extend piped-in supplies of treated water.\n9. Engage national and regional governments.\n10. Engage international leadership to support HWTS.\n\nHopefully some of this paper will be read by enough people in positions of power to change course….There are so many opportunities and many examples in other sectors to learn from."

These figures are not acceptable and Europe is not at rest. Did you know that European standardization plays an important role in helping setting up environmental quality standards for water?\n\nWater resources are under pressure and Europe is also under threat due to, among others, waste waters from industrial installations, and diffuse sources such as agriculture (e.g. pesticides running off into water from agricultural land). To help protecting European public health and Europe's ecosystems, CEN, the European Committee for Standardization, was mandated by the European Commission (Mandate M/424) for the development or improvement of European Standards in support of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). The Directive tackles a better control and management of the waters, i.e. groundwater and surface waters. How? By reducing dangerous chemicals in our waters and ensure water sustainable use.\n\nCEN has been asked to develop European Standards to help supporting the monitoring requirements of the WFD for the quality of water. Indeed, the European Union Member States must achieve WFD objectives by the end of 2015. European Standards will contribute to ensure that monitoring programmes for the implementation of these objectives are measuring the chemical and ecological status of Community wasters in a comparable way.\n\nCEN Technical Committee 230 (CEN/TC 230) on water analysis is the main responsible TC working on European Standards to support the Water Framework Directive with the elaboration of standard test methods for physical, chemical, biochemical, biological, microbiological examination of water quality. Included are as well methods for sampling, quality assurance, and classification aspects. Standards, European and international, related to water quality are more than a hundred. You can read more on them on our website: water analysis- published standards.\n\nTwo other Technical Committees are working on Standards related to water:\n\n~ CEN/TC 164 – Water Supply This TC is establishing standards for the installation and performance requirements of systems, constructions of components used for the water supply from the production facility, including the treatment of the water, to the taps attached or unattached to a sanitary appliance with the view of maintaining the quality of water.\n\n~ CEN/TC 165 – Waste water engineering This TC is developing functional standards, standards for performance and installation in the field of wastewater engineering for systems and components.Standards for design, calculation, construction, commissioning, operation and maintenance in the field of wastewater engineering, from the point of origin (with the exception of the product standards for sanitary appliances*) up to the point of disposal, including treatment plants and use of treated wastewater for purposes other than agricultural irrigation."

      "text": "Body\n\nAs we have discussed in this post, bottled water is far from the most environmentally-conscious hydration solution. Greener alternatives to that include buying a filter or carrying reusable water bottles with you. But not everyone needs to go out of their way like that, some of us are just lucky because we live in cities where tap water is clean and drinkable. So are you one of the lucky bunch? Let's take a look and see.\n\nA couple of years ago Forbes.com tested the tap water from cities across the United States and analyzed the results.\n\nForbes studied data compiled from the Consumer Confidence Reports (CCR), which are provided annually by the EPA and community water systems. The CCR looked at each city's water turbidity—commonly known as \"cloudiness\" –-as well as levels of bacteria, lead, and halo-acetic acids, which are byproducts of the water purification process. Scientists have also found other contaminants, such as pesticides, germs, arsenic, and even rocket fuel in water samples.\n\nJustifiably, the public often questions the healthful quality of tap water. According the Environmental Working Group (EWG), contaminated tap water can cause illness, especially among pregnant women, the elderly, and young children. Though tap water purity levels improved since being publicized, according to studies similar to the one conducted by Forbes, some cities still violated Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards with very high levels of contaminants.\n\nDespite the odds, high EPA standards and green living initiatives inspire many cities to ditch the bottle and reap the benefits of their local water supply. Seven of the top cities with the cleanest tap water include:\n\nSan Jose, California is leading the way amongst green cities, by announcing plans to recycle or reuse 100 % of its wastewater within the next 15 years.\n\nMiami, Florida ranks #4 on Forbes' top cities, and also scored in the top 25 for low levels of turbidity, bacteria, lead, and halo-acetic acids.\n\nMidwesterners who call St. Louis, Missouri home are proud of the clarity, aroma, and taste of its local tap water supply. The US Conference of Mayors agrees, and after a blind taste test in 2009, announced that St. Louis had the best tap water. Furthermore, St. Louis water only had traces of the pollutants decried by the EPA.\n\nAustin, Texas scored consistently in the top ten with low turbidity, halo-acetic acid, and lead levels, and thus winning the silver medal in Forbes' survey.\n\nIn Kansas City, Missouri, even the drinking fountains ranked high in clean tap water studies\n\nBut it's Des Moines, Iowa that takes the gold according to Forbes and also ranks high in other studies. Des Moines had the second lowest level of bacteria amongst cities studied, along with a consistent top fifteen ranking due to low levels of lead, turbidity, and halo-acetic acid.

      "text": "Where the Best Mineral/Spring Water Comes From\n\nWhen you reach for a bottle of water, you could be confronted with dozens, if not hundreds, of choices in regards to the type of water and its origin. Three of the most common types of bottled water are mineral, Artesian, and spring. There are various locations throughout the world known for their waters of these three types. Here are some of the most notable.\n\nMineral Water\n\nMineral water refers to a drink that comes from a natural spring or well and contains a tiny part dissolved solids. Although some sceptics might refer to these dissolved solids as impurities, others claim they provide definite health benefits. In most countries, adding minerals to the water that don't occur naturally prevents the bottle from being labelled as 'mineral water'.\n\nWhile there are mineral springs in nearly every country in the world, Italy is notable for its crystal clear springs. The Piedmont region, in particular, is renowned for its low mineral content and exceptional taste. The reason for such great water? The climate in Piedmont creates annual heavy snowfall while the geographic aspects of the region include volcanic rock, which is thought to help the clarity of taste of the water that percolates through it. France also has two of the most globally popular brands, Perrier and Evian.\n\nArtesian Water\n\nTo be considered artesian, water must come from a well in an aquifer. An aquifer consists of a rock formation which contains and transmits water and lies below the surface of the geographic area. Pressure forces the water up into a well above the level of the aquifer.\n\nBecause artesian wells can be found anywhere, there are no associated minerals or health benefits. There are also a plethora of locations around the world that produce delicious, clear drinking water from Hawaii all the way to Australia (yes, there are artesian wells even in the desert!). One popular worldwide brand of bottled artesian water is Fiji, from the Fiji Islands.\n\nSpring Water\n\nNatural springs, which allow ground water to flow from below the earth to its surface, produce spring water. As it moves upward, minerals dissolve in it and perhaps even produce natural bubbles as the result of the presence of carbon dioxide. If you think there is little difference between mineral water and spring water, you are correct. The terms and labels are often deceiving because they are used interchangeably.\n\nSome of the most notable worldwide locations for clear springs that produce delicious water are Delphi, Greece; Aachtopf, Germany; Fontaine de Vaucluse, France; Shandong, China; Jerusalem, New Zealand and areas throughout the United States.\n\nLuckily, whether or not you believe the health claims for the water that comes naturally from various regions, you have lots of choice when it comes to choosing drinking water"

      "text": "Bottled Water Part II: Breaking the habit\n\nBottled water is fast becoming a habit, a habit that takes a huge environmental toll as was discussed in Part I of the blog.\n\nBottled water, no doubt, is convenient. At times, it even makes a lifestyle statement. And it is becoming increasingly common to think that it's the only alternative, as one may have lost faith in local public utilities to deliver uncontaminated water, regardless of whether one lives in the developed or developing world.\n\n- Invest in a good filter. If you live in the developed world, chances are that your bottled water is no safer than your tap water, as scientific studies have shown time and again. This doesn't mean that tap water is necessarily safe by itself. Regardless of where you live, the presence of chlorine and chlorine by-products, pesticides, synthetic fertilisers and chemicals, dirt and bacterial contamination in pipes and overhead tanks are genuine concerns. It makes sense to research into a good quality water filter, such as one with activated carbon, with natural magnetic stones to energise the water.\n\n- Carry your own bottle of water, preferably a stainless steel one with filtered water from home.\n\n- If you're dying of thirst and can't get hold of any potable water, look for alternatives such as fresh juice or fruit or pick up bottled water that has been manufactured as close as possible to where you live. Please recycle your used bottles. My friend, Vinisha suggested a great website for recycling ideas. It's \n\n-Refuse free bottled water that is dispensed liberally at events, parties and functions and avoid providing them when you are organising an event. Hire or install a water dispenser instead.\n\n- Encourage your company not to distribute bottled waters at seminars and conferences and place water dispensers instead\n\nYour saying NO to bottled water can make a huge difference in reducing a host of environmental ills, conserving oil and reducing carbon emissions. More importantly, you will help in conserving water that belongs to communities, and in ensuring water quality that belongs to future generations."

      "text": "Even the scientists are a bit uncertain as how to classify a substance as a heavy metal. By some definitions, there are about 50 heavy metals, or which about 20 can cause toxic reactions in the body. Heavy metals can be loosely defined as metals that are about 5 times heavier than an equal volume of water. Not all heavy metals are intrinsically bad; we actually need some of them for health reasons such as zinc, iron, copper, and manganese. However, too many of these 'good' heavy metals can also cause harm. However, there are some heavy metals that have no redeeming qualities such as mercury, lead, arsenic, and cadmium. Heavy metals have been linked to some very serious health effects:\n\nLead poisoning is a very serious condition, and lead can cause damage to nearly every part of the body. Damage can be done to the kidneys, brain, heart, gastrointestinal system, and reproductive system. In large enough doses, lead poisoning can cause death.\n\nMercury is another dangerous metal that can find its way into the water supply. Mercury causes neurological problems which can cause irreversible damage to the brain.\n\nHeavy metals can enter a water supply through a number of sources. Old lead piping in private homes or even antiquated municipal water systems can leach lead into the water. Lead and the other heavy metals can also occur because of run off from industrial operations and mining. As these metals are naturally occurring substances, they can enter water simply as rock formations that contain them weather and release them.\n\nAssuring Safe Water for Your Family\n\nThe best way to make sure that heavy metals are not being consumed by your family through drinking or cooking water is to use a filter that will remove these pollutants. Not every water filter is designed to do this, and most pitcher filters will not provide the cleansing ability needed to make the water safe although Seychelle pitcher filters are great for removing heavy metals and a wide range of contaminants. There are several filter options, however, that will remove most, if not all of heavy metals from your water supply:\n\nReverse osmosis filters do a very good job of removing heavy metals from the water. Whole house filters will assure that not only will drinking water be pure, but that water used for bathing will also be uncontaminated.\n\nFilters with KDF and carbon are also good at removing most heavy metals from water. Lead, copper, and mercury will be trapped by the carbon.\n\nDistillation filters are available as either whole house or countertop units and will remove literally every trace of heavy metals from the water.\n\nConsidering the harm that heavy metals can do to you and your family, especially to babies and young children, using an appropriate water filtering system is only sensible. Whether you live in an urban, industrial area or in a rural setting, there is always the possibility of water contamination by heavy metals – filtering your water can spare you health problems now and in the future.\n\nThe great majority of Americans, about 80%, now live in cities or in the areas immediately surrounding cities. These people must all drink water supplied by their local municipality, and ensuring a safe water supply is necessary to preserve the health of several hundred million people. Prior to 1974, there were basically no standards applied to water quality, but the establishment of the Safe Water Drinking Act was a step in the right direction to keep public drinking water safe. The law was updated later to include wells, rivers, reservoirs, and all other sources of municipal drinking water.\n\nAny water supply is dependent on what enters the water system, and contaminants can enter a city water supply hundreds of miles from where the water will be used. There are a number of pollutants that can pose health problems:\n\nOverflow of sewage from treatment plants or septic systems, especially in times of flooding.\n\nRadon and arsenic are natural pollutants that are found in different regions of the country.\n\nAgricultural areas can produce large amounts of pollution from fertilizers, pesticides, and animal waste.\n\nManufacturing plants can release chemicals into the system.\n\nTesting of municipal water supplies is essential to guaranteeing the quality and safety of city water, but there are times when testing is either inadequate or fails completely, particularly when the filters in the system are not able to detect some pathogens. Cryptosporidium, for example, has caused outbreaks over the past 20 years or so, with the number of people being sickened growing over this time span. Testing is done at varying intervals, depending in part on state and local regulations.\n\nHowever, although most bacterial and other contamination is dealt with adequately by the great majority of municipal water systems, there are still two inescapable substances that many people would be happy to avoid: chlorine and fluoride.\n\nChlorine is put into water to prevent bacterial illnesses. Most municipal water is drawn from reservoirs, lakes, or rivers and cannot be considered to be safe to drink. Chlorine eliminates not only most viruses, but also such dangerous bacteria as those that cause typhoid fever, cholera, and dysentery. The number of incidents from these pathogens has fallen to nearly nothing since chlorination was introduced. However, since chlorine can also have some negative health effects, many people will use filtration systems in their homes to remove the chlorine from the water.\n\nFluoride was once touted as a wonderful way to prevent dental decay. However, research has shown that it actually makes little difference in preventing cavities, and can actually cause damage to the teeth. There also seems to be a correlation between lower IQ and fluoridated water. While many municipalities have suspended use of fluoride, it is also possible to filter it from your drinking water, too.\n\nToday, water filters are available, either as countertop or undersink models or as whole house systems that can remove undesirable elements from municipal water. Advances in filtering technology will allow the removal not only of VOCs, heavy metals, and cysts (which are usually able to slip through treatment plants), but also of the chlorine and fluoride that is present in municipal water.\n\nAlthough it is not really the new kid on the block, public awareness of giardia, and giardiasis, has become more pronounced in recent years. Giardia is a protozoan, which is actually a very tiny animal, and it is quite happy to take up residence in your intestines. Giardia moves by means of flagella and will breed in the small intestine, causing symptoms such as fever, diarrhea, repulsive burps, cramps, and dehydration.\n\nContaminated water is the easiest way to acquire a giardia infection, and while it is much more common in less developed nations, the United States has its share of giardiasis, too. For years, beavers were blamed for spreading giardia as the percentage of infected beavers was high. However, further research has now shown that beavers and other animals pick up giardiasis from humans. Wild animals inhabiting areas downstream of camp grounds are heavily infected with giardia.\n\nGiardia has two forms, the active, swimming form, which is called a trophozoite and a tough cyst. Both forms are passed in the stool, but usually only the cyst survives to cause trouble with another living organism. If a cyst is swallowed in water, it will migrate to the small intestine and 'hatch' into a trophozoite. Trophozoites reproduce by the simple process of splitting in half. Trophozoites absorb food from the contents of the intestine, and eventually move down into the large intestine where most of them will become cysts, ready to be passed on to another victim.\n\nTreating and Preventing Giardiasis\n\nNot everyone who swallows a giardia cyst will actually become ill, and these people can become carriers without even knowing it. Those who do become ill will usually get over the infection in a week or two, although antibiotic treatment can also be used to help the body return to health more quickly. Anyone who is ill to the point of dehydration should see a physician immediately.\n\nBoth camping expeditions in the wilderness and travel overseas can heighten your chances of becoming ill with giardiasis. However, securing a safe water supply is easy as long as you treat your water before drinking it. Water purification tablets that are iodine based have been found to be effective for killing giardia cysts as long as the cysts are exposed to the iodine for half an hour. Chlorine tablets are not considered to be reliable at eliminating giardia and should not be used for this purpose.\n\nOther than boiling your water, the best option available for removing cysts is to use a water filter designed to remove pathogens. Whether you choose a camp filter that will be hung up to use gravity, or one that actively pumps water, always be sure that you check the specifications to be certain that giardia cysts will be filtered out. Bottle filters and countertop gravity filters are also good choices when camping or traveling and by simply putting your drinking water, from whatever source, through the filter you will be assured that what you drink will not make you ill."

That's why it hits hard when we hear stories like the one about Wild Waterworks needing a new water supply because the water it now gets from Lake Ontario is contaminated with fecal matter.

In fact, the testing on Red Hill Creek showed an improvement over 2002.\n\nBut do we have an adequate level of civic and institutional concern about water quality? When residents of subdivisions along the creek received the contamination report from Environment Hamilton, they didn't wax hyperbolic. They expressed justifiable concern. This has been an issue for a decade. And while progress has been made, the problem persists. City staff are working on a report identifying the hookups and how to address the matter. But it's not due for nearly a year.

We are working with a local Rotary club. We have not pursued a Matching Grant in the past. With the participation of other local clubs a Matching Grant becomes a possibility in the upcoming year.\n\nThe Gambia is a small State in West Africa. The population of the Gambia is estimated to be 1.6 million, and the density per square kilometer is 128, one of the highest in Africa. Three quarters of the population is rural. Women constitute 51 per cent of the population. Currently, the crude birth rate is 46.2 per thousand though dropping is still high. Life expectancy at birth is low at 55 years overall, and 54 years and 57 years for males and females respectively.\n\nThe Gambia is among the poorest countries in the World, ranked 155th out of 177, in UNDP's Human Development Index for 2004. As is the case in many developing countries, water is a precious and critical resource for the Gambian people. Without access to adequate wells, women spend an inordinate time searching for and transporting water in order to feed families and grow crops.\n\nGardens for the Gambia focuses on digging wells at schools. The wells provide three critical things for Gambian school children: 1) Knowledge of agriculture; 2) A meal – sometimes their only meal of the day - for the poorest children; and 3) profits from surplus produce sold at market enable the school to buy supplies and equipment. Each well serves 100 to 300 people.\n\nMany individuals wonder why such a long period of time is required in The Gambia and why matters cannot be attended to more efficiently or with much less time. Unfortunately, much of West Africa, including The Gambia, is part of the developing world. As a result, there is a lack of infrastructure and communication is often difficult.

But not the expensive bottled water. From the faucet – tap water. Water is healthy because it has no extra calories, no artificial colorings, and no preservatives or additives. And it takes a weight off of your wallet – the savings for an average American family of 4 that quits soft drinks are over $500 a year.\n\nThe Safe Drinking Water Act was passed in 1974 and required monitoring of 20 dangerous chemicals.\n\nThe list of toxins grew to 91 by the late 1990′s.\n\nIt is still miserably short when one considers the SIXTY THOUSAND chemicals that are used in this country, hundreds of which are known carcinogens and many of which have found their way into our water systems.\n\nTens of millions of people could be affected by multiple contaminants in their drinking water.\n\nThe EPA says that very long studies are needed to verify the effects, but even then it's hard to determine causality because pollution is also in the air we breath, food we eat, our clothes, toys, homes, and pretty much everywhere.\n\nThe Times article is part of a series called Toxic Waters, a frightening and interesting read.\n\nWhat you need to know:\n\nSo we must drink bottled water, right?\n\nNot so fast.\n\nWhere do you think all the bottled water comes from? Many bottlers take their water from the same sources as municipal tap. True, they filter it, but do you think they do more testing for toxins than the minimum they should by law? Not!\n\nLarge public water supplies are tested for contaminants up to several times a day. But the FDA requires bottlers to test their water just once a month or year.\n\nAnd bottled water is stored in plastics that leach out PET, or polyethylene terephthalate, another carcinogen. Not to mention the huge environmental impact of billions of plastic bottles polluting our planet.\n\nWhat to do at the supermarket:\n\nIf you're debating between tap and bottled water, you're already in a good place, not drinking soft drinks. Many people choose bottled water because they have gotten used to the taste. Before you commit yourself one way or the other, check out your local water supply safety reports. You can also opt for home purifying and filtering systems.\n\nMy family avoids ingested fluoride. Fluoride is meant to prevent cavities when used directly on the teeth, but it's toxic to the human body. Also in tap water are all the pharmaceuticals people flush down the toilet or put in a landfill that gets leeched into the ground water and make it to the water supply. Add in chlorine and all the other toxins, yuck. Ideally, I want to get a under the sink reverse osmosis system in addition to a regular filter system but it's cost prohibitive so for now I'm \"stuck\" drinking bottled water that's been treated with reverse osmosis. I recycle the bottles and use #1 plastic bottles (#3, 6 and 7 are the worst).\n\nBill\n\nIsn't it also true that when water is bottled in the same state it's sold in it doesn't have to be tested?\n\n XO Water\n\nWhether by a home filtration system or with a cooler that filters, it's becoming increasingly important to filter our water for all of the bad contaminants out there. An XO bottleless cooler offers two filtration types, Reverse Osmosis and Micron Filtration. YOU get to decide whether to leave minerals in your water or not.\n\nThe great part about a bottleless cooler is the flat fee, w/o contracts or leases. You own it, and replace the (affordable!) filters every 6 months. Under the sink filtration systems are very expensive and require some assistance to install. Why not explore a bottleless water cooler as an alternative?\n\n bottlelesswater\n\nOne of the best alternatives to bottled water that I found was the bottle-less water cooler. We switched to one in our office already. To learn more about what bottle-less water coolers are, visit\n\nBottle water tends these days to come in bottles made of BPA (bisphenol-A), where your drinking water has sits with plenty of time to leach plasticizers out of its container.\nThe more you learn about modern food and water, the more you realize how unavoidably fooked the food supply has been made.

It is a measure of concentration, not absolute amounts. For example, one inch in sixteen miles is one ppm. [Note: 1 mg/L = 1 ppm\n\none part in a million. Abbreviated ppm and commonly used to express defect levels or concentrations. Passivation - a final layer or layers put on semiconductors to protect them against contaminants and mechanical damage.\n\n(ppm) Concentration expressed as parts of solute per million parts of solution. Usually refers to parts per million by mass. For example, a 10 ppm NaCl solution can be written as: 10 mg NaCl/kg solution, 10 µg NaCl/g solution, 10 ng NaCl/mg solution. In very dilute aqueous solutions, ppm is approximately equal to mg solute per liter of solution."

It will even kill Crypto if given enough time.\n\nIodine does not improve taste or clarity (if anything it worsens it), and will not kill Crypto. Once opened, a bottle of iodine pills must be discarded after a year, AM lasts much longer especially if kept in a cool place (I keep mine refrigerated between trips).\"\n\n\"Indiana John - cryptosporidium: A protozoan associated with the disease cryptosporidiosis in humans.

Cryptosporidiosis may cause acute diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever that last 1-2 weeks in healthy adults, but may be chronic or fatal in immuno-compromised people.\"\n\nSo yes, I bought a MIOX... mostly out of curiosity than anything else. I am an avid Aquamira fan and think that Aquamira is as close to perfect as you can get for an ultralight water treatment.\n\nAnyhow... I'll put on my asbestos underwear and post on.\n\nI read all the beotching posts about how the thing stinks. I'll make my own decisions here but I noticed some common threads both on TT and, ESPECIALLY, off of TT.\n\n1. Why do people insist on writing an evaluation of gear that they don't own?\n\n2. Why do people insist on turning a review of a piece of gear like the MIOX into a discussion on the merits of pumping versus using chemical treatments? Don't compare apples to oranges... compare apples to apples. I think it's fair for people to say \"I prefer X to Y\" but why slam a piece of gear because of a subjective preference?\n\n3. The MIOX instructions tell you to test the water after you add the oxidants and again 10 minutes later. People were posting all sorts of crazy things. Example: One person was complaining that the water tested \"safe\" 30 minutes after the test but 2 and 4 hours later got \"less and less safe\" meaning that over time the oxidant level decreased. Well, dude, this is to be expected. The oxidants disperse. So you test once after 10 minutes and then you are done... period. These people complained that they had to keep adding oxidant to \"keep\" the water safe. Ridiculous.\n\n4. People saying batteries were expensive and hard to find. Well I found SureFire batteries (recommended by MSR) both in the package with the device and also on the web exactly where MSR said I should find them. People then complained about the price ($10 for two batteries in one post). My cost? $21 for 12 batteries (shipping included) or $3.50 for a battery change. These are lithium batteries with a huge shelf life so why not stock up?\n\n5. People complaining that the unit uses salt too quickly. The MSR instructions are confusing on this point and I think are conflicting. One page says to fill the salt chamber (which I think is the correct approach). Another says to fill the chamber which is about 1/4 tsp of salt. The chamber holds a lot more than 1/4 tsp of salt. When I fill the chamber the salt does not get consumed quickly and I can easily see one fill providing 20 treatments as MSR states. I have experimented and done about 10 and have plenty of salt left over.\n\n6. People complaining about taste. I have had to drink water in the backcountry that I would not step in with my boot. I did not find the water treatment to be free of taste and odor 30 minutes after I mixed it, unlike Aquamira which I can't taste at all. Of course complaints like this are legitimate but they are also highly subjective (a matter of personal preference). I was raised on well water and I still find city water repulsive. My kids have been raised on city water and find well water repulsive. Go figure.\n\n7. People that took the unit \"out of the box\" into the weeds and tried to make it work in the field with no practice. The MSR MIOX pen clearly requires a bit of practice to use since it's not just a \"dump and wait\" solution like Aquamira... there is a PROCESS associated with it's use that is more complex than Aquamira but less complex than, say, pitching a tent or tying ones shoes.\n\n8. Complaints that the thing is \"expensive to run\" with test strips that must be purchased and batteries. Well I already addressed the battery cost although I still can't comment on how long a set of batteries will last in the field. That said, there is the matter of the test strips. Each batch of water requires that two test strips be consumed. I haven't figured out why one isn't sufficient. MSR says to test once after you mix the oxidants with the water and then again 10 minutes later. I don't see why one can't just test 10 minutes after you add the oxidants. I'll probably ask MSR about this but I expect I'll get a legal answer and not a technical one. Anyway, I read somewhere that the test strips they sell are basically the same as the test strips used to test pool water. I have to look into this. My belief at this point is that indeed Aquamira will be less expensive at $11 for enough to treat huge volumes of water.\n\n9. People seem unable to deal with the concept or \"waiting\". I saw numerous posts on different web sites about how they didn't like having to wait to drink the water with the MSR MIOX pen and hence preferred to use Aquamira or PolarPure or a Filter. Well... last I checked you needed to wait to drink water made safe with Aquamira and PolarPure as well. The idea people kept posting that a filter was \"no wait\" \"instant\" water seems silly to me since you have to spend time pumping the water in the first place plus time to fiddle with the pump.\n\n10. I got a kick out of the people that posted that the Military used it and they don't have a problem with the pen. The military uses a lot of things that I don't use as a backpacker (mortars, claymore mines, etc)... well perhaps some here do use these things but I don't... anyhow just because the military approves and uses something doesn't mean that it will be fit for my purposes as a hiker. It's a good start but won't wash away concerns I may have about how I will want to use the product.\n\n11. Everyone keeps beotching about \"this kills this but doesn't kill that\". This all seems silly to me. I have used everything from boiling to iodine to chlorine dioxide to filters of all kinds and have never gotten sick period. I think if you combine the actual odds of getting sick (if you use common sense) with the efficacy of all of these products I am not really concerned about this. Still there were tons of creepy posts on this topic. \"4 hours to kill crypto\" was a real mind boggler to me. Aquamira take the same amount of time. Iodine doesn't kill it at all. Do people even realize that PolarPure is iodine, I wonder? It says so pretty clearly on the label of the bottle I have in my closet.\n\nOK, I'll stop at 11. I'll be updating this thread as I tinker with this expensive science project in the months to come. I'll probably try to work out some sort of OBJECTIVE summary of the MSR MIOX compared to other treatment methods and an honest review from field testing in different conditions.\n\nI will say, however, that I think a lot of the reviews/posts all over the web (most ont from TT but some of them) are really amazing to me.\n\n\"Aquamira produces chlorine dioxide. It is a two-part solution that is shelf stable meaning that it will last about 5 years unmixed. Once you mix the two parts you have to wait about 5 minutes for the two solutions to produce chlorine dioxide. Then you dump it in your water and wait.\n\nIodine varies somewhat. PolarPure, my favorite iodine based treatment, is basically an \"add to water and wait\" approach (no 5 minute wait time). Iodine tables are pretty much the same but you have to wait for the tablet to dissolve. Iodine tables are for sure NOT shelf stable (read the label). PolarPure is amazing stuff and I think is as close to a perfect iodine treatment as one can buy since it's pretty much shelf stable. It uses iodine crystals under water to produce a solution of saturated water/iodine you add to water. Since the crystals are never exposed to air (they are submerged under water) they don't go bad. Cool, cool, cool. :)\n\nI can taste iodine (but don't mind the taste). You can remove the taste of iodine with tablets that are basically just vitamin-C... ascorbic acid. I can still taste it after this but again it doesn't bother me.\n\nI can't taste Aquamira in water. I am told that this is because of the way oxidants like chlorine dioxide work... releasing oxygen that does the actual killing of the nasties.\n\nI repackage Aquamira into two eye-drop dropper bottles. You need a fraction of an ounce for most backpacking trips.\n\nYou can get chlorine dioxide tablets as well (portable aqua and Katadyn make these) that basically work the same as Aquamira and are even lighter, but they are expensive if you look at cost/liter. I carry a few of these in my first aid kit as an emergency backup since the weight penalty is basically zero. last edited: 10/25/06 9:59:21 AM\"\n\n\"XL, the chlorine dioxide in Aquamira removes most bad tastes and colors, unlike iodine. It also kills Crypto as Jimmy san mentioned, which iodine does not. Think of that sulphur smell you get with some stagnant water, and the coloring you get from the tannin when leaves have been sitting in a pool of water (basically, tea). Aquamira will remove that smell and color, then the oxidant dissipates so you don't taste it. MIOX is the same. According to the company MIOX produces the same oxidant as AM, plus one more. What that other one is, is on this thread or another one here on TT that discusses MIOX. Iodine won't change clarity or taste. Bleach can improve clarity but always leaves behind its own taste.\n\nChlorine dioxide is used by many city water treatment systems, not only because of the benefits above but also because it doesn't leave behind carcinogens like bleach-based system do. I found that info on the EPA web site when I was researching chlorine dioxide.\"\n\n\"There were complaints posted on various forums that tannin levels and mineral levels in the water effected the dose levels required from the MSR MIOX. I intend to test this out in the field. It makes sense to me, however. Most chemical treatments require either a larger dose or a longer contact time with water that is not clear or is murky. That said, if the MIOX mixture dissipates in 4 hours then it might be that a stronger up-front dose is required since the longest it will last is 4 hours. That might be the reason why MSR makes you retest after 10 minutes... the oxidants might get consumed by water rich in tannins and mineral content and leave less behind to kill of the nasties in the water. Hence test at 10 minutes and add more oxidant if the level is insufficient. This is pure speculation on my part, however, but the instructions say little about initial water quality or the reason for the second test being done after 10 minutes. It would be nice if they had a paragraph or two (even on their web site FAQ) that explained this type of thing. last edited: 10/25/06 11:01:36 AM\"\n\n\"Oh... and I'll add that I think I understand the reason for the testing with the strips. It is easy to tell if Aquamira is activated. It stink big time and has a yellow color. I am betting that there is enough chlorine dioxide in a batch that is yellow to treat most any kind of water given enough contact time. With the MSR MIOX the oxidant mixture is clear although it for sure has a strong odor. Also, I am betting the amount of active ingredient produced is just enough for most typical conditions and not \"overkill\". Anyway, since the mixture is clear and the \"smell test\" is imprecise the testing is probably required to get consistent results."

      "text": "Help keep our community water resources safe. Stop chloramine.\n\nIn March of 2014, the Rivanna Water and Sewer Authority plans to switch from chlorine to CHLORAMINE as a disinfectant in our water supply. Chloramine is a small molecule formed by the combination of chlorine and ammonia. The water authority says it is being compelled by tougher EPA regulations, and that the chloramine switch would be the most economical. It doesn't dissipate into the air like chlorine and stays in the distribution system longer. The RWSA also claims that chloramine forms fewer regulated disinfection by products than chlorine. However, there is much to be concerned about with chloramine, as it has negative health and environmental consequences.\n\nWater is our most precious resource and the linchpin for our health, food production and economic well-being. Without a clean, safe source of water, all of our efforts for relocalizing our food and economy – and making a resilient future for ourselves – are seriously undermined or rendered moot.\n\nBelow are a few of the problems encountered in water systems with chloramine. To help stop chloramine, read \"What Can You Do?\" at the bottom of this page.\n\n-Filtration- Chlorine is relatively easy to remove from your tap water. Chlorine dissipates or out gases from water rather quickly on its own. It can also be removed by common household water filters, like the Pur faucet attachments and Brita pitchers. However, chloramine is very difficult to get out of the water. Regular water filters will not remove it. Neither will more complex water distillation or reverse osmosis systems or even boiling the water. The only reasonable way to remove chloramine is by passing the water over an activated charcoal bed system, and it takes a long time to effectively expose all of the chloramine-contaminated water over a large charcoal bed. These systems can cost the water customer thousands of dollars. This is an expensive burden to place on the water customer.\n\n-Short Term Health Effects- Hundreds of people across the country are reporting respiratory, dermal and digestive ailments when drinking or showering in chloraminated water. Chloraminated water used to make baby formula can cause Blue Baby Syndrome. (monochloramine speciates into di and tri chloramine. Tri chloramine is a known respiratory irritant known to cause 'swimmers asthma' in lifeguards and routine swimmers. The same effect is being seen when chloraminated water is vaporized in showers.\n\n-Long Term Health Effects- While both chlorine and chloramines are capable of forming disinfection by-products, chloramines also form additional disinfection by products that are up to 100,000 times more toxic. Some of these highly toxic or carcinogenic byproducts include hydrazine (component of rocket fuel), iodoacetic acids and nitrosamines. Several recent studies demonstrated a connection between the transformation of pharmaceuticals and common household products like shampoo and dish soaps and the formation of nitrosamines during chloramine disinfection. Nitrosamines are very potent carcinogens. This provides a possible link between the presence of trace levels of certain drugs and household products in drinking water sources and potential adverse health effects\n\nIn older homes, the chloramine leaches much more lead and copper out of pipes and soldering, and exposes the consumer to much higher lead levels. If there is fluoride in the water also, the two chemicals act together synergistically to leach more lead than either chemical alone. The blood lead levels in children living in Washington DC increased dramatically after the city switched to chloramine as a water disinfectant.\n\n-Damage to plumbing infrastructure- Chloramine corrodes gaskets, valves, elastomer fittings and rubber plumbing parts like toilet flappers and rubber casings. Chloramine can cause pinhole pitting in copper pipes. Leaks from the pinholes can cause mold to grow. Insurance companies do not cover damage from mold. Appliances that come in contact with hot water (hot water heater, dishwasher, washing machine) will have shortened life spans. This doesn't just affect the homeowner, but every business that depends on hot water to conduct business, like restaurants and laundries.\n\n-Environmental Damage- Water containing tiny concentrations of chloramine is deadly to aquatic life (fish, frogs, and invertebrates). The same is true of chlorine. However, there is a huge difference. Chlorine dissipates very quickly and chloramine takes weeks to dissipate. So if a water main breaks and leaks chloraminated water into natural waterways, chloramine keeps killing aquatic life, whereas chlorine, which can also kill fish and invertebrates, dissipates very quickly so the devastation is quite small in comparison. Even a minor spill into a local waterway can result in a serious fish kill. The stream, Pimmit Run goes through McLean, Va. According to an article in the 4/2/08 edition of the Fairfax County Times, a water main broke, leaking \"hundreds\" of gallons of chloraminated water into Pimmit Run, and killing \"at least 90 percent of the fish\", according to Ed Pickens of Fairfax Trails and Streams. This happened over several miles of the stream, the article stated.\n\nWHAT CAN YOU DO?\n\n1) Call or email your representatives on Charlottesville City Council or Albemarle Board of Supervisors.\n\nComments\n\nIt takes weeks to evaporate out of water in a container with an open lid or a bowl. Even the best filtration only reduces the chloramine somewhat. Showering and bathing in chloraminated water is the worst exposure, so even with under-the-sink type of filters, the major route to exposure is not eliminated. Only expensive whole house filters can get to the shower/bathing water. Whole building filtration gives you the best shot at big long filters with lots and lots of carbon- the size that wouldn't fit into an apartment or under a sink. Even then, the bigger the building, the more people who are living in it, and/or the higher the flow rate of the water passing through it (more water being used all at once in the building), the less effective the filter is at removing chloramine. There is no way that any filters are effective enough to reduce chloramine such that people with moderate to severe respiratory, eye, digestive and/or skin symptoms get relief. People without symptoms can't tell the difference so they may think their filter is getting everything out, when in fact, it's not. Chloramine sufferers who are low income and/or rent apartments have no option for bathing in filtered tap water because the cost of apartment building filtration is excessive.\n\nThousands of people across the country have been documented developing respiratory, eye, dermal and/or digestive ailments when exposed to chloraminated tap water via drinking, cooking with, or showering or bathing in. \"Some of the health impacts that are occurring now are going to lead to more serious problems later on, due to chronic exposure. One such impact is an increase in deaths from respiratory disorders. Other impacts include disability and/or death from severe and continuous inflammation of the intestines and complications from extensive and chronic inflammation of the skin, such as infection and even gangrene.\" (Chloramine Disinfection Linked to Health Problems by Denise Johnson-Kula)"

      "text": "Posts Tagged 'pore size'\n\nWater filtration systems are systems and specific devices that removes impurities in drinking water and improve the smell, taste, and look of the water. The filtrated water is used in homes and other places such as offices for drinking, washing, and cooking. Water filter pitchers are the most affordable method of purifying water, but these types of systems do not always completely purify the water as it will depend on the type of filtration system used. Water filtration systems remove certain types of impurities and will identify the type of impurities that they will remove. As well, water filtration systems do not remove microorganisms and are designed to be used for water that is micro-biologically safe.\n\nThere are a number of different types of water systems. The various systems come with their own distinct benefits and disadvantages. You have to look at the various types of systems to see which type meets your needs. However, there are special combination filtration systems that combine the various technologies to eliminate a wide variety of impurities in the water.\n\nThere are three main types of filters used in water filtration systems that include:\n\nParticle Filters: This type of filter uses a membrane to trap particles or screen out impurities based on their size. The pore size of the membrane is used to determine a rating for the filters. It is measured in microns. The more efficient water filters have a smaller pore size. For instance, a filter that removes particles that are 0.5 microns in size will result in cleaner water being produced than when using a filter that removes particles that are 5 microns in size.\n\nActivated Carbon (AC) Filters: This filter is effective at removing organic contaminants from water which means you will have water that is not only healthy, but also tastes and smells good. The water will also be clear. When water flows through this filter, the carbon block attracts and removes contaminants such as heavy metals like copper, lead, and chlorine and dissolved substances such as hydrogen sulphide.\n\nResin Filters: These filters contain resins that remove such contaminants as heavy metals. They also remove minerals that create deposits. These types of impurities have an electrical charge. They are removed from the water when they attach to an opposite charge that is contained on the resin. Resin filters can be used along with activated carbon filters to remove dissolved substances and various types of impurities.\n\nWater systems are a great method of improving household water. You can buy filtration systems that range from water drinking pitchers up to large house water filtration systems at a wide range of prices. They make water healthier to drink and use and improve the colour, taste, odour of the water while removing impurities that can be harmful to people and they can remove hardness of the water which is caused by minerals. Using a water filtration system will ensure that you and your loved ones are drinking safe and great tasting water."

      "text": "Why Bottled Water?\n\nAccording to various accounts, 25 to 40 percent of bottled water in the U.S. comes from public water sources, a.k.a. tap water.1 For the companies that produce this water, it is an incredibly lucrative venture; they usually pay the standard municipal rate for tap water, which is less than one cent per gallon, and then resell it for anywhere between 240 to 10,000 times that price.2 In 2008, the top three bottled water brands in the U.S. by volume were Nestlé Waters North America's PureLife, Pepsi's Aquafina, and Coca-Cola's Dasani3 – all three of which come from municipal sources.4\n\nAs bottled water grows in popularity, we are witnessing a shift away from consumption of tap water. Today, one in five Americans only drink water from bottles. A generation of children is growing up believing that the only healthy water comes from bottles, and that tap water is impure. 5,6 This means that we are becoming more and more dependent upon huge, profit-motivated multinational corporations to provide one of our most important and fastest dwindling resources: clean drinking water.\n\nThese companies have done a fantastic job convincing us that their water is pure and delicious, thanks to advertising that appeals to a cultural fascination with youth, beauty, and purity.7 (Many people are amazed to discover that Aquafina was launched in 1994 and Dasani, 1999 – they are now so ubiquitous, it's hard to imagine life without them.) But how pure and safe is the water that they're selling?\n\nTap water is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Bottled water is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which lacks the enforcement authority that the EPA wields. By law, the FDA must set the same standards for drinking water that the EPA sets, or issue an explanation as to why they are not doing so; but the FDA does not require testing nearly as often as the EPA does for tap water, does not inspect plants as often, and, perhaps most shockingly, does not require companies to warn consumers of violations, even when they do find them.8,9\n\nFinally, there are the staggering environmental impacts of bottled water. First, when millions of gallons of water are removed from local watersheds, the hydrological cycle is disrupted, affecting water available for human usage as well as damaging local ecosystems.10,11Then, there's the plastic: Annually, 17 million barrels of oil are consumed in the production of the bottles alone – enough oil to fuel 1.3 million cars for a year. This figure does not include the oil burned in transportation or refrigeration of the water. In fact, the amount of oil used in the lifetime of a plastic water bottle is the equivalent of filling that bottle one-quarter of the way with oil.12 Finally, bottled water takes an enormous toll on our landfills. Less than 15% of single-use plastic water bottles are recycled nationwide; we send 30 million to our landfills every day.13 This is not just another drop in the bucket (pardon the pun).\n\nThe facts are clear: bottled water has negative impacts on our society, our health, our environment, and our wallets.\n\nThe need for action is urgent. We are the ones who can make the change."

      "text": "Tuesday, July 14, 2009\n\nWell here we go again. I've been very lax about posting my missives. My associates believe that I have been derelict in my duties, as a person of blogs, for not having posted more \"informatives\" (I kinda like that title) on this site.\n\nYou need to understand the difference between the word \"aerobic\" or \"requiring free oxygen\" vs what I call \"atmospheric oxygen\". \"Atmospheric oxygen\" means being in an atmospheric like environment. This is a crucial difference when discussing aerobic treatment devices. The crucial difference is efficiency.\n\nAerobic bacteria, or bacteria functioning metabolically with an aerobic metabolism, need free oxygen but they need it instantly and constantly to be efficient at digesting or metabolizing organic compounds (stuff). Aerobic devices that depend on dissolved oxygen (DO) in water to supply the \"free oxygen\" to aerobic bacteria (we trap within these devices and force them to work for us) are not efficient. Why you ask because I have your undying attention? DO is not constant within water. There is a mosaic of \"free oxygen\" in the water (7mg/l in water is considered saturated). Not very much oxygen by the way and saturated DO does not exist in most aerobic devices (except mine).\n\nThe DO is not a constant in every measurable amount of the water. The bacteria are not in constant contact with the \"free oxygen\" at all times as they would be if in atmospheric conditions. They have to wait (like waiting for a bus) until the \"free oxygen\" molecule happens along (again like the bus) for them to metabolize the oxygen and organic compounds (stuff). Luckily bacteria don't appear to have the same frustration potential as humans (again like the bus).\n\nSo if we want efficiency in \"aerobic treatment, we don't want the treatment to merely be aerobic, we want it to be atmospheric like. Welllllllll, guess what? There are such devices that have atmospheric like conditions within the devices, while they sit on the bottom of your septic tank. They are the Pirana System and the Septic Genie.\n\nThey are quite small, three feet tall and twelve inches in diameter or less, and very easy to install. They use very little electricity, require 2 cfm or less of air at less than 4 psi. Why small, easy and use little energy? Because the bacteria live in \"atmospheric like oxygen\" conditions within the devices. This means the bacteria have instant and constant access to oxygen to metabolize organic compounds (stuff). This means efficiency. Efficient allows for reduced size but increased effectiveness.\n\nSo when you think of aerobic treatment, qualify your thinking and think \"atmospheric like\" aerobic treatment. You now understand the difference and have a choice.\n\nWell, thanks for stopping by.

The researchers now plan a large-scale education campaign.\nThe team has been working on the idea of filtering drinking water for years. In 1996, they carried out a small study that showed a folded sari could filter out much of the cholera-carrying plankton. The most recent report is the result of testing the idea across much of Bangladesh.\nOnce the cloth dries out, the bacteria die. Folding a sari to give eight layers filters out virtually all the cholera, but women - who gather the water in Bangladeshi society - did not tend to do this, Huq said.\nThe flow of water becomes very slow. We could not implement it in the village because women collecting water were not ready to spend five to seven minutes to wait for the water to collect, he said.With four layers it was a zip.\nBangladeshi villagers often filter water through a piece of cloth, but they do not usually fold it. Folding the thin sari cloth greatly increased its filtering power, the researchers found.\nNow the team wants to find out if other items of clothing used in other countries will work as well.(Source: Maggie Fox, IOL, 15 January 2003)"

      "text": "City Water Has Been Bad For My Plants\n\nQuestion:\n\nI have a problem. We live in the city and use city water. Apparently the water is high in something, calcium maybe, because all of my plants get a white crust around them that they didn't have when I lived in the country and used well water. (I had to give up my aquarium because of this awful white build-up.) We don't get enough rain to be able to collect rain water as an alternative. Is there anything I can do or add to the water to stop this from happening? I had some beautiful plants when I moved here 3 years ago, and now almost every one of them is dead or dying. Help!\n\nHardiness Zone: 8a\n\nTripleb from Greenville, AL\n\nAnswer:\n\nTripleb,\n\nIt sounds like you're getting salts and/or lime build up from calcium carbonate deposits in your water. The white ring is limescale, a white (calcium carbonate) residue left by hard water when it evaporates. This sometimes occurs naturally in areas where water is pumped from underground aquifers. Hard water isn't bad for human health, but it can definitely wreak plenty of havoc on the health of your plants, not to mention your aquarium, water heater, dish water, clothes washer, shower fixtures, coffee maker, etc. Watering plants with hard water can leave behind deposits in the soil that can actually prevent plant cells from taking up adequate amounts of water and nutrients. An easy solution is to invest in a filtering pitcher like those made by Brita or PUR for watering your plants. At $20-$50 (depending on size and features), you'll be seriously reducing your hard water problem and purifying your drinking water without filtering out the important minerals. If you want to spend a lot more money, there are also filters designed for the end of your faucet. I use a pitcher to filter all of my water for cooking, making coffee, drinking and watering my plants. Heck, my cats and dog even get filtered water. These pitchers make it handy for filling up water bottles, too.\n\nAnswers: City Water Has Been Bad For My Plants\n\nRead answers for this question below.\n\nBy\n03/24/2007\n\nJust boiling the water will get rid of some of the hard water minerals.\n\nBy\n01/15/2007\n\nLetting water sit for a day or a week does not get rid of minerals, it does get rid of chlorine (but not chloramines, which many cities are converting to). I do not think the original poster's problem is chlorine, I think the problem is hard water and minerals. (I have aquariums and am familiar with these things. I also breed freshwater shrimp.)\n\nThe OP could get a distiller from Sears (where I got mine) which will remove all chemicals and minerals from the water. But the distiller (I had a counter top version) uses heat at about 1500watts, and thus costs money to run. The OP could also buy bottled spring water in bulk, costing 30-50 cents per gallon.\n\nBy rosa (Guest Post)\n10/19/2006\n\nIf you have room, store some of your city water in open containers for at least 24 hours before using, I know this is what is used for fresh water aquariums, works great to remove chemicals from city water\n\nBy Doggy (Guest Post)\n10/19/2006\n\nFilters do NOT remove fluoride. Fluoride only benefits preadolescent children. their teeth would be better protected by using a fluoride rinse (supervised)\n\nBy Lynda (Guest Post)\n10/18/2006\n\nI spray my houseplant leaves top and underneath with Sea Kelp in bottled water, and they green up overnight! I can't imagine what is in your water except perhaps some sort of mineral salts, therefore it's critical that you call your water district/water company to know what's going on, telling them your story. I'd repot whatever plant I could afford to repot/using fresh soil (with some ground charcoal in bottom of pot, if possible to sweeten the bottom water residual, and use the bottled water until they pull through the shock and stress of what they're going through. This is what I find is often the condition of plants that are being tossed curbside and is what I have ALWAYS had luck doing when I have extra money for bottled water.\n\nI'd not worry about the nutrients right away, you can add a few used coffee grounds and left over unsweetened/uncreamed coffee if the white crust is not caused by anything acidic, I'd think. For the new soil, I got time-released Miracle Grow mix when I had no compost and a little extra money. Now I use my own compost exclusively, mixed with garden soil.\n\nMy mom used to fertilize her plants weekly, which I believe killed a few because it's too often. Each plant has it's own needs, too, so do your homework about what each one likes, needs to thrive. Some prefer LOTS of water, others like dry med. loose soil. Don't treat them all the same. Watch their light needs as well, and consider the dry air on their leaves, all things that stress them out, not just the water.\n\nA rule of thumb that I have used since I have moved over 22 times from coast to coast, is to purchase plants according to the climate where I am. Even houseplants seem to know the difference and do indeed react to being moved, some for the better (ivy), some for the worse (Ficus).\n\nGod luck with your discoveries and research. God bless you. : )\n\nBy\n10/18/2006\n\nThe other thing you miss if you filter water is fluoride. If your water is fluoridated, this means your teeth enamel is not as strong as it could be. Check with your dentist for substitutes.\n\nWater softeners in areas of hard water save your pipes. Let's see, which is more costly, pipes or teeth? Hmmm. Difficult choice. Check with your water department. The white stuff on your plants is building up in your pipes, too.\n\nBy Donna (Guest Post)\n10/18/2006\n\nTry letting the water sit in an open container for a week before watering your plants. Works for us.\n\nBy Cathy (Guest Post)\n10/18/2006\n\nGet a soil testing kit ASAP and check the PH levels. If it is too alkaine, there are products you can buy make it more acidic. Alternatively, dilute some vinegar in water and pour it around the plants (keep away from the stems and leaves though), or mix in some coffee grounds into the soil. Good luck!\n\nBy\n10/18/2006\n\nThe only suggestion I have is to filter your water. We have a water filter jug which I keep in the fridge for cold drinks, the water tastes a lot better this way. It could be a bit fiddly for your plants, but there are bigger units you can purchase. Good luck.\n\nBy Laura (Guest Post)\n10/18/2006\n\nI don't know if this will help or not. We have a water softener here as we have very hard water. We also have a reverse osmosis system because I think the wateris fairly gross. I love the R/O water. Problem is it has no nutrients for plants. So Mom makes a huge cup of tea each day and saves the last 2 inches in a jar and on Saturdays she waters all her plants with her herbal and green tea mix. The plants are really thriving. She has been doing this for about 3 years now. So for you I would say buy a gallon of distilled water and make tea!"

      "text": "Tag Archive | \"tap water\"\n\nCool, refreshing, crystal clear water tastes great on a hot summer day, but most people don't give much thought to what's actually in their drinking water. The following is an explanation of how water treatment affects the tap water that people drink every day.\n\nAluminum Sulfate\n\nAlum, or aluminum sulfate, is added to water to aid in filtration. Alum acts as a coagulant to bind fine suspended particles together into larger particles that can then be filtered out of the water. It results in water that is clearer, and the alum itself will be cleared from the water. Because the aluminum is filtered back out along with the particles it binds to, it poses no health risk.\n\nFluoride\n\nThe EPA reports that fluoride is added strictly for the dental benefits. Fluoride does not improve the actual quality of the water supply, but it is proven to help protect the teeth of people who consume it. However, water fluoridation is becoming increasingly controversial. The National Water Council currently advises parents not to give fluoridated water to infants. Further, the Centers for Disease Control estimate that one in three children in America have irreversible damage to their permanent teeth as a result of fluoride. Supporters point to evidence showing fewer cavities for people consuming fluoridated water while opponents claim that there are serious health risks, including the risk of cancer. Of all the chemicals added to water, fluoride is the most controversial, and the only one that is not needed for actual water quality.\n\nChlorine\n\nThe EPA reports that chlorine is added as a disinfectant. Derivatives of chlorine, including chlorine dioxide and chloramines, are also added to prevent water supplies from turning into breeding grounds for bacteria and viruses. The health problems with consuming high levels of chlorine are clear. However, water departments around the nation are careful to use enough chlorine to kill bacteria without using so much as to cause health problems.\n\nPotassium Permanganate\n\nThis oxidizing agent is added to lake water. It is used to clear the water of iron, manganese, and some natural tastes and odors. Removing the iron and manganese ensures that the water does not cause stains on clothing and plumbing fixtures. After being oxidized by potassium permanganate, these minerals become insoluble and can be easily removed through basic filtration methods. However, concentrated levels of potassium permanganate can be harmful to the skin.\n\nPolyphosphate\n\nUsed as a liquid substance, polyphosphate helps to isolate the iron, manganese, and calcium in water. When added to water, polyphosphate protects water lines by preventing corrosion of pipes.\n\nAny chemical added to water has the potential to cause health problems. However, it is important to weigh the potential risks against the health benefits that are gained by having clear, clean water that is free of algae, bacteria and viruses. Regardless of where you live, it is a good idea to have an additional filtration system in your own home to remove some of these chemicals.\n\nPoor water pressure can be caused by many different things, but there are some common culprits that you can examine first. Water pressure can change over time because of changes in your water pipes, or changes to your water supply. Identifying the cause early and proper maintenance of water pipes can resolve the problem permanently.\n\nYour Water Pipes\n\nThe most common cause of poor water pressure is the buildup of scales inside the pipes that run from the water main to your home. These scales reduce the diameter of your pipes, restricting water flow. Plastic pipe, called PVC pipe, is often a good choice because there is no chance of rust buildup within the pipe. Calcium and lime are also causes of mineral buildup in water pipes.\n\nIdentifying Low Pressure\n\nPoor water pressure can be easily identified if you are accustomed to good pressure. You may notice that it takes longer to fill your bath tub, or that the water from the sink takes longer to fill a pitcher. You may also be dealing with longer times for washing clothes. Poor water pressure is very common, but that doesn't mean that you are stuck with the problem. Finding the cause is the first step in increasing water pressure in your home.\n\nRust and Corrosion\n\nOlder homes may have cast iron or other metal water pipes that suffer from rust and corrosion which also leads to poor water pressure. The most common cause for rust and corrosion in metal piping is the content of the water that runs to your home. Most water is packed with minerals and other materials that interact with the metals, leading to lowered pipe integrity and rust. Replacing old, rusty pipes with PVC can help to ensure clean water and good water pressure.\n\nNew Pipe\n\nIf your poor water pressure has occurred right after the installation of new pipe in the home then you may be dealing with a poorly placed water line that reduces water flow. In general, it is best that water travel in a straight path until it reaches the intended faucet, where the line will branch off. Corners that are too tight or pipe that is bent or damaged will also result in lower water pressure.\n\nPipe Maintenance and Repair\n\nRepairing and maintaining your water pipes is the best solution for avoiding poor water pressure in the future. There are solutions that range from coating the inside of existing pipes with epoxy to totally replacing damaged water pipes in the home. It is usually best to schedule a regular maintenance appointment with your plumber to ensure good water pressure over time and to avoid repairs in the future.\n\nPeople rely on water everyday, including tap water. While drinking from the tap is preferable to bottled water, no one wants to drink water that is dirty . Cloudy water, also known as, white water, can cause headaches to many people. There are many reasons why your tap water may be cloudy, and ways to fix it.\n\nTemperature is Usually the Reason\n\nIf the temperature in the pipes is lower than the room temperature, it may cause trapped air bubbles that make it look like cloudy water. You don't need to fix this problem. It is something that will solve itself. Fill the cup up with the water, let it sit, and the bubbles will disappear from the bottom up in a few minutes.\n\nDirt in the Water\n\nDirt can be a reason for your cloudy water. You should consult with your city about the possible reason for your cloudy water if it is not air bubbles. If dirt is the reason for your cloudy water, you could try using a water filter .\n\nRust in the Water\n\nIf your cloudy water is brown, red, orange, or yellow in color then rust or iron can be the cause of it. The rust sediments could have been disturbed in your house or apartment building, causing it to be suspended in the water. While you should not drink the water, it is not particularly a health threat to wash clothes. If you do decide to wash clothes with rust in the water, make sure to use a rust stain remover. Do not use bleach because it will mix with the rust and cause permanent stains.\n\nIf you are a homeowner it is important to know if the rust is coming from your pipes or the city. If it is coming from the city, the rust will show up at every faucet in the house, it only shows up in cold water, and the water was clear earlier, but is now distorted. If it is the city, they will fix it.\n\nBacteria in the Water\n\nIf your drain becomes blocked up with hair, soap, or food waste, you may smell a rotten odor like sewage or rotten eggs. Fill a glass of water and let it sit. If it does not have a smell, then there is nothing wrong with the water; you simply need to disinfect the drain. If the smells do come from the water, make sure to contact your city immediately as there may be harmful bacteria in the water.\n\nThese are the most common causes of cloudy water. Remember to always check with your city if you are not sure about the causes of the cloudy water. Hopefully this has helped you become more aware of your water and how to treat it.\n\nWhere Does Water Come From? The full answer to this question should include 'What the Earth's original source of water is,' wateridePublic concerns related to chemicals in the water supply have become popular over the past few years; this has ultimately led to an increase in the consumption of bottled water. While choosing between the consumption of bottled water or tap water is in the end up to the consumer, there are still many factors that help people choose between the two. The most prominent of these factors are safety concerns, cost factors, environmental costs, and whether or not a person has access to tap or bottled water.\n\nSafety Concerns\n\nWithin the United States, both bottled and tap water is considered to be extremely safe to consume. While bottled water is often thought of as being cleaner and safer than drinking tap water, there is no research that supports such evidence. The quality of water in both bottles and municipals differs, making it very hard to come up with a generalization as to which one wins over the other. The FDA sets the safety standards for bottled water, while the EPA sets the safety standards that regulate municipal water. The EPA standards that govern municipal water sources are far more strict than the regulations surrounding bottled water. For this reason many people are turning to tap water. When a person asks \"What's in my water?\" it is imperative that the person understands what type of treatment the water undergoes, as well as the source of the water.\n\nPrices of Bottled and Tap Water Per Gallon\n\nIn most areas across the United States the price of bottled water is 300 times more costly than the price of tap water. In fact the SFPUC enables consumers to purchase water at only around $.003/gallon; with bottled water costing anywhere between $1 and $4 a gallon. Not only is bottled water more expensive in relation to its purchasing price but also with the time and energy it takes to purchase it and deliver it to its destination.\n\nCosts to the Environment\n\nSince water is often times imported from foreign countries and shipped long distances this increases the consumption of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions, which ultimately leads to air pollution. Taking all of these factors into consideration, it is easy to understand that why bottled water is bad for the environment based on its delivery and consumption.\n\nAccessibility\n\nWithin the United States it is easy to access bottled water or tap water. Almost any type of convenient or grocery store sells bottled water, while most homes and building structures are built with the ability to provide tap water. The public within the United States brings many beneficial aspects to the impact water has on the environment by maintaining values that demand to know \"How safe is my water?\"\n\nConclusion\n\nKeeping the safety concerns, price costs, environmental costs, and accessibility issues in mind it becomes apparent that tap water should ultimately be the main type of water consumed; however, since the United States is a free country it still provides the public with their own choice.\n\nPharmaceutical drugs such as antibiotics, anti-depressants, and hormone pills have been discovered, although in low levels, in drinking water across the United States. Currently, there are no testing regulations from the Federal government to protect our water. However, there is growing concern among doctors and scientists regarding the health effects of drugs in drinking water, even when they are at low levels. Studies are currently ongoing to measure the health effects.\n\nPharmaceuticals in Water\n\nIn 2008, the Associated Press released the results of an investigation they undertook that found that nearly 41 million Americans were exposed to pharmaceutical drugs in their drinking water. According to the Associated Press, 24 major cities are affected across the nation. The levels of pharmaceutical drugs that were detected were low, but the investigation had shown that the problem is widespread and can continue to grow. 62 major city water providers were contacted for the AP investigation, and out of that number, only 28 did any type of testing. In addition, 35 of the 62 watersheds, the source of drinking water, were contaminated with differing medications.\n\nHow Do They Get There?\n\nThere are multiple ways in which drugs can enter drinking water, lakes and oceans. Medications are mostly absorbed by the body, but some of it gets flushed into the sewer systems. Drugs can also pass from our bodies while swimming in open waters. Unused medications are often disposed of improperly, with many people pouring them down the drain or flushing them down the toilet. Residues from the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical drugs end up as waste in water. Finally, illegal dumping of expired medications into waterways by drug manufacturers has occurred in the past, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The disposal of unused pharmaceuticals is regulated by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which assess fines for violations.\n\nHow Can We Remove It?\n\nThe EPA also notes that there are currently no city sewer treatment facilities in the country that are equipped to remove large amount of pharmaceutical drugs from water sources and sewer systems. The EPA suggests that activated carbon water filters, however, do remove most chemicals and drugs from a water supply, which is a remedy that can be used in the home or in large industrial situations as well.\n\nWhat Are the Risks to Humans?\n\nFish have been shown to be affected by drugs in lakes and rivers, but whether the same holds for humans is unknown. The Journal of the American Medical Asscociationpublished an article in 2008 that stated that because the research on pharmaceuticals in drinking water was insufficient and the health risks are relatively unknown, that safer disposal methods must be examined until more is known."

Sorry but . . . fluoridated salt is increasingly common – both intentionally fluoridated and naturally fluoridated.\n\nWhy is salt being fluoridated and how can we find LOW fluoride salt?\n\nWhy Fluoridate Table Salt?\n\nTheir thinking is: In countries unable to fluoridate their water, fluoridating salt ensures the people will have maximum dental protection. Fluoridation proponents ignore research showing that systemic fluoride (consuming fluoride into the body with food and/or water) cannot provide any benefits to teeth. The ONLY way fluoride MIGHT be good for teeth is when applied topically, and even that is debated in new research.\n\nFluoridating salt has NO positive benefit for teeth. It just goes into the digestive system where it gets absorbed into our bones, replaces calcium, causes a whole host of damaging health effects, yada, yada, yada.\n\nHow Much Fluoride?\n\nIntentionally fluoridated salt usually contains about 250 ppm fluoride, which results in a daily intake of 2.5 mg of fluoride per day for people consuming 10 grams of salt.\n\nConsider this: \"Himalayan\" salt is enmeshed in controversy over the fluoride issue. Reportedly this salt is from mines in the pristine Himalayas – however people have investigated this claim and can't find any salt mines there. Critics claim that what is sold as \"Himalayan\" salt is actually from one of the world's largest salt mines in Pakistan and contains 231mg (231ppm) fluoride – naturally!!(1),(2)\n\nSince fluoride can occur naturally in soil and water, it can be in natural salt deposits too. That's why we're checking into the fluoride content of natural, untreated salt. Fluoride is in salt – but in what quantity? Himalayan salt contains the upper limit of fluoride. Read on and you'll find several natural salts containing MUCH lower levels of fluoride.\n\nAnd please don't be beguiled by people claiming that so-called \"natural\" fluoride is healthy. Not! No \"healthy\" fluoride exists. The only issue is which of the forms of this toxic substance are the most life-sucking and which are less life-sucking.\n\nWhat Countries Fluoridate Salt?\n\nAccording to Fluoride Alert, countries with salt fluoridation programs include: Austria, Bolivia, Columbia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, France, Germany, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Switzerland, and Venezuela. How extensive and whether people are given the option of having non-fluoridated salt, is not confirmed.\n\nResearch published in 2006 subsequent to Mexico's national salt fluoridation program, demonstrates the dental fluorosis rate among children went up to 52%. This rate was attributed to both fluoridated salt and the use of fluoridated toothpaste. (3)\n\nHUGE Concern\n\nI'm wondering if fluoride could be slipped into our salt without our knowledge? – especially considering that fluoride does not have to be included on product labeling.\n\nGoodness knows that there are a myriad of other food additives put into our foods that we're never told about. (My husband spent his career in the food processing industry and tells horror stories about this.) Could this also intentionally happen with fluoride?\n\nAppropriate product labeling is good. The thought that we might unknowingly be getting fluoride in our salt (not to mention a whole list of other foods) is upsetting.\n\nFinally, someone has confirmed my findings about that stupid Himalayan Sea Salt. It started up my Fibromyalgia again until I stopped using it and detoxified my body with the help of naturopathic remedies. It took 4 months before I could get back into the Gym.\n\nPlease write to Dr. Mercola, as I have, to convince him to stop promoting that shit.\n\nI have been quite displeased with Mercola promoting Himalayan salt too! In one breath he discusses the evils of fluoride and in the next he promotes Himalayan salt. He should read the chemical analysis of the stuff."

      "text": "The life of refrigerator water filters is dependent upon the volume of contaminants in the water as well as the amount of use of the filter. Nicely water is more likely to include contaminants not identified in publicly treated water and could need to have a lot more frequent filter changes. As a rule of thumb, the filter really should be changed as specified by the manufacturer or at least every six months.\nCarbon is the major substance employed in water filtration methods since carbon has the potential to absorb several of the chemical substances discovered in water. Most refrigerator water filters, which meet NSF/ANSI 42 certification standards, use granular activated carbon (GAC) to attract chemicals and impurities responsible for negative taste and odor, such as those that are a by-product of chlorine. These filters are not capable, however, to rid water of more dangerous, health-threatening contaminants. The method by which water is channeled through GAC filters does not allow sufficient time to complete the absorption of such substances. Various bacteria are formed, trapped and allowed to multiply, which additional contaminates water processed by the filters. Carbon is not capable to absorb heavy metals, such as lead. GAC filters might trap some heavy metals and sediments, but allow other people to filter through to the output water. Failure to change the water filter, each six months, permits unabsorbed water contaminants and newly formed bacteria to saturate the filter, forcing the filter to leak contaminants back into processed water. The water output may possibly contain a lot more contaminants than the filter was intended to get rid of in the first location.\nTechnology has lead to the development of much more absorbent carbon-based filters, solid carbon block filters. These filters contain solid blocks of carbon to absorb contaminants from water. Water takes longer to strain through carbon blocks than it does carbon granules, so that carbon blocks provide adequate time for the absorption of far more well being-threatening containments. Even though carbon block filters are capable to absorb toxics, pesticides, TTHM's and other contaminants, they can't absorb heavy metals or contaminants that are by-products of agricultural fertilization, such as nitrates or sulfides. The composition of carbon blocks allows them to restrain heavy metals and bacteria away from output water, even so, nitrates and sulfides are not filtered. Even so, carbon block filters are sufficient to meet NSF/ANSI 53 certification standards. Failure to modify carbon block filters, every six months, makes it possible for contaminants to saturate the filter, forcing the filter to leak contaminants into the processed water. When sediments are not removed from water, those sediments buildup and corrode filter fittings and water fixtures, causing them to leak. This kind of damage to filters and fixtures could result in the output water to contain more contaminants than the water input to the filter. Failure to adjust the filters may well also minimize the water pressure, inside the filtering system, forcing it to be ineffective.\nSome refrigerator water filters may include fiber water filters. These filters are created of tightly wrapped fibers of rayon or spun cellulose, which trap rust, lead and other sediments found in water. When used alone, these filters are ineffective in reducing any chemical or wellness-threatening contaminants. Fiber filters are very best suited for use with other sorts of filters to lessen the concentration of sediments. They should be replaced, every six months, to stay away from a build-up of sediments that would force the filter to leak the contaminants back into the processed water. reverse osmosis water filtration systems for home"

In Bangladesh, where roughly half the population drinks contaminated water, this issue is a particularly heavy concern. The problem arose in the 1970s during efforts to provide an alternative to surface water, which is often highly contaminated with bacteria. Millions of tube wells were built in hopes of bypassing the bacteria-contaminated surface water and by accessing what was thought to be clean water. Unfortunately for the millions of Bangladeshis relying on tube wells for their water supply, many of the wells were found to have unearthed water contaminated by naturally occurring arsenic.

      "text": "Water treatment device and method\n\nAbstract: A water treatment system, comprising a, and a plurality of permanent magnets configured to create a magnetic field along the at least one pipe, the magnetic field having a direction perpendicular to the water flow direction of the at least one pipe, wherein the electric field and the magnetic field are configured to break at least some hydrogen bonds between water molecules of water passing through the at least one pipe.\n\nThe disclosed technology relates generally to devices for water treatment, and more specifically to water treatment devices based on electric and magnetic fields.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSED TECHNOLOGY\n\nProcesses for treating water in order to make it more acceptable for a desired end-use are well known, and are used in many fields, such as sewage treatment, agricultural waste water treatment, and industrial waste water treatment. In general, the goal of water treatment processes is to remove existing contaminants from the water, or at least to reduce the contaminant concentration in the water, so that the water becomes suitable for a desired end-use, such as returning the water to nature without adverse ecological impact.\n\nIndustrial waste water treatment includes two main types of processes, boiler water treatment and cooling water treatment. Proper water treatment is crucial, as lack of proper water treatment can affect various aspects of water treatment and use, from public health issues (e.g. poor quality dirty water can become breeding ground for bacteria such as Legionella) to energy efficiency and safety of machinery.\n\nSpecifically, steam boilers may suffer from scale deposits on the walls of the boiler and/or pipes, particularly because there are no specific requirements regarding the quality of the water used in such boilers. The thermal conductivity coefficient of scale deposit is one hundred times smaller than that of metals, and the thermal resistance of such deposits is high. The large thermal resistance and low thermal conductivity coefficient cause heat loss from the system resulting in excessive fuel consumption. On the other hand, the metal walls on which the scale is deposited become overheated, which may lead to pipes bulging and even bursting.\n\nTypically, removal of scale deposits requires shutdown of the boilers and associated systems. Additionally, scale deposits are removed using sharp metal instruments. As a result, scale deposit removal involves labor, materials, and at times causes mechanical damages and/or chemical erosion to the boilers and pipes.\n\nThough the composition of scale deposits is complex and dependent on the contaminants present in the water, often times at least part of the scale deposit is formed of carbonate materials deposited on the boiler body, such as calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and magnesium carbonate (MgCO3). A secondary scale deposit is often formed by alkaline metal residuals attaching to an existing deposit. Scale deposit formation can be described by the following chemical equations:\n\nCa(HCO3)2CaCO3(s)+H2O(l)+CO2(g)\n\nMg(HCO3)2MgCO3(s)+H2O(l)+CO2(g)\n\nMgHCO3(s)+H2O(l)Mg(OH)2(s)+CO2(g)\n\nAs seen from the equations, the level of chemical reactivity of water molecules affects the equilibrium of the equations. Thus, highly chemically reactive water can prevent the formation of scale, and can even cause the removal of existing scale deposits from the boiler. However, natural water is not highly chemically reactive.\n\nWater molecule clusters are formed because the negative charges in the oxygen atoms in a water molecule are not completely neutralized when combined with hydrogen atoms to form water molecules. As a result, water molecules in a given sample will include a certain amount of oxygen atoms bearing a negative charge. Such negatively charged oxygen atoms which attract hydrogen atoms of neighboring water molecules, and form hydrogen bonds therewith. Water molecules that are bonded together via hydrogen bonds form water molecule clusters, defined chemically by the formula (H2O)n.\n\nWater molecule clusters tend to be inertial in their physical properties and chemical reactivity, and typically do not break apart even when encountering highly active substances in nature. This feature of the water keeps it stable in the environment. Furthermore, destruction of hydrogen bonds is extremely endothermic, and requires a large amount of heat to be added to the water before the hydrogen bonds are broken and the water becomes more chemically reactive.\n\nAs a result, there is a need for a more energy efficient method of breaking up water clusters, particularly for use in water treatment facilities such as water treatment boilers. While attempts have been made to provide methods for increasing the reactivity of water molecules, these attempts continue to involve the investment of large amount of energy from an external source and require large power consumption.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nOF THE DISCLOSED TECHNOLOGY\n\nThe disclosed technology relates generally to devices for water treatment, and more specifically to water treatment devices based on electric and magnetic fields.\n\nMore specifically, the disclosed technology provides a technical solution for reducing scale accumulation in boilers, and removal of scale deposits from boilers without resorting to use of harsh chemicals. Additionally, the disclosed technology provides a method for breaking down hydrogen bonds in boiler water, thereby reducing the energy required for operation of boilers.\n\nIn accordance with some aspects of an embodiment of the teachings herein, there is provided a water treatment system comprising a plurality of pipes, each of the plurality of pipes formed of a rare earth metal alloy and configured for water passage through the pipe in a water flow direction. Excitation of electrons in the rare earth metal alloy of at least one of the pipes forms an electric field along the pipe, the electric field having a direction perpendicular to the water flow direction in that pipe.\n\nAdditionally, a plurality of permanent magnets are arranged so as to create a magnetic field along the pipe, the magnetic field having a direction perpendicular to the direction in which water flows through the pipe.\n\nAs a result of the presence of the electric field and the magnetic field, at least some hydrogen bonds between water molecules of water passing through the pipe are broken.\n\nIn some embodiments, at least two pipes in the plurality of pipes lie parallel to one another.\n\nIn some embodiments, at least one of the pipes comprises a plurality of longitudinal segments having a first diameter. The segments are connected to one another by a plurality of ridges having a second diameter, the second diameter (the diameter of the ridges) being greater than the first diameter (the diameter of the segments). Thus, at least one of the pipes has the shape of a bamboo stalk.\n\nIn some embodiments, the excitation of the electrons in the rare earth metal alloy is caused by the magnetic field and the force it applies to the rare earth metal alloy. In some embodiments, no external power source is used for the excitation of the electrons in the rare earth metal alloy.\n\nIn some embodiments, at least some water molecules are grouped in water clusters having a first size before entering the plurality of pipes. The break of at least some hydrogen bonds, occurring in the pipes, results in at least some of the water molecules exiting the pipes being grouped in water clusters having a second size, which is smaller than the first size. Stated differently, the electric and magnetic forces applied to the water passing through the pipes breaks down water clusters, such that water leaving the plurality of pipes, after exposure to the electric and magnetic fields, includes smaller clusters than it included prior to entering the pipes.\n\nIn some embodiments, exposure of water molecules to the electric and magnetic fields while passing through the pipes increases the chemical reactivity of at least some of the water molecules. In some embodiments, the increase in chemical reactivity of some water molecules results in reduced scale sedimentation in a boiler into which the water flows from the plurality of pipes. In some embodiments, the increase in chemical reactivity of some water molecules results in removal of scale sedimentation from a boiler into which the water flows from the plurality of pipes.\n\nIn some embodiments, the permanent magnets are arranged such that they form a permanent magnet layer surrounding each of the plurality of pipes.\n\nIn some embodiments, the permanent magnets are arranged in at least two permanent magnet layers forming a matrix. Each of the permanent magnet layers in the matrix defines a magnetic field, such that the magnetic fields in the matrix apply force in alternating directions. Stated differently, the magnetic fields generated by each pair of adjacent permanent magnet layers in the matrix, apply a force in opposite directions.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nFIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of an embodiment of a water treatment device constructed and operative in accordance with an embodiment of the teachings herein.\n\nFIG. 2 is an enlarged schematic illustration of area A of FIG. 1.\n\nFIG. 3 is a sectional illustration, taken along section lines F-F in FIG. 2.\n\nFIG. 4 is a scaled-down sectional illustration, taken along section lines B-B in FIG. 1.\n\nFIG. 5 is a sectional illustration, taken along section lines D-D in FIG. 4.\n\nFIG. 6 is a scaled-down sectional illustration, taken along section lines C-C in FIG. 1.\n\nFIG. 7 is a sectional illustration, taken along section lines E-E in FIG. 6.\n\nFIG. 8 is a cutaway, schematic illustration, of an embodiment of a flat plate water treatment system using the water treatment device of FIGS. 1-7, constructed and operative according to an embodiment of the teachings herein.\n\nFIG. 9 is a schematic illustration of an embodiment of a water treatment device based on a three dimensional magnetic plate, constructed and operative in accordance with another embodiment of the teachings herein.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\nOF EMBODIMENTS OF THE DISCLOSED TECHNOLOGY\n\nEmbodiments of the disclosed technology include a water treatment device, using magnetic and electric fields.\n\nIn accordance with aspects of some embodiments of the teachings herein, there is provided a water treatment system, comprising:\n\na; and\n\na plurality of permanent magnets configured to create a magnetic field along the at least one pipe, the magnetic field having a direction perpendicular to the water flow direction of the at least one pipe;\n\nwherein the electric field and the magnetic field are configured to break at least some hydrogen bonds between water molecules of water passing through the at least one pipe.\n\nIn accordance with aspects of some embodiments of the teachings herein, there is provided a method for water treatment, the method carried out by way of:\n\npassing water through a plurality of pipes, each of the plurality of pipes being formed of a rare earth metal alloy;\n\nforming an electric field along at least one pipe of the plurality of pipes by causing excitation of electrons in the rare earth metal alloy forming the at least one pipe, the electric field having a direction perpendicular to a direction of water flow through the at least one pipe; and\n\ncreating a magnetic field by placing a plurality of permanent magnets along the at least one pipe, the magnetic field having a direction perpendicular to the direction of water flow through the at least one pipe;\n\nwherein the electric field and the magnetic field are configured to break at least some hydrogen bonds between water molecules of water passing through the at least one pipe.\n\nReference is now made to FIG. 1, which is a schematic illustration of an embodiment of a water treatment device constructed and operative in accordance with an embodiment of the teachings herein, and to FIG. 2, which is an enlarged schematic illustration of area A of FIG. 1\n\nAs seen in FIG. 1, a water treatment device 4 comprises a plurality of water treatment components 6, which are assembled together by means of connectors. Each water treatment component 6 comprises a pair of single faced, magnetically permeable channel plates 7, arranged, respectively, at the top and the bottom of water treatment component 6. Plates 7 are attached, at respective ends thereof, to two partition boards 5, each including an opening 14. It is appreciated that, when assembled, the edges of water treatment components 6 face openings 14 of partition boards 5, and are flush therewith.\n\nAs seen with particular clarity in FIG. 2, each pair of plates 7 has a plurality of double faced magnetically permeable channel plates 8 arranged therein. The number of double faced magnetically permeable channel plates 8 may be any suitable number, as determined by the size of water treatment device 4. As seen, in the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, five double faced magnetically permeable channel plates 8 are deployed.\n\nIt is appreciated that single faced magnetically permeable channel plates 7 and double faced magnetically permeable channel plates 8 typically operate in an oxygen-free environment, the alloy used to form the plates 7 and 8 will not rust, as described further hereinbelow.\n\nAs seen in FIGS. 1, 2, and 3, between each pair of plates 8, as well as between the end channel plates 8 and the adjacent channel plates 7 is located a plastic clapboard 9 having permanent magnets 10 enclosed within. Specifically, each plastic clapboard 9 is in fact formed of three, typically identical, heat-resisting plastic boards, which are bonded together to form a clapboard 9. A central one the plastic boards includes magnet cavities 13 for placement of permanent magnets 10 therein, such that permanent magnets 10 are sandwiched between two plastic boards, and are surrounded by plastic from all directions. The intervals between permanent magnets 10, within a clapboard 9, are typically small, for example in the range of 10 to 12 mm.\n\nReference is now additionally made to FIG. 4, which is a sectional illustration taken along section lines B-B in FIG. 1, to FIG. 5, which is a sectional illustration taken along section lines D-D in FIG. 4, to FIG. 6, which is a sectional illustration taken along section lines C-C in FIG. 1, and to FIG. 7, which is a sectional illustration taken along section lines E-E in FIG. 6.\n\nAs seen in FIGS. 2, 4, and 5, a plurality of pipes, or longitudinal water channels 11, are embedded in the inner face of each single-faced magnetically permeable channel plate 7. Additionally, as clearly seen in FIGS. 2, 6, and 7, a plurality of pipes, or longitudinal water channels 12 are embedded in each of the faces of each double-faced magnetically permeable channel plate 8. Together, water channels 11 and 12, and plates 7 and 8, form a magnetically permeable split-flow core for a water treatment facility.\n\nThe number of water channels 11 in each single faced magnetically permeable channel plate 7 may be any suitable number, and may vary between different plates 7. Similarly, the number of water channels 12 in each face of each double faced magnetically permeable channel plate 8 may be any suitable number, and may vary between different plates 8 and even between the two faces of a single plate 8. In some embodiments, the number of water channels 11 or 12 placed in a face of a plate 7 or 8 is dependent on the volume of water to be treated. As seen in FIGS. 4 to 7, in the illustrated embodiment twelve water channels are placed in the face of each plate.\n\nThe water channels 11 and 12 may have any suitable shape. That said, in some embodiments, water channels 11 and/or 12 are formed of longitudinal segments having a first diameter, connected by ridges having a second diameter, the second diameter being slightly greater than the first diameter, thereby forming a shape similar to that of a bamboo stalk. Forming water channels 11 and/or 12 in the shape of a bamboo stalk is advantageous because the bamboo-shaped (bent) channel forms and generates the water inrush function (velocity and acceleration) within the channel. The slower water flow allows the water to be treated more effectively than the water moving in a straight channel under the same conditions as the constant water flow.\n\nAs seen in FIG. 2, the locations of permanent magnets 10, formed in plastic clapboards 9, correspond to the locations of water channels 11 and 12. Specifically, in some embodiments, permanent magnets 10 are disposed in magnet cavities 13 along water channels 11 and 12. In some embodiments, permanent magnets 10 are longitudinally arrayed such that their directions alternate in pairs, for example in the form of N—S, S—N, N—S, S—N, etc.\n\nAs seen in FIG. 1, single faced magnetically permeable channel plates 7, double faced magnetically permeable channel plates 8, and plastic clapboards 9, are tightly fastened together using bolts 20 passing through mounting holes 22 located at edges of water treatment device 4, and nuts 24.\n\nReference is now made to FIG. 8, which is a cutaway, schematic illustration, of an embodiment of a flat plate water treatment system using the water treatment device of FIGS. 1-7, constructed and operative according to an embodiment of the teachings herein.\n\nA water treatment device 4, as described hereinabove with reference to FIGS. 1-7 is used in forming a flat plate water treatment system 30. As seen, a water treatment device 4 is mounted within a tank body 32, as seen in FIG. 8. Tank body 32 further includes a water inlet 1, configured for water to enter water treatment system 30, a water outlet 2, configured for treated water to exit water treatment system 30, and a pedestal 3.\n\nIt is appreciated that tank 32 may include one or more water treatment devices 4, and that each of those water treatment devices may include one or more water treatment components 6. That said, as an example, the illustrated embodiment shows a single water treatment device 4, including two partition boards 5 and two water treatment components 6.\n\nReferring now to FIGS. 1 to 8, in use, boiler water is fed into tank body 32 via water inlet 1. The water flows through each of water channels 11 and 12 in plates 7 and 8, and then flows out of the tank 32 via water outlet 2. Typically, water flowing out of tank 32 flows into a boiler, via tubes connecting tank 32 with the boiler.\n\nMagnetic forces from permanent magnets 10 affect the outer shell electrons of the alloy forming magnetically permeable plates 7 and 8 and the channels 11 and 12 therein. Thus, the outer shell electrons continuously move between an excited state and the ground state, thereby releasing energy to aid in the water treatment process.\n\nAs mentioned hereinabove, permanent magnets 10 are arranged in cavities 13 within clapboards 9 such that their locations correspond to water channels 11 and 12, and form a magnetic field within tank 32, in a direction perpendicular to the direction of water flow. Additionally, as mentioned above, plates 7 and 8 and water channels 11 and 12 are formed of an alloy having excellent magnetic conductivity, result in release of energy by transition of electrons between an excited state and a ground state. As such, an electric field formed in water channels 11 and 12 is self excited, and creation of the electric field does not require any external energy input.\n\nThe energy released by the magnetic field and from the transition of electrons between states, impinges on water clusters in the water flowing through channels 11 and 12, and breaks at least some of the hydrogen bonds in the water clusters thereby reducing the size of the water clusters. The broken water clusters do not recombine due to the polarization of the magnetic field generated by permanent magnets 10.\n\nThe reduction in the size of water clusters, and in the number of hydrogen bonds in each water cluster, boosts the physicochemical activity of the water clusters. The increase in energy in the system causes and increase in resonance internal energy of water molecules flowing through the system, thereby causing the water molecules to flow faster (increased thermal motion) and to have higher chemical reactivity. Thus, when the water exits tank 32 and enters the boiler it is highly chemically reactive, and has smaller water clusters.\n\nWhen considering the chemical reactions through which water scale is formed:\n\nCa(HCO3)2CaCO3(s)+H2O(l)+CO2(g); and\n\nMg(HCO3)2MgCO3(s)+H2O(l)+CO2(g);\n\nwater with increased chemical reactivity will cause the reaction to be carried out in the forward direction more readily than in the reverse direction, thereby shifting the chemical equilibrium and causing reduced scale formation, and possibly the breakdown of at least some scale. Additionally, in some embodiments, the concentration of sodium ions in treated water is reduced.\n\nAs a result, water and steam treated by the system and method of the teachings herein are purified, and cause less scaling and/or discharge in boilers, up to a level of zero discharge. The reduction in scale deposits greatly reduces boiler maintenance costs, since there is no need to remove old scale deposits from the boilers which may harm the boiler, no need for acid cleaning of the boiler, boiler accident caused by scale are prevented, the operating pressure of the boilers is reduced, and the application of coal is improved.\n\nAdditionally, experimental results show that using the water treatment system of the teachings herein greatly improves boiler operation and productivity. For example, coal consumption may be reduced by approximately 3 g/kilowatt-hour or 3%, boiler outputs may be improved by approximately 7%, steam flow may be reduced by 3-8%, and power consumption may be reduced by 1%. Improvements may be found in many other parameters of boiler function as well.\n\nReference is now made to FIG. 9, which is a schematic illustration of an embodiment of a water treatment device based on a three dimensional magnetic plate, constructed and operative in accordance with another embodiment of the teachings herein.\n\nAs seen, a magnetic array 100 comprises a plurality of magnetic plates 102, each of the magnetic plates including an array of permanent magnets 104. The magnets 104 in each plate 102 are arranged in alternating N—S order, both in the rows of the array and in the columns. Thus, the magnetic array 100 creates alternating three-dimensional magnetic fields.\n\nWhen water molecules pass through magnetic array 100, typically around the array or between magnets 104 forming the array 100, they undergo mutations and/or chemical reactions, as do other molecules passing through this type of magnetic environment. This feature of the magnetic array 100 makes it useful for generating a magnetic field in water treatment facilities similar to those described hereinabove with reference to FIGS. 1 to-above are also contemplated and within the scope of the disclosed technology.\n\nDownload full PDF for full patent description/claims.\n\nYou can also Monitor Keywords and Search for tracking patents relating to this Water treatment treatment device and method or other areas of interest. ###"

      "text": "Indicator : Nitrate in ground water\n\nRationale: Ground water is a vital source of drinking water for more than 75 percent of Minnesotans and 98 percent of the state's nearly 1,000 community water systems.\n\nAbout this indicator: Less than half a percent of public water supply systems in Minnesota had average nitrate-nitrogen concentrations above the drinking water standard during a two-year period from 1999 to 2000. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has established a public drinking water standard for nitrate-nitrogen (nitrate) concentrations at 10 parts per million (ppm). Nitrate in water poses a health threat, especially to infants, and is used nationally as an indicator of overall water quality. Many experts consider nitrate levels above one part per million to be a sign of human influence on water quality. Sources of nitrate include fertilizer, crop residue, manure, septic systems and deposits from the atmosphere.\n\nTwenty-eight public water supply systems, or less than half a percent of Minnesota's 8,121 public water supply systems, had average nitrate-nitrogen concentrations above the drinking water standard in 1999-2000. Public water supply systems include both community and non-community systems. Community systems supply drinking water for more than 15 connections or 25 residents year-round. Non-community water systems, such as for schools, factories, hospitals, restaurants, and the like serve at least 15 connections used by people other than year-round residents for 60 days a year or 25 or more people for at least 60 days a year.\n\nNearly one-fourth of Minnesota's population relies on private wells as a primary source of drinking water. Local water quality databases, developed by counties such as Nicollet, Brown, and Cottonwood in the southwestern part of the state, indicate that the statewide database for public water supply wells does not accurately reflect nitrate-nitrogen concentrations for private water wells. This is because wells installed by the homeowner (such as sand points), those installed before the state well code went into effect in 1974, and hand-dug wells with large diameters are not included in statewide databases. According to data from these counties, about 5 percent of the private wells in Nicollet County, 12 percent of the private wells in Brown County, and 27 percent of the private wells in Cottonwood County have average nitrate-nitrogen concentrations above the drinking water standard of 10 parts per million. However, if wells of questionable construction (i.e., wells less than 50 feet in depth and with diameters 10 inches or greater) are excluded, the percentage of unacceptable nitrate-nitrogen concentrations drops to 3 percent for Nicollet and Brown counties and to 11 percent for Cottonwood County.\n\nThings to think about: The data from Nicollet, Brown and Cottonwood counties suggest the value of localized water quality tracking. Data from the three counties also provides evidence that Minnesota's well construction code is effective, since wells that do not meet code requirements are responsible for most of the problems.\n\nNitrate contamination is more frequent in wells that are poorly constructed or sited. In addition, some areas are more susceptible to nitrate contamination because geologic conditions, such as sandy soil, allow nitrate to seep into the ground more easily or the chemical makeup of the groundwater does not break down nitrate.\n\nTechnical notes: This indicator was calculated for public water supply systems where the average nitrate-nitrogen concentrations for all the wells for each system were fairly consistent (within one standard deviation). Results for 440 public water supply systems were excluded because the results were not as consistent between sampling events or because the system used various wells with diverse water quality. Eight of the 28 public water supply systems with average nitrate results above the drinking water standard are no longer active. None of these 28 public water supply systems are community systems."

      "text": "Comparatively Speaking: Water Content vs. Water Activity\n\nBy: Anthony J. O'Lenick, Jr., Siltech LLC\n\nPosted: December 29, 2010\n\nSidebars\n\nThis topic of water content and water activity should be of interest to all formulators interested in product safety and stability. It is a concept associated with preservation and one often discussed by industry expert David Steinberg.\n\nWater content refers to the sum of all the water either added to, or introduced with raw materials in, a formulation. The analytical method to assess water content is a titration method that was established in 1935 by Karl Fischer (see Karl Fischer Titration).\n\nWater activity or aw is different from water content in both a qualative and quantative way. First, it is a ratio of the vapor pressure of a liquid divided by that of pure water at the same temperature. Pure distilled water has a water activity of 1.00 (unitless). Second, the value in formulations is rarely 1.00. This means the ingredients in the formulation interact with the water content, altering how that water interacts with the air above the sample.\n\nWater migrates from areas of high aw to areas of low aw. For example, if honey (aw ≈ 0.6) is exposed to humid air (aw ≈ 0.7), it will absorb water from the air.\n\nThis is of interest to the formulator since it is water activity, not water content, that is most important to preservation. Most bacteria cannot grow at an aw below 0.9; yeasts cannot grow at an aw below 0.85; and molds cannot grow at an aw below 0.7. So-called dehydrated foods have aw lower than 0.61."

Which is the main reason the citizens are upset (well, that and the fact they're stealing their drinking water), they got absolutely no say so in whether or not the company was allowed in.\n\nI don't know if most people know, but the majority of bottled water, is actually not from springs or natural sources, it's from \"municipal sources\" aka Tap Water. That's right, that yummy bottle of Dasani you're drinking right now, tap water. Except you paid 19 times what tap water actually cost. In fact, a bottle of water cost the company about 1-2 cent to produce. You paid, what $1.50 or so for that? Yeah, no mark up there.\n\nThe other thing most people don't realize is no one really monitors the bottled water industry. They're self-regulated. Which means they do all their own testing, and don't really have to show the reports to anyone. They may test every day or two, whereas municipal water sources are highly regulated and test their water many times a day to ensure it's safety. In most cases, tap water is actually safer for you than bottled water. Making you re-think that bottle of water right now, huh?\n\nHow many of these are YOU responsible for?\n\nNot only is the safety of the bottle water addressed, along with environmental concerns, but also the ethics of the 3 big bottled water companies. Nestle, Coke and Pepsi. Remember a few years ago when we were in a really severe drought so there were mandatory conservation measures put in place? You couldn't water your lawn or wash your car? Well guess what? The big 3, were still bottling water from municipal sources. So, while you couldn't use water, it was perfectly okay for them too? Even when lake levels were massively low from drought, they just kept pumping away.\n\nPart of the other obvious problem with bottled water is…well the bottle. First off the bottles leach dangerous chemicals that have been found to cause cancer, diabetes and obesity. So while you're drinking water to lose weight, it could actually be causing you to gain weight. The other problem with the bottles are the fact that they are using oil in refineries to make the plastic. (Sounds healthy, huh?) It's especially scary for the residents who live near these refineries that experience major health problems from the fumes and chemicals these oil companies are pumping in the air.\n\nI felt especially bad for a Corpus Christi, TX resident that the movie interviewed. He was explaining that there are battles you fight to win, and then other battles you start that you know you're going to lose. So he chooses not to fight. That pains me. No, chances are he won't win, but maybe that lost battle will help us win the war on oil and bottled water companies.\n\nAnother issue with the bottles is, well, they have to end up somewhere…and normally that's not in the recycling bin. The world rate of recycling bottled water containers is 50%. Doesn't sound all too shabby, huh? Well, sadly in the US that rate is only 20%. That's right, we're such a huge world power, rich and can afford to pay 19 times the price of water, yet, we don't recycle? Aren't we just spoiled brats that squander away what's given to us? There are a few solutions to this problem. Several states require deposits on water bottles, and those states with a 5 cent deposit see a recycling rate of 70%! Raise that deposit to 10 cent and it goes up to 97%! Sadly only a handful of states have bottle deposits. Why? Because manufacturers fight tooth and nail to not have to do deposits. They see it as an encroachment on their profit, which as we've already seen is astronomical so a few lost pennies really shouldn't be such a big deal, right? The bottled water companies do \"encourage recycling\" but they want people to use curbside recycling. Which, usually is funded by tax payers, so the company gets to look good without spending a penny. As a wrote in another post about curbside recycling, there's several problems with that. The main one being that 50% of Americans don't have access to curbside recycling. Yep, 50%!\n\nWhere are your water bottles ending up?\n\nSadly most plastic bottles actually end up in our world's oceans. These are very fragile ecosystems that support a huge majority of the earth's life. And sadly we're losing them because of bottled water. Do you remember learning about plankton in school? Those super little tiny organisms that are feed on by whales? And we're taught how numerous they are? Well, right now in certain parts of the oceans, there is actually more plastic than plankton. How's that for scary?\n\nI only had one major issue in this film. They kept blaming the bottled water companies. Yes, they need to be blamed, but 99% of the blame needs to be laid on consumers. If you don't buy it, they won't produce it. They produce it because it's huge profits and people pay it. From a business stand point, it's genius!\n\nThe movie does also make the point that in some situations bottled water is a much needed necessity. Natural disasters, third world countries where clean water isn't available. But in normal, every day American activity it should really have no place."

They will publish their findings in Environmental Pollution.\n\nThe system--safer, cheaper and simpler to use than many other methods--breaks down a range of toxic chemicals. While the method cleans the water, it doesn't yet make the water drinkable. However, the method may eventually prove critical for limiting the spread of disease at disaster sites around the world.\n\n\"After the disaster of Hurricane Katrina, scientists have had their backs against the wall trying to develop safeguards,\" said Shah. \"No one knows when a similar situation may arise. We need to develop a treatment for decontaminating flood water before it either comes in contact with humans or is pumped into natural reservoirs.\"\n\nThe treatment system that the researchers are developing is simple: a polymer sheet of resins containing copper is immersed in the contaminated flood water. The addition of hydrogen peroxide generates free radicals on the polymer. The free radicals remain bound to the sheet, where they come in contact with bacteria and kill them.\n\nThe researchers are working to lower the amount of copper in the treated water end product and improving the system's impact on chemical toxins.

In our attempts to be more healthy and drink more water, several of us spend thousands of dollars a year on bottled water and other pricey filtration systems. Another growing trend to give ourselves the best water possible is the installation of a water softener.\n\nMany people believe that hard water, which is generally full of certain minerals such as calcium and magnesium, is bad for them. They want better tasting water that will also give them a much more rich lather when they shower. While a water softener will definitely provide a homeowner with a better lather, they should really weigh the pros and cons before choosing to install one. They may find that a rich lather isn't worth the additional costs at both your health's and wallet's expense.\n\nThe Health Factor\n\nWhile many believe that soft water tastes better, that doesn't necessarily mean that it is better for you. In fact, soft water is often stripped of many beneficial minerals including calcium and magnesium, which your body needs to function naturally. However, this isn't the worst of it.\n\nWater that is processed using traditional water softeners must be run through iodized salt in order to make it softer. That iodized salt often increases the amount of sodium in your water, which ultimately increases your sodium intake. While a bit of salt is good for you, too much can lead to other conditions such as hypertension and high blood pressure.\n\nThe Costs\n\nIn addition to lacking minerals and extra salt, traditional water softeners also lead to pipe corrosion due to the large amounts of salt they use. So not only will you have to pay for regular maintenance and salt, but you can expect to have to replace your plumbing as well – which isn't exactly cheap.\n\nWe all want great tasting and healthy water, but that doesn't mean that you should have to pay an arm and a leg for it. Sometimes the best water can come right from your tap. However, if you find that your water really is too hard and is causing build up in your pipes or leading to poor tasting water, consider installing a salt-free water softener. These types of devices require very little maintenance and don't require you to pour pounds upon pounds of salt into your water regularly. They will soften your water, but without giving you the detriment of a diet high in sodium.\n\n2 Comments\n\nHard water may not taste so bad, but its effects can be unsightly around the house- and detrimental to your water heater and plumbing.\nElectronic hard water treatment systems, which are maintenance free, are ideal for your plumbing and your budget. Since, they require no salt, they do not corrode pipes, in fact- they descale them as well as the water heater- which provides up to a 40% reduction in heating costs. You save money every month and no longer have to buy and lug heavy bags of salt.\nScalewatcher holds the original patent on the technology, and Aqua Genesis, their #1 Distributor in North America offers a 1 Year Money Back Guarantee.\nFind them at: aquagenesisusa.com\n\nI wasn't able to realized such until I read this article, atleast now I have some knowledge on hard waters .

Using the flowing motion of water and centrifugal force, a portable device uses the method, hydrodynamic separation, to split up waste particles, eliminating the need for a filtration barrier.\n\nJoin the conversation!Posted by arnoldmiller007\n\n30th Nov 2010\n\nJust InRE: PARC: Purifying water through movementTranscript\n\nMusic\n\n>> Meng Lean: My name is Meng Lean. I'm the Principle Scientist and project leader for the PARC's Clean Water Effort.\n\nMusic\n\n>> Meng Lean: I'm hoping that the invention that we have created will have a significant impact on the way that we do water purification in the future. It's called hydro dynamic separation. The concept here is to be able to use a very simple idea where we understand the way that water moves and based on thge water motion we can actually separate out particles and in that aspect, totally eliminate the requirement of the use of a filter. Today we will demonstrate how we can take a very highly concentrated wastewater and run it through our spiral separator and produce a concentrated waste stream and a clean affluent stream. The way it works is that we have to understand the motion of water, how it flows, so to be able to use the way the water moves down the co-channel, it generates a centrifugal force. You only use a centrifugal force generator to create a very precise flow pattern of the water. And it's that flow pattern that sweeps the suspended particles and move them to a position where there's a force minimum. This device has many, many applications. I really believe that it is really well positioned for supplying water to small communities. So 85 percent of water communities in the United States support a few thousand people. So this would be ideal. In terms of drinking water, I think it's highly regulated, but there are other areas, for example, desalination, where the urgency to create potable water is just emerging. And I think that's an area which is much more open to novel and new solutions"

Rinse: If switching between very low and very high ppm water,\nalways rinse the probes with distilled water to avoid any build-up. Are TDS meters really conductivity meters?\nYes. While EC and TDS are often used synonymously, there are some\nimportant differences to note. EC, when applied to water, refers to the\nelectrical charge of a given water sample. TDS refers to the total\namount of substances in the water other than the pure H2O. The only true\nway of measuring TDS is to evaporate the water and weigh what's left.\nSince this is near impossible to do for the average person, is it\npossible to estimate the TDS level by measuring the EC of the water.\nEvery digital TDS meter in the world is actually an EC meter.\nCopyright HM Digital"

      "text": "Keys to Using Grey Water for External Uses\n\nWhen you are washing the car or watering your garden, is fresh drinking water a requirement? Of course it isn't, which is why many Australian residents are using rain water tanks to retain their used household water for other purposes, helping to alleviate some of the strain on the local water supply and lowering their own utility bills. Anytime you are considering the use of \"grey water\", remember that there are elements to the process that must be adhered by to ensure the safety of your plants and the avoidance of toxic chemicals in the soil! Understanding Grey Water Grey water is any water used in the house for purposes like showering or washing clothes. The water is safe for horticultural use, though it must be filtered of the detergents or chemicals that are used during these practices. Grey water MUST NOT BE USED FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION! With this exception in mind, just about everything else is fair game, so understanding the nature of grey water and how it should be handled can help to save you plenty of money and reduce the amount of city water your property requires. Properly Filtering Your Reclaimed Water Also known as \"reclaimed water\", grey water provides the perfect opportunity to reuse water for your irrigation needs. A filtration system is the key! Multi-layered filter systems are the perfect way to remove the toxins from this water before it ever reaches your garden or the ground. By pushing all of the grey water through sand filters and a grease trap, you can remove the oils, soaps, and other toxins that will do much more harm than good to your garden. The Prevalence of Grey water Usage Australian rain water tanks are the first step toward creating a self-sustaining water system on your property. We have already seen cities across the world use grey water for golf course irrigation, localized gardening areas, and watering recreation parks. They often use a color-coded system that reminds visitors that the water coming from the sprinkler systems is not safe to drink. Your filtered grey water must fall under the same category, so be sure that everyone in the area knows that the system is pumping out water that is not intended for human consumption. Reducing the Strain on Your Septic System Many homes have a self-sufficient septic tank system that filters the water used for future uses. Rain water tanks and the systems associated with them operate in much the same manner. And, because septic systems can be costly to repair or replace, many residents are finding it helpful to relieve some of the stress on the system by getting their irrigation or car washing water from another source. This source, of course, being the reclaimed water from their own home usages. Save your septic system by lending it a helping hand with slimline water tanks. Many Australian residents are just now learning about water restrictions, which have increased the demand for self-sufficient rain water tanks and have expanded the uses that many of us take advantage of. Collecting your household grey water and reusing it for many other outdoor activities has helped to slow the drain that we are experiencing on our nation's clean drinking water. Because so many residents enjoy maintaining gardens or would like to clean their cars each weekend, it is important that new ways to harvest and reuse water enter the forefront of our minds. Purchasing a tank, making the necessary connections between the home's water system and the holding area, and properly filtering the grey water to make it safe for reuse can ensure that future generations enjoy the same clean water that many take for granted today. The Tank Factory is a provider of premium quality Australian-made rain water tanks at affordable prices. Some of our most popular poly tanks include a wide range of round tanks, slimline tanks and underground tanks\n\nAbout Watertankfactory\n\nWater restrictions are taking a toll on the routine water practices of many Australians, but there are ways to circumvent the legislation and still have enough water to take care of your flowerbeds or garden. Now, we aren't talking about a means of undermining the spirit of the regulations, but instead, are considering the use of rainwater tanks. Used to capture natural rainfall and store it for future use, these additions can save a household money and frustration when looking to capitalize on periods of heavy downpour. To better select the right tank for your needs, remember a few key points of emphasis that will impact the effectiveness of its implementation."

      "text": "Yes, I have heard the same thing, too -- from various sources. They say that distilled water is actually almost like a toxin to our bodies in that it does leach out nutrients because water will always try balance itself out with your minerals in your body. The best water -- according to the guy who made the documentary \"Food Matters\" and \"Hungry for Change\" -- is spring water (if you can find it). Supposedly because it has already filtered through rocks and has acquired mineralization on its own. Claims that this is the type of water that is most supportive to our human physiology -- and calls distilled water unnatural. Of course, distilled water is very valuable for applications in science and industry, but when it comes to drinking water, it may not be the best.\n\nI do not know much about the PH discussion on water, except to say that I thought water was supposed to be neutral. High alkalinity in water could be potentially dangerous, specially for people who are not acidic (like fruitarians) -- depending on what your own PH really -- in that it could lead to alkalosis if it is made unnaturally too high.\n\nWrong. \"They\" are wrong. Distilled water is a toxin - therefore Doug Graham recommends it? That makes a lot of sense.\n\nThe mineral leach crap originated from companies that sell filters, remineralization solutions, and my favorite, \"mineral water.\" The guy who made that documentary is wrong too, by the way.\n\nThe minerals in water that has \"filtered through\" (been contaminated by) rock are inorganic minerals. Crushed rocks. Not only are these incredibly hard to the body to absorb and use, they are toxic in that they contribute to ossification of the brain and joints. Natural Hygiene texts are clear as water when it comes to this issue: Inorganic minerals are a toxin.\n\nSince \"back to nature\" explanation often helps: Humans are \"meant\" to get most of their water from juicy fruits. The next best water is RAINWATER (i.e. distilled water.) Unfortunately, most rainwater is heavily polluted so we have to make our own in a distiller which mimicks the water cycle. The next best is glacial runoff collected close to the point of melting, since the inorganic minerals may at that point may only be in suspension, not in solution, so the sediment will settle to the bottom yielding essentially pure water.\n\nInorganic minerals are a toxin. Organic minerals are found in fruits and vegetables. Spring water has not been \"filtered,\" it has been contaminated. Pure water is the next best thing to water from juicy fruits. Since rainwater is polluted, distilled water is optimal.\n\nHow can distilled water be \"unnatural\" if rainwater is (ideally) unpolluted distilled water? That's like a poorly applied reverse appeal to nature fallacy.\n\nContaminated? lol. Frankly, it stand to reason that we are more adapted to drinking mineralized water because it is the water that our ancestors evolved to drink -- distilled water did not exist. Obviously we are here to return to our roots and eat the foods we are meant to eat (and drink) -- distilled water wasn't one of them. Of course, since fruits and vegetables do provide lots of minerals, what minerals water attracts to itself (from your body), are probably being easily replenished. This discussion is kind of moot if you are a fruitarian in that sense -- but it is interesting. Unfortunately, I do not have a natural spring near me or I would drink it -- you can drink right from it with no additional filtration, boiling or concern.\n\nYou obviously did not read my entire post. Distillation mimicks the water cycle. Rainwater is essentially distilled. So your point that distilled water did not exist is \"moot\".\n\nAlso, our ancestors did not evolve to drink any particular water. Humans are not a water-drinking species. We drink water when we need to but we lack the physiology that most water-drinking animals have.\n\n\"Why does Dr Graham recommend eating fruits and vegetables? My co worker is giving me an earful about how it will lead to an protein deficiency.\"\n\nThe lesson here is NOT that one should unquestionably swallow everything that emanates from Dr. Graham's mouth. The lesson here is that one should LEARN their lesson after punching their way through so many fallacies/misinformations regarding a healthy lifestyle. Chocolate's good, chocolate's bad. A study says people who drink alcohol regularly have longer lifespans. My mom says I will get a potassium overdose. Etc etc etc. My mom didn't actually say that though.\n\nSo while we should question everything Dr. Graham says, we should also recognize his track record for giving us good advice (advice that commonly goes \"against the grain\" and against the little tidbits and soundbytes and pet theories that everyone has about everything from red meat to distilled water). So if he says something is good for you, and someone else says something is really bad and will leach minerals from you, you should do some reading. Even if what they say sounds vaguely scientific or scary. Or, do what you did here and ask the community. Good job!\n\nA few things I forgot, that are common anti-rainwater talking points:\n\n-Distilled water only has the capability to leach inorganic minerals, which you obviously do not need as they are rocks, not food\n\n-There is no such thing as \"living\" or \"dead\" water, as some people claim that boiling water \"kills\" it. Water is an inert substance. It is impossible to ascribe any qualities of life to it; doing so is simply a poetic device (personification.) All water in existence has at some point in the history of the cosmos been boiled, converted to other substances, frozen, etc.\n\nWater is indeed a \"magical\" substance. Its properties are very intriguing -- its solid form is less dense than its liquid -- it can actually float on itself. It is the universal solvent -- it can be soft and soothing and when frozen it can rip right through steal and concrete. There is no other substance quite like it. People boil water not to kill it -- but to kill the bacteria and parasites that can survive in it. Yes water can leach inorganic materials, but this is certainly a concern since our bodies do need these inorganic materials to support life -- calcium being a main one. We cannot say that we can do without calcium and it is mineral. It is not just a useless piece of rock.\n\nRainwater is certainly good water -- except if it is acid rain, then it's not so good.\n\nYou are wrong. We do not need inorganic minerals. Organic minerals are minerals that are living; have been assimilated into living plant tissue.\n\nThe word \"calcium\" could refer to an inorganic or an organic form of calcium. You are assuming that minerals only exist in an inorganic form, which is an incorrect assumption and this can be verified by opening a chemistry textbook.\n\nSo inorganic calcium is a useless piece of rock, to us. To plant it is a life-giving mineral. The plant assimilates it and then it is in its organic form, which we can use.\n\nI decided to do the math once. I found the mineral content of a popular brand of spring water, and compared it to the mineral content of greens. Depending on the mineral, it turned out that a gallon of spring water is equivalent to anywhere between one hundredth and one half of a medium lettuce leaf. So if you're worried about distilled water leaching minerals from your body (presuming you drink about half a gallon of distilled water a day), just eat an extra quarter of a lettuce leaf each day, and you're covered. This leaching argument is silly."

      "text": "It's Time To Talk About Water – Again\n\nThe blog It's Time To Talk About Water discussed the variations in water from different sources. Today's blog is the start of a series on how to purify and prepare water for use in cleaning and rinsing applications.\n\nWater from municipal and other sources may have characteristics that are deleterious to a variety of processes. Many of us have been introduced to this concept by the proliferation of water purifying products that are available from local water \"specialists\" (I won't do a commercial here but you know who I mean) as well as grocery, department and specialty stores. The popularity of bottled water also attests to the fact that water isn't always what it should be. Interestingly, I can remember my Aunt Blanche collecting rain water in a barrel, not to water her plants, but to wash her hair! So even in ancient times (with apologies to my Aunt Blanche – RIP) people noticed that there were differences in water.\n\nThe following is a list of some of characteristics of water that can contribute to the success or failure of a cleaning process.\n\n1) Insoluble Particles – Although we seldom aware of it, most water from municipal supplies, wells and other sources brings with it suspended particles. These particles are finely divided minerals, metals and other materials which contribute to both the chemical and physical properties of the water. Insoluble particles collect in still water to cause sediment. In our town (and I assume other places as well), it is a bi-annual ritual to flush the water mains by opening fire hydrants. This causes a temporarily increased flow of water in the water mains which sweeps collected sediment from the pipes.\n\nNote – The next two need a little introduction. A salt is a compound formed by reacting an acid with a base. For example, the reaction of hydrochloric acid (HCL) with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) forms sodium chloride (NaCl) and water (H2O). This one is pretty simple as all the chemical element components can be accounted for before and after the reaction as written above even by a non-chemist. Although we are all familiar with sodium chloride (simple table salt) there are hundreds of other \"salts\" formed by the reaction of various acids with various bases. Since one product of the formation of salts is often water, it is only natural that dissolved salts are commonly found in water. Just a little bit of acid and a little bit of a base would be difficult to avoid completely – especially in nature.\n\n2) Water Soluble Salts - These salts are readily soluble in water. When left behind by the evaporation of water containing them in a dissolved form, their residues can be easily removed by the application of more water. As a result, the residues from these salts, do not build up over time. Re-wetting them will cause them to re-dissolve.\n\n3) Water \"Insoluble\" Salts – This is the stuff that leaves what are commonly called \"calcium\" or \"lime\" deposits in sinks, faucets, toilets, etc. where water repeatedly evaporates leaving them behind. It may seem a little contradictory to call these contaminants \"insoluble\" since they obviously got into the water somehow. In fact, they are \"semi\" soluble. Water, often known as the \"universal solvent\" will dissolve almost anything given enough time. Water collects these contaminants from the earth over a period of years or millennia. Unfortunately, if they dry on parts during the cleaning process and return to their only semi-soluble crystalline form, we don't have the luxury of waiting another millennia for them to dissolve in water again.\n\nSomething to think about – How does the above apply to the formation of stalactites and stalagmites? Would they form if the dripping water only contained what we call water-soluble salts?\n\n4) Other Dissolved Solids – Although the majority of dissolved solids are salts, there are other things that can be dissolved in water including gasses, other liquids and even a number of solids.\n\n5) Bugs – \"Bugs\" is a not-so-affectionate term applied to living organisms, both animal and vegetable, or their remains which are commonly found in water. Unfortunately, water, and even some chemistry, provides the ideal environment for their proliferation. Aside from the obvious consequences of the wrong bugs entering living organisms (like humans) there are other effects which are less than contributory to the success of many processes including cleaning and rinsing.\n\nThe above list, I realize, is far from all-inclusive as any number of other contaminants can be found suspended, emulsified in or dissolved in water. It does, however, comprise a working \"HOT\" list for contaminants of consequence found in water used in cleaning. Upcoming blogs will explain how to detect and remove, counteract or control a number of contaminants commonly found in water."

      "text": "Quality\n\nThe source for all Village water supply is Lake Michigan. The water treatment process is done at the City of Chicago's Jardine Water Purification Plant. Lombard then purchases its water from the DuPage Water Commission (DWC). Lombard Water Treatment is responsible for the lake water receiving stations, pumping facilities and all water quality sampling. In the year 2003, a total of 1,576,819,000 gallons of water were pumped from the four receiving stations, averaging 4,256,000 gallons per day. The Village also maintains four wells for emergency purposes and they are pumped off regularly to ensure that they will be ready if needed. DuPage Water Commission\n\nYes. In Illinois, the Department of Public Health requires the addition of fluoride to potable water to provide children with the proper dental healthcare. Fluoride in drinking water is primarily absorbed into the blood stream and deposited on the teeth of children up to the age of about 8. Department of Public Health\n\nChlorine is added to drinking water for several reasons. First and foremost, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and the United State Environmental Protection Agency require that all water plants disinfect the water. The Chicago Water Department Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC). Second, a minimal amount of chlorine is added to assure that the water remains safe as it travels from the treatment plant to your home. A few individuals, who are sensitive to chlorine, can detect the chlorine taste and odor at these low levels.\n\nAs with most products, some filters works better than others and some do not work at all. There are many types of filters available, each type works differently and will remove different substances from the water. It will be very helpful for you to know exactly why you want to filter the water before you speak to the seller of water-treatment devises. If you choose to filter your water, there are several resources available to you to assist you in choosing a filter that works properly and will meet your needs. Consumer Reports Magazine occasionally will compare types of water filters and explain which types remove which constituents. The National Sanitation Foundation provides a guide on How to select the right water treatment device for your home or your business.\n\nPlease note: If you do install a water filter, follow the operating and maintenance instructions very carefully. An improperly installed and/or maintained filter can adversely affect the water quality. The water provided by the Village of Lombard meets all State and Federal drinking water standards.\n\nServices for water testing are available from private laboratories for a fee. This fee varies greatly depending on the number of constituents you would like tested for in the water. To obtain a booklet of qualified laboratories call the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, Division of Laboratories, at (217) 782-6455.\n\nThe Village of Lombard Water Division typically receives an increase in taste and odor complaints during the summer months when water temperatures increase. The numbers to taste and odor complaints have increased dramatically during the last few years.\n\nMost complaints generally are that the water has an earthy, musty smell and taste. We believe the earthy, musty taste and odor of the drinking water is the result of compounds produced by blue-green algae and other vegetation found in Lake Michigan. Taste and odors may be more noticeable when the lake water gets warmer. Refrigerating the water will minimize the taste and odors. The presence of taste and odors does not affect the safety of the drinking water. The Chicago Water Department adds powdered activated carbon (PAC) to the water at the Jardine Water Purification Plant. The application rate of PAC is based upon the concentration of water vegetation and the number of taste and odor complaints.\n\nResidents are urged to contact the Village with any taste and odor complaints. They are forwarded to the DuPage Water Commission, who then logs them with the Jardine Plant. When there is a rise in complaints, they increase their treatment. But because of the distance, it takes approximately 24 hours for the DuPage Water Commission to receive the water. It then takes another 24 hours to get into our water supply. We also suggest residents refrigerate their drinking water. The decreased temperature helps alleviate the problem.\n\nDissolved minerals make water hard; as the amount of minerals in the water increases, the water becomes harder. Two common minerals found dissolved in drinking water are calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate. There is usually much more calcium carbonate than magnesium carbonate present in water; therefore, water hardness is reported as the amount of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) dissolved in the water. There are two units of measurement for hardness commonly used in the United States, grains per gallon and milligrams per liter calcium carbonate (mg/L as CaCO3). The conversion factor is 17.1 mg/L as CaCO3 = 1 grain per gallon. Our water is about 8 grains per gallon or 137 mg/L as CaCO3. When we were on wells our average well water hardness was 29 grains per gallon or 496 mg/L as CaCO3.\n\nWater softening is the process of removing the minerals from the water and is commonly accomplished by either reverse osmosis filtration or ion exchange. Reverse osmosis filtration units can handle only small volumes of water and is usually performed at a single point of use, such as the kitchen sink. Ion exchange units can handle large volumes of water and are usually installed on the incoming water supply line to a property. Ion exchange systems exchange sodium ions for the calcium and magnesium ions in the water. Medical studies show that people who live in areas with hard water have reduced occurrences of cardiovascular illness compared to people who live in areas with soft water. You should consult your physician before making artificially softened water your primary source of drinking water.\n\nLombard strives to deliver a consistent, high quality, drinking water. Many steps must be taken to attain this goal. Daily monitoring and water testing is conducted at all four receiving stations. Numerous water samples are collected throughout the Village during the year to meet State and Federal water quality requirements.\n\nYes. Your drinking water contains disinfectants to inhibit bacterial growth. These disinfectants can kill fish. The water supplied by the Village of Lombard contains chlorine. Adding the appropriate chemicals, which are available at most pet stores, can neutralize chlorine. Chlorine can also be removed with a granular activated carbon (GAC) water filter. Chlorine can also be removed from the water by letting a container of the water sit exposed to the atmosphere (uncovered) for at least 48 hours. Some fish, particularly tropical fish and Koi, are also sensitive to rapid changes in the temperature and pH of the water - even small changes. If you are going to change the water in an aquarium or pond, or add a significant amount of new water, consult an experienced fish care expert for tips on how to accomplish this without shocking or killing your fish. Some people may be concerned that water harmful to fish might not be safe for them to drink. This concern is not necessary. Humans and fish use water in very different ways. When humans drink water, the chlorine is neutralized by our digestive system before it enters our bloodstream. When fish \"breathe\" water, any chlorine present enters their bloodstream directly. This interferes with the fish's ability to take oxygen from the water and can cause the fish to suffocate."

      "text": "If you've ever ingested unclean water, you probably already know the terrible effects it can render on the human body. Some of the most common side effects from drinking unclean water include dysentery, cholera, typhoid, fluorosis, malaria, etc. If left untreated, these side effects easily lead to death. In virtually all unexpected catastrophes, clean drinking water won't be available so it's critical to understand how to purify your drinking water.\n\nThe best water storage plan in the world won't be of any use if you're away from home when disaster strikes.\n\nWith some methods of water storage such as a 55 gallon outdoor rain barrel, you'll also need to purify the water if you intend to use it for drinking, cooking, or hygienic purposes. If possible, it's always best to purify water by using two or more purification and disinfection methods to get the cleanest water possible.\n\nBoiling\n\nObviously the most common method of purifying water in an emergency situation is boiling it. Boiling water can kill harmful pathogens. Boiling won't remove any debris or sediment, so it's a good idea to first strain the water you're boiling using a coffee filter, cheesecloth, or some type of clean, porous material to strain unwanted sediment. Boiling won't remove chemicals like mercury, lead, etc., nor will it remove toxic metals or nitrates that may have contaminated the water. To purify water via the boiling method, simply bring the water to a boil for one minute. Afterward, ensure the water is covered while it cools off. The primary disadvantages of boiling water is the energy required to bring the water to a boil (especially if the electricity's out) and the fact that it doesn't remove chemicals, nitrates, and toxic metals.\n\nFiltration\n\nFiltration systems are another viable option used to treat and purify water. Leaders in the market such as Berkey Water Filtration Systems not only filter harmful contaminants such as Cryptosporidium, Giardia, E. Coli, Vibro Cholerae, Salmonella, etc., but also are a great value because there ceramic filters can be cleaned and reused. Unlike boiling water which doesn't address issues such as foul odor or taste, a Berkey system uses ceramic or carbon filters (depending on the model) which contains a carbon core\nto reduce bad taste and odors. In addition, these filters also remove many types of chemicals such as herbicides, pesticides, etc.\n\nChemical Treatments\n\nFinally, the last method of water purification this article will address is chemical treatment methods. By far, the most common chemical methods are chlorine and iodine. Chemical treatments are most effective when combined with boiling water first and then treating the water after it has cooled. The portability of chlorine or iodine tablets and powders make them attractive for scenarios in which you'll be traveling. Although they're a great supplement to have around, they're not the best option to rely on to purify our water storage.\n\nSummary\n\nIn closing, it's essential to have a firm understanding of how to not only store water, but also possess the knowledge and equipment to purify it. Never trust the cleanliness of water by its appearance. Even the most pristine mountain creek can be contaminated with chemicals and other harmful pathogens. Try and master at least two methods of purifying water before an unexpected event to not leave anything to chance Store action"

About 86 percent of the empty plastic water bottles in the United States land in the garbage instead of being recycled.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNew Food & Water Watch Report Highlights Problems with Bottled Water\n\nWashington, DC - Choosing tap water over bottled water is better for consumers' health, their pocketbooks, and the environment, according to a new report released today by Food & Water Watch. The report is being released on the heals of a San Francisco executive order banning the use of city funds for bottled water and a U.S. Conference of Mayors resolution to study problems with bottled water consumption.\n\nIn 2005, Americans spent $8.8 billion for almost 7.2 billion gallons of non-sparkling bottled water. Consumers drank even more in 2006, about 26 gallons per person. The bottled water industry spends billions on advertising that promises purity in a bottle while implying that tap water is somehow less safe, something that is simply not true, according to the report.\n\n\"Bottled water generally is no cleaner, or safer, or healthier than tap water. In fact, the federal government requires far more rigorous and frequent safety testing and monitoring of municipal drinking water,\" said Food & Water Watch Executive Director Wenonah Hauter. \"Rather than buying into this myth of purity in a bottle, consumers should drink from the tap.\"\n\n\"Utilities all over the country spend millions of dollars to deliver clean, safe, affordable water right to the kitchen sink,\" said Susan Leal, San Francisco Public Utilities Commission General Manager. \"Relying on bottles that use lots of energy to produce and are sometimes trucked or even flown thousands of miles and ultimately become a municipal solid waste problem just makes no sense,\" concluded Leal.\n\nBut just kicking the bottle in favor of the tap is not enough, says Food & Water Watch. Our nation's public water and sewer infrastructure is old and in the coming years will need billions of dollars of investment to maintain and further improve treatment, storage, and distribution. Each year we fall more than $20 billion short of what is needed to maintain our public water and sewage systems.\n\n\"It's time for Congress to establish a clean water trust fund that would give communities the financial help they need to invest in healthy and safe drinking water for every American and for future generations,\" Hauter said.\n\nThe United States maintains trust funds for highways, airports, and social security. Providing a dedicated funding stream for national priorities is sound public policy, explained Bill Holman, former executive director of the Clean Water Management Trust Fund and former secretary of the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources. \"The North Carolina Clean Water Management Trust Fund has sparked innovative, community-based solutions to protect and restore water resources in North Carolina. A national clean water trust fund would provide similar benefits,\" said Holman.\n\nFood & Water Watch is encouraging consumers to Take Back the Tap by choosing tap water over bottled water whenever possible and supporting increased funding for safe and affordable public tap water.\n\nI love You Food, I Thank You Food, I Respect You Food - I love You Water, I Thank You Water, I Respect You Water - I love You Air, I Thank You Air, I Respect You Air.\n\nWASHINGTON - Water, water everywhere and we are duped into buying it bottled.\n\nConsumers spend a collective $100 billion every year on bottled water in the belief--often mistaken, as it happens--that this is better for us than what flows from our taps, according to environmental think tank the Earth Policy Institute (EPI).\n\nFor a fraction of that sum, everyone on the planet could have safe drinking water and proper sanitation, the Washington, D.C.-based organization said this week.\n\nMembers of the United Nations have agreed to halve the proportion of people who lack reliable and lasting access to safe drinking water by the year 2015. To meet this goal, they would have to double the $15 billion spent every year on water supply and sanitation.\n\n''While this amount may seem large, it pales in comparison to the estimated $100 billion spent each year on bottled water,'' said EPI researcher Emily Arnold.\n\n''There is no question that clean, affordable drinking water is essential to the health of our global community,'' Arnold said. ''But bottled water is not the answer in the developed world, nor does it solve problems for the 1.1 billion people who lack a secure water supply. Improving and expanding existing water treatment and sanitation systems is more likely to provide safe and sustainable sources of water over the long term.''\n\nWorldwide, bottled water consumption surged to 154 billion liters (41 billion gallons) in 2004, up 57 percent from 98 billion liters in 1999, EPI said in a written analysis citing industry data. By one view, the consequences for the planet and for consumers' purses are horrifying.\n\n''Even in areas where tap water is safe to drink, demand for bottled water is increasing--producing unnecessary garbage and consuming vast quantities of energy,'' said Arnold. ''Although in the industrial world bottled water is often no healthier than tap water, it can cost up to 10,000 times more.'' At up to $2.50 per liter ($10 per gallon), bottled water costs more than gasoline in the United States.\n\nA close look at the multibillion-dollar bottled water industry renewed Arnold's affection for the faucet.\n\nTap water comes to us through an energy-efficient infrastructure whereas bottled water must be transported long distances--and nearly one-fourth of it across national borders--by boat, train, airplane, and truck. This ''involves burning massive quantities of fossil fuels,'' Arnold said. By way of example, in 2004 alone, a Helsinki company shipped 1.4 million bottles of Finnish tap water 4,300 kilometers (2,700 miles) to Saudi Arabia. And although 94 percent of the bottled water sold in the United States is produced domestically, some Americans import water shipped some 9,000 kilometers from Fiji and other faraway places to satisfy demand for what Arnold termed ''chic and exotic bottled water.''\n\nMore fossil fuels are used in packaging the water. Most water bottles are made with polyethylene terephthalate, a plastic derived from crude oil. ''Making bottles to meet Americans' demand for bottled water requires more than 1.5 million barrels of oil annually, enough to fuel some 100,000 U.S. cars for a year,'' Arnold said.\n\nWorldwide, some 2.7 million tons of plastic are used to bottle water each year.\n\nOnce it has been emptied, the bottle must be dumped. According to the Container Recycling Institute, 86 percent of plastic water bottles used in the United States become garbage or litter. Incinerating used bottles produces toxic byproducts such as chlorine gas and ash containing heavy metals tied to a host of human and animal health problems. Buried water bottles can take up to 1,000 years to biodegrade.\n\nOf the bottles deposited for recycling in 2004, the United States exported roughly 40 percent to destinations as far away as China--meaning that even more fossil fuels were burned in the process.\n\nMeanwhile, communities from near which the water came in the first place risk running dry.\n\nMore than 50 Indian villages have complained of water shortages after bottlers began extracting water for sale under Coca-Cola Co.'s Dasani label, EPI said.\n\n''Similar problems have been reported in Texas and in the Great Lakes region of North America, where farmers, fishers, and others who depend on water for their livelihoods are suffering from concentrated water extraction as water tables drop quickly,'' ''Arnold said.\n\nAll this, because many consumers associate bottled water with healthy living. More fool us.\n\n''Bottled water is not guaranteed to be any healthier than tap water. In fact, roughly 40 percent of bottled water begins as tap water; often the only difference is added minerals that have no marked health benefit,'' EPI said.\n\nFrance's Senate, it added, ''even advises people who drink bottled mineral water to change brands frequently because the added minerals are helpful in small amounts but may be dangerous in higher doses.'' To be sure, many municipal water systems have run afoul of government water quality standards--driving up demand for bottled water as a result. But according to the study, ''in a number of places, including Europe and the United States, there are more regulations governing the quality of tap water than bottled water.''\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sets more stringent quality standards for tap water than does the Food and Drug Administration for the bottled stuff, it added.\n\nAmericans drank 26 billion liters of bottled water in 2004, or roughly one eight-ounce glass per person every day. Mexico had the second highest consumption, at 18 billion liters. China and Brazil followed, at close to 12 billion liters each. Italy and Germany ranked fifth and sixth in consumption, downing just over 10 billion liters of bottled water each. Italians drank the most bottled water per person, at nearly 184 liters in 2004--more than two glasses per day. Mexico and the United Arab Emirates consumed 169 and 164 liters per person. Belgium and France followed, knocking back almost 145 liters annually. Spain ranked sixth, with 137 liters swallowed each year.\n\nSome of the fastest growth in bottled water consumption is taking place in poor countries, however.\n\nWith consumption per person increasing by 44-50 percent between 1999 and 2004, Lebanon and Mexico had among the fastest growth rates of the top 15 per-capita guzzlers, EPI said.\n\nIndian and Chinese people drank far less individually but collectively, the world's two most populous countries appear to have been on a bender. India swigged three times as much bottled water in 2004 as it did in 1999 and China, more than twice as much.\n\nIf individual Chinese consumers drank one-fourth the bottled water downed by the average American, EPI said, China would springboard over the United States and become the world's largest consumer"

      "text": "Water treatment can be\ndefined as any procedure or method used to alter the chemical composition or\nnatural \"behavior\" of a water supply. Water supplies are classified as\neither surface water or groundwater. The majority of public or municipal water\ncomes from surface water such as rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. The majority of\nprivate water supplies consist of groundwater pumped from wells.\n\nMUNICIPAL OR UTILITY\nWATER TREATMENT\n\nMost municipal water found\nin a city or community today has been treated extensively. Specific water\ntreatment methods and steps taken by municipalities to meet local, state,\nnational, or international standards vary but are categorized below.\n\nScreen prefiltration A coarse screen, usually 50to 100 mesh (305to 140 microns), at the intake point of a surface water supply, removes\nlarge particulate matter to protect downstream equipment from clogging,\nfouling, or being damaged.\n\nClarification\nClarification is generally a multi-step process to reduce turbidity and\nsuspended matter. Steps include the addition of chemical coagulants or\npH-adjustment chemicals that react to form floc. The floc settles by gravity in settling tanks or is removed as\nthe water percolates through a gravity filter. The clarification process\neffectively removes particles larger than 25 microns. The clarification\nprocess is not 100% efficient; therefore, water treated through clarification\nmay still contain some suspended materials.\n\nLIME TREATMENT\n\nThe addition of lime (Ca)\nand soda ash (Na2CO3) reduces the level of calcium and\nmagnesium and is referred to as \"lime softening.\" The purpose of lime\nsoftening is to precipitate calcium and magnesium hydroxides (hardness) and\nthen clarify the water. The process is inexpensive but only marginally\neffective, usually producing water of 50 to 120 ppm (3 to 7gpg)\nhardness.\n\nDisinfection Disinfection is one of the most important steps to\nmunicipal water treatment. Usually, chlorine gas is fed into the supply after\nthe water has been clarified and/or softened. The chlorine kills bacteria. In\norder to maintain the \"kill potential\", an excess of chlorine is fed\ninto the supply to maintain a residual. The chlorine level must be constantly monitored\nto assure that no harmful levels of chloramines or chlorinated hydrocarbons\ndevelop.\n\npH adjustment\nMunicipal waters may be pH adjusted to a pH of approximately 7.5 to 8.0 to\nprevent corrosion of water pipes, particularly to prevent dissolution of lead\ninto the water supply. In the case of excessive alkalinity, the pH may be\nreduced by the addition of CO2.\n\nON-SITE\nTREATMENT\n\nAfter the water is\ndelivered from the utility or the well, there are many on-site options for\nfurther treatment to meet specific end-use requirements.\n\nChemical addition\n\npH adjustment. Certain chemicals, membranes,\nion exchange resins and other materials are sensitive to specific pH\nconditions. An example of this is to prevent acid corrosion in boiler feed\nwater by adjusting the pH so it is between 8.3 to 9.0.\n\nDispersants. Dispersants are added when scaling may be\nexpected due to concentration of specific ions in the stream. Dispersants\ndisrupt the scale formation, preventing growth of precipitate crystals.\n\nSequestering (chelating) agents. Sequestering agents are used\nto prevent the negative effects of hardness, preventing the deposition of\nCa, Mg, Fe, Mn and Al.\n\nOxidizing agents. Oxidizing agents have two\ndistinct functions: as a biocide, or to neutralize reducing agents.\n\nPotassium permanganate. Potassium permanganate (KMnO4)\nis a strong oxidizing agent used in many bleaching applications. It will\noxidize most organic compounds and is often used to oxidize ferrous iron\nto ferric for precipitation and filtration.\n\nReducing agents. Reducing agents, like sodium metabisulfite (Na2S2O5),\nare added to neutralize oxidizing agents such as chlorine or ozone. In\nmembrane and ion exchange systems, they prevent the degradation of certain\nmembranes or resins, which are sensitive to oxidizing agents.\n\nTank-type pressure\nfilters\n\nA typical filter consists\nof a tank to house the filter media and a valve or controller to direct the\nfilter through its various cycles–typically service, backwash and rinse.\n\nEasily the most critical aspect\nof pressure filter performance is the relationship of flow rates to filter\nmedia surface area. This relationship is the primary cause of failure or\ntrouble in filter systems. If problems develop, the most common reason is that\nmany filters are inaccurately \"sized\" for the job. Some examples of\npressure filters and their applications are:\n\n·Sand filters. Sand or other filtration\nmedia are used to remove turbidity. However, the location of the fine media on\ntop of the coarse media causes the sand filter to clog quite quickly and the\ncoarseness of sand allows many smaller impurities to pass through.\n\n·Oxidizing filters. Oxidizing filtersuse a\nmedium treated with oxides of manganese as a source of oxygen to oxidize and\nprecipitate iron, manganese, hydrogen sulfide, and others.\n\n·Activated carbon filters. Activated carbon (AC) is similar to\nion exchange resin in density and porosity. It absorbs low molecular weight\norganics and reduces chlorine or other halogens from water, but does not remove\nany salts. These filters must be changed periodically to avoid bacterial\ngrowth, but are not easily reactivated in the field. Accumulated solids require\nfrequent backwashing of the filter unless installed after reverse osmosis or ultrafiltration.\n\n·Dual- or multi-media filters. Dual-media filters remove suspended\nsolids to as low as 20 microns in size, but no dissolved solids. The top layer\nis a coarse anthracite followed by fine sand.\n\nPre-coat filters Usually with a media of diatomaceous earth, pre-coat\nfilters remove very small particulate matter, including some bacteria. They are\npractical only for limited volume applications but are common for swimming\npools, beverage plants, and small installations.\n\nCartridge filters\nCartridge filters can now be described two general ways: as depth filters or\nsurface filters.\n\n·Depth cartridge filters. In a\ndepth cartridge filter, the water flows through the thick wall of the filter\nwhere the particles are trapped throughout the complex openings in the media.\nThe filter may be constructed of cotton, cellulose, synthetic yarns or\n\"blown\" microfibers such as polypropylene.\nThe best depth filters have lower density on the outside and progressively\nhigher density toward the inside wall. The effect of this \"graded\ndensity\" is to trap coarser particles toward the outside of the wall and\nthe finer particles toward the inner wall. Depth cartridge filters are usually\ndisposable, cost-effective, and are in the particle range of 1 to 100 microns.\nGenerally, they are not an absolute method of purification since a small amount\nof particles within the micron range may pass into the filtrate.\n\n·Ultrafiltration\ncartridge filters. Point-of-use ultrafiltration cartridges\nare used to remove pyrogens and other macromolecular\ncompounds from ultrapure water. They are built in a\nspiral-wound configuration. This allows a crossflow\nmode of operation to help keep the surface clean.\n\nIon exchange systems An ion exchange system consists of a tank containing\nsmall beads of synthetic resin. The beads are treated to selectively adsorb\neither cations or anions and exchange certain ions\nbased on their relative activity compared to the resin. This process of ion\nexchange will continue until all available exchange sites are filled, at which\npoint the resin is exhausted and must be regenerated by suitable chemicals. ·Water softening. The ion exchange water softener is\none of the most common tools of water treatment. Its function is to remove\nscale-forming calcium and magnesium ions from hard water. In many cases soluble\niron (ferrous) can also be removed with softeners. A standard water softener\nhas four major components: a resin tank, resin, a brine tank, and a valve or\ncontroller. However, water softening is disadvantageous when high quality water\nis required since sodium ions will be present after the ion exchange process. · Demineralization/deionization.Ionexchange deionizers\n(Dl)use synthetic resins similar to those used in water softeners.\nTypically used on water that has already been prefiltered,\nDI uses a two-stage process to remove virtually all ionic material remaining in\nwater. Two types of synthetic resins are used, one to\nremove positively charged ions (cations) and another\nto remove negatively charged ions (anions). Resins have limited capacities and\nmust be regenerated upon exhaustion.\n\n· Two-bed and mixed-bed deionizers.Thetwo basic configurations of deionizers are two-bed and mixed-bed. Two-bed deionizers have separate tanks of cation\nand anion resins. In mixed-bed deionizers, the anion\nand cation resins are blended into a single tank or\nvessel. Generally, mixed-bed systems will produce higher quality water with a\nlower total capacity than two-bed systems.\n\nDeionization can produce extremely high-quality\nwater in terms of dissolved ions or minerals, but they do not generally remove\norganics and can become a breeding ground for bacteria.\n\nOrganic scavenging\nOrganic scavengers, or traps, are ion exchange resins that contain strong-base\nanion resin regenerated with sodium chloride brine. Since most naturally\noccurring organics have a slightly negative charge, they are absorbed by the\nanion resin. After the resin is loaded, the organics can be displaced by high\nconcentrations of Cl during regeneration.\n\nDistillation\nDistillation is the collection of condensed steam produced by boiling water.\nMost contaminants do not vaporize and, therefore, do not pass to the condensate\n(also called distillate).\n\nWith a properly designed\nstill, removal of both organic and inorganic contaminants, including biological\nimpurities and pyrogens, is attained. Distillation\ninvolves a phase change which, when properly carried out, removes all\nimpurities down to the range of 10 parts per trillion, producing water of\nextremely high purity.\n\nCareful temperature\nmonitoring is required to ensure purity and avoid contamination of the purified\nwater. Organics with a boiling point near that of water are very difficult to\nremove due to carry over into the vapor. In these situations a double\ndistillation system is often required for complete pyrogen\nremoval.\n\nElectrodialysis Electrodialysis (ED) and electrodialysis\nreversal (EDR) employ specially prepared membranes which are semipermeable to ions based on their charge, and they\nemploy electrical current to reduce the ionic content of water. Two flat sheet\nmembranes, one that preferentially permeates cations\nand the other anions, are stacked alternately with flow channels between them.\nCathode and anode electrodes are placed on each side of the alternating stack\nof membranes to draw most ions through the membranes. This leaves much lower\nconcentrations of ions in the water of the alternate channels. Recent\ndevelopments have improved the efficiency of ED by reversing the polarity of\nthe electrodes periodically. This is called EDR and has reduced the scaling and\nfouling problems common to ED.\n\nCrossflow filtration systems Crossflow (also called tangential flow) filtration is\nthe pressurized flow of the feedwater, or influent,\nacross a membrane, with a portion of the feed permeating the membrane and the\nbalance of the feed sweeping tangentially along the membrane to exit the system\nwithout being filtered. The filtered stream is called the \"permeate\",\nbecause it has permeated the membrane. The second stream is called the\n\"concentrate\" or \"reject\", because it carries off the\nconcentrated contaminants rejected by the membrane. Because the feed and\nconcentrate flow parallel to the membrane instead of perpendicular to it, the\nprocess is called \"crossflow\" or\n\"tangential flow.\" Depending on the size of the pores engineered into\nthe membrane, crossflow filters are effective in the\nrange of reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration and more recently microfiltration.\n\nCrossflow membrane filtration allows\ncontinuous removal of contaminants, which under normal filtration would\n\"blind\" (cover up) or plug the membrane pores very rapidly.\n\n·Reverse osmosis. Reverse osmosis (RO) was the first crossflow\nmembrane separation process to be widely commercialized. RO removes virtually\nall organic compounds and 90 to 99% of all ions. A large\nselection of reverse osmosis membranes are available to meet varying\nrejection requirements.\n\nRO can meet most water\nstandards with a single-pass system and the highest standards with a\ndouble-pass system. RO rejects 99.9+% of viruses, bacteria and pyrogens. Pressure, on the order of 200 to 1,000 psig (13.8\nto 68.9 bar), is the driving force of the RO purification process. It is much\nmore energy efficient compared to heat-driven purification (distillation) and\nmore efficient than the strong chemicals required for ion exchange. No\nenergy-intensive phase change is required.\n\n·Ultrafiltration.Ultrafiltration (UF) is a\nsimilar process to RO and NF, but is defined as a crossflow process that does\nnot reject ions. UF rejects contaminants in the range of 1000 dalton (10\nangstrom) to 0.1 micron particles. Because of the larger pore size in the\nmembrane, UF requires a much lower operating pressure: 10 to 100 psig (0.7 to\n6.9 bar). UF removes organics, bacteria, and pyrogens while allowing most ions\nand small organics, such as glucose, to permeate the porous structure.\n\n·Microfiltration.Microfiltration (MF) membranes are absolute filters\ntypically rated in the 0.1 to 2 micron range. Traditionally available in\npolymer or metal membrane discs or pleated cartridge filters, microfiltration is now also available in crossflow configurations. Operating pressures of 1 to 25\npsig (0.07 to 1.7 bar) are typical."

As of January 2011, the NYS DoH's website incorrectly claims that \"water fluoridated at the optimum level poses no known health risks.\" (The American Dental Association admits in its Fluoridation Facts booklet \"decreased fluoride removal may occur among persons with severely impaired kidney function who may not be on kidney dialysis.\", (5). NYC residents can lighten their toxic fluoride exposure by contacting Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Speaker Christine Quinn and their own Council Member to make sure they vote to stop the addition of fluoride chemicals into NYC's water supply. For more information: \n\nAmbassador Young and Dr. Durley expressed concerns about the fairness, safety, and full disclosure regarding fluoridation in letters to the state's minority and majority legislative leaders. (1,2)\n\nFluoride chemicals, added to 96% of Georgia's public drinking water supplies are meant to prevent tooth decay, especially in the poor. Yet, 61% of low-income Georgia third-graders have tooth decay compared to 51% from higher income families - and 33% and 20%, respectively, have untreated cavities showing a dire need for dental care. (3)\n\n\"We also have a cavity epidemic today in our inner cities that have been fluoridated for decades,\" wrote Ambassador Young.\n\nStudies show that despite fluoridation, tooth decay is higher in blacks (4) along with fluoride overexposure symptoms - dental fluorosis or discolored teeth.(5)\n\nDr. Durley wrote, \"The National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academy of Sciences has designated kidney patients, diabetics, seniors, and babies as 'susceptible subpopulations' that are especially vulnerable to harm from ingested fluorides. Black citizens are disproportionately affected by kidney disease and diabetes, and are therefore more impacted by fluorides.\"(4)\n\nAmbassador Young wrote, \"I am most deeply concerned for poor families who have babies: if they cannot afford unfluoridated water for their babies' milk formula, do their babies not count? Of course they do. This is an issue of fairness, civil rights, and compassion. We must find better ways to prevent cavities, such as helping those most at risk for cavities obtain access to the services of a dentist.\"(5)\n\nDr. Durley's letter to the legislators also says, \"I support the holding of Fluoridegate hearings at the state and national level so we can learn why we haven't been openly told that fluorides build up in the body over time (and) why our government agencies haven't told the black community openly that fluorides disproportionately harm black Americans…\"\nAn American Association for Justice Newsletter for trial lawyers describes potential fluoride legal actions based on personal injury, consumer fraud, and civil rights harm.(6)\n\nIn a letter to their state's Health Commissioner, a bipartisan group of Tennessee legislators expressed their concern about fluoridation's undesirable impact on babies and other groups.(7)\n\nA bipartisan group of New York City Council Members has also introduced legislation to stop fluoridation in NYC. (8)\n\nDaniel G. Stockin of The Lillie Center Inc., a Georgia-based firm working to end the practice of fluoridation says, \"You can look for even more leaders and persons harmed by fluoridation to speak out now.\"\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) proposes to lower water fluoride levels to alleviate the growing dental fluorosis epidemic. The Fluoride Action Network (FAN) submitted scientific evidence to HHS (9) indicating that fluoridation must stop completely to preserve health, documenting that:\n• HHS has failed to consider fluoride's impact on the brain. Fluoride has been linked to lowered IQ in 24 human studies, and over 100 animal studies have reported damage to the brain.\n• Infants who are fed formula made with fluoridated tap water will receive up to 175 times more fluoride than breast-fed infants. Infants 0-6 months old, the smallest and most vulnerable in our population, were completely excluded from risk calculations in HHS's proposal.\n• African-American children and low-income children suffer from the highest rates of dental fluorosis, including the most severe forms of the condition. The HHS has failed to take any steps to redress this inequity, thereby making fluoridation an Environmental Justice issue.\nYoung stated, \"My father was a dentist. I formerly was a strong believer in the benefits of water fluoridation for preventing cavities. But many things that we began to do 50 or more years ago we now no longer do, because we have learned further information that changes our practices and policies. So it is with fluoridation.\"\n\nI watched the proceedings on the internet. It seems the fluoridationists got their money's worth by hiring PR agencies (better known as liars for hire) to convince legislators that fluoridation was a good thing. I heard many members on the House floor say the same things they were probably coached to say \"this is one of the best things we can do for our children\" \"Fluoridation reduces tooth decay by 60%\" \"The CDC says it's OK to mix fluoridated water into infant formula\" Too bad all their practiced and memorized quotes are false and not substantiated by science.\n\nOne has to wonder why, if fluoridation was such a good thing, that PR agencies would have to be hired to convince legislators and without knowledge of their constituents. And why did the legislator who said he received thousands of messages from all over the state telling him to oppose fluoridation vote in favor and then brag he was a conservative. The money is still coming from taxpayers that go to the dentist and will have to pay a little more so Delta Dental can give away $500,000 to every city in Arkansas that wants to start fluoridation.\n\nWhy does he think the one-sided information given to him by a special-interest group\ntrumps that of his constituents who he is supposed to represent. It's a really sad day for the children of Arkansas who will be guinea pigs in this on-going experiment disguised as a public health measure.\n\nArkansas legislators have been duped and manipulated by organized dentistry. Listening to them on the internet, the legislators uttered \"facts\" that were false. For example, they said it's OK to mix fluoridated water into infant formula. But these organizations say no: the Centers for Disease Control, American Dental association, Academy of General Dentistry, the Mayo clinic and other respected health and government groups.\n\nUniversity of York, UK (2000) Report - About this report, the Centre for Review and Dissemination writes \"We were unable to discover any reliable good-quality evidence in the fluoridation literature world-wide.\" (1)\n\nNational Institutes of Health NIH Consensus Statement on Diagnosis and Management of Dental Caries Throughout Life (2001) - \"... the (NIH) panel was disappointed in the overall quality of the clinical data that it reviewed. According to the panel, far too many studies were small, poorly described, or otherwise methodologically flawed\" (over 560 studies evaluated fluoride use). (2)\n\nAgency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (2003) - This report says \"… subsets of the population may be unusually susceptible to the toxic effects of fluoride and its compounds…the elderly, people with osteoporosis, people with deficiencies of\ncalcium, magnesium, vitamin C, and/or protein.\" (3)\n\nNew York State Department of Health (1990) - The authors concluded: \"… some individuals may experience hypersensitivity to fluoride-containing agents.\" And, \"…it is\ncurrently impossible to draw firm conclusions regarding the independent effect of fluoride in drinking water on caries prevalence using an ecologic study design.\" (4)\n\nNational Research Council Fluoride in Drinking Water Report (2006) (5) - The Chairman of this committee, John Doull, PhD, is quoted in Scientific American as saying \"What the committee found is that we've gone with the status quo regarding fluoride for many years—for too long, really—and now we need to take a fresh look,\" Doull says. \"In.\"\n\nCommonly-consumed Infant fruit juices contain fluoride, some at levels higher than recommended for public water supplies which can damage teeth, according to research to be presented on March 17, 2011 at the International Association for Dental Research annual meeting in San Diego.\n\nNinety samples of three different flavors (apple, pear and grape) from three manufacturers were tested. All contained fluoride at concentrations ranging from 0.11 to 1.81 parts per million (ppm).\n\n\"Children who consume excessive amounts of juice per day may be ingesting more fluoride than the recommended daily intake,\" the researchers report.\n\nRecently, the US Department of Health and Human Services recommended lowering \"optimal\" water fluoride levels to 0.7 ppm to decrease the epidemic of fluoride-discolored teeth (dental fluorosis) afflicting over 41% of adolescents.

      "text": "Don't bottle 13-year-old's water wisdom\n\nThirteen-year-old Robyn Hamlyn was in Meaford, Ont., last week, explaining water policy to a rapt city council. Inspired by the Maude Barlow documentary Blue Gold: World Water Wars, Hamlyn has spent the last year travelling around Ontario lobbying city councils to become blue. \"Help me save our water. I can't do it without you,\" Hamlyn has pleaded to various mayors and councils. So far, she has won the support of Niagara Falls, St. Catharines and four other Ontario municipalities, and doesn't plan to stop until every community in the province is blue.\n\nBlue Communities, conceived by the Council of Canadians (COC) and the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) along with activist Barlow, aims to protect Canada's fresh water. To become a blue community, a municipality must ban the sale of plastic water bottles from public facilities and municipal events, must have a publicly funded and operated water system, and must deem water a human right.\n\nRobyn Hamlyn believes Canada's fresh water is a shrinking resource. As she stated in a March speech to the Council of Canadians, \"We have to act now, instead of later. I get frustrated with people getting hung up on small details and when they should be looking at the bigger, more scarier picture.\" What some Ontarians find scariest in this picture is the realization that municipalities take their advice from a 13-year-old.\n\nShould plastic bottles be elevated to the top of anyone's environmental agenda? Stewardship Ontario estimates that plastic water bottles make up less than one-fifth of 1% of the municipal solid-waste stream in Canada. In addition, 96% of Canadians say they recycle their plastic water bottles. If water is banned from municipal events, those present won't go thirsty — they'll purchase other, often less-healthy alternatives, such as pop, which is, incidentally, composed almost completely of water. Diet Coke is 99% water — privately owned water.\n\nHamlyn advises municipal councillors that bottled water may actually be less clean and safe than tap water. In reality, the opposite is true: Bottled water has never caused an illness in Canada, whereas tap water has sickened many, most notably in Walkerton, Ont., in 2000, where seven people died and 2,300 suffered from a strain of E. coli.\n\n2 Responses to Don't bottle 13-year-old's water wisdom\n\nWhile tap water in America at least (I assume for Canada as well) is more regulated than bottled water, as we all cynically know, regulation != safety. Also, you have to adjust illness by the extreme difference in consumption. Drinking a $1/liter bottle of water means that you drink a liter or so of water. Drinking $5/thousand gallon water means you drink it like, well, water. A heavy user might use three bottles of water a day, but the average consumer uses 100 gallons of tap water. Therefore, the illness item is a non-starter.\n\nThe waste issue is a non-starter. People will either consume disposable water bottles or use and wash their own refillables as they chose, and banning water will lead only to consumption of gatorade or Coke (I don't know if civilization has reached far enough North for them to have Dr Pepper).\n\nHowever, I agree spot-on with the \"Water is a Human Right\" meme. Having a purchased good as a right creates unconscionable results. For comparison, the idea that free speech can be bought (or for a price, denied to others) is a travesty against the soul of democracy. However, in a mutually exclusive good like water, you must regulate, restrict, and charge for it due to the sheer amount of necessary infrastructure involved in its transport and consumption.\n\nThe \"water shortage\" meme is the replacement for the now-discredited \"global warming\" meme. While there are certainly issues with fresh water being rather unevenly distributed around the planet, the claim that we're \"running out of water\" is just so much Junk Science. This is easily verified by noting that National Geographic (magazine) has already run a full issue devoted to this new \"problem\" (Water is Life, April 2010).\n\nNational Geographic correctly states that the amount of water on earth has not changed (significantly) since the dinosaurs were drinking it millions of years ago. Indeed, the water cycle of ocean evaporation, precipitation, movement via rivers, etc., back into the ocean — and again and again is a basic science most learn in grade school. Since this pattern depends on weather (which is always changing!) there are areas that receive more or less water. Of course, the most idiotic humans move to water short areas (like Los Angeles), then complain that water is in short supply.\n\nThe reality is, that water, like most resources are only in shortage when the prices are held at artificial levels by economically illiterate politicians elected by the idiots who decided to live in the middle of a desert because of the \"nice weather\" was ideal for creating movies. If water was allowed to be priced by free markets, we'd soon discover that there is no shortage and the water supply would be distributed to those who give the most value for it. (Already, cities tend to pay rather more for water while farms are often located in areas where highly subsidized water is available.)\n\nIn addition \"greens\" have artificially created shortages by demanding that various fish be given rights to water forcing humans (in cities and farms) to have a shortage causing substantial economic harm. Often the quantity to be dedicated to the fish has not been determined by honest scientific inquiry but is a political decision."

The product makes it easier for runners to stay hydrated without carrying a water bottle or camel back.\n\n\"A regular water bottle is hard, and it doesn't have a handle. A camel back is heavier.

But, Public Health Dayton-Montgomery County is now charged with inspecting the splash pads before the parks can open for the season.\n\nOnce a park has passed the initial inspection, it may open for the season. From there, Public Health Dayton-Montgomery County will complete water quality inspections every two weeks.\n\nStill, there are some things families can do to prevent contamination of the water. First, be sure to shower before you go to a pool or splash pad. Also, wash your hands after using the restroom. For small children still in diapers, be sure to put them in swim diapers, and only change those diapers in the restroom. Lastly, if anyone in your party is suffering from diarrhea, splash parks and pools are out of the question.\n\nWegerzyn Metropark Children's Garden is already open to children, and Riverscape and Island Park are expected to follow in the coming days."

These products are usually categorized according to the source of the water as well as the methods used by the bottling company to treat it.\n\nBasic treatment methods used for bottled water include the following:\n\nDisinfection: Bottled water products are generally required to undergo disinfection to kill or remove potentially harmful microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses and cysts. Bottlers who obtain water from a source that has not previously been disinfected, such as a spring or well, usually use ozone or ultraviolet to disinfect the water, as these processes do not leave a residual taste or odor in the water.\n\nBottled water companies can also purchase their source water from an approved potable water supply, such as a municipal water supply.\n\nOther Treatment: Some bottled water companies choose to further treat their products. Processes such as filtration, reverse osmosis and distillation can be used to help reduce excess levels of impurities as well as reduce aesthetic issues that can adversely affect the taste, odor or color of the water.\n\nStandards of Identity\n\nIn the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has established \"Standards of Identity\" for bottled water sold in the U.S. Below are several common identities:\n\nArtesian Water: Artesian water originates from a confined aquifer under the surface of the earth that has been tapped and which the water level stands at some height above the top of the aquifer.\n\nFluoridated Water: Bottled water that contains added fluoride is usually labeled as fluoridated water or water with added fluoride. It may also be labeled as \"For Infants\" or \"Nursery.\" In the U.S., the FDA limits the amount of fluoride that can be added to water to no more than 1.3 mg/L.\n\nMineral Water: Is defined as water that naturally contains at least 250 parts per million total dissolved solids (TDS). No minerals may be added to this water.\n\nPurified Water: Water that is being labeled and sold as \"purified\" must be produced through either distillation, deionization, reverse osmosis or other suitable processes.\n\nSpring Water: Spring water is defined as water that comes from an underground source from which water flows naturally to the Earth's surface.\n\nAlthough the FDA does not require bottlers to list naturally occurring compounds on the product label, such as sulfates or sodium, any ingredients added to the bottled water must be clearly stated on the label. Any naturally occurring or added ingredients cannot present in the water cannot exceed the FDA's maximum levels permitted by the applicable federal or state regulations."

Also, this leads to spreading of water-borne diseases, eutrophication, etc. Read on to know more about the\n\nharmful effects of sewage water pollution\n\n.\n\nThe waste water that flows from industrial, domestic or other areas is called as sewage water. In a proper and efficient sewage management, this sewage water is piped or channeled out of the cities for treatment. The major bulk of the sewage consists of water, whereas the other components include chemicals and organic wastes.\n\nHarmful Effects of Sewage Water Pollution\n\nPathogens present in the sewage water can spread numerous diseases. Also, stagnant water promotes mosquito growth. This leads to malaria. Typhoid is another water-borne disease which spreads via contaminated water.\n\nAccumulation of chemical nutrients in the water bodies is known as eutrophication. This is another harmful effect of sewage water pollution. Eutrophication increases BOD, reduces the number of fish and overall degrades the water quality.\n\nToxic wastes released into rivers are consumed by the aquatic organisms. This enters into the food chain which can badly affect the human health.\n\nCoral reefs are severely affected by the sewage water pollution all over the world. The growth of the corals is inhibited by the toxins contained in the polluted water.\n\nHence, it is important to treat the sewage water prior to its disposal into rivers. Also, it is imperative to effectively remove any harmful effluents from the sewage water. To minimize the adverse effects of sewage water pollution, an efficient waste water treatment should be implemented."

      "text": "My idea is to combine the designs of the Brita pitchers and Brita bottle to create a hybrid bottle/pitcher. The Brita bottle is nice since it is portable and you can drink directly from the container. However, I like that the pitcher filters the water when it enters the container rather than when it leaves the container as occurs with the bottle. Also, the pull-up lid on the bottle can wear out over time and some days the bottle isn't big enough.\n\nFirst, the bottle/pitcher would have two openings. One opening to fill the bottle with unfiltered water, and a second opening that you can drink out of or pour into a cup. There would be a chamber in the bottle similar to the current Brita pitchers where the water is filtered. This way, you have filtered water available rather than filtering it each time you drink out of the bottle. The one-liter bottles are very popular and a great size to keep at your desk at work, so that would probably be a good size for the bottle/pitcher.\n\nComment\n\nWow! What an awesome idea!! Thank you for sharing. Quick question: Looking at your drawing, the filter is currently placed underneath the area of unfiltered water. Are you imagining it to have similar structure as a pitcher's-a contained area for the water and water filters down the tunnel? The only thing is that area to hold unfiltered water area may be quite small according to current design. I am wondering if the bottle/pitcher container should be wider instead of slim design. What do you think was envisioning the structure to be similar to a Brita pitcher as you mentioned where the water filters down the tunnel. The shape of the bottle needs to be brain stormed a little further. A bottle that is too wide may make it more difficult to grip to drink directly from the bottle. The base could be wider with a narrower neck so that the bottle can still be gripped and the chamber to hold the unfiltered water could be expanded.\n\nI might call it the \"Office Oasis\" since it would provide thirst quenching options while at the office. You could drink right from the container, or pour from the container into a mug to make a cup of tea.\n\nRe-visiting your question about the small area for the unfiltered water... the \"chamber\" to hold the unfiltered water could be made out of material used in hydration bladders (like the bladders used in hydration backpacks) instead of hard plastic, only the material would have some elasticity. Imagine that the outside shape of the bottle stays the same, but the chamber to hold unfiltered water is like a balloon that can expand and contract. The top of the balloon is attached to the bottom of the lid and the filter is attached to the bottom of the balloon inside the bottle. As the unfiltered water fills the balloon, the balloon expands inside the bottle. As the unfiltered water drains from the balloon into the bottle, the balloon contracts."

Because not all coliform bacteria are cause for \"failing\" a water potability test, if a water test result discloses high or excessive T-coli alone, what we can conclude is that further investigation is needed.\n\nIf the water test passes a T-coli test as not detected, absent, or below your community's acceptable minimum level, the water is considered safe to drink insofar as bacterial contamination is concerned. Of course other contaminants (chemicals, for example) could still be present in such a water sample.\n\nEscherichia coli (EC or E-coli) bacteria tests in water indicate the presence of (or depending on the test performed, the count or level of colony forming units of) Escherichia coli.\n\nIf water \"faIls\" an E-coli test, the water is not safe to drink. Escherichia coli is a specific indicator of the presence of humanh or animal fecal waste contamiantion of the water supply, a water test which detects an unacceptable level of Escherichia coli is unsafe to drink. The source of contamination needs to be found and corrected or if this is not possible, an appropriate water treatment system is installed.\n\nAs we suggested above for T-coli, if the water test passes an E-coli test as not detected, absent, or below your community's acceptable minimum level, the water is considered safe to drink insofar as bacterial contamination is concerned. Furthermore, T-coli may be present and E-coli absent and the water test may be considered acceptable. However in our OPINION, a high T-coli water test\n\nOf course other contaminants (chemicals, for example) could still be present in such a water sample.\n\nHPC heterotrophic plate count in water test results: aerobic and facultative aerobic bacteria are both detected by the HPC count.\n\nThe HPC count is not part of most basic water potability tests. You may order this test, for example, as part of diagnosing a known or suspected problem, or to help check for growth of microbial contaminants in treated water. HPC or the heterotrophic plate count, along with total coliforms (T-coli) and Escherichia coliform (E-coli) counts are used to indicate the level of microbiological contamiantion of water tests for potability.\n\nDetails about Total Coliform Bacteria Information for Homeowners\n\nThe photos shown here illustrate the simple and inexpensive Total Coliform Test procedure.\n\nWhen the reagent is added to a properly-collected\nwater sample, the liquid remains clear (left hand photo) if the total Coliform count in the sample is less than 1 colony-forming-unit or 1cfu/100ml and turns yellow (right hand photo) if the total Coliform count\nis above 1 cfu/100ml of water in the water test sample.\n\nWhat are \"Total Coliform Bacteria\" and why test for them?\n\nWhat exactly are Total Coliform bacteria and why do we test for them in our drinking water?\nTotal Coliform bacteria are part of a family of bacteria called, Enterobacteriaciae, or Enterics, for short.\nColiform bacteria have some interesting characteristics that allow us to use them as indicator organisms.\n\nIn this case, a Coliform present sample in drinking water indicates that the source is, or recently has been infiltrated by surface water.\n[Coliform bacteria are almost always present in surface water.]\n\nWe use \"Coliforms\" to help us determine this, because Coliform bacteria are found throughout the environment, as well as on most plant material.\nThey live longer than the pathogenic (disease-causing) microbes we don't want you to get, so it allows us to culture them in the lab.\n\nFinding Coliform bacteria in a drinking water sample does not mean anyone is going to become ill. After personally analyzing over fifty thousand individual Coliform tests, we wish we had a nickel every time someone would say to me something like, \"I've been drinking' this water for over\nseventy years, and we never been sick from it once!\" While that may be all well and true, drinking water that contains certain contaminants has been one of the leading causes of major disease outbreaks, historically speaking.\n\nWill Coliform bacteria in water make you sick?\n\nWhen we find Coliform bacteria in your drinking water sample, as stated above, it simply indicates that the source is, or recently has been compromised by surface water.\nWe're not so concerned about the Coliform bacteria themselves, but the \"red flag\" if you will, is that we don't know what else may have gotten in your drinking water system via the same route that the Coliform bacteria entered. Some types of bad microbes we don't want you to ingest, for example, would be Klebsiella, Shigella, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, or Salmonella, just to name a pesky few!\n\nMost drilled wells are free from Coliform bacteria, but many dug wells contain Coliform. This is not surprising, since dug wells are a surface water source, which means it is above the bedrock layer.\nDug wells, can be an excellent source of drinking water, but extra care should be taken to be sure there is adequate separation from the well with respect to pets, farm animals, and runoff.\n\nIf you have a dug well, the volume and taste are fine, but it keeps getting Coliform bacteria, then a viable and effective option may be to install an ultraviolet disinfection system, which kills the bacteria and other microbes by separating, or denaturing the DNA or RNA of their cells.\nThis works well because it doesn't change the chemistry of the water like some other disinfection methods, such as chlorination.\n\nHowever any water treatment system requires care and monitoring, lest you think it's working when it's not. Further, the presence of surface water in your water supply might mean that other surface contaminants, such as chemicals, are\nalso present. If this is the case, a UV-light is not going to remove them. This is why further testing of your water may be in order before deciding just what water treatment system should be installed.\n\nFinally, if Total Coliform bacteria is found in a drinking water sample, then the sample is also checked for a type of\nfecal Coliform bacteria, which is always Escherichia coli, or E. coli. The presence of E. coli may mean a septic or leach field infiltration, or in a dug well, it just may be a squirrel\nor field mouse that tried to make his home in your well!

Unfortunately, it's not cheap.\n\nThe reverse osmosis process, which separates out salt with a membrane, costs about 50 cents per cubic meter of water. Reverse osmosis systems also have to be monitored so that the membrane doesn't get fouled or clogged. Last year, Ashkelon in Israel opened a $250 million plant that will ultimately churn out 100 million cubic meters of water annually.\n\nQuos, a stealth company out of Chicago, has come up with a technique for removing the salt and other impurities without membranes, according to Vinod Khosla, whose firm, Khosla Ventures, has put money into Quos. The company, like some of the other companies Khosla Ventures has put money into, can in some ways still be looked at as a science experiment, he acknowledged. He wouldn't say much more about Quos, but with all of the money going into water, stay tuned. (We spoke to him briefly after a presentation at the ThinkGreen conference taking place in San Francisco.)\n\nKhosla Ventures also put money into NanoH20, which grew out of a research project at UCLA. NanoH20 has developed a membrane that attracts water molecules and repels other types of molecules, thus speeding up the desalination process.\n\nQuos isn't the only desalination company out there without membranes. Altela in New Mexico has come up with a shipping container-size device that simulates the evaporation-condensation cycle that you see in nature. The company, in other words, makes rain and removes impurities that way.\n\nOther notes from Khosla:\n\n--One of the reasons that grasses like Miscanthus make better sources for fuel feedstocks than plants like corn is the fact that they are perennials. Every year, the roots grow longer and deeper. \"You only need a little water and fertilizer. That is why perennials are the key,\" he said.\n\n--The biggest obstacle facing the solar thermal industry is transmission lines. Solar thermal plants need to be built in the desert, but the power has to be distributed to distant population centers. The Department of Energy is experimenting with ways to beef up the transmission grid. Solar thermal, which makes electricity by harvesting heat from the sun, can produce electricity for close to the same price as natural gas plants and will approach coal plants in the next few years, according to advocates.\n\n--And of course the usual Vinod comments: biodiesel is not so hot, ethanol is going to be cheap, and photovoltaics can't do much to solve global warming.\n\nMicrosoft wants to revamp the way we watch TV, change channels, and switch between different media with the new Xbox One.

Generally, whole house water filters are installed at the point where water enters the house, so that water gets filtered even before it reaches pipes. In some cases where people need to filter different things at different taps a filter is installed at each tap.\n\nWhole house water filters mostly follow a four-stage filtration process and help in removing almost all harmful contaminants from the water supply. At the first stage sediment materials in the water are removed. At the second stage water atomization alters the molecular structure of chlorine and turns it into zinc chloride which is a harmless molecule. The third and fourth stages of filtration involve bituminous-activated carbon and coconut-shell activated carbon media and filters pesticides, remnants of biological matter, and other harmful chemicals."

After this process, a filter is needed in order to filter out the sediment and coarse contaminants out of the water supply. For this, the students had to select products and materials that were low cost and readily available to the villagers in Peru – a working model of the filter system had to be built and demonstrated. And the students provided just that: they provided design plans, bill of materials to manufacture, a cost analysis, and a working model of the water filter system.

The original field of applicants for the competition was 165 across the country, Embry-Riddle officials said.\n\nThe backpack, which currently weighs 58 pounds, works by connecting a hose from the backpack to a source of water. The backpack, made of plastic, also has two folded solar panels, a battery, a solar charger, three filters and a pump.\n\nYung Wong, Embry-Riddle student team leader, 22, of Iselin, N.J, said the solar panels hook up to the charger and then the battery runs the pump, which pushes the water through the filters.\n\nThe system is run mainly by the battery, which is re-charged by the solar panels.\n\nThe water purifier can be deployed in less than 30 minutes using easily understood instructions, converting standing stagnant water into safe drinking water for up to 1,500 people per day, officials said. The device operates on solar power and will run for 72 hours without sunlight if deep-cycle batteries are used.\n\nThe university received interest at the competition from several groups, including the U.S. Army, who wants to work with the school in the future on the technology, a professor involved in the project said.\n\n\"Before we went to D.C., we didn't really see the potential for it. When we were there we got tremendous positive feedback,\" said Wong, who is graduating in May with a bachelor's in mechanical engineering and will continue working on the project as a graduate student. \"I think it's going to go far. We'd like to create a business out of it and have started the process to put in a patent for it as well.\"\n\nThe goal is to reduce the size and weight to about 40 to 45 pounds.\n\n\"It's important because of how many people it can impact and help,\" Wong said. \"It can help in disaster areas and it can help the military so they don't have to keep shipping in water.\"\n\nThe cost possibly could be about $3,500, but that price is still being worked out, according to Marc Compere, assistant professor of mechanical engineering.\n\nCompere said the earthquake in Haiti inspired the portable solar-powered water purifier. The university and students designed and installed a solar-powered water purification system for an orphanage in Haiti last year.\n\n\"We went there and we saw how (important) a solar water purifier would be. We needed it and we drank water from our own purifier,\" he said.\n\nIt also was a big undertaking to take the system on a plane to get it to Haiti, he said, so they thought of designing a smaller backpack system.\n\nAnother water purifier system will be built by Embry-Riddle students in August with a university in Port-au-Prince that lost its building because of the earthquakes.\n\nThe Embry-Riddle team members involved in the backpack system in addition to Wong were Johnathon Camp of Crystal River; Kyle Fennesy of Richmond, Texas; James Holmes of Riegelsville, Pa.; Neil McCalla of Oxford, St. Mary, Jamaica; Shavin Pinto of Colombo, Sri Lanka; Dean White of Brandon; and Civil Engineering student Jared Coleman of Lake Worth. They were advised by Embry-Riddle mechanical engineering Professors Marc Compere and Yan Tang and civil engineering Professor Mark Fugler.\n\nThe team took home two other awards from the expo — the 2012 EPA P3 Student Choice Award bestowed by the other teams, and the U.S. Army's Net Zero Award for Water, Waste and Energy.\n\nArchives\n\nWhat people say About Us.\n\nWe wanted to provide the safest water possible to our family, so we called Angel Water.

In fact, safe drinking water has been a key ingredient in some of the greatest public health achievements of the last half-century, including the dramatic reduction in disease and increased longevity that we now tend to take for granted. Along with other basic public health measures like immunization, drinking water protection has played a crucial role in building a safer and healthier society.\n\nWe need to remain vigilant if we are to protect those past gains. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) is strongly committed to safeguarding the quality of our drinking water, and as part of that commitment, we routinely monitor all of our state's public water supply systems for a broad range of chemical, radiological, and biological contaminants.\n\nMDH believes that educating the public about water quality issues is an important element of drinking water protection. Since 1995, we have been releasing annual summary reports, like this one, to help us achieve that goal. Like previous reports in the series, this year's report covers test results and actions taken during the preceding calendar year.\n\nThe main body of the report provides information about Minnesota's community water supply systems—that is, systems that provide people with drinking water in their places of residence.\n\nThe section on Emerging Issues contains information on the Clean Water Fund, the state water plan and water sustainability framework, and rules that are being revised.\n\nWe hope this information will provide the people of Minnesota with a clearer picture of what is being done to protect the quality of their drinking water, and what our monitoring efforts have revealed about the success of those efforts. We believe that the picture is a positive one, but there is always room for improvement and we hope this report will maintain Minnesotans' confidence the work being done by MDH to protect the safety and the quality of their drinking water.\n\nThe Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) is responsible for enforcing\nthe federal Safe\nDrinking Water Act, and safeguarding the quality of drinking water in our state. This includes the responsibility of regulating approximately 7,100 public water supply systems statewide. This number includes 961 community systems, which provide drinking water to people in their places of residence. The community systems include 727 municipal systems, serving towns or cities.\n\nThe Major Elements of Drinking Water Protection\nMinnesota's drinking water protection strategy includes three major\nelements:\n\nPrevention measures are used to protect the quality of drinking\nwater at the source by controlling potential sources of pollution, regulating\nland use, reviewing plans and providing advice on construction of water\ntreatment and distribution facilities, and inspecting these facilities\non a regular basis.\n\nTreatment measures, including routine disinfection, are used\nto make the water palatable and safe to drink.\n\nMonitoring of water supplies for potentially harmful contaminants,\non a routine basis, is the critical element of the state's enforcement\nresponsibilities under the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n\nThe Monitoring Process\nMinnesota's community water supply systems are monitored for the\nfollowing types of contaminants:\n\nPesticides and Industrial Contaminants. Each community water\nsystem may be tested regularly for more than 100 pesticides and industrial\ncontaminants, including both synthetic organic chemicals (SOCs) and\nvolatile organic chemicals (VOCs). The list of chemicals to be tested, and the testing schedule, may vary from one system to another.\nTesting requirements depend on factors such as whether a particular\nchemical is likely to be present in the local environment and how vulnerable\nthe system is to contamination. If a system exceeds the applicable federal\nor state drinking water standard for a particular chemical, it must\nnotify the people who use the water and take appropriate steps to correct\nthe problem.\n\nBacteriological Contamination. Larger community water systems are\ntested monthly, and smaller systems are tested quarterly, for contamination by coliform bacteria. The coliform test is used as a general indicator\nof water quality in the system, in terms of potential microbial contamination.\n\nTotal coliform bacteria are common in the environment (such as in soil) and are generally not harmful. Fecal coliform and Escherichia coli(E. coli) bacteria are an indicator of human or animal fecal matter.\n\nIf fecal coliform or E. coli is detected along with total coliform in drinking water, there is strong evidence that sewage is present; therefore, a greater potential for harmful organisms exists. In these cases, immediate corrective actions must be taken. The actions include a notice to residents to boil their water before using it for cooking and drinking. The water system will be disinfected, flushed, and retested to ensure that any contamination problems are eliminated.\n\nIf only total coliform is detected (without the presence of fecal coliform or E. coli ), the source is most likely from contamination the environment, introduced during construction or while repairs to plumbing or a water main were underway. The will not be issued.\n\nNitrate. Each system must be tested annually for nitrate. Nitrate is a man-made contaminant and also\noccurs naturally in the environment, but elevated nitrate levels in\ndrinking water are usually associated with the use of fertilizer, or\nthe breakdown of human and animal waste. It is a health concern primarily\nfor infants under the age of six months. If the federal standard for\nnitrate is exceeded, an advisory is issued regarding consumption of\nthe water by infants. The advisory remains in effect until steps can\nbe taken to correct the problem.\n\nInorganic Chemicals and Radioactive Elements. Each system is\ntypically tested once every nine years—although, in some cases,\nit could be as often as once a year—for 13 additional inorganic\nchemicals. Systems are normally tested every three years for a number\nof radioactive elements. Both inorganic chemicals and radioactive elements\nmay be naturally present in the water. If the water exceeds health standards\nfor either type of contaminant, people who use the water are informed,\nand steps are taken to correct the problem.\n\nDisinfection By-products. Disinfection rids drinking water\nof microbiological organisms, such as bacteria, viruses, and protozoa,\nthat can cause and spread disease. The most common method of disinfection\nis the addition of chlorine to drinking water supplies. However,\nchlorine can combine with organic materials in the raw water to create\ncontaminants called trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs).\nRepeated exposure to elevated levels of THMs over a long period of time\ncould increase a person's risk of cancer. All community water\nsystems that add a disinfectant to the water must regularly test their\ntreated water to determine if THMs and HAAs are present. If the THMs\nor HAAs exceed the limits set by the U. S. Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA), the water system must take action to correct the problem.\nThe corrective actions include notifying all residents served by the\nwater system.\n\nLead and Copper. Community water\nsupply systems have participated in efforts to reduce lead and copper\ncontamination in drinking water. Lead and copper are not typically present\nin the water when it leaves the treatment plant. Lead and copper differ\nfrom other contaminants in that they are rarely present in source waters.\nRather, they enter the water through contact with plumbing components,\nusually in individual homes. If more than 10 percent of the homes in\na community exceed the federal \"action level\" for lead or\ncopper, based on the results of community-wide monitoring, the water\nsystem must do additional testing and take steps to reduce levels. Systems\nthat exceed the action level for lead must also perform an ongoing program\nof public education.\n\nNote: Any time a drinking water standard is violated, the\naffected water system must take corrective actions that include notifying\nits residents of the violation. In addition to this notification, all\ncommunity water systems issue an annual Water Quality Report (sometimes\nreferred to as a Consumer Confidence Report) that lists the source\nof the system's drinking water as well as a list of all regulated\ncontaminants that were detected, even in trace amounts well below the\nlegal standard, during the previous calendar year.\n\nSince 1974, the U.S. EPA has been responsible for regulating the nation's\npublic water supply systems, under the provisions of the federal Safe\nDrinking Water Act. However, almost all states, including Minnesota, have\nnow assumed responsibility for enforcing the act within their own borders.\nMinnesota became one of the first states to achieve primacy, and to begin\nregulating public water supply systems at the state level, in 1976.\n\nThe definition of \"public water supply system,\" for purposes of the Safe Drinking Water Act, is a broad one. To be considered \"public,\" a water supply system must have its own water source and provide water to 25 or more people, or have 15 or more service connections.\n\nMinnesota currently has 7,128 public water supply systems. Of those systems, 961 are community systems, which provide water to people in their homes or places of residence. Most of these community systems use groundwater from underground sources, tapped by wells, as their source of water. However, 23 of these systems, including the municipal systems that serve the state's largest cities, use surface water, drawn from lakes or rivers.\n\nOf the state's 961 community water systems, 727 are municipal systems, serving towns or cities. The rest of the community systems provide water to people in a variety of residential locations, including manufactured home parks, apartment buildings, housing subdivisions, colleges, hospitals, and correctional facilities.\n\nThe remainder of the state's public water supply systems is noncommunity\nsystems. Some of these noncommunity systems provide water to an ever-changing \"transient\" population at places such as restaurants, resorts,\nand highway rest stops. Other noncommunity systems may provide water to\nrelatively stable population groups in nonresidential locations such as\nschools, places of employment, and day-care facilities.\n\nThe Major Elements of Drinking Water Protection\nThree basic strategies are used to safeguard the quality of our drinking\nwater:\n\nPrevention. Preventing contamination of the source water used\nby public water supply systems—lakes, rivers, and water wells—is\nan important component of drinking water protection. This aspect of\ndrinking water protection includes measures such as regulating land\nuse, regulating the construction of water treatment facilities, and\ncontrolling potential sources of pollution.\n\nTreatment. Most community water supply systems use some form\nof treatment, so the water will be palatable and safe to drink. Many\nsystems require routine disinfection as a safeguard against potential\nproblems with bacteriological contamination. Groundwater systems are less likely to require disinfection, because wells that are properly constructed and are located in a non-vulnerable aquifer are less susceptible to surface contamination.\n\nMonitoring. Monitoring is the critical element of compliance\nactivities under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Under provisions\nof the act, public water supply systems are required to sample treated—or \"finished\"—water\non a regular basis, and submit the samples to the MDH laboratory for analysis. The\nsamples are tested for a broad range of potential contaminants. If\nunacceptable levels of contaminants are found, the water supply owner\nor operator is legally responsible for informing the people who use\nthe water and for taking steps to eliminate potential health hazards.\n\nUnder the provisions of the SDWA, the individual public water supply\nsystem is responsible for taking water samples and submitting them\nto certified laboratories for analysis. To lessen the burden on water\nsupply operators, most of the required samples are collected by field\nstaff from MDH. Minnesota's public water supply operators have\none of the best records in the nation regarding compliance with these\nsampling and testing requirements.\n\nNote: The monitoring requirements and test results described in this\nreport apply primarily\nto community water supply systems.\n\nMonitoring: What We Test For—and Why\nMinnesota's community water supplies are tested for a number of different\ntypes of contaminants. The reasons for testing—and how often the\ntesting is done—depends on the type of contaminant and other factors.\nThe type of contaminant also determines what actions will be taken, if\nunacceptable levels are found in the water.\n\nThe major types of contaminants we test for include:\n\nPesticides and Industrial Contaminants. Minnesota's community\nwater supply systems are routinely tested for more than 100 different\npesticides and industrial contaminants, including synthetic organic compounds\n(SOCs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Systems may be tested anywhere\nfrom four times a year to once every six years, depending on the specific\nchemical and the vulnerability of the system to contamination (see Assessing\nVulnerability to Contamination, below). Some systems may not need\nto do any testing for a particular contaminant. A formal use waiver is sometimes granted, specifically exempting a water supply system from\ntesting for a particular contaminant, if that chemical or pesticide is\nnot commonly used in the immediate area.\n\nThe EPA has developed legal standards known as maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for 60 of the more common pesticides and industrial contaminants found in drinking water. Advisory standards have been developed for other pesticides and industrial\ncontaminants, and those are used in the same way as the MCLs in assessing\ntest results.\n\nAny time a community water system exceeds the MCL for one of these contaminants,\nthe water supply operator, with the assistance of MDH, must notify the people who use the water. Appropriate steps are\nthen taken to reduce the contamination to acceptable levels.\n\nIn some cases, the MCL or advisory standard is calculated to prevent\nimmediate or short-term health effects. More often, however, these standards\nare designed to reduce the long-term risk of developing cancer or other\nchronic health conditions. They are calculated very conservatively. If\nthe concern is long-term health effects, the standards are calculated\nto keep the risk of illness at levels most people would regard as negligible—even\nif they drink the water every day, over an entire 70-year lifetime.\n\nBacterial Contamination. Community water supply systems serving\nmore than 1,000 people are tested one or more times per month for coliform\nbacteria. Smaller systems are tested four times a year. The coliform\ntest is used as a general indicator of water quality in the system, in\nterms of potential microbial contamination. If the coliform test is negative,\nit is an indication that the system is adequately protected against\ncontamination from other types of disease-causing organisms. However,\nif coliform bacteria are found in the water, it is assumed\nthat the system may be compromised, and steps are taken to protect the\npeople who use the water.\n\nAs noted in the Executive Summary, total coliform bacteria (without the detection of fecal coliform or E. coli ), are generally not harmful. In these cases, the would not be issued as would be if fecal coliform or E. coli were found.\n\nNitrate/Nitrite. Community water supply systems in Minnesota are\ntested once a year for nitrate, a chemical which may occur naturally in\nthe environment but which can also enter the water from sources like fertilizer\nrun-off, decaying plant and animal wastes, or sewage. Nitrate is a health\nconcern primarily for infants under the age of six months. The infant's\ndigestive system can convert the nitrate to nitrite, which\ncan interfere with the ability of the infant's blood to carry oxygen.\nThe result is a serious illness know as methemoglobinemia, or \"blue\nbaby syndrome.\" Methemoglobinemia can be fatal if nitrate levels\nin the water are high enough, and the illness isn't treated properly.\n\nThe MCL for nitrate in drinking water is 10 parts per million (ppm).\nIf a water supply system exceeds the standard, the people who use the\nwater are notified and advised not to use the water for mixing infant\nformula, or other uses that might result in consumption of the water by\ninfants under six months of age. The advisory is kept in place until steps\ncan be taken to reduce nitrate levels in the water. Possible remedial\nmeasures include treating the water to remove the nitrate, or drilling\na new water well.\n\nOlder children and adults are generally not at risk from drinking nitrate-contaminated\nwater. In fact, the average adult consumes about 20-25 milligrams per\nday in food, primarily from vegetables. Because of changes that occur after\nsix months of age, the digestive tract no longer converts nitrate into\nnitrite. However, some adults—including people with low stomach acidity\nand people with certain blood disorders—may still be at risk for\nnitrate-induced methemoglobinemia.\n\nInorganic Chemicals. Community water systems in Minnesota are tested for 13 other inorganic chemicals in addition to nitrate. If past results don't indicate the presence of inorganic chemicals, testing is usually done once every nine years; otherwise it may be done as often as once a year. The list includes antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium,\ncadmium, chromium, cyanide, fluoride, mercury, nickel, selenium, sulfate,\nand thallium. In some cases, these chemicals may be naturally present\nin the groundwater. If a water supply system were to exceed the MCL for\none of these chemicals, the people who use the water would be notified,\nand appropriate steps would be taken to reduce levels of these chemicals\nin the water.\n\nRadioactive Elements. Community water systems in Minnesota are\nalso usually tested once every three years—or as often as once a\nyear, in some cases—for a list of radioactive elements. These radioactive\nelements, or radiochemicals, are present in the water from natural sources.\nIf a system were to exceed the federal MCL for one of these radioactive\nelements, the people who use the water would be notified, and steps would\nbe taken to correct the problem.\n\nDisinfection By-products. Disinfection rids drinking water of\nmicrobiological organisms, such as bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, that\ncan cause and spread diseases. The most common method of disinfection\nis the addition of chlorine to drinking water supplies. Not only\nis chlorine effective against waterborne bacteria and viruses in the source\nwater, it also provides residual protection to inhibit microbial growth\nafter the treated water enters the distribution system. This means it\ncontinues working to keep the water safe as it travels from the treatment\nplant to the consumer's tap.\n\nHowever, even though chlorine has been a literal lifesaver with regard\nto drinking water, it also has the potential to form by-products that\nare known to produce harmful health effects. Chlorine can combine with\norganic materials in the raw water to create contaminants called trihalomethanes\n(THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs). Repeated exposure to elevated levels\nof THMs over a long period of time could increase a person's risk of cancer.\n\nThe formation of disinfection by-products is a greater concern for water systems that contain organics or use surface water, such as rivers, lakes, and streams, as their source. Surface water sources are more likely to contain the organic\nmaterials that combine with chlorine to form THMs and HAAs.\n\nAll community water systems that add a disinfectant to the water\nmust regularly test their treated water to determine if THMs and HAAs\nare present. If the THMs or HAAs exceed the limits set by the U. S. EPA,\nthe water system must take action to correct the problem. The corrective\nactions include notifying all residents served by the water system.\n\nLead and Copper. All community and non-transient public water systems have been tested for lead and copper. In community water systems, the water was tested in a\nnumber of homes within each system, to determine if they exceeded the\nfederal \"action level\" of 15 parts per billion (ppb) for lead\nor 1,300 ppb for copper. If a system exceeded the action level for lead\nor copper in more than 10 percent of the locations tested, it was required\nto take corrective action and do further testing. Current testing requirements\nare based partly on the results of that initial round of testing and of\nthe success of subsequent efforts to reduce risk of lead contamination\nin systems that have previously exceeded the action level.\n\nLead in drinking water is not an environmental contamination problem\nin the conventional sense. Water is almost never contaminated with lead\nat the source, or when it first enters the distribution system. However,\nwater can absorb lead from plumbing components used in individual homes.\nPossible sources of lead contamination include lead pipe, lead plumbing\nsolder, and brass fixtures. Lead exposure is a potentially serious health\nconcern, especially for young children. However, the water must usually\nbe in contact with lead plumbing components for an extended period of\ntime, usually by standing in the system overnight, before it can absorb\npotentially hazardous levels of lead. Consumers can usually protect themselves\nsimply by turning on the faucet and letting the water run for 30 seconds,\nor until it runs cold, before using it for drinking or cooking.\n\nWhile most people are subject to lead exposure from a number of possible\nsources—and drinking water typically accounts for a relatively small\nproportion of a person's total lead exposure—it is also one\nof the easiest sources of lead exposure to control and eliminate. Some Minnesota water supply systems address the issue by treating their water before it reaches a person's home, so it will be less likely to absorb lead from plumbing.\n\nAssessing Vulnerability to Contamination\nMonitoring requirements for individual public water supply systems depend partly on how vulnerable the system is to contamination. MDH does vulnerability assessments of water supply systems, taking into account a number of factors. If the system uses groundwater, proper well construction can serve to increase or decrease the risk of contamination. In some systems, natural geologic barriers may serve to protect the source water from contamination. Systems with a past history of contamination problems may be at higher risk.\n\nIn general, groundwater systems tend to be less vulnerable to certain types of contamination than surface water systems. Water tends to be naturally filtered as it moves downward through the earth, making its way from the surface to the underground aquifers tapped by water wells. That process can remove certain kinds of surface contaminants, including bacteria and parasites such as Cryptosporidium. For that reason, many groundwater systems do not routinely include disinfection as part of their normal water treatment procedures.\n\nThis is a summary of results of monitoring performed in 2010. In the case of a violation, a water system takes corrective actions. These actions include public notification to inform affected residents of the situation and if there are any special precautions they should take. In all cases noted here, residents were advised directly by the water system at the time the violation occurred.\n\nPesticides and Industrial Contaminants\nDuring 2010, MDH conducted 17,361 tests for pesticides and industrial contaminants in community water systems.\n\nOne municipal system, Bloomington (population 85,238, Hennepin County), exceeded the standard for methylene chloride. The system was back in compliance within a few days, and the city notified its residents of the situation.\n\nStandard procedures were followed in all of these cases. Systems were disinfected, flushed, and retested to ensure that any contamination problems had been eliminated. All of the residents served by the affected systems were informed of the situation.\n\nNitrate/Nitrite\nThree community systems, including one municipal system, exceeded the standard for nitrate in 2010. The municipal system was Park Rapids (population 3,494, Hubbard County), which had a well that exceeded the allowable limit for nitrate.\n\nThe city worked with the Minnesota Department of Health and developed a compliance agreement to take the affected well out of service and use it only for emergency purposes after notifying residents. Park Rapids also informed its residents of the situation as soon as the violation was identified.\n\nArsenic occurs naturally in the environment and, as a component of underground rock and soil, can work its way into groundwater, and is found in many areas of Minnesota. For many years, the standard for arsenic was 50 ppb. A revision to the Arsenic Rule, which was finalized in January 2001, lowered the limit to 10 ppb. The new standard took effect in 2006.\n\nThese systems in exceedance are working with MDH to come into compliance and are also communicating regularly with their residents about the situation.\n\nRadioactive Elements\nRadiation occurs naturally in the ground, and some radioactive elements may work their way into drinking water.\n\nRadium 226 & 228\nNine community water systems, including 8 municipal systems, exceeded the standard for radium 226 & 228 by the end of 2010. The affected municipal systems are Amboy (population 541, Blue Earth County), Claremont (pop. 608, Dodge County), East Bethel (pop. 88, Anoka County), Hinckley (pop. 3,301, Pine County), Lewiston (pop. 1,507, Winona County), Medford (pop. 1,107, Steele County), New Germany (pop. 360, Carver County), and Rushford Village (pop. 260, Fillmore County). No restrictions were placed on water consumption although residents were notified of the situation. Residents were told that this was not an emergency situation and were advised to consult with their doctors if they have any special concerns. Each of these systems has either started or completed infrastructure changes or is studying alternatives to meet the maximum contaminant level.\n\nOther Inorganic Chemicals\nNo community water systems exceeded the standard for inorganic chemicals in 2010.\n\nDisinfection By-products\nNo community water systems exceeded the standard for disinfection by-products in 2010.\n\nLead and Copper\nCommunity water supplies in Minnesota began their lead and copper monitoring programs in 1992 and 1993 as a result of the U. S. EPA Lead and Copper Rule in 1991. The monitoring is done by taking first-draw water samples from a given number of consumer taps within the water distribution system. The number of samples taken in based on populations served and past monitoring results. If more than 10 percent of the samples taken exceed the federal action level for lead (15 parts per billion-ppb) or copper (1.3 parts per million-ppm), the entire system is considered to be \"in exceedance.\" Communities that are found to be in exceedance are required to perform additional monitoring, implement corrosion control measures, and begin a public education program within 60 days of the reported exceedance.\n\nSince the initiation of the lead and copper monitoring program in 1992, more than 250 community water systems in Minnesota have exceeded the lead and/or copper action levels. Over 150 of these systems have integrated corrosion control measures into their water treatment process. The majority of the systems that have taken proactive treatment measures have been deemed by MDH to have optimized their corrosion control treatment. Continued monitoring results have shown that corrosion control treatment is very effective in lowering lead and/or copper levels in Minnesota's community water supplies. Among the various treatment approaches, the most widely adopted was the use of phosphate-based corrosion control inhibitors, which accounts for about 90 percent of the treatment processes installed for lead/copper corrosion control in Minnesota. By maintaining a consistent treatment and adequate levels of corrosion inhibitor residuals in the water distribution system, both lead and copper levels can be effectively reduced.\n\nIn 2010, five community water supplies exceeded the lead action level and 17 community water supplies exceeded the copper action level. The occurrence of lead action level exceedances was considerably lower than the occurrence of copper action level exceedances because proven corrosion control treatments have shown to be more effective in reducing lead levels. In general, corrosion control treatment brought reduction in copper levels by 50 to 70 percent, and about 80 percent of the systems achieved compliance after treatment installation and optimization. Of the 24 systems not meeting the copper action level, seven have a 90th percentile copper value greater than 2.0 parts per million. The Minnesota Department of Health continues to work with these systems to bring them into compliance through the effort of corrosion control treatment and treatment optimization.\n\nCopper is an essential element for living organisms, including humans, and—in small amounts—necessary in our diet to ensure good health. However, too much copper can cause adverse health effects, including vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, and nausea. It has also been associated with liver damage and kidney disease.\n\nThe human body has a natural mechanism for maintaining the proper copper levels throughout the body. However, children under one year old have not yet developed this mechanism and, as a result, are more vulnerable to the toxic effects of copper. People with Wilson's disease also have a problem with maintaining the proper balance and need to exercise particular care in limiting exposure to copper.\n\nThe most common and effective corrosion control measure currently accepted for use in community water supplies is the inclusion of phosphate-based compounds into the water treatment process. Increasing phosphate usage in the water treatment process to lower copper and lead levels may not be feasible due to environmental concerns associated with increased phosphorus levels being released into the environment. Because there are concerns with potential environmental impacts from increased phosphorous and discharge limits set by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, some systems are unable to add phosphate at doses necessary to achieve levels needed to regain compliance for both lead and copper. With the need to balance public-health protection and environmental protection, and recognizing that it is unlikely for copper to cause adverse health effects at levels below 2.0 parts per million, the Minnesota Department of Health does not envision copper levels in the remaining systems to be further reduced through increasing phosphate usage. However, the goal to lower the copper levels as much as is technically feasible will be continued.\n\nState Water Plan and Water Sustainability Framework The Minnesota Environmental Quality Board (EQB) has adopted the 2010 Minnesota Water Plan, a\ncomprehensive long-range water resources plan for the state that presents a vision for achieving sustainable water management and ensuring healthy ecosystems.\n\n\"In 2008, the citizens of Minnesota voted to dedicate special tax revenue to protect and restore the state's land, water, habitat, trails, and cultural resources,\" reads the executive summary of the Water Plan. \"These valued resources define our identity as Minnesotans, and with this special revenue comes a responsibility to set priorities wisely and in a manner that can most effectively make a difference.\" (The executive summary refers to the Clean Water, Land, and Legacy Amendment to the state constitution, which increased the sales tax by three-eighths of one percent and allocated the additional revenue to protect water quality, preserve arts and culture, and support state parks and trails.)\n\nThe state water plan, prepared every 10 years, identifies steps Minnesota must take to meet its long-term needs. The report details seven principles and nine strategies for sustainable water management. It calls for new efforts to understand state groundwater systems and the role they play in nourishing surface waters and identifies additional steps to protect Minnesota's lakes and streams. With the support and engagement of local land and water interests, the plan calls for setting priorities, adapting management practices, increasing protection efforts, promoting wise water use, and restoring local management capacity.\n\nThe plan was prepared in cooperation with EQB member agencies and with public advice. It is the latest in a long history of bringing together agencies and others with an interest in achieving sustainable water management.\n\nRelated to the state water plan is the Minnesota Water Sustainability Framework, the first long-term framework for statewide water sustainability in the country. Released by the University of Minnesota Water Resources Center, the framework was commissioned by the Minnesota Legislature in 2009. It is intended to serve as a legislative roadmap for future investments in water resources, including the approximately $86 million a year dedicated to the protection of water as a result of the Clean Water, Land, and Legacy Amendment.\n\nThe report addresses a number or water-related issues, including drinking water quality, storm water management, agricultural and industrial water use, surface and groundwater interactions, ecological needs, invasive species, and the state's water infrastructure. The recommendations include a study of Minnesota's ground-water resources to determine how much is available and if supplies are being adequately replenished, the promotion of \"green\" chemistry through incentives for industry and consumer education to prevent future water contamination, a plan for integrated of water and land sustainability at the watershed level, and restructuring of municipal water pricing to reflect the actual costs, including ecological costs, of water use.\n\nDrinking Water Quality Standards Review and Revisions Fluoride\nThe U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) has proposed new guidance which recommends a single national optimal fluoride level of 0.7 parts per million (ppm) for community public water supplies. This would replace an optimal fluoride range of 0.7 to 1.2 ppm, a range used by the state of Minnesota when it developed its fluoridation laws.\n\nTo promote public health through the prevention of tooth decay, Minnesota requires municipal water supplies to maintain an average distribution system fluoride concentration of 1.2 ppm while remaining between 0.9 ppm and 1.5 ppm. That requirement remains in effect. The newly proposed HHS optimal level of 0.7 ppm was subject to a 30-day public comment period with a final recommendation expected before the end of the year. Once the HHS recommendations are finalized, MDH will investigate changes in policies and/or laws that will continue to promote and protect the dental health of all Minnesotans.\n\nThe U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also announced that it intends to reevaluate the existing fluoride maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 4 parts per million. A secondary (non-enforceable guideline) standard for fluoride is 2 ppm to protect against moderate dental fluorosis. Some areas of Minnesota have naturally occurring fluoride in the ground. All systems are in compliance with the MCL although a small number have levels of fluoride above 2 ppm in their water.\n\nPercholate and Other Volatile Organic Chemicals\nThe U. S. EPA will begin regulating perchlorate, a chemical used in the manufacture of rocket fuel, fireworks, flares and explosives, and may be present in bleach and in some fertilizers. Perchlorate may affect the thyroid. EPA will evaluate the science on perchlorate health effects and occurrence in public water systems as well as the feasibility of treatment technologies to remove perchlorate from water. The process for proposing a formal rule includes input from key stakeholders and a public comment period.\n\nThe EPA is also moving toward establishing a drinking water standard to address a group of up to 16 volatile organic chemicals that may pose a risk to human health. VOCs include solvents discharged from industrial operations. The VOC standard will be developed in line with EPA's new strategy to address contaminants as groups rather than individually to provide public health protection more quickly and also allow water utilities to more effectively and efficiently plan for improvements.\n\nChromium-6 (Hexavalent Chromium)\nA standard for total chromium of 1 ppm has existed since 1991 although it does not distinguish between chromium-3 (trivalent chromium) and chromium-6 (hexavalent chromium). Chromium-3 is an essential nutritional element in humans and has relatively low toxicity, unlike chromium-6, which is more toxic and may lead to adverse health effects. Sources of chromium-6 are discharges from steel and pulp mills and erosion of natural deposits of chromium-3.\n\nEPA is providing guidance to public water systems to enhance chromium monitoring through additional sampling and analysis specifically for chromium-6 and is assessing the health effects of chromium-6. This is part of a process to identify and address potential health threats from long-term exposure and could lead to a separate standard for chromium-6.\n\nClean Water Fund On November 4, 2008, Minnesota voters approved the Clean Water, Land, and Legacy Amendment to the state constitution, increasing the sales tax by three-eighths of one percent and allocating the additional revenue to protect state waters, preserve arts and culture, and support state parks and trails.\n\nApproximately 33 percent of the tax proceeds will be dedicated to a Clean Water Fund to protect, enhance, and restore water quality in lakes, rivers, streams, and groundwater, with at least five percent of the fund targeted for protecting drinking water. The use of these funds is determined by the Minnesota Legislature, and administered by programs within the Department of Natural Resources, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, the Minnesota Department of Health, and other agencies.\n\nMinnesota Department of Health activities will focus on protecting public health by evaluating and communicating scientific information about the potential for health risks from exposures to possible environmental health hazards in drinking water and by ensuring a safe and adequate supply of drinking water for all Minnesotans through source water protection.\n\nDuring the 2010-2011 biennium, the Minnesota Department of Health will receive approximately $3,765,000from the Clean Water Fund. These resources provide support for MDH to:\n\nengage an additional 90 communities into the wellhead protection program and assist them with plan development and implementation, in line with MDH's goal to have all communities involved in wellhead protection planning by 2020,\n\naward more than 100 source water planning and implementation grants to public water suppliers, totaling nearly $950,000,\n\ncontract for a special project to evaluate geological, chemical, and well construction conditions corresponding with arsenic levels in three counties,\n\nestablish health-based guidelines for 10 contaminants of emerging concern in drinking water contaminants,\n\nassess where and how these contaminants are used in Minnesota and the potential for human exposure, and\n\ncontract special research studies relating to alternative risk assessment methodologies, relative source contribution, and a needs assessment for public education and outreach for contaminants of emerging concern.\n\nMany Minnesota communities already have been benefiting from money from the Clean Water Fund, including:\n\nBig Falls\nBig Falls, in Koochiching County in northern Minnesota, has dealt with issues with arsenic, especially since the maximum contaminant level for arsenic was lowered from 50 to 10 parts per billion in 2006. One of the city's well had high levels of arsenic, and Big Falls struggled to meet the stricter standard. Finally, the city drilled a new well and took the well with high arsenic out of service. However, this well was close to the new well and an existing well; it needed to be sealed so that it wouldn't become a conduit for contamination to enter the groundwater.\n\nBig Falls is a small city and found the cost of sealing the well to be a hardship. Clean Water Fund funds covered the $1,350 cost of sealing the well, leaving the city responsible only for obtaining estimates, contracting with a licensed well driller, and providing documentation to the Minnesota Department of Health.\n\nThe funds available helped Big Falls to protect its groundwater and to continue to provide its 264 residents with safe drinking water.\n\nPelican Rapids\nAbandoned wells can threaten aquifers as conduits for contamination. The city of Pelican Rapids, in Otter Tail County in central Minnesota, had a pair of wells located in areas where contamination was known to be present.\n\nThe Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) identified these wells as potential threats to the city's drinking water supplies. After Pelican Rapids developed a wellhead protection plan that included the sealing of these two wells, MDH, using funding from the Clean Water Fund, awarded the city $8,940 to seal them.\n\nBy sealing the abandoned wells, the city is protecting its groundwater, helping it to keep providing its 2,374 residents with safe drinking water.\n\nClarissa\nA grant from the Clean Water Fundhas helped the city of Clarissa ensure that it will still have the ability to provide safe drinking water to its 609 residents even during an extended power outage or other emergency.\n\nClarissa, located in Todd County in central Minnesota, had no way to provide power to their water plant in case of an extended power outage or other emergency. Minnesota Rural Water Association (MRWA), a partner of the Minnesota Department of Health's Drinking Water Protection Section, addressed this issue while working with the city on its Wellhead Protection Plan (WHP). MRWA staff recommended the installation of a transfer switch and the rewiring of the city generator. The Health Department approved the WHP and, ultimately, the implementation grant, using funding from the Clean Water Fund.\n\nThe grant helped to fund the rewiring as well as the installation of a 400-amp transfer switch. As a result of this, the city will be able to continue uninterrupted service of its water supply to residents, even if the area experiences a power failure for an extended period.\n\nCold Spring\nIn response to elevated nitrate levels in its water, the city of Cold Spring, Minnesota, has been working with local landowners and others to reduce nitrogen fertilizer applications. In addition to area farmers, the central Minnesota city has partnered with the Minnesota Department of Health, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture, Minnesota Rural Water Association, Stearns County, and the Natural Resource Conservation District and has benefited from grants from the Clean Water Legacy fund.\n\nAfter studying the issue, the group prioritized fields where recharge to public water supply wells was likely occurring. The group then worked with area farmers and landowners to reduce the nitrate levels. Cold Spring purchased nitrogen-inhibitor products from the local co-op, which applied the products to farmers' fields to more efficiently use the nitrogen fertilizer that was being applied to the fields. As a result, farmers reduced their levels of fertilizer from 8 to 16 percent of their current application rates in comparison to University of Minnesota recommendations for coarse textured soils. The use of nitrogen inhibitors, combined with the additional reduction in applied fertilizer, resulted in a decrease of 4,100 pounds of nitrogen applied on 277 acres.\n\nBeyond reducing the nitrogen fertilizer being applied, the partnership has increase the trust and cooperation between the city and local farmers and landowners, a relationship that had been strained in the past. The cooperation has extended to all city residents with education regarding turf management issues to alleviate nitrate loading that may be occurring near public wells.\n\nIn addition to the nitrate inhibitors, Cold Spring has installed four monitoring wells and is working with the Minnesota Department of Health to measure the effectiveness of the program and develop information about the source of contaminated groundwater now supplying the city's wells. The monitoring wells will also show groundwater flow conditions within the drinking water supply management area, which will help reduce uncertainty in future efforts to amend the city's wellhead protection plans.\n\nThe partnership, aided by Clean Water Legacy funds, has improved vital relationships while making safer the water that Cold Spring is supplying to its 3,850 residents.\n\nHenning\nHenning is in Otter Tail County in central Minnesota. The city provides drinking water to its 812 residents as well as to the 313 people in nearby Ottertail. While Henning has been able to provide an uninterrupted supply of water to these two cities, it was concerned about what could happen during an emergency in which it could be left without power.\n\nWhen Henning was working on its Wellhead Protection Plan, Minnesota Rural Water Association, a partner of the Minnesota Department of Health's Drinking Water Protection Section, recommended that they install a transfer switch. The Health Department approved the city's wellhead plan along with an implementation grant [made available through the Clean Water Fund?] of $9,860.\n\nThis grant made it possible for Henning to install a three-phase, 600-amp transfer switch at their water plant, allowing the city to continue to be able to provide safe water even when electricity is not available.\n\nMonitoring test results for 2010 tend to reinforce the conclusions of previous years. Although we need to remain vigilant, Minnesotans can continue to have confidence in their drinking water.\n\nMDH remains committed to protecting the high quality of our drinking water. The safety of our drinking water should never be taken for granted—but Minnesotans can be assured that their local water supply system is making every effort to ensure that their water is safe. And they can also be assured that the Minnesota Department of Health—and the broader public health community—are working to ensure that their confidence is well placed.\n\nSummary of Safe Drinking Water Monitoring Results for Minnesota Includes Results for Both Community and Noncommunity Public Water Supply\nSystems in Minnesota for 2010\n\nThe following is a summary of drinking water monitoring test results\nfor all public water supply systems in Minnesota for calendar year 2010.\nPublic water supply systems include all systems that serve 25 or more\npeople on a regular basis, or that have 15 or more service connections.\nThere are 7,128 such systems in Minnesota, including:\n\n961 community systems, which provide water to consumers in their\nplaces of residence, including 727 municipal systems.\n\nThis large file lists, on a system by system basis, all MCL and\nTreatment Techniques (TT) violations in Minnesota for calendar year\n2010. Systems are listed in numerical order by their Public Water\nSupply Identification (PWSID) number.\n\nThis large file lists, on a contaminant by contaminant basis,\nall MCL and TT violations in Minnesota for calendar year 2010.\n\nNote: Although a public water supply may be out of compliance with\nmore than one contaminant or violation type, when calculating totals,\nit is counted no more than once within the population being totaled;\nas a result, the sum of the number of public water systems in violation\nover the various violation types or contaminants may not add up to the\ntotal.\n\nIndividual water systems produce an annual report listing contaminants that were detected, even in trace amounts, during the previous calendar year.

      "text": "Green Your Pool: 4 Alternatives to Chlorine\n\nThe chlorine in your pool can cause more serious damage than red eyes, dry skin and faded swimwear.\n\nAccording to the EPA, chlorine can irritate the respiratory system, especially in individuals that already suffer from allergies and asthma. And scientists are beginning to suspect that chlorinated water contains chemical compounds that become carcinogenic when they interact with organic matter in a pool, such as leaves, according to British environmental landscape architect and natural swimming pool advocate Michael Littlewood.\n\nChlorine also has environmental consequences: When you drain your pool, the chlorine that is meant to keep your pool sterile is toxic to aquatic animals and plants in local waterways.\n\nBut there are a number of innovative systems and products that can help you cut down on your pool's chlorine content, to make your backyard oasis better for your health and easier on the environment.\n\n1. Salt water pools\n\nSalt water pools are a popular alternative to conventional chlorinated pools, but these pools are actually not free of the chemical: Salt water pools essentially produce their own chlorine from salt.\n\nSalt water pool systems include a generator, which passes a low voltage electrical current through the pool water, converting the chloride ions in salt into chlorine to kill microorganisms and prevent algae and bacterial growth.\n\nThese types of pools offer some benefits over standard chlorine pools: You don't have to buy, store or handle chlorine, and many salt water pool owners report a softer-feeling water than water from a chlorinated pool.\n\nBut salt water pools are not the most eco-friendly of chlorine pool alternatives: Their chlorine generators consume a lot of energy, and the wastewater, just like chlorinated pool water, poses a threat to the flora and fauna in local water bodies because of its high salt content.\n\nIn addition, if you're particularly sensitive to chlorine, a salt water pool may not alleviate all your health complaints, since chlorine will still be present in the pool. You will also need to make sure you maintain proper water chemistry, including pH, to prevent mineral buildup, which can cause the salt-to-chlorine generator to fail."

      "text": "A water analysis should be done to determine the source of the iron and manganese. Iron and manganese may be present in the water supply or be caused by corroding pipes (iron or steel). Iron from pipe corrosion indicates low pH that may need to be corrected. Generally, you should take the sample from the faucet closest to the pumps. Allow the water to run for 5-10 minutes before sampling to obtain fresh water that has not been exposed to air. Do not sample water that has gone through a water heater or a water treatment unit such as a softner. If the water is clear when first drawn, but red or black particles appear after the water settles, dissolved iron and manganese are present. If the water has a red tint but no particles settle out after a time, colloidal iron is the cause. Reddish brown or black brown slimy masses inside the toilet tank indicate iron or manganese bacteria. Laboratory tests are recommended in all cases to determine iron and manganese concentrations.\n\nTesting Public Water Supplies\n\nThe quality of water supplied by Public Water Systems is regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act. This includes any well with 15 or more service connections or that regularly serves 25 or more people.\n\nPublic drinking water standards established by EPA fall into two categories - Secondary Standards and Primary Standards.\n\nSecondary Standards are based on aesthetic factors such as taste, odor, color, corrosivity, foaming, and staining properties of water that may affect the suitability of a water supply for drinking and other domestic uses.\n\nPrimary Standards are based on health considerations and are designed to protect human health. Iron and manganese are both classified for human health reasons under the Secondary Maximum Contaminant Level (SMCL) standards, indicating that they are not regulated by either the Federal or State Drinking Water Acts. If your water comes from a public water supply, contact the water utility office to inquire about the iron and manganese levels in your water.\n\nTesting Private Water Supplies\n\nWater quality in private wells is not currently regulated at the federal or state level. thus, the regular testing of a private water supply is not required under state or federal law. If consumers want to know the concentration of dissolved iron and/or manganese in a private water supply, they will need to have the water tested at their own expense. If foul odor (which is not a rotten egg smell) and a red or black slime layer is found in places like the toilet bowl or reservoir, then individuals should also request to have the water tested for iron and manganese bacteria. Tests to determine the presence of iron or manganese, and of iron and manganese bacteria in drinking water should be done by a laboratory utilizing approved EPA methods for the detection of iron and manganese.\n\nInterpreting Test Results\n\nPublic Water Supply Test Results\n\nThe Secondary Maximum Contaminant Level (SMCL) for iron in drinking water is 0.3 mg/L, sometimes expressed as 0.3 ppm, and 0.05 mg/L (ppm) for manganese. Water with less than these concentrations should not have an unpleasant taste, odor, appearance or side effect.\n\nPrivate Water Supply Test Results\n\nSince EPA regulations do not apply to private drinking water wells, users of private drinking water typically evaluate iron and manganese based on the degree of nuisance of these dissolved metals. They may also consider the EPA guidelines of 0.3 ppm iron and 0.05 ppm manganese and the presence or absence of iron and/or manganese bacteria in assessing the degree of nuisance associated with their water supply.\n\nQuiz\n\nAnswer the questions in the Lesson 3 quiz . When you have gotten all the answers correct, print the page and either mail or fax it to the instructor.

      "text": "FAQ's\n\nHow does a MagnaPool work?\n\nA MagnaPool works naturally to clean your pool in three ways. First, Magnesium Chloride one of the main components is known for its use as an antiseptic. Second, MagnaPool's special filtration process naturally removes organic impurities and phosphates before bacteria and algae can feed on them and grow. Third, the MagnaPool Hydroxinator naturally produces non-synthetic chlorine in a process very similar to one that takes place within our own bodies to fight bacteria and disease. These natural and efficient processes leave your pool clean and clear,with mineral water that is gentle on eyes and beneficial to skin and body.\n\nHow can I convert my existing swimming pool into a MagnaPool?\n\nPoolrite Plus stores are the licensed MagnaPool retail stores, and you may contact your local Poolrite Plus store if you'd like to replace your old system with a MagnaPool system. If you are planning more extensive renovations on your pool and would like to include a MagnaPool system as part of a bigger pool renovation project, make sure to use a licensed MagnaPool builder.For a list of licensed MagnaPool retailers (Poolrite Plus) and builders by state, please refer to the 'Distributor Map' section.\n\nAside from the initial purchasing price, what does it typically cost to maintain a domestic MagnaPool System? How does this compare with maintenance costs of other pool sanitation systems?\n\nThe typical annual running cost for a standard 50,000L domestic swimming pool with a traditional salt-water system is about $1,500.*A MagnaPool system in the same swimming pool would typically cost under $1,000 per year to maintain.* In this scenario, a MagnaPool system provides an estimated savings on running cost of up to 35%—or over $500 in annual savings. These figures do not include water savings, which are significant. (See FAQ on \"Water Savings\")\n\nWhere can I buy my MagnaPool minerals on an ongoing basis?\n\nYour MagnaPool minerals are sold in 10kg bags only through licensed Poolrite Plus stores and are available to MagnaPool owners exclusively.\n\n* If you have a question you would like answered please send it through to info@magnapool.com and we shall endeavour to answer it in a prompt manner."

Extreme Paranoia.\n\nWednesday, March 18, 2009\n\nwater recap\n\nWATER RECAP Generous loyal minions sent contributions and I've been counting my chickens before the check cleared thinking what doodads I wanted. I ordered a few ski masks and a 12v charge controller from  because I didn't have multiples of either one. Anytime the temperature gets into the teens I put on a ski mask which fits right over my eyeglasses and not only does my melon stay much warmer, my face doesn't freeze into a snot dripping frost bitten grotesque veneer. I got the charge controller because a guy that used to work here gave me his solar panel. Just gave it to me. Sucker. 45 watts, and the old style panel that will last a lot longer. So for the cost of a controller, $25, I've doubled my solar capacity. When I talked to him a second time he mentioned it was draining his battery and that he kept disconnecting it each night. So I guess that's why I got it. I'm thinking I can hook it up in the van to avoid dust and potential theft. Which will also serve as a back up \"generator\" if I stop driving into town ( currently my other panels charge the batteries I only use for lighting and the second truck battery is my entertainment/computer electricity ). I also ordered another water filter from  , for $55. It used to be just a smidgenabove $50 but they've increased their shipping charges ( I think Sportsman's did too, actually ). * So, having ordered another 13k gallon filter I was naturally thinking about water and how all my loyal minions didn't write as a second job so they didn't get paid the $1.50 an hour I do and thus couldn't afford a filter of their own ( seriously, this job pays spit which is why it is a labor of love first and only then when you're damn good and have paid your dues does it secondly start to pay ). So, always caring about other people I figured we could do a water purification recap, starting at the cheapest way of getting safe water and moving up to a super deluxe $50 generic Berky filter. To start with, fire. Fire is free almost everywhere. A few skinny women might be trying to scrounge for the same wood as you after the collapse, complaining how they have so many children to cook for but you can safely write that off as female manipulation. Just knock her down and take your wood. Maybe you can burn your SUV for cooking, Yuppie Scum! Okay, boil your water. But don't waste the wood. You don't need to let it stay at a rolling boil. Take all the past advice about boiling extra minutes per thousand feet of elevation and forget it. When bubbles start to rise, the water has stayed hot enough to pasteurize the water. I've written an article about this before ( it's a recap, right? ) but as usual with my piss poor organizational skills I have no idea when. Look for it if you want the full info ( and just to let you know, even though none of you have ordered Chicken Little #6, I've already put out #7. I still have my loyal sucker chained to his computer churning out new compilations for me which proves someone still loves me even if you don't- order at  ). * Next up the frugal scale we have the clay pot. Take an unglazed flower pot ( if it has a hole in the bottom you must cover it up- minions have suggested silicon caulking and a saucer ) and fill it up with water. Let drain. Do that three times as a way to clean. Now, the next batch is ready to drink. Poor bastards in tropical countries use this method. If it can clean water buffalo crap and Tropical Super Mold it can clean your water. Periodically you take clean water and scour the pot to clean off the accumulated crud. About the same money or a little more, you have the Water Pasteurization Indicator. Its a tube full of soy wax that melts to tell you the water is hot enough. You can Wiki a description and buy one at  . You can also put water in a pop bottle and let it sit in the sun a few hours as a purifier but it would be less efficient away from the equator. Plus, the wax gauge is only a few bucks which is cheap insurance. * About the same price is a solar pond. This one you really should look up for yourself as I've forgotten most of the details, but it just a much more efficient version of the Army desert still. You dig a shallow wide hole with black plastic on the bottom covered with clear and have a collection trough for the distilled water. You are only buying the two pieces of plastic but you should have extras due to degrading from exposure and the likelihood of ripping. I wouldn't recommend this method because it is so temporary, but it is an option. Last up is the expensive generic Berky filter. Minions have pointed out cheaper filters, but I'm not sure they will last the thirteen thousand gallons a Berky will. I got this method out of a book years ago, so I didn't invent this. But I've rarely seen it mentioned so I try to spread the word. You buy a Berky replacement filter element for $50. Take two food grade poly buckets with lids. The top one has a hole drilled in the bottom. Stick the filter nipple through it. The filter comes with a threaded screw/nut and gasket so unless the gasket dries out ( I don't know if it will, a caution for storage ) you secure the filter easily that way with no leaks. A hole in the bottom lid lets the water collect in the bottom bucket. Simple. Okay, it's more like a $70 filter if you buy two buckets and lids but it sounds much more frugal the other way. * That should about sum it up. From no cost to cheapest filter cost for your water purification needs. END\n\nA purifier removes and/or kills EVERYTHING* in the water. Viruses included. Big Berkey ceramic elements, heating pasteurization, sun-exposed coke bottles (which work fine no matter the time of year it just takes longer for UV to do th job by itself), reverse osmosis, clay pots I'm not sure about.\n\nA filter only gets rid of particulate debris and bacteria/protists/parasites. They're usually the paper cartridges or the cheaper ceramic elements. Katadyn hand-pump units are a good example.\n\nChlorine and Iodine are fine in the short term for water purification but Iodine tastes like piss and neither of the two works long term. They both tend to degrade over time and it takes 5 drops/liter which doesn't sound like much but over time it's a lot.\n\nNow that you're on the subject of cleanliness Jim you should do a review of Camp Soap...the stuff is ridiculously effective.\n\nMeastro is correct, you must be care ful to not asssume that a filter will purify. I have a rain catchment system that takes the rain from the large garage roof and filters out the crud that comes with it. That water is then filtered again through the canister filters for chemicals and heavy metals down to 5 microns, then the water is passed through and ultraviolet purifier that kills just about any living thing.\n\nAdd and dissolve one heaping teaspoon of high-test granular calcium hypochlorite (approximately ¼I went by Wally World and looked in the pool chemicals area for some Calcium Hypochlorite but could not find any. What they did have that said it releases chlorine was Trichloro-s-triazinet in 94.5 to 99% concentrations. Now is this Trichl stuff some brand name for CH or is it something entirely different? Can it be used for potable water purification?\n\nConsider that Calcium hypochlorite is sometimes combined with Trichloro-s-triazinet (Cyanuric acid) to prevent the sun (UV radiation) from destroying the released Chlorine too quickly. I have no idea what Cyanuric acid would do to human health, but people do swim in it. The name Cyanuric Acid is problematic, though, reminding me of cyanide."

      "text": "Michigan food processors turn groundwater orange\n\nOrange you glad I didn't say arsenic?: It's common practice among Michigan's fruit and vegetable processors to spray their untreated wastewater, heavy with sugars and salts, onto nearby fields. After years of putting up with the spraying, nearby residents are complaining that large processors like Birds Eye, Welch Juice, and Minute Maid (owned by Coke) are destroying groundwater with their fruity funk. Scientists say that too much fruit and vegetable waste strips the oxygen from soil, concentrating metals and arsenic that leaches into groundwater.\n\nWhat does that mean for nearby residents? Tap water that glows a strange shade of orange, dyes their bathtubs, and turns eggs black when they're boiled. Mmm.\n\nState officials tell residents that there's no health danger, even though the levels of arsenic, lead and other metals in the drinking water exceed federal standards. [And the water's dark orange. Hello?] Residents who discover that their wells are contaminated find that the state and the companies have known about the problem for a decade or more. When pushed to investigate, the state may take years - one government spokesperson argued that while they have to enforce the law, they don't want to put the processors out of business - and even when they're cited, companies fail to change their practices. Meanwhile, local governments consider spending millions to upgrade water systems and extend municipal water lines to residents with unusable wells. That's generous and all, but if it's Birds Eye's problem, why isn't the company footing the bill? (Detroit Free Press)"

      "text": "Keeping Water Safe With ION Stabilized Oxygen\n\nStabilizing oxygen is a proprietary process in which sodium chloride is added to purified water to increase electrical conductivity. The sodium chloride helps facilitate the process of manufacturing ION, a product that stabilizes the oxygen in the water by separating the oxygen molecules from the water. The electrolysis process starts with a saline solution similar to that used by most hospitals. This saline solution is made up of seven different salts collected from around the world. The entire process takes about 30 days. The end product is called ION (stabilized oxygen). It has a very high concentration of oxygen, safe pH levels, with very little sodium chloride remaining in the product.\n\nION (Stabilized Oxygen) Very Effective For Water Purification\n\nION stands for Ions of Oxygen Negative. It is the negative charge of the ion oxygen molecule that attracts and steals away the positive charge of any anaerobic bacteria in the water. It acts like a magnet attracting and attaching to the bad bacteria or foreign free radical, thus killing them. Anaerobic oxygen cannot live in an oxygen environment thus the ION treatment kills, and eradicates bacteria, some viruses, toxins, fungus, mold, parasites, toxic chemicals and inorganic substances that are either added to or leaches into our drinking water.\n\nION is great for wilderness water treatment. I take it with me when I travel to foreign countries or anyplace where the water is questionable. When ION is used in water that will be stored for emergency purposes, it will keep the water safe for at least five years. I believe every medical kit and 72-hour bug out bag should have a bottle of ION in it at all times. One bottle of ION will last for three months for one person. Every person in the family needs to have at least one bottle of ION for an emergency situation.\n\nDangers Of Non-Purified Or Untreated Water\n\nWhen people drink untreated water, even from a stream in the mountains, it can be dangerous and even deadly if the following bacteria and parasites are present: cholera, typhoid, dysentery, flukes, leeches, giardia, cryptosporidium, hepatitis A and E. coli. The pathogens can cause vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, weight loss, fever, abdominal cramping and extreme pain. Typhoid can cause extremely high fever and illness. Some of them are waterborne and get into the water through fecal matter. Giardia is a parasite that attaches to the intestines of humans and animals. Symptoms include severe headaches, inflamed liver, weakness, anorexia and jaundice. It can be fatal.\n\nFilter Dirty Water Before Using ION\n\nWhen you are filtering water, it is a good idea to remove as many large particles as possible to prevent clogging your filter system. If you do not have a water filter, you must use the clearest water you can find. If you can't find clear water, then strain the water through a bandana, cheesecloth, pantyhose or just a piece of cloth.\n\nAnother effective way to filter water is to use a 2-liter soda bottle and a coffee filter to filter out large particles and sediment. Cut off the top third of the soda bottle. Place the pour spout upside down inside the bottom of the bottle. Place the coffee filter in the top and filter the water through the bottle. After the water has been filtered use ION stabilized oxygen to kill bacteria in the water. ION and coffee filters should be in everyone's emergency kit or 72-hour backpack.\n\nDosage Of ION Stabilized Oxygen\n\n8 drops in 8 ounces of water to purify water\n\n20 drops of ION per gallon to purify water\n\n20 drops in 8 ounces of water for flu, infection or illness\n\nHalve the dose for children\n\nDouble dose for athletes in competition\n\n3-5 drops directly on wounds to kill bacteria\n\n½ bottle (1 ounce) of ION for a 55 gallon drum of water storage\n\n1 (2-ounce) bottle will treat 110 gallons of water storage\n\nIs ION (Stabilized Oxygen) Safer Than Other Products On The Market?\n\nIt has a mild taste similar to sodium chloride (salt) without the harmful side effects of chlorine. ION (stabilized oxygen) is non-toxic to the skin or body and works very well for water purification. That is why it is so much safer to use than chlorine bleach, iodine, colloidal silver or hydrogen peroxide. All these products can be toxic when taken in large doses. ION (stabilized Oxygen) is non-toxic and will never harm you in any way.\n\nION Can Be Taken Internally\n\nION (stabilized oxygen) is well known for killing bacteria in the human body when taken internally and used medicinally as a health supplement. It should be taken at the first sign of flu, cold or any other bacterial infection. All you do is put 20 drops of ION in an 8-ounce glass of water, stir, let it set for a minute and drink it. It has been tested by many labs and has all the documentation to prove its effectiveness against harmful pathogens (disease-causing microbes).\n\nUse ION to sterilize cuts, scratches and bruises; end tooth decay; stop pain and infection of wounds; treat emphysema; fever blisters; herpes; cold sores and first and second degree burns; alleviate headaches, back pain, arthritis and joint aches. ION has been used for bladder infections, kidney infections, sore throats, strep and food poisoning. ION detoxifies insect bites, spider bites, bee stings and mosquito bites. ION will not kill friendly flora or good bacteria. In fact, it stimulates the growth and development of beneficial bacteria.\n\nION is great for plants, root cuttings, transplants, sterilizing cooking tools and surfaces, extending the life of milk and juices, and making yogurt.\n\nOur Bodies Require Oxygen To Rebuild And Repair\n\nOur bodies are amazing in that they require oxygen in every process and function involved in the absorption of nutrients, the reproduction and repair of the healthy cells and the elimination of unhealthy or dead cells. Stabilized oxygen goes into the cells and gives them the much-needed oxygen to rebuild and repair the cells, which helps the body's natural defenses of the immune system.\n\nION Has An Alkaline pH\n\nThe process of making ION is a 30-day brewing process, which removes the acid from the product and makes it an alkaline base. Alkaline base products are better for your health because bacteria and disease cannot grow in an alkaline environment.\n\nShelf Life of ION Stabilized Oxygen.\n\nION stores indefinitely on the shelf if kept in a cool environment and out of direct sunlight.\n\nWater Storage Tanks\n\nI own a 185-gallon water tank. I really like it, and it fits the needs of our family perfectly. This large, cylinder-shaped water tank is ideal for storing water. It tucks away into a corner of a room or garage. It easily fits through doors. It is gravity-fed and has an opening at the top to fill the tank. It has a drain at the bottom and a spigot-type faucet about a third of the way up from the floor to fill smaller containers. I always keep several 5-gallon containers close by just in case I need them. I use a bottle and a half of the ION for the 185-gallon tank and two bottles for the 250-gallon tank. I like to put the ion in at the beginning of the fill so it will mix properly with the water as it fills the tank. If you wait until the end, the ION will not get mixed in properly. ION will keep the water safe for up to five years.\n\nThese tanks come in 185 gallon, 250 gallon and 500 gallon sizes. They are tall and stand upright so there is no need to stack water containers on top of each other. This tank takes up less space in a garage or room than any other water storage tanks. Because it is gravity fed, it does not need a pump to get the water out. There are indentations in the tank so it can be strapped to a wall for extra strength in an earthquake.\n\nThe tankers are shipped from Utah. The shipping costs between $200 and $250, depending on where it is shipped. If you ship two tanks together to the same location, the shipping cost is cut by about 40 percent. Please call for a shipping quote.\n\nThis water storage tanker, ION water treatment, emergency medical supplies, 72-hour backpacks, sewage treatment, wheat grinders, food dehydrators, as well as many other self sufficiency and survival products can be found on my website \n\nInformation in this article is for educational purposes only. Always consult with a qualified medical physician. ION has had many great results and has testimonials from many satisfied customers; however, is not intended to treat any medical condition. It is sold only as a dietary supplement or water treatment.\n\nFood Storage Meals In Mylar® Pouches\n\nThese ready-to-cook meals can be stored long-term and cooked quickly. Everything is in the pouch. You just add water and cook for 20 minutes, and the meal is done. The food comes in Mylar® pouches; each pouch makes four servings.

He had been decomposed and had been there for about two weeks by the time they found him…\nEnough reason to re-treat your water?\n\nWater treatment plants do not filter out many pathogens and debris. They also add things like fluoride that is very toxic to the human body. Fluoride competes with iodine in the body for absorption and Fluoride wins and you become iodine deficient. This is very common in areas where they fluoridate the water. Chlorine is used in many facilities and this combines with ammonia to for Chloramines that smell. This gives the water a pungent smell. The chlorine residual found in tap water also kills the friendly bacteria in your intestines that keep you from getting sick. Tap water also contains heavy metals that their filters don't get out.\n\nMost soft drinks use tap water to make them. They use filters, but do not eliminate the fluoride and many other harmful things.\n\nChlorine does not kill staph, strep, and other germs like the tuberculosis germ. Some facilities are now using ozone to do some germ killing and this is better than Chlorine for some things.\n\nThe best water is steam distilled water. This is pure and very good for you. I make it everyday in my home distiller and then add some good ionized minerals to it, but you don't have to do that. It tastes so much better than any water you can buy or make from home filters. The home filters, by the way, are not very good. They mostly take the taste issues out of the water because they just use granulated charcoal and an osmosis filter to take out some of the debris. Many things go past these types of filters"

As a result, homeowners throughout Northern Virginia and Maryland may notice a chlorine taste and smell in their tap water. This is in addition to temporary discoloration and the presence of sediment. Fairfax Water, which treats the majority of the drinking water in the Northern Virginia and Maryland areas, will use free chlorine as the primary disinfectant in its drinking water treatment process during this time. For most of the year, chloramines are used because they present a less prominent taste and smell than free chlorine.\n\nAlthough chlorine is an efficient way to kill harmful bacteria, it does have its' drawbacks. Not only does it taste and smell bad, but it can dry out your skin, fade your clothing, and dry out the rubber seals in your appliances. It may also be harmful to the health of your family over time.\n\nAccording to Prince William County and Fairfax County websites, \"Customers who are sensitive to the taste and odor of chlorine can place an open container of tap water in their refrigerators which enables the chlorine to dissipate. However, they should replace refrigerated drinking water every two or three days with a fresh supply.\"\n\nInstead of worrying about the effects of free chlorine on the health of your family or your pets, call My Plumber Heating and Air today to inquire about our water conditioning options. My Plumber Heating and Air offers several water-conditioning treatments to remove impurities.

Use water from the kitchen tap, where it will be fresh from the mains. If you get water from the bathroom tap it may be coming from a storage tank, so it won't be as good for drinking.\n\nIf you want to give your baby a drink of water, boil tap water and then allow it to cool. You should only need to give your baby extra water if she's formula-fed and:\n\nBreastfed babies under six months can get all their fluid needs from breastmilk so shouldn't need a separate drink of water.\n\nOnce your baby is six months, you can give her a drink of water straight from the tap, there's no need to boil it first. You can use a water filter if you want, but make sure you follow the filter manufacturer's instructions. Keep filtered water in the fridge, as the filtering process removes some of the additives, such as chlorine, used to keep tap water fresh.\n\nIf you feel more comfortable boiling all water until your baby's a year old, carry on doing this, as you may find it less confusing.\n\nIf you have your own spring, well or borehole in the garden, get your water supply checked before giving it to your baby. Many private water supplies are high in nitrate levels and not recommended for babies. If this applies to you, then natural bottled mineral water would be a safer option until your baby is six months old.\n\nWhen buying bottled water, try to use still water that's low in sodium. Look for Na on the label, which means sodium, and choose one that contains 200mg or less of Na per litre. Evian or Volvic are both good options. Also make sure you boil and cool the water first to make it safe"

      "text": "Poor water quality and inadequate water distribution systems are more than a rural problem, with communities of varying sizes across the globe struggling to provide clean water for their inhabitants. Enter AguaClara - a water treatment project originating from Cornell University currently tackling this challenge in Honduras. I recently got the chance to talk to AguaClara's founder, Monroe Weber-Shirk, about his work to date and plans for the future.\n\nThis Big City: Tell us about AguaClara!\n\nMonroe Weber-Shirk: I worked in Central America in the 1980s in refugee camps and learned to know Jacobo Nuñez who went on to form Agua Para el Pueblo (Water For People) – an NGO in Honduras which builds water distribution systems for rural communities. They've been doing that for 25 years, and when I reconnected with Jacobo Nunez in 2004, one of the questions he asked me was: 'What can we do about the fact that we're piping contaminated surface water to these communities?' The water supply systems they were building took a water source, such as a mountain stream or river, piped it down to a distribution tank, and then down to the houses in the town. He was concerned about water quality, and they didn't really have any good options for cleaning up that water. My background is Environmental Engineering, I've been very interested in water filtration and water treatment in general, and when I heard that question, I realised that I didn't know how to solve the problem in that context. I knew how to solve it in Ithaca, New York, but not in Honduras in resource-poor communities without reliable electricity.\n\nTBC: Can you give us a brief overview of the technology behind it?\n\nMWS: We add a coagulant to the water that comes into an AguaClara water treatment plant, which essentially coats the particles in the water and makes them sticky, like a glue. We send the water through a flocculator, where the particles collide with each other and stick together, hence they grow in size and become large enough so you can see individual flocs. A floc is an aggregate of many particles, and flocs look kind of like snow in the water – they grow to be more than a millimetre in size. They have a higher sedimentation velocity, so when you send the water to a sedimentation tank, the flocs settle quickly and you end up having clean water coming off the top of the sedimentation tank. That clean water then goes through a filter, and then finally we add chlorine to disinfect the water. Chlorine is only effective in clean water.\n\nOh, and we do all of this without electricity! Water enters an AguaClara plant 1.5 m higher than it leaves the plant, and this difference in elevation is the potential energy that powers the water all the way through the plant. We had to invent a new type of filter, a Stacked Rapid Sand Filter, in order to add filters that can be backwashed without electricity. Operating without electricity means a huge cost savings every year a plant is operating. It means significant infrastructure that has almost no carbon footprint. And, it means our plants are really lovely and quiet without the din of motors and pumps.\n\nTBC: What kind of changes have you witnessed in areas where AguaClara has been implemented?\n\nMWS: Tamara is a good example. It is a community of about 3,500 people, and it's home to an AguaClara water treatment plant which was built in 2008. One of the things the Water Board was able to do was to increase the water tariff. The Water Board is a community organisation elected by the townspeople and has legal status in Honduras. They are only able to raise the water rates with the explicit approval of the community. A rate increase means community members were prepared to pay more for water after they started receiving clean water. That is really significant – people are willing to pay more for clean water. That's what makes this whole system sustainable. The tariff was raised more than one time, completely changing the Water Board. It used to be essentially bankrupt, and there were community members who refused to pay the tariff. Now with higher quality water that people value, the water board has the guts to cut off the water for nonpayment, so people pay. Compliance went way up. The Water Board started operating with excess capital. They bought more land to protect their water source. They started investing in infrastructure, doing things like improving the distribution network in the town. They were also able to invest in AguaClara's newly invented Stacked Rapid Sand Filters in 2011 using the money they had raised from the increased tariff.\n\nThe more profound change for communities is the improvement in health. Community members used to carry diarrhea medicine in their pockets because they were sick so often. Time and resources were spent caring for sick family members. Now they drink water from the tap instead of having to buy bottled water.\n\nTBC: Could AguaClara be deployed on an urban scale?\n\nMWS: Yes, this can be used on an urban scale. There is nothing technical preventing us from going larger, and I fully expect this to happen. It turns out the technical challenge is going smaller. We currently have plants that are serving communities between 1,500 and 15,000 people. Knowing how to do this for 15,000 people is achievable, but knowing how to do it for 1,000 people is hard.\n\nTBC: I think it's great that your designs are open source and available for free online. Can you tell us some more about this aspect?\n\nMWS: Open source means that all developments in AguaClara are published on our wiki. This simplifies things for us as we are inventing things at a pretty high rate, and not having to invest in patent law makes our lives simpler. It also earns us friends! When we walked in to the government ministry in charge of water in Honduras, their first question was 'Is it patented?' The reason for this is they have been screwed so many times by patented technologies, that they don't want to use them again. Open source means anyone on the planet can go on to our website and get a full design for a municipal water treatment plant. Currently, only students from Cornell, where AguaClara is being developed, can contribute to this Wiki, but the information is open to all. I would love to collaborate with other universities. We post a long series of challenges every semester and it would be exciting to have multiple teams working on different campus to solve those challenges.\n\nTBC: What about members of the 8 communities that have AguaClara water treatment plants? Can they contribute?\n\nMWS: Yes! We get ongoing feedback from the existing plants, which immediately affects research and design teams here at Cornell. There's a good deal of knowledge sharing also happening in Honduras. Agua Para el Pueblo is developing an association of communities that have AguaClara plants. One of the challenges of maintaining water supply systems is that they require some level of technical assistance forever. One way of achieving that is by developing an association of communities that have AguaClara plants.\n\nTBC: Do local people benefit from training to maintain the system?\n\nMWS: The system works because the communities built these plants, they own them, and they hire employees to run the plants. Agua Para el Pueblo provides training for those plant operators, and it's all done locally. Local ownership and relationships built on trust are the key concepts that makes this system sustainable.\n\nTBC: How can other students and young entrepreneurs take their ideas from a concept to a marketable product?\n\nMWS: What has made our system of evolving technologies work is, first of all, we have a large student team. Knowledge is shared from one generation of that team to the next by having students work on the team for a year or more, and students help train the next generation. There has to be a sharing of knowledge, and peer to peer learning is critical. Developing technology that's good enough to fly in the real world requires something really good. It's easy to make junk. Making something that can be scaled up and be something really significant requires doing a really great job. That doesn't happen in a year. You can't build a project in a semester and somehow save the world. I provide long-term continuity on this project. I'm going to hang around and keep working on this, and that's part of what makes this work.\n\nTBC: What does the future hold?\n\nMWS: My dream has always been huge. The need for safe drinking water is huge. More than 1 billion people don't have access to safe drinking water. We did very rough calculations that there are hundreds of millions of people that would benefit from AguaClara-style technology. If our goal is to eventually reach that many people, we have to figure out how to disseminate that knowledge globally. Currently we've got eight plants in Honduras and it's a tiny project, but we have the ability to deliver designs in an automated fashion. Just like Henry Ford delivered cars out of his factory at an incredible pace, we can deliver customised CAD drawings and designs at a rate of about 1 every 10 minutes. In the foreseeable future, we could provide all the designs that the planet needs. The challenge is identifying partners who can build these facilities. In Honduras it's Agua Para el Pueblo. We're seeking partners in other countries to take these technologies and begin implementing them"

Trendley Dean,7 who conducted the original studies of naturally fluoridated teeth in the 1930s, had observed that at concentrations of fluoride in the water around 1 ppm, approximately 10% of the population had mottled teeth, now recognised as dental fluorosis, and that at higher concentrations the prevalence of dental fluorosis rose rapidly.\n\nNature in her wisdom, locked up most of the fluoride present in the Earth's crust in the form of complex fluoride ores, buried deep within the crust, but man has mined these ores and released the fluoride freely into the environment, where it is continually accumulating.\n\nFluoride either inhibits enzymes by distorting their molecular structure, as in the case of cytochrome C peroxidase,19 or by combining with their essential trace-element co-factors.\n\nCommunitywaterfluoridation is the process of artificially adjusting fluoride levels in drinking water supplies with the intention of improving oral health.\n\nCommunitywaterfluoridation owes its origin in part to the research of Dr. Frederick McKay, who pressed the dental community for an investigation into the \"Colorado stain,\" which is now known as dental fluorosis.\n\nFluoride's potential to impair thyroid function is most clearly illustrated by the fact that -- up until the 1970s -- European doctors used fluoride as a thyroid-suppressing medication for patients with hyperthyroidism (over-active thyroid).\n\nen.wikipedia.org /wiki/Water_fluoridation_controversy (5687 words)\n\n[No title](Site not responding.

      "text": "The water used in your fountains will effect how your item looks and functions over time. Keeping fountains full that are not hooked up to auto fill lines can be one of the main chores that make your waterfall operational. The correct use of water will also vastly lengthen the life span of the water fountain and will reduce the maintenance and cleaning necessary. Many people do not at first realize that it makes much difference what king of water is used, probably because the different types of water all look the same to the naked eye. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is what we do not see that can be problematic.\n\nDistilled Water\n\nWater which has been distilled is typically recommended on indoor water features. The distillation process removes most water free radicals including mineral deposits. 'Hard water' mineral deposits will cake onto fountain surfaces over time, especially around the edge of the water trough or where the water level rises and falls frequently over time as it evaporates and is filled accordingly. These deposits will also interfere with effective pump functioning where the water must proceed through narrow channels and pump propellers as it is forced through the system. Mineral build-up is a common source of pump failure. You can by distilled water in supermarkets usually in one gallon or 5 gallon plastic containers.\n\nTap Water\n\nCity (tap) water is not recommended for indoor fountain use. Many people begin by using distilled water, then over time graduate to just filling the fountain with tap water. If you forget to buy distilled water it is very easy to just fill from the tap, and easy habits are hard to break. Using tap water is not recommended because it will greatly increase the time needed to clean the fountain later on. The hard water deposits from tap water are not east to remove. You may also encounter other problems from using tap water including pump failure, decreased water flow resulting from obstruction and unsightly deposits on glass, mirror, stone and metal surfaces.\n\nFiltered Water\n\nSome people can't keep an adequate supply of distilled water on hand, or forget to buy it regularly. In such cases a faucet mounted water filter can be better then nothing at all when it comes to keeping your fountain full. The filter will remove some calcium and hard water deposits and it very convenient, of course, but is not officially recommended over distilled unless it simply serves to steer people away from just using plain tap fountain water.\n\nReverse Osmosis Water\n\nReverse Osmosis water is obtained through the use of a Reverse Osmosis (RO) filtration system. This is the best kind of water we can use on a fountain or waterfall. Unfortunately, RO systems can be costly so you may need to spend a little more up front to get the benefits of this type of water. You will also need a small space or cabinet to house the RO system near your water feature since they are typically external units and not housed within the fountain reservoir due to their complexity and size. People usually employ RO systems only on very big custom water features or healthcare type installations, using them on smaller household waterfalls can be overkill."

      "text": "... some substances may prove more difficult to manage in bottled than tap water. This is generally because bottled water is stored for longer periods and at higher temperatures than water distributed in piped distribution systems. Control of materials used in containers and closures for bottled waters is, therefore, of special concern. In addition, some micro-organisms, which are normally of little or no public health significance, may grow to higher levels in bottled waters. This growth appears to occur less frequently in gasified water and in water bottled in glass containers compared to still water and water bottled in plastic containers. However, the public health significance of this remains little understood, especially for vulnerable individuals, such as infants and children, pregnant women, immuno-compromised individuals and the elderly. In regard to infants, as bottled water is not sterile, it should be disinfected - for example, by boiling for one minute - prior to its use in the preparation of infant formula.\n\nThere have also been reports of fraud in which ordinary tap water has been added to used mineral water bottles and sold as the original article. Consumers may not be able to detect this by taste alone and, if concern is warranted, should examine the closures of bottled waters carefully before purchase and insist on seeing bottles opened in their presence in restaurants and other food and beverage service establishments.......\n\n--------\n\nThe report goes on to debunk the idea that hard water has health benefits as opposed to soft water.\n\n----------\n\nChecked out the FSAI website searched for bottled water and found this: The FSAI has received a number of queries about statements which indicate that the plastic used to manufacture drinks bottles (a material called polyethylene terephthalate or PET) contains a potentially carcinogenic cancer-causing element, diethylhydroxylamine or DEHA. It has also been stated that repeated rinsing and reuse of such bottles can cause the plastic to break down, resulting in release of the DEHA into the liquid contained in the bottle. These statements appear on the internet or are sent by e-mail and purport to come from the Australian Department of Natural Resources and Mines.\n\n----------------------\n\nFollowing testing of bottled water carried out by environmental health officers of the HSE, the specialist food distributor Vejas, Churchfield Business Park, Cork, has initiated the withdrawal of two batches of mineral water due to levels of arsenic and lead above that prescribed by the European Communities (Natural Mineral Waters, Spring Waters and Other Waters in Bottles or Containers) Regulations 2005 (S.I. No. 79 of 2005).\n\nThe affected products are:\n\nVytautas Natural Mineral Water\n\n0.5 L Bottle, Best before 15.06.2007\n\nBatch L610\n\nVytautas Natural Mineral Water\n\n1.5 L Bottle, Best before: 13.09.2007\n\nBatch L969\n\nVejas, Cork has contacted all premises supplied with the product to make them aware of the withdrawal.\n\nWhile the levels identified are in excess of those prescribed, there is no immediate risk to consumers' health from the water."

      "text": "Drinking Water Quality\n\nDefinition\n\nThe percentage of the surveyed population that\nreceive their water from community water supplies, whose drinking water\ncomplies with the Drinking Water Standards of New Zealand 1995\nrelating to E. coli and Cryptosporidium. About 85 percent of the New\nZealand population drink water from community supplies.\n\nRelevance\n\nMaintaining good drinking water quality is\ncritical for human health and quality of life outcomes. The health risk\nto consumers from water-borne disease in drinking water supplies comes\nfrom two main types of microbiological organisms: bacteria (such as\nfaecal coliforms, and E. coli), and parasites (such as Giardia, and\nCryptosporidium). Improvements in this indicator ensure that less of\nthe population is at risk of water-borne disease and other contaminants.\n\nCurrent Level And Trends\n\nThe majority of New Zealanders are supplied with\ncommunity drinking water that is free of micro-organisms. The\nproportion of New Zealanders whose drinking water, measured at the tap,\ncomplies with the 1995 drinking water standards regarding E. coli\nincreased from 69 percent in 1994 to 80 percent in 2002. Overall the\nlevel of E. coli compliance has fluctuated over the second half of the\n1990s from between 80 and 86 percent. Most water supplies serving large\npopulation areas are fully compliant with the 1995 standards. The main\nreason for non-compliance is inadequate monitoring rather than the\nactual contamination of drinking water. Inadequate monitoring is the\nreason behind the slight decrease in E. coli compliance between 2001\nand 2002.\n\nCompliance with the 1995 drinking water standards\nfor Cryptosporidium is measured at the water treatment plant rather\nthan at the tap. Data is not available for Cryptosporidium compliance\nbefore 1996. Since 1996, the compliance rate has increased slightly\nfrom a value of 77 percent in 1996 to 81 percent in 2002. Between these\nyears there was some measured fluctuation in levels of compliance with\na low of 75 percent in 1997 and 1998.\n\nWhile the proportion of consumers with fully\ncompliant drinking water supplies has remained fairly flat since 1996,\nthis reflects the replacement of the 1984 standards with the more\nstringent standards adopted in 1996 rather than any decline in water\ntreatment over this time.\n\nFigure EN2.1 Proportion of the surveyed\npopulation served with water that meets drinking water standards,\n1994-2002 Source: Ministry of Health (2002b)\n\nRegional Differences\n\nGroundwater sources supply drinking water for\nabout 40 percent of the New Zealand population, while about 60\npercent of people are supplied from surface (catchment) water. Most\nwater in catchment headwaters is of good quality, but problems with the\nquality of some groundwater sources have been identified.\n\nThere is considerable regional variation in the\npopulation served with drinking water that is fully compliant. In 2002,\nonly 13 percent of the population in Otago and 21 percent of the\npopulation in Southland were served with drinking water that fully\ncomplied with the 1995 drinking water standards. Waikato and Northland\nalso had particularly low compliance rates, varying between 32 percent\nand 38 percent of the population covered. Compliance in Auckland,\nTauranga and Wellington, however, was close to 100 percent. The vast\nmajority of non-compliance is due to inadequate monitoring, rather than\nactual contamination. This is the main reason for low levels of\ncompliance in Northland, Waikato and Otago in 2002.\n\nWhere drinking water quality is affected, the\nagricultural sector is seen as the most important source of water\nquality problems.75\n\nInternational Comparison\n\nOverall, the quality of New Zealand water is\nhigh by international standards. New Zealand's water supplies are\nfree of many of the diseases that result in sickness and death in other\ncountries. However, the incidence of infection from Giardia in water\nsupplies is 85 per 100,000 people, which is considered high compared to\nthe reported rates for other western countries.76"

      "text": "Call Jack today at (949) 842-6122\n\nTags\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIs it okay to use a water softener with PristineHydro?\nYes, water softeners will reduce build up and scaling to extend the life of your water heater, water pipes, fixtures, and appliances. Using a water softener (with good potable water) in combination with the PristineHydro filter system will extend the life of the RO membrane.\n\nI use a water distiller, and the taste of the water is flat and heavy. What does the water taste like from the PristineHydro system?\nDistillation does not remove sulfuric and nitric acids or chlorine. Water from PristineHydro tastes like natural spring water, with a nice, light, refreshing mineral taste. PristineHydro Technology restores the water's natural mineral properties, improves the surface tension and biological availability, and increases hydration of your body. Everything you use water for will taste better.\n\nWhat is PristineHydro Enhancing Technology?\nThis new technology is exclusive to the PristineHydro. It is the first of its kind to be introduced to purify home drinking water, which offers ultra-purified, sterilized, restructured, re-mineralized magnesium bicarbonate water.\n\nHow does the PristineHydro compare to buying bottled water for drinking?\nNo highly toxic plastic bottles, less trash, more environmentally friendly, no trips to the store.\n\nIf you have hard water and no water softener can you still use PristineHydro Purifier?\nIt is not required. PristineHydro provides the highest quality RO membrane in order to provide the best (rejection) quality of water for the longest period of time. However, hard water will shorten the life of the membrane and therefore it might require replacing more often.\n\nHow does PristineHydro compare to buying bottled water for drinking?\nNo highly toxic plastic bottles, less trash, more environmentally friendly, no trips to the store, and no monthly billing required. Tests indicate that some bottled water may be of poor quality and often does not meet the same standards required for tap water.\n\nHow long do the filters last?\nIt depends on the input water, and how much you use the filter, however, in most cases the 5 micron and the deionization cartridges should be replaced every 1000 gallons of the under the counter and 500 gallons for the on the counter units.\n\nHow much are replacement filters?\n\nInlet 5 micron: $30.00\n\nKDF/HA/AC filter: $85.00\n\nR.O. Membrane: $175.00\n\nReplacement special deionization cartridges: $65.00 each\n\nReplacement pH cartridge: $75.00\n\nCarbon post: $30.00\n\nCan I change the filters myself?\nMost people can easily change the filters themselves."

Well, after some research I came to the conclusion that fluoride is a danger to the public and we've been deceived by the government once again! Do your own research and make up your own mind but here are some sites to get you started. And I'm sure there are people that will call me a quack but I'm just trying to warn people there MIGHT be something more to the fluoride in the water than we were lead to believe.\n\nWow! You have, like, totally opened my eyes! Come to think of it, I always thought the water in my faucet tasted a little funny. Besides, if youtube said it was true, than it has to be. Seriously, I think you might have discovered the next Watergate scandal in the U.S.A.! You know, I think the government is trying to cover this up with pointless issues like the waterboarding incidents in Guantanamo Bay, but you single-handedly exposed the government for what it truly is!\n\nSpeaking of which, I think there is another chemical harmful to us that the government isn't warning us about: hydrochloric acid! That's right! Your body probably contains several milliliters of the stuff right now, but the government never tells you. In fact, the government has already programmed vital organs in your body like your liver and your pancreas to produce this acid on it's own. Therefore, the only way to rid yourself of this wretched acid is to remove your own liver and/or pancreas. Don't worry, they're probably not vital organs, probably.\n\nWell, from this point on, I vow to never drink tap water again in order to rid myself of the horrible fluorine once and for all. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to brush my teeth.\n\nBilly vs. Tree -- The epic struggle of boy versus tree.\nSonic Colores -- It looks like it's going to be a good game because I love how the way it makes me grow.\n\nWow, sarcasm! That's original!\nIts not a matter of filtered or unfiltered, its a matter of whether you want extra chemicals designed to destroy organic matter added after it has been filtered and treated. Note the same stuff material is usually added in sufficient quantities to melt steel if it were undiluted.\n\nYes the human body can withstand certain amounts of flouride. But like a carcinogen or any other toxin, do you really want to chance it if it can be avoided?\n\nWe can withstand certain amounts of arsenic too. Doesn't mean you should drink it on a regular basis though.\n\nTheMy question is ... why would they? When it comes to government actions, I'm as big a sceptic as the next guy but who supposedly gains from this?\n\nAre there huge fluoride manufacturers pouring billions into politicians' pockets just so they can shift their product? If so, how would they make that money back when drinking water is provided at minimal cost?\n\nI know the whole fluoride-in-water issue has been controversial since at least the 1950s, but I just can't see any benefit to the government or to anyone else in a position to influence the government. On balance, therefore, I'm prepared to give the politicians the benefit of the doubt on this one.\n\nType of Water\nTo avoid nuisance algaes growing in your tank, it is recommended to get Reverse Osmosis De-Ionized water. You can often times buy this kind of water at the fish store where you found your saltwater pet. You can also buy RO water at your supermarket, as well as distilled water. What you don't want to use is tap water from the sink. It contains elements that are detrimental to your saltwater tank. Chlorine, Phosphate, Nitrate, Fluoride and more are readily detectable in tap water, but your saltwater tank needs pure water to keep your fish healthy.\n\nHawk TheNah, the you can't convince the converted no matter how much substantiated evidence you present. Cognitive dissonance. It's great reading what those who believe immunization causes autism even though a few dozen repeated studies cannot prove it and have conclusively disproven it.\n\nOh god... chemistry people. The stuff can't phucking harm you in the form and the level it's in.\nYou can't filter it either: it's dissolved.\n\nWhen fluoride harms you it doesn't do it by tiny gradual stages. It just does it. It's not some cumulative poison like lead or cadmium for goodness sake! if the calcium in your system starts getting eaten away by Fluoride you DO notice it and it HURTS.\n\nA guy working in his backyard here a few years ago, using hydrofluoric acid on some concrete got a small bit splashed on his hands. He wasn't wearing protection and he didn't have a solution that would neutralise it. So he jumped in his swimming pool hoping that would save him. He died very fast.\n---\nMan I wonder what these guys would think if they knew that nitroglycerine was a very effective heart medicine. -one of the most explosive conventional materials ever developed. Whoops, now I've told them lol!\n\nI care to disagree Ozone. Are you familiar with the concept of lead poisoning? It works the same way. Slow accumulation and exposure, usually through water. Nobody thought lead pipes made drinking water dangerous, until people starting manifesting systems and now we mostly use PVC or copper.\n\nIn fact any material harmful to the body can accrue to the point where it affects your health over time. Its called Poisoning. Same way Cigarettes can give you cancer or alcohol can wreck your liver. Some people get away with consuming them for years but in the long run frequent exposure WILL harm you.\n\nThat's the problem: it's NOT like lead. At all, in any way. the human body has a problem with Al heavy metals from uranium, to cobalt, to mercury, to cadmium, to lead... And so on.\n\nGold is OK though, you can eat that if you like :D\n\nBut The people pushing that agenda are nuts. Painful, annoying nutjuobs.\n\nEven non-radioactive Uranium, which apparently IS NOT innately harmful will do a LOT more harm to your internal organs if it keeps building up compared to the fluoride you consume in fluoridated water. ...which doesn't ;)\n\nI'm sorry to say this, but ceasing consumption of fluoridated water will provide you as much protection from harm and death as a hat covered with aluminium foil. :)\n\nozoneocean But\n\nTellOstensibly municipal water supplies add a pre-bottled mix of flouride that is safe. This does nothing to take local chemical content into account. 15 people died in Almira Michigan when the high salt content of their water interacted with the flouride and produced Sodium fluorosilicate. Sodium fluorosilicate becomes deadly at .2g within an exposure period up to 12 hours. Hydrogen fluoride is even worse and can result in chemical burns, and I don't have to tell you how much hydrogen is available in h2O.\n\nI'm not going to pedal you the crack-pot theories about it being forced medication or the illuminati trying to kill us. I simply know that its an outmoded and hazardous material. Like asbestos, it was once considered beneficial but is not safe to use. Seriously though, enough people brush their teeth now that its not even needed. Let's at least not take the risk.\n\nHydrogen fluoride is even worse and can result in chemical burns, and I don't have to tell you how much hydrogen is available in h2O.\n\nThere is a lot of Hydrogen in there. Problem is, getting it out of there. You need intense heat to create hydrogen fluoride and even then, it is a highly reactive material which is quick to break down into other fluorides. That's why you usually don't see too much of it outside of smelting plants and factories. In nature, you don't see too much of it outside of active volcanoes. I don't think you have to worry too much about tap water magically converting itself to hydrofluoric acid. Even if you boil your water you aren't exposing it to enough heat to cause that reaction.\n\nimshard TellIt's NOT cumulative because of the kind of chemical it is. It has no trouble passing through the body, unlike the aforementioned heavy metals.\n\nNutritionists are not respected professionals. What they practise is 1/10th common knowledge science and 90% pop theory on food. I'm not surprised they tell you things about Fluoride. As for medical professionals, being a doctor doesn't confer sense on someone unfortunately. I knew doctors that practice acupuncture and homoeopathy. By that token- YES, abstaining from tap water WILL be god for you, because the placebo effect will probably have some bearing then ;)\n\nAs we keep saying- the fluoride is not in a form or in a sufficient amount to affect the calcium. Besides, The body doesn't produce calcium, stars do that. You just ingest the stuff. But the fact is that most studies show that even when you drink a lot of milk or take a lot of calcium salt supplements not even much of that goes to the bones. You really don't have to worry about fluoride stripping it- you ingest more calcium than you do fluoride... If the stuff in toothpaste and tap water did work that way it'd be nullified by your food intake anyway.\n\nAs to your anecdote about the deaths in the small town, a source would be good. But I'd seriously doubt the veracity of the scenario since it amazingly unlikely. I've no doubt those people could have died from exposure to that chemical, but I don't believe it had anything to do with the fluoride ions added to their drinking water - since the standard process is such that it would be impossible. Indeed, I know for a fact that we have fluoridated water supplies here with extremely high salt content and yet nothing of the sort has ever occurred. (or could, logically, if you go by the chemistry).\nSo if those people actually DID die and it really was from exposure to said chemical, I would speculate that the source was somewhat different from the one you believe. -accidental chemical spill, supply tampering, a catastrophic breakdown or error with some mechanical process or other that resulted in the contaminate being introduced.\n\n-Such things happen. Not song ago Several miners became extremely ill after water contaminated by uranium tailings leaked into the reservoir of their drinking water. The situation wasn't discovered for several days, during which time the poor men had bein increasing their exposure.\n\nlet me make this simple.\nFluoride in almost any form bonds to calcium, that calcium is then not usable by your body. Very few forms of it are safe for consumption, and it doesn't take much for its chemical structure to change or reform into one that is hazardous.\n\nWater treatment facilities regularly superheat and re-condense water to purify it. Thus increasing the odds of unwanted chemical reactions.\n\nFluoride only works topically to protect the dental enamel. There is no benefit whatsoever, and considerable evidence of harm, from ingesting fluoride. Many dentists are aware of this fact.\n\nHalf of all ingested fluoride remains in the skeletal system and accumulates with age.\n\nFluoride is an effective insecticide amongst other things and works by destroying critical enzymes (G-proteins). This is how it negatively affects human health as well. For example, fluoride disrupts thyroid health by displacing iodine uptake in the thyroid gland and it also causes calcification of the pineal gland, which disregulates the pituitary gland, which is the master gland of the endocrine system. Pineal calcification is especially prevalent in teens, who are going through growth spurts. Fluoride accretes in bone, and bone turns over more rapidly during periods of growth. Who knows a teen with disrupted sleep habits? Fluoridated communities have higher rates of hip fractures, and higher rates of cancer.\n\nMoney saved from halting water fluoridation programs can be more wisely spent on public health education about diet and topical fluoride varnishes for those at risk for dental decay.\n\nBefore it is added to water, most fluoride is purchased from factories and powerplants as a byproduct and classified as toxic waste by the EPA.\n\nMore benefit could be obtained from spending the same money on hygiene and public health programs as on fluoride.\n\nDeny it all you want but the fact is minerals and not just heavy metals become trapped in the body. If they didn't we'd fall apart into greasy pools of fluid.\n\nPimshard PMy mother works for Health Canada. Her job is to determine whether things are safe to be eaten. I just asked her about this, and she basically confirmed what Ozone has been sayingNo one has mentioned the chlorine that they also add to the water. I know that's added to reduce the number of bacteria in the water but good god. I've tasted US tap water and it was horrible. I'll never go near that shit. If I order a coke in a restaurant and it turns out that it was made in a post mix machine (cola in syrup form mixed with carbonated tap water) I have to turn it away because even that tastes revolting (and no, I'm not one of those pansies that ask before hand and starts to whine if they say yes. I can easily taste it).\n\nI have a funny story. Do you people remember a Simpson episode where Bart insulted Australia and he had to go there to apologize? The whole thing started because Bart found out that water in the southern hemisphere turned counter clockwise while it turned clockwise in America and called Australia to check. When they visited the US embassy over there the toilet system had been rigged to force the water to turn clockwise so that the US personnel would feel more at home. I never figured how true this joke was until I heard of this particular case.\n\nWell, there used to be a US army base in Iceland near where I lived and the local government one day realized that the army was shipping water to the base from America. Figuring that was a bit wasteful, Icelandic government representatives contacted the army officials and asked why they simply didn't buy water from them. The Army asked for samples of tap water to test which was quickly provided. Shortly after the Army responded with a request to receive unfiltered water to test. Apparently they thought that the water had been treated because the purity levels were considered too high. They were told that this was not the case and the water was unfiltered. Naturally the water was qualified and the US troops stationed there were treated with local water but here's the kicker. It was decided that the water should, despite it's purities, be treated with chlorine and fluoride anyways, so that the soldiers would feel more like home.\n\nThose were my two cents.\nIf you have any other questions, please deposit a quarter.\nThis space for rent.\n\nForget fluoride, I've discovered there's something even more toxic in the water supply. It can cause results such as damage to the central nervous system, lungs and eyes creating symptoms such as disorientation, breathing difficulty, vision changes, damage to cell membranes, collapse of the alveoli in the lungs, myopia, retinal detachment and seizures.\n\nYes that's right the fiend I speak of is... Oxygen! Granted this only occurs from exposure to pure oxygen, yet oxygen is a toxin and you'll notice it doesn't accumlate to unsafe levels in the body and kill you. The point is, just because something is toxic one way doesn't make it completely harmful. In fact pretty much anything good for you has it's bad points too.\n\nHere's another lovely example you seem to think calcium is harmless correct? Well then perhaps some Calcium Hydroxide should be perfectly healthy? I mean it's just Calcium, hydrogen and oxygen right? Let's see:\n\nSo wait, good things can be bad for you under certain conditions? It might even interest you to know Calcium Hydroxide is used to remove solute from drinking water as part of sewage treatment AND as a Calcium supplement in mineral fortified baby formulas.\n\nBut by all means let's worry about a little diluted fluoride your only getting small doses of at a time. As a user of heavily fluoridated toothpaste (Neutra Fluor 5000+, look it up it's the most fluoride you can have in toothpaste) and a drinker of tap water I have not as of yet ever had any adverse effects to my health from it, unless you count hardening of the enamel on my teeth an adverse effect.\n\nThe fact is most things are harmful if they are handled incorrectly, the fluoride in the water supply is about as toxic as the oxygen. Which is to say, very under the right conditions which fortunatly, they aren't.\n\nThe History of Fluoridation In the early 1900s, Dr. Frederick S. McKay began an almost 30-year search for the cause of the staining of teeth that was prevalent in Colorado, where he practiced dentistry. In his investigation, McKay found the condition common in other states, including Texas, where it was known as \"Texas teeth.\" In 1928, he concluded that such teeth, although stained, showed \"a singular absence of decay,\" and that both the staining and the decay resistance were caused by something in the water. In 1931, the \"something\" was identified as fluoride. ....In 1943, he reported that the ideal amount of fluoride was one part per million parts of water.\n\nThe next step was to determine whether water engineering could copy nature's amazing dental health benefit. At several test sites, the fluoride concentration of the public water supply was adjusted to one part per million. One such test was conducted in the neighboring cities of Newburgh and Kingston, New York. ...After ten years, the children of Newburgh had 58% fewer decayed teeth than those of nonfluoridated Kingston. ....\n\nToo much fluoride can cause dental fluorosis, which, in its mildest form, causes small, white, virtually invisible opaque areas on teeth. In severe form, fluorosis results in brownish mottling. However, dental fluorosis is not caused by artificial fluoridation, because the levels are kept low enough to avoid this effect.\nquoted -- \n\nThe National Academies of Science did a study where they found health problems in people who have fluoride levels at or near 4mg/L in their water, which is the highest level approved by EPA. 200,000 people in America have water at this level and they show a higher degree of developing severe tooth enamel fluorosis and also bone fractures. 1.4 million Americans have fluoride water levels at 2mg/L, the EPA secondary recommended level, and the studies show mixed results, with some moderate tooth enamel fluorosis but not enough to be a health risk beyond tooth coloration, and inadequate data for bone fractures.\nsource --  [www8.nationalacademies.org]\n\nSo it looks to me that there is some legitimate concern about water fluoridation at very high levels around 4 ppm. But I wasn't able to find any studies showing any health problems with populations who have water fluoridation at the ADA recommended 1 ppm.\n\nShade Here's another lovely example you seem to think calcium is harmless correct? Well then perhaps some Calcium Hydroxide should be perfectly healthy? I mean it's just Calcium, hydrogen and oxygen right? Let's see:\n\nI'm sorry but that's a stupid example. Sure calcium, in it's pure form, may be good for you but Calcium Hydroxide is a chemical compound. When you mix different elements together you normally get something with drastically different properties.\n\nTake for example chlorine and sodium, a highly toxic gas and an unstable mineral. Combine the two and you have table salt.\n\nTake oxygen, one of the three things that's essential for fire to exist. Take Hydrogen, one of the most potent fuel for fire. Combine the two and you have something that puts out fire, water.\n\nAnd chemicals can be different depending on how it's put together. Glucose, table sugar and fat are all chemicals made from Carbon, Hydrogen and Oxygen, each one respectively more complex.\n\nEven elements can have different chemical makeup. Carbon can be found in pure form as graphite, coal or a diamond.\n\nIn short. I find this example of yours to be invalid. However.. kudos on the oxygen toxicity example. All things that may be good for you are normally bad in large dosage, and vice verse. Heck, some doctors have figured out that some of the worlds most deadliest poisons can be good for us... in a very, very small dosage.\n\nThose were my two cents.\nIf you have any other questions, please deposit a quarter.\nThis space for rent.\n\nProduct Placement Sure calcium, in it's pure form, may be good for you\n\nHahaha, it's not. It's like sodium. You eat some of that and your neck will end in a bloody stump lol!\n\n------------\nimshard- in the form Fluoride is added to water there is not enough to have that affect on bodies or the bones therein. None of those negative health problems are backed up by reputable agencies IF you're talking about the fluoride as it is added to water supplies in the amount and form that is common practise. IN the form and amounts that it's added to the water supply it DOES NOT accrete to the bone or what have you. It just doesn't. Just like drinking a calcium plus milk DOES NOT strengthen your bones any more than normal milk, even though nutritionists and advertising people would like you to think that it does- the science doesn't show it. the trouble with this fluoride bullshit is just like the rest of the health/nutrition fringe fad stuff: They extrapolate from real studies into areas of wild speculation where it just doesn't apply.\n\nFor that very reason the satirical examples given by PP and Shade are quite appropriate: they illustrate what's happening; something that is true in one instance, taking into account certain conditions, is inappropriately extrapolated to be true in all conditions. That's not scientific man. It's fine to extrapolate and formulate a hypothesis, but you have to realise that extrapolation is ALWAYS subordinate to data about real world conditions and studies actually focusing on the the specific real world conditions that you are speculating and extrapolating aboutOk my point isn't that fluoridated water is immediately toxic. Even though the risk of accidents resulting from the use of hexafluorosilicic acid (the most common fluoridating agent) in municipal water supplies is quite high (dangerouness not likelihood). Since it decomposes under nominal conditions and once it is diluted resulting in free Fluoride ions. Ions that can and do recombine with other elements without special stimulus. Even lava sulfate and sand bed filtering does little for this and 98% of US water supplies are closed loops that recycle the same water continuously. The same water is treated and retreated with fluoride. While fluoride is usually only added in amounts that would equal 1ppm few districts bother measuring the existing content of fluoride and instead focus on chlorine and Ph levels. Fortunately safety commissions usually shut down a supply if it is discovered to exceed 7 ppm fluouride.\n\nThat said, it is the long term effects that concern me since incidents of actual immediate toxicity are quite rare. When asked, most officials and professionals will correctly tell you fluoridated water is safe because by and large it is. You can safely drink tap water and not die. But over time it will lead to long-term health effects as the material accumulates in your tissues and modifies your body chemistry.\n\nIt belongs in toothpaste where its greatest effectiveness (as a topical treatment) can be achieved."

According to Dr healthy alkaline balance, germs are unable to get a foothold.\n\nCancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment. Cancerous tissues are acidic, whereas healthy tissues are alkaline. When oxygen enters an acid solution it can combine with H+ ions to form water. Oxygen helps to neutralize the acid, while at the same time the acid prevents oxygen from reaching the tissues that need it. Acidic tissues are devoid of free oxygen.An alkaline solution can provide oxygen to the tissues. The pH scale goes from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Below 7 is acid and above 7 is alkaline. The blood, lymph and cerebral spinal fluid in the human body are designed to be slightly alkaline at a pH of 7.4.\n\nIf you have a health problem, most likely you are acidic. We have seen that research shows that unless the body's pH level is slightly alkaline, the body cannot heal itself. So, no matter what type of modality you choose to use to take care of your health problem, it won't be effective until the pH level is up. If your body's pH is not balanced, you cannot effectively assimilate vitamins, minerals and food supplements. Your body pH affects everything.

In June of 1999, I was given no hope by the medical community for my nonhodgkins tcell lymphoma. Shocking news to hear, that after 3 years of the best cancer treatments known to the medical community, there was nothing left to try to cure my disease.\n\nI had followed my doctors' advice and had gone through various tortures trying to control the cancer that was threatening my life.\n\nHere is a brief list of my cancer ordeal:\n\n* Signs of heart failure, kidney failure, and liver failure * Cancer found in my bones and all my organs (Stage 4 - there are only four stages) * Fevers as high as 105.4 degrees * Removal of my spleen * Night sweats and day sweats * \"Gallons\" of chemotherapy and huge amounts of steroids * Extreme nausea and stupor from the toxins used to \"treat\" my body * Bone marrow/stem cell transplant * Loss of hair, weakened eye site, loss of weight, wasted muscles and muscle weakness, loss of feeling in my fingers, painful sores in my mouth and throat. * With My Immune System Severely Compromised And Cancer Winning The War, The Doctors Offered No Hope * Chemotherapy was killing me as it attempted to kill the disease.\n\nAt this point, I knew that I needed to find a way to regain my health. I began to explore health alternatives by learning everything that I could about natural treatments for cancer. I read books and spoke to various health practitioners and especially cancer survivors. Since cancer had devastated me financially, my first question of these health experts was how to use my limited monetary resources for maximum gain.\n\nFrom These Interviews With Health Experts I Discovered 5 Simple Steps To Maximize Health And Achieve Victory Over Sickness\n\n* DETOXIFY your body to remove normal acidic waste products accumulated daily, plus remove toxins accumulated in your body from your environment, prescription drugs, unnatural foods and from the \"normal\" process of aging. Detoxifying removes the stress from having to deal with toxins and lets your body focus on rebuilding health. * HYDRATE your body; this is basic to maintain or regain optimum health. * OXYGENATE your body; since cancer and most other illnesses cannot survive in an oxygenated environment. * ALKALIZE YOUR BODY PH - from acidic to alkaline pH, because cancer and many other illnesses cannot live in alkaline conditions. Alkaline is the \"normal\" state of healthy persons. * ENHANCE YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM to maximize yourbody's ability to fight off disease and heal itself.\n\nIn my search for low cost effective, ways to cure myself of nonhodgkins tcell lymphoma and restore my health, I discovered (among other things) the benefits of ionized alkaline water. \"How Ionized Alkaline Water Addresses These 5 Simple Steps For Assisting The Body To Regain Health And Vitality\"\n\n* DETOXIFICATION Ionized Alkaline Water helps to naturally flush toxins and acidic waste from your body and is a powerful antioxidant. Water is one of the best sources for detoxification. * HYDRATION - during ionization your alkaline water filter forms your water into microclusters that are more easily absorbed at the cellular level thus \"super hydrating\" your body. * OXYGENATION Ionized Alkaline Water makes more oxygen available to your cells than distilled, reverse osmosis, filtered only, bottled or tap water. Cancer doesn't thrive in an oxygenated body!!!! * ALKALIZE YOUR BODY PH - Alkaline Ionized Water will help to optimize your body's pH. You could try to achieve anl akaline state with foods but alkaline water will turbo charge your efforts. As a result, it enables your body to better absorb and utilize nutrients, minerals and supplements. * ENHANCE YOUR IMMUNE RESPONSE - All of the above allow your immune system to respond more appropriately and rapidly to it's many daily challenges. I generally drink 80 ounces of 8.5 to 9 pH ionized alkaline water along with at least 3/4 teaspoon of Celtic sea salt in my diet each day\"\n\nIf you are like most Americans, your body needs more water. Why not drink the best tasting water which is, also, the best water for your body?\n\nSince my death sentence, pronounced by the medical community, I have gone from a terminal cancer patient to a terminal cancer survivor. My body shows no signs of non hodgkins tcell lymphoma.\"My health and vigor have returned!!!!\"\n\nI believe Ionized Alkaline Water has been a major contributor to my surviving cancer and to my regaining and maintaining my good health.

      "text": "Water Tank Cleaning and Disinfection\n\nCold water storage tanks are one of the most important risk areas in Legionella Management and their upkeep and maintenance is fundamental to ongoing controls. Under current guidance, tanks should be inspected on a 6 monthly basis.\n\nCommon problems include;\n\n1.Poor Turnover / Over-storage – often tank are installed to service more people or building usage has changed leading to the water stagnating in the tank for 3-4 days before being replenished\n\n2.Poor Flow – often tanks are set up incorrectly such that water only flows through one tank or one end of a large cistern leading to stagnation.\n\n3.Silt / Scale – build up of silt and scale over time can provide nutrients for bacteria to grow\n\n4.Tank Lids – lids that fit incorrectly or are made of the wrong type of materials can allow organic matter into the cisterns or themselves encourage bacterial growth.\n\nAll the above can lead to conditions suitable for bacterial growth and this applies not just to Legionella but a whole host of other organisms making tank a crucial part of water hygiene.\n\nHow often should I have the tanks cleaned?\n\nIt is a common misconception that cold water tanks should be cleaned on an annual basis. This is in fact only the case if water is stored for drinking purposes (this requirement in fact comes from the DWI (drinking water inspectorate). In this instance the tank should be drained, cleaned and chlorinated on an annual basis, the tank should meet Bylaw 30 and WRAS regulation as well as a bacteriological sample taken every 6 months.\n\nIf, as is common on most sites, the water is stored for toilet flushing, showers and hand washing the tank only need be cleaned when 'routine inspection show it to be necessary'. This will depend on turnover, cistern set up and hardness / silt content of local water – specific recommendations are made following 6 monthly tank inspections.\n\nExample\n\nBefore\n\nAfter\n\nWhat do Nemco have to offer?\n\nNemco are able to offer a comprehensive tank cleaning service to comply with all the requirements as set out in ACOP L8 and BS6700. Tanks are drained, physically scrubbed, hovered, disinfected to 50 ppm for an hour and then re instated. All work is completed with health and safety as the highest priority ensuring no site personnel are exposed to dangerous chemicals.\n\nNemco have numerous years experience disinfecting everything from domestic cold water tank right way through to water towers and large scale industrial cisterns.\n\nDifficult Access?\n\nNot a problem! Nemco have engineers trained specifically for confined space, working on flat roofs / loft areas meaning most jobs are possible.\n\nNemco also employ a specialist rope access team for inspection / cleaning and disinfection of high level water towers etc. Please see the 'High Access' section for further details."

Will a Triflow tap fit a sink with a standard sized hole?\n\nThe filtering capability of the Triflow filter is excellent, resulting in clean, healthy drinking water that also tastes great.\n\n2. Why is it necessary to filter my water supply?\n\nSafe water is vital for the good health of you and your family, but also for friends and visitors to your home.\n\nWhile the quality of community water supplies have improved considerably in the last 50 years, these supplies often leave something to be desired both in taste and the prevalence of chemical treatment additives such as chlorine. The majority of complaints received by water supply organisations are due to poor taste or smell.\n\nIf your water comes from a mains supply, your water safety is monitored by your local authority (which may give you comfort, depending on the authority). If your water comes from a water collection tank or other source, it is up to you to keep your water safe.\n\n3. What does the filter leave in the water?\n\nWhile some water treatment products like distillers and reverse osmosis systems remove calcium and other beneficial elements, Triflow systems are designed to reduce only harmful contaminants while leaving essential minerals like calcium and magnesium intact.\n\nCalcium, for example, contributes to the overall taste of drinking water, is important for your bones and teeth, and is essential for various bodily processes such as blood clotting. Your Triflow system will leave these minerals in your water.\n\n4. Will there be a noticeable difference in the quality of water from the filtered supply?\n\nAbsolutely. Most people immediately notice a significant difference in the quality of their drinking water when they install a Triflow. Of course, the extent of this difference will depend on the level of contaminants in the tap water supply and individual sensory thresholds.\n\nAs the system reduces turbidity and discolouration, people often notice an improvement in the clarity of the treated water also.\n\nTo test the difference, pour a glass of Triflow water and another separate glass from the cold tap water supply. Take a gulp of the Triflow water first and consider the taste and smell. Now do the same with the untreated tap water. Notice the difference?\n\n5. How does the Triflow system work?\n\nTriflow, with its groundbreaking internal workings, is the world's first three-way tap, dispensing not only hot and cold tap water, but also filtered water.\n\nTap water is filtered at point of use and on demand through a high quality Katadyn ceramic filter. With a simple flick of the additional Triflow lever, cold tap water is diverted through an under-bench filter cartridge.\n\nTo prevent cross-contamination with the hot and cold tap water, the great tasting filtered water is delivered through a dedicated waterway in the tap's spout.\n\nThe specially designed ceramic filter cartridge (exclusive to Triflow) is produced by world-leading Swiss water treatment company, Katadyn.\n\nThe Katadyn FRX02 filter is of the highest quality and removes foreign particles and organisms from the water supply down to a size of only 0.2 microns (0.0002mm).\n\nThe filter cartridge is protected under the bench in a sturdy stainless steel housing with braided stainless steel connecting hoses, resulting in a highly durable system that will give many years of trouble free use.\n\nKatadyn recommends that the filter cartridge is replaced every six months to ensure the continued health of your system and the effectiveness of the ceramic core and bacteria killing silver.\n\n6. How will I know when I need to change the cartridge?\n\nApart from reduced flow strength, there are no outwardly visible signs that will tell you when to change your cartridge, though cartridge replacement is strongly recommended every six months for four main reasons:\n\n1. Through continual use the FRX02's ceramic and carbon core will inevitably become exhausted and will filter your water less effectively.\n\n2. As the cartridge core becomes exhausted it will clog faster, requiring more frequent cleaning.\n\n3. The bacteria killing properties of the impregnated silver will diminish over time, so that the risk of bacterial influx may increase.\n\n4. Cartridge life is a factor of time as well as use. This means that in situations of intermittent or sporadic use, a cartridge may reach the end of its life prior to the estimated 3500 litre capacity being reached.\n\nReturning the Triflow registration card once your tap is installed will register your details and ensure you receive a six monthly reminder when a cartridge change is due.\n\nRegistration will also assist with future customer service and to process any warranty claims you may have over the long life of your system.\n\n7. How difficult is it to change the cartridge?\n\nThe procedure for replacing the filter cartridge is very simple and takes only a few minutes. Click here for a step by step guide.\n\nFull instructions on how to change your cartridge are also supplied with each Triflow tap when shipped, and are included with every replacement cartridge ordered.\n\nApart from the Triflow tap, which is a tap fitting of normal size, the filtration unit is a cylinder only 31cm long which takes up little space under the sink.\n\n9. Do Triflow taps require the use of chemicals or electricity?\n\nNo. The Triflow system has been designed to work from mains water pressure without the assistance of any pumps or other electrical system and does not require the use of any chemicals whatsoever.*\n\n*Note that the exclusive Kitchen and Bathroom Triflow taps by Zaha Hadid do require an electrical connection.\n\n10. What is the operating pressure of a Triflow system?\n\nThe Triflow system works on normal mains water pressure. The maximum pressure for the system is 75psi (5 bar). The minimum recommended pressure is 25psi (1.7 bar). A pump will be required to deal with very low pressure situations and pressure limiting valves can be supplied for people experiencing a higher than average pressure.\n\n11. What is the flow rate from the filtered water supply?\n\nWith normal water pressure, the flow rate of the filtered water supply is usually 1 ½ to 2 litres/min. For optimum performance you can adjust the service valve to set the flow rate.\n\n12. What are the minimum and maximum temperatures the system should be subjected to?\n\nThe filter should never be subjected to freezing as this can damage the structure of the matrix core and the hose connections. Damage can also occur if the filter is subjected to very hot water, although cold water could be passed through it to a subsequent instant hot unit down the line.\n\nFor the Triflow tap body itself, the recommended maximum temperature of the hot water supply for Chrome, Nickel, Pewter and Gold finishes is 85º Celsius. For the English Bronze finish, the maximum recommended temperature is 65º Celsius.\n\n13. Can I purchase a Triflow tap without the filter system?\n\nTriflow taps have been designed as a complete system with the filtration system as an integral part. The tap is therefore not available for purchase without the under-bench filtration unit.\n\nYou may however choose not to install the filter and use the third lever and discrete waterway for your rain water or other unique water supply.\n\n14. Do I need to purchase a separate filter for the water dispenser in my refrigerator or for my instant hot water unit?\n\nPossibly not (subject to a discussion with your plumber). A special fixing kit incorporating a tee piece can be installed by your plumber thereby allowing multiple supplies of filtered water to be drawn off from a single unit. These are not supplied with your Triflow tap and would therefore need to be separately sourced.\n\n15. Will the filter stop my kettle from scaling?\n\nTriflow systems do not soften water.\n\nCalcium and magnesium, which are the most common cause of scaling, are important for your health and are not removed by the Triflow filter.\n\n16. How do I clean my Triflow tap?\n\nWhile the finishes on Triflow taps are more than twice the industry standard thickness, care should of course still be taken not to damage the tap's finish. To clean the tap, all that is required is a gentle wipe with a soft, soapy cloth. You should not under any circumstances use abrasive liquids, powders or scouring pads to clean the tap.\n\nIf you wish to very occasionally give your Chrome, Nickel, Pewter or bare brass tap a more serious polish, we recommend the use of a gentle metal polish like Autosol, which is available from most hardware stores.\n\nDO NOT use any metal polish on Gold or English Bronze finishes.\n\n17. Is my Triflow system guaranteed?\n\nYes. In the unlikely event that your Triflow suffers from a fault, the system is covered for five years for defects in materials and workmanship when installed and operated in accordance with our instructions.\n\nA registration card is enclosed with each tap giving full details of the product warranty.\n\nThe filter cartridge life will depend on influent water quality, pressure and overall usage and is not therefore covered by this warranty. Please let us know, however, if you experience irregularities with your filter.\n\n18. Will a Triflow tap fit a sink with a standard sized hole?\n\nYes. Triflow taps fit to a standard 35mm diameter hole. If a spray rinse model is selected, an additional hole of 30mm in diameter will be required."

      "text": "FineWaters Pavilion™\n\nVirginality indicates how protected a water is from its surroundings. It is determined by the water's level of nitrate, an inorganic compound made up of one nitrogen atom and three oxygen atoms. Nitrate is easily carried through soil by water.\n\nThe substance can leach into the ground below the root zone through heavy rainfall or irrigation, and it may subsequently find its way into groundwater. In its natural state, water has less than 1 mg/l of nitrate; higher levels typically reveal a compromised water. This contamination may come from fertilizer, animal waste products, decaying plant matter, septic tanks, or sewage treatment systems. Only testing can determine nitrate levels in water, as nitrate has no taste, odor, or color.\n\nThe ability of blood to carry oxygen throughout the body may be impaired by very high nitrate contamination in drinking water; this may case methemoglobinemia (also known as blue baby syndrome). Cancer, disruption of thyroid function, birth defects, and miscarriages are other health risks posed by high levels of nitrate.\n\nThe World Health Organization recommends that exposure to nitrate should not exceed 50 mg/l for short periods. In the United States, drinking water may not contain more than 10 mg/l of nitrate, a level determined by a study in 1951 of infants suffering from blue baby syndrome. I use the following system of icons to describe the Virginality of bottled water:\n\nSuperior\n\n0 - 1mg/l\n\nVery Good\n\n1 - 4mg/l\n\nGood\n\n4 - 7mg/l\n\nAcceptable\n\n7 - 10 mg/l\n\nPotable\n\n10 -50 mg/l\n\nDistillation, reverse osmosis, and ion exchange can each remove nitrate from water; several manufacturers offer equipment to apply these techniques to home drinking water. Nitrate is not removed by standard water softeners or filters, including carbon adsorption filters, and boiling water actually increases the concentration of nitrate."

      "text": "live near Melbourne Vic Australia, on the Mornington Peninsula. Along with every other thinking person, the lack of water is of concern to me and I practice water conservation in my own lifestyle.\n\nA friend recently alerted me to the Melbourne Water webpage  and told me to check out the recycled water section. After reading it I have to say that I agree that this is needed and in theory have no problems with the practice.\n\nI do have a few questions and these are:\n\nHow much of the pesticides are removed?\n\nHow much of the drugs that are passed through people are still in the water?\n\nIt seems to me that if this water is used for parks and gardens it may be safe but what of the market gardens?\n\nThere is such an increase of ill health and even people who eat the \"right diet\" are becoming ill.\n\nIt appears that the more sensitive one is to pollutants the more sensible one becomes in ones approach to health. (In some cases; there are people who still prefer drugs to treat nutritional deficiencies)\n\nThese people, whose immune systems have been compromised by one or a combination of the practices common in our drug ruled society, these people then, who turn to fresh foods as their healing method are still as much in danger as the healthier types who eat and drink from the public feeding trough (fats food etc)\n\nThe person who is sensitive to drugs and chemicals and chooses to eat mainly fruits and vegetable may still be exposed to the same dangers as the rest of the population because if the recycled water is contaminated with traces of drugs and chemicals then would it not be taken up by the plants, who are not able to distinguish a chemical from an organic substance. This is how our crops are being poisoned in massive market gardens by the use of chemical fertilizers. Is it possible that we will now get a double dose of a toxic cocktail? Or are we receiving this already.\n\nHere is a section from the Melbourne water website:\n\n\"How can recycled water be used?\n\nVegetables\n\nRecycled water can be used for just about anything, as long as it has been treated to the right level. The right level of treatment would depend on how the water will be used. For example, will recycled water be used to water fruit orchards, parks and gardens? Or, will it be used to cool power stations?\n\nThe most common uses for recycled water include:\n\nIrrigating farms and market gardens\n\nwatering parks, gardens, golf courses\n\nindustrial processes in factories\n\ntoilet flushing\n\nwashing and cooling in power stations and mills.\n\nOther possible uses include:\n\nfire fighting\n\ncouncil sport grounds and new housing estates\n\ntopping up wetlands and maintaining river flow\n\nIt is now also possible to produce safe drinking water from sewage. In several countries sewage is recycled to drinking water (potable) quality (e.g. Orange County, California, USA and Singapore). This does not occur in Australia. However, some local councils with severe water shortages are considering this option.\"\n\nThe right level here seems to be the operative word!\n\nThe lack of water here in Melbourne may make the last paragraph a reality. Unless a cast iron guarantee is given that all drug residues is removed from the recycled water it is not an option that inspires me with confidence. There are far too many \"human factors\" involved and the thought of recycled sewage in the hands of someone who has had a bad night's sleep or is not 100% on the job in charge of my drinking water is not a prospect I look forward to.\n\nWhat to do?\n\nThere is a growing number or people who have taken control of the ONE FACTOR that is available to them\n\nStep ONE in any health regeneration plan is a cellular detox of all chemicals and heavy metals.\n\nThe ONE safe and effective product that removes heavy metals and chemical from the cells as opposed to the bowel and intestinal tract detox is Activated Liquid Zeolite.\n\nIf our water is 100% safe then we don't have a worry. That's a bit of a joke in my opinion. Even the drinking water that is considered safe has fluoride and chlorine as well as any number of toxic chemicals in it. Most of this poison is invisible and you can't taste it but it does damage at the cellular level. We have too many chemicals and heavy metals in circulation and very few of them have been tested in combination.\n\nHere is a transcript of a recent meeting about water quality in Tasmania call 0402 204942 or got to  Email: Zeolitequeen@optusnet.com.au"

      "text": "An aerobic treatment system or ATS, often called (incorrectly) an aerobic septic system is a small scale sewage treatment\n\nSewage treatment\n\nSewage treatment, or domestic wastewater treatment, is the process of removing contaminants from wastewater and household sewage, both runoff and domestic. It includes physical, chemical, and biological processes to remove physical, chemical and biological contaminants...\n\nA septic tank is a key component of the septic system, a small-scale sewage treatment system common in areas with no connection to main sewage pipes provided by local governments or private corporationsprocess used in septic systems. These systems are commonly found in where public sewers are not available, and may be used for a single residence or for a small group of homes.\n\nUnlike the traditional septic system, the aerobic treatment system produces a high quality secondary effluent, which can be sterilized and used for surface irrigation. This allows much greater flexibility in the placement of the leach field\n\nSeptic drain field\n\nSeptic drain fields, also called leach fields or leach drains are used to remove contaminants and impurities from the liquid that emerges from the septic tank. A septic tank, the septic drain field, and the associated piping compose a complete septic system. The septic drain field is effective for...\n\n, as well as cutting the required size of the leach field by as much as half.\n\nProcess\n\nThe ATS process generally consists of the following phases:\n\nPre-treatment stage to remove large solids and other undesirable substances from the wastewater; this stage acts much like a septic system, and an ATS may be added to an existing septic tank to further process the primary effluent.\n\nAeration stage, where the aerobic bacteria digest the biological wastes in the wastewater.\n\nSettling stage to allow any undigested solids to settle. This forms a sludge which must be periodically removed from the system.or similar disinfectant is mixed with the water, to produce an antiseptic output.\n\nThe disinfecting stage is optional, and is used where a sterile effluent is required, such as cases where the effluent is distributed above ground. The disinfectant typically used is tablets of calcium hypochlorite\n\nCalcium hypochlorite\n\nCalcium hypochlorite is a chemical compound with formula 2. It is widely used for water treatment and as a bleaching agent...\n\n, which are specially made for waste treatment systems. Unlike the chlorine tablets used ins, which is stabilized for resistance to breakdown in ultraviolet light, the tablets used in waste treatment systems is intended to break down quickly in sunlight. Stabilized forms of chlorine will persist after the effluent is dispersed, and can kill off plants in the leach field.of microbes to digest the waste products in the water, excessive amounts of items such as can damage the ATS environment and reduce treatment effectiveness. Non-digestible items should also be avoided, as they will build up in the system and require more frequent sludge removal.\n\nTypes of aerobic treatment systems\n\nSmall scale aerobic systems generally use one of two designs, fixed-film systems, or continuous flow, suspended growth aerobic systems (CFSGAS). The pre-treatment and effluent handling are similar for both types of systems, and the difference lies in the aeration stage.\n\nFixed film systems\n\nFixed film systems use a porous medium which provides a bed to support the biomass film that digests the waste material in the wastewater. Designs for fixed film systems vary widely, but fall into two basic categories (though some systems may combine both methods). The first is a system where the media is moved relative to the wastewater, alternately immersing the film and exposing it to air, while the second uses a stationary media, and varies the wastewater flow so the film is alternately submerged and exposed to air. In both cases, the biomass must be exposed to both wastewater and air for the aerobic digestion to occur. The film itself may be made of any suitable porous material, such as formed plastic or peat moss. Simple systems use stationary media, and rely on intermittent, gravity driven wastewater flow to provide periodic exposure to air and wastewater. A common moving media system is the rotating biological contactor (RBC), which uses disks rotating slowly on a horizontal shaft. Approximately 40 percent of the disks are submerged at any given time, and the shaft rotates at a rate of one or two revolutions per minute.\n\nContinuous flow, suspended growth aerobic systems\n\nCFSGAS systems, as the name imply, are designed to handle continuous flow, and do not provide a bed for a bacterial film, relying rather on bacteria suspended in the wastewater. The suspension and aeration are typically provided by an air pump, which pumps air through the aeration chamber, providing a constant stirring of the wastewater in addition to the oxygenation. A medium to promote fixed film bacterial growth may be added to some systems designed to handle higher than normal levels of biomass in the wastewater.\n\nRetrofit or portable aerobic systems\n\nAnother increasingly common use of aerobic treatment is for the remediation of failing or failed anaerobic septic systems, by retrofitting an existing system with an aerobic feature. This class of product, known as aerobic remediation, is designed to remediate biologically failed and failing anaerobic distribution systems by significantly reducing the BOD5 term also refers to a chemical procedure for...\n\nTotal suspended solids is a water quality measurement usually abbreviated TSS. It is listed as a conventional pollutant in the U.S. Clean Water Act. This parameter was at one time called non-filterable residue , a term that refers to the identical measurement: the dry-weight of particles trapped...\n\nof the effluent. The reduction of the BOD5 and TSS reverses the developed bio-mat. Further, effluent with high dissolved oxygen and aerobic bacteria flow to the distribution component and digest the bio-mat.\n\nComposting toilets\n\nComposting toilets are designed to treat only toilet waste, rather than general residential waste water, and are typically used with water-free toilets rather than the flush toilet\n\nFlush toilet\n\nA flush toilet is a toilet that disposes of human waste by using water to flush it through a drainpipe to another location. Flushing mechanisms are found more often on western toilets , but many squat toilets also are made for automated flushing...\n\ns associated with the above types of aerobic treatment systems. These systems treat the waste as a moist solid, rather than in liquid suspension, and therefore separateFeces, faeces, or fæces is a waste product from an animal's digestive tract expelled through the anus or cloaca during defecation.-Etymology:...\n\nduring treatment to maintain the correct moisture content in the system. An example of a composting toilet is the clivus multruminclined chamber'), which consists of an inclined chamber that separates urine and feces and a fan to provide positive ventilation and prevent odors from escaping through the toilet. Within the chamber, the urine and feces are independently broken down not only by aerobic bacteria, but also by fungi, arthropods, and. Treatment times are very long, with a minimum time between removals of solid waste of a year; during treatment the volume of the solid waste is decreased by 90%, with most being converted into water vapor and carbon dioxide. Pathogens are eliminated from the waste by the long durations in inhospitable conditions in the treatment chamber.\n\nComparison to traditional septic systems\n\nAeration is the process by which air is circulated through, mixed with or dissolved in a liquid or substance.-Aeration of liquids:-Methods:Aeration of liquids is achieved by:...\n\nstage and the disinfecting stage are the primary differences from a traditional septic system; in fact, an aerobic treatment system can be used as a secondary treatment for septic tank effluent. These stages increase the initial cost of the aerobic system, and also the maintenance requirements over the passive septic system. Unlike many other biofilters, aerobic treatment systems require a constant supply of electricity to drive the air pump increasing overall system costs. The disinfectant tablets must be periodically replaced, as well as the electrical components (air compressor) and mechanical components (air diffusers). On the positive side, an aerobic system produces a higher qualitythan a septic tank, and thus the leach field can be smaller than that of a conventional septic system, and the output can be discharged in areas too environmentally sensitive for septic system output. Some aerobic systems recycle the effluent through a sprinkler system, using it to water the lawn where regulations approve.\n\nEffluent quality\n\nSince the effluent from an ATS is often discharged onto the surface of the leach field, the quality is very important. A typical ATS will, when operating correctly, produce an effluent with less than 30 mg/liter biochemical oxygen demand This is clean enough that it cannot support a biomat or \"slime\" layer like a septic tank.\n\nATS effluent is relatively odorless; a properly operating system will produce effluent that smells musty, but not like sewage. Aerobic treatment is so effective at reducing odors, that it is the preferred method for reducing odor from manure produced by farms"

It only becomes an issue when large amounts of ozone convert bromide into bromate, a cancer causing agent. Ozone is used as a sanitizing agent in bottled water to control growth instead of chlorine.\n\nNormally you control your ozone levels very, VERY carefully to make sure this doesn't happen, but if their equipment was out of spec and they weren't monitoring properly, then they may have had bromate formation. Bromate formation is a huge no-no and is cause for a recall.\n\nAre you sure that it's just bottled from the water in the region it's produced? I'm in Toronto, and our tap water is far nicer than Dasani or Aquafina. Both of those taste weird to my palette. Evian is nice, but still no better than the tap water.\n\nWell, to be fair, they take the tap water and run it through reverse osmosis filters, add their special blend of minerals, and then cap it with some ozone to ensure its sterile. As a matter of fact, that process costs them more than the process of making coke. With coke they only run the tap water through charcoal filters.\n\nwhile this is correct, that does not account for anything that is in your pipes or faucet. While many bottled water companies use the same equipment as your city does to treat the water, it does not travel through pipes that can be almost a hundred years old.\n\nThat article seems quite biased. I work in a bottled water facility, and we test our water hourly for common contaminants and we run several microbiological tests daily on every line. Our testing is far more rigorous than what is outlined for municipal water.\n\nPlus, since our process is far, far more effective than municipal systems for controlling growth, we don't have the growth issues municipal water does. If we did, we'd be out of business.\n\nChlorine does NOT remove contaminants or kill some microorganisms like microbial cysts or spores. People have died drinking tap water contaminated with Cryptosporidium. Bottled water does not have this problem since spring water is collected underground, before it can be contaminated by animal feces, and nothing survives the RO and ozination process used in purified waters.\n\nSo there may be small, local, branded waters that don't follow good procedures, but large bottlers are far more rigorous than municipalities. It's just not worth risking a multimillion business to save on a $2.00 test.\n\nRead your local water quality report (No one ever does) and you will see they regularly encounter out of spec water, but just continue to run. (What are they gonna do, shut everyones water off because the PH is a little off?)\n\nI recently did a study involving tap and bottled water and found this same information. Municipal tap water is much more regulated than bottled. Take the time to read the labels on some bottled waters; some of them even say it's just bottled municipal water anyways. They just turn a killer profit putting a fancy label on it.\n\nI'm pretty sure a lot of people do that. I personally occasionally drink tap water but prefer it to be filtered. My town was rated to have the best tasting tap in New Jersey one year. Its safety is questioned due to a chemical company incorrectly discarding waste.\n\nI often drink tap water in New Jersey. In my dorm, it tastes really disgusting, so I try to steal water from my dining hall (where I suspect it is at least filtered) in a steel bottle when I remember to. Otherwise, I'll just drink it the disgusting stuff in my dorm.\n\nI live in Canada. There is differences in water quality across the country, but none really so bad that I wouldn't drink it out of the tap. Although, anything off the Red River tastes like shit. Drinking water from around the Rockies though? Vancouver water tastes better than bottled.\n\nTry Kitchener/Waterloo sometime. The water tastes disgusting and it leaves a haevy residue on anything (dishes, glasses) you wash with it that is impossible to fully get rid of. Toronto water is fine though.\n\nWell, I certainly applaud anyone wanting to drink 100 tap waters, but take it from this old drinking rat, I've spent my entire adult life in the gym, and a program like this one can do more harm than good.\n\nIf you only drink one type of drink (and that's all a single drink like tap waterDrinking Tap Water basically only rehydrates you thirst and to some extent, the quenches your thirst. What you really want to do is drink a wide variety of drinks, all the major beverage groups (water, pop, alcohol, juices, teas and milk) at the same time, over the course of a workout. And don't forget your to eat!\n\nI'm proud of you guys wanting to do this. Three cheers! Falling in love with drinking drinking establishment, with qualified waiters and bartenders who will design your programs for you (especially in the beginning, until you get the hang of it yourself) and guide you in your quest for drinking able to drink a variety of drinks the first time you walk into the drink establishment. You have to start somewhere and almost every one of us were there ourselves at one time. So no one will say anything to you and very, very quickly you will progress way beyond that stage anyway.\n\nAnd don't worry about being embarrassed or not being able to drink a variety of drinks the first time you walk into the drink establishment. You have to start somewhere and almost every one of us were there ourselves at one time. So no one will say anything to you and very, very quickly you will progress way beyond that stage anyway...\n\nAs a drinking guy myself, I can completely confirm this.\n\nIf I see a thirsty person in McDonalds chugging soda, I'm going to be a judgemental arsehole.\n\nIf I see a thirsty person in their house drinking water, actually hydrating themselves, I'm thinking \"Good on ya, mate\".\n\nI grew up drinking well water, which is hard water. Drinking water out of the tap at friends houses always tasted weird to me - sort of empty and sterilized. I was used to the mineral content of the well water.\n\nI've found people who grew up with well water tend to like the taste of blood more than others, because of the iron content of the water.\n\nWell water breeds vampires is where I'm going with this, I guess.\n\nWhen I lived in DC I was told to avoid drinking the tap water, so I did, and of course throughout most of Asia, Central America, and Middle East I stuck to bottled stuff. Everywhere else, though, tap, always.\n\nI'm going to get downvoted for this, but gasland has credibility issues. They claim there is no regulation when there is plenty of regulation. They claim you can't find the chemicals in frac and it's easily findable on the internet because the state governments have required it.\n\nThere is some sensational stuff in there. The flaming water looks like it must be related to fraccing, but when these were investigated they were found to be biogenic methane in the aquifer. This has happened everywhere for years, but when you add the random chance of bacteria forming that produces this to the fact that fraccing is happening in half the country, you are going to get a few places where the two coincide.\n\nIt shows the dead fish in the river, but the death of the fish was attributed to improper coal ash dumping. Essentially, the whole video is stringing together unrelated events in different towns and pointing to the existence of fraccing as a common factor, but at the same time shows that fraccing itself is common.\n\nIt did appear to me from the video that some company was illegally dumping frac fluid. I don't doubt that these companies are taking shortcuts. But the video makes it sound like the companies are able and allowed to do this without and regulation or recourse against them, when that's simply not true.\n\nI think the bottle water companies have done a really good job for this to even be a question in the United States. New York has some of the best tap water in the world, yet our bottle water market is still huge.\n\nNo. There's a cancer cluster in my area and an old battery factory that left tons of batteries in the ground. My mother died from cancer a few years ago and all she drank was tap water. This is poorly worded as I am tired, but fuck no, I would not drink my tap water straight up.\n\nWow! i grew up in Australia, live in New Zealand and everyone drinks tap wtaer. i have never even considered otherwise. Over here bottled water is seen as a bit of a joke. It's terrible for the enviroment, waste, plastic etc. it takes 5 litres of water to make 4 litres of bottled! crazy. And it's free from the tap!!!!\n\nNew Zealand, Austria, Canada and Germany beg to differ. (Vancouver and Vienna are the winner of the \"best tap water award\" or whatever... I'm from Vienna and it was in the news. New Zealand and Germany were very high-ranking and also winners a few times.)\n\nTap water in western countries is extremely safe. As others have said, it's more regulated and tested than bottled water is. If you're drinking bottled water because you don't trust tap water, you're misinformed.\n\nPenn & Teller did a Bullshit! episode on bottled water, BTW. It was pretty good - they were at a NY posh restaurant and they had a \"water steward\" who was recommending waters from all sorts of exotic locations, and the people were all agreeing that they were very different from one another. In reality, of course, P&T were filling up the bottles from a garden hose in the alley behind the joint.\n\nHere in Nashville, I used to not be able to tell the difference between the tap water and filtered water (filtered water coming from both a through-the-door refrigerator dispensing unit at home and an on faucet PUR unit at work).\n\nThen, this flooding thing happened. And the change was ridiculously apparent. So much chlorine. Was at Jack's BBQ downtown one night and couldn't even choke down the tap water. Same thing at home - incredibly bad. Had to drink the filtered water (as an aside, I used to not care too much, because I'm a loony and don't quite care much for cold water, and the filtered water was always too cold for me).\n\nThe levels seem to be back to normal now, but it was the first time where I couldn't honestly say, \"this tap water really does taste like river-punch.\"\n\nIt depends where you live. I live in South Nashville and the water has always been laden with chlorine. It's undrinkable. That's why I keep it in a jar for 10 hours, wait for the chlorine to evaporate, then I filter it with Brita and it's delicious.\n\nYes, I always thought that was absolutely normal and everyone can do it (I'm from Germany, partially living in Denmark and then moving to Austria... in all three countries all publicly available water is drinking water). Actually the quality of the tap water is BETTER THAN BOTTLED WATER. It's also cheaper and not as wasteful as buying bottles... especially not plastic bottles.\n\nThen I went to a different country for the first time (Turkey, when I was 7 years old). My mom told me not to drink the water. I was weirded out. She said you will get sick when you drink it, so I didn't.\n\nThen I went to England when I was 13... I wanted to drink tap water and then realized it was full of chlorine! That was so incredibly weird.\n\nI'm weirded out and disgusted by the fact that humans deliberately poison their water reserves and waste all their water so quickly that some countries are already out of drinking water or are not developed enough to provide free and easily available drinking water to their citizens.\n\nI learned about the problems in Africa when I was 5 years old... I thought \"Yeah well, it's hot in Africa, so it will dry out more quickly and people generally need more water to drink when it's hot, so that's normal.\".\n\nThen I understood that there are INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES who don't have DRINKABLE TAP WATER.\n\nYeah they do. But if you don't like the taste of tap water, for Christs sake just get a filter. Don't waste all those bottles and shit. The water that I drink out of the tap in my dorm room at college tastes like chlorine, so I just bought a brita filter pitcher\n\nI filter mine. We get letters in the mail regularly listing all the stuff in our water supply, and it isn't pretty, though this might be standard practice. Plus it smells exactly like a swimming pool with the rubber lining."

      "text": "Mass spectrometry could be key to safe groundwater\n\nArgentina is one of the world's biggest producers of lithium, an element found in large deposits throughout the Andes, along with other minerals. Now, scientists at Lund University have discovered that high levels of the substance is finding its way into drinking water used by villagers in the area.\n\nLithium, which in the past has been used to treat bipolar syndrome, in large cumulative doses, can affect the thyroid adversely and lead to hypothyroidism, which, in turn can lead to metabolic disorders such as weight gain, depression and memory loss. Although the amount of lithium being ingested is in very small doses, it occurs over the lifetime of the individual, even while in the womb, and builds up in tissue over time to dangerous levels.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the tests was that they were carried out using mass spectrometry, rather than traditional techniques that only allow testing for one specific substance. As well as high levels of lithium, spot urine samples showed much higher normal levels of other elements such as arsenic, cesium, rubidium and borium.\n\nThis gives rise to the problem that no one really knows the effect of the build up of other ground elements present in water that has filtered through mountains with a high mineral content.\n\nHowever, as Karin Broburg from Lund University points out, the tests do show that there is a good case for mass spectrometry to be used routinely for drinking water sampling throughout the world:\n\n'Groundwater has in many places been considered better to drink than the often polluted water from lakes and rivers, But, in Bangladesh, this has caused enormous health problems, when it turned out that the water from drilled wells contained arsenic. Very little is known about the concentration of lithium and other dangerous substances in the groundwater around the world, so this should be measured"

In ultrafiltration, this diffusion through the membrane is accelerated by means of a pressure difference. In electrodialysis, an electrical field accelerates the migration.\n\nwater supply systems treatment\n\nSeveral types of synthetic semipermeable membranes can be used to block the flow of particles and molecules while allowing smaller water molecules to pass through under the effect of hydrostatic pressure.

      "text": "Did you know that 70% of all new pools being built today are salt water pools? And they continue to gain favor over traditional chlorine pools. Why all the excitement?\n\nSalt water pools provide:\n\nRefreshing water that's more soothing to skin and hair than traditional chlorine pools and is easier on eyes and noses\n\nLess maintenance time and expenses, more time for enjoyment\n\nNo unpleasant chlorine smell\n\nNo need to purchase, transport, store or handle hazardous and costly chlorine chemicals\n\nRequirements & Care\n\nSalt water pools differ significantly from traditional chlorine pools. They require unique equipment and special care. With the proper support, it's an investment that will pay dividends in total pool enjoyment for years to come.\n\nAt the heart of the system is the electrolytic chlorine generator (ECG) – a sanitizing system designed specifically for salt water pools. It uses a powerful cell to produce natural chlorine from salt and keeps sanitizer levels balanced, so frequent additions of chlorine are no longer needed.\n\nSalt water pools require specialized salt water pool chemicals designed to perform inside the harsh environment of the salt water generator. Chemicals designed for use in traditional chlorine pools can break down as they pass through your chlorine generator.\n\nThe Right Salt Makes All the Difference\n\nAll salts are not the same. Ordinary pool salts contain varying levels of undesirable contaminants that can result in challenges unique to salt water pools. Additionally, using salts not specifically designed for salt water pools or chemicals formulated for traditional chlorine pools can affect pools in a variety of ways, including:\n\nStaining – Naturally occuring, inorganic materials such as metals can be found in inferior salts or from your source water, and can lead to unsightly stains and discoloration of pool finishes. Even salts labeled as \"food grade or food quality\" can contain levels of inorganic materials which while fine for human consumption can prove problematic when salt is added in large quantities needed to create a salt water pool.\n\nWater clouding – Organic contaminants, particularly those found in solar salt, can result in dull cloudy water.\n\n- More cell cleanings, premature cell failure, and associated greater time and expense\n\nScaling on Pool Finishes – The introduction of inorganic and organic contaminants by conventional pool salts can cause pool finishes to become discolored, faded and unattractive.\n\nChemical Breakdown – Many chemicals designed for traditional chlorine pools break down in the harsh environment of the chlorine generator and lose their protective properties, and in some cases contribute to the very problems they try to address, such as scale and algae.\n\nAs the chlorine generator is converting salt to chlorine, a very harsh environment is created which include:\n\n- High-temperatures up to 120 degrees F\n\n- High-chlorine levels up to 50 parts per million\n\n- Swings in pH from 1.0 to 14.0 as water goes through the generator\n\n- Fluctuation of the Langelier Saturation Index (LSI). Swing from 0.3 to -0.3 increases your pool's tendency to scale by 6,000 times\n\nThe Perfect Solution for a Perfect Salt Water Pool\n\nWhether you're considering building a pool, thinking about switching over your traditional chlorine pool, or seeking better care for your existing salt water pool, the Pristiva® System is the perfect solution. After conducting extensive research with pool builders, retailers and service companies to understand the unique needs and challenges of salt water pools, we designed an entirely new program to not only meet but also exceed those needs.\n\nThe result is the fast, easy Pristiva System.\n\nPristiva utilizes a proprietary formula powered byX2O®, our unique combination of powerful enhancers contained in both Primer® and Activatortm. It is specifically formulated to improve your water's clarity and softness, while protecting your pool finishes and equipment. Pristiva also provides the quickest, easiest pool maintenance available with fewer expenses."

But that water is actually not safe to drink. It is not even safe to use in the shower.\n\nIt is true that local treatment facilities routinely provide reports on the quality of their water to the homeowners in their area. They are required to do this by law. But did you know that water companies frequently change their numbers to make the quality of the water they provide look better than it is?\n\nSometimes, what you are told in these reports is not the whole truth but an edited statement. When asked about why they do this, water companies respond that the people will not comprehend the \"relevance of these findings.\" This is a carefully worded statement that is little more than, \"They can't handle the truth.\"\n\nNow that you know that you don't really know what is in your tap water, you should not be so trusting. In fact, it is appropriate to think twice about drinking or showering in unfiltered tap water. The Washington Post reported that 65 of 3,000 large water purification systems in the country have lead in their water. Years ago, lead-based paint was banned from the country because of the harm it brings to the body. Lead can cause learning disorders and permanent brain damage in children.\n\nIt is also important to note that the lead found in your water can also be from your pipes and plumbing. Some pipes and fixtures are made out of lead, and this lead can seep into your water, especially when the water has been sitting for a while. This is a type of water contamination that happens between the local water treatment facility and your faucets and shower heads.\n\nAlmost all tap water provided to homes in the US has been disinfected using chlorine by local water processing facilities. Chlorine is not necessarily the best disinfectant to use, but it is the cheapest one available. The US Council on Environmental Quality said that those who drink chlorinated water increase their chances of getting cancer by 93%.\n\nThe microorganism called cryptosporidium is a parasite that can potentially cause death. Despite this being a very harmful parasite, it can still be found in tap water samples today. Even the government said that no local water treatment facility can completely remove this parasite from your drinking water. The technology that they are using today cannot handle it. Chlorine cannot even completely kill this microorganism.\n\nNow that you know that your water may not be pure or safe and that it may have chlorine or the deadly cryptosporidium, it is time to think about how your tap water is affecting your health and the health of your household. Since water treatment facilities are not giving you the kind of water you deserve, you need to do something about your water.\n\nThe best thing you can do is buy an Aquasana water filter. These filters can remove chlorine, microorganisms, and other contaminants that can be bad for health. Aquasana water filters provide you with pure, safe, and tasty water that is beyond the standards of local tap water providers."

You'll want to do the same with all household trash. Make sure you have a good supply of trash bags.\n\nIf the tap water is of uncertain quality, one of two chemicals can be used to purify it, iodine or chlorine. Each carries some risks. Iodine is not recommended for pregnant women or those with thyroid conditions. Also, iodine is not effective against cryptosporidium, a common cause of water-borne illness in Northern California.\n\nFEMA and the Red Cross recommend chlorine in the form of Clorox bleach for rendering poor water safe for use. Be prepared to add unscented bleach, at a concentration of 16 drops per gallon, then let the water stand for 30 minutes to render it safe for human or animal use. If you have a lemon tree in the neighborhood, add a few slices of lemon to improve the flavor just before drinking.\n\nWater may also be purified by boiling for three minutes, which will kill bacteria and protozoa, but boiling uses a lot of fuel, which may be scarce.

      "text": "Arsenic\n\nWhat you need to know\n\nArsenic and Old Lace, the classic play by Joseph Kesserling about two sweet old ladies who poison gentlemen callers, may be what comes to mind first when you think of arsenic. Arsenic used as a poison is widely documented in detective and mystery stories. Many people are alarmed when they hear that their drinking water, either from a public or private water system, may contain arsenic. What do you do if your water contains arsenic, and can it be removed? You can find the answers to these and many other questions about arsenic below.\n\nWhat is Arsenic?\n\nArsenic is a semi-metallic element with the chemical symbol \"As.\" It is a member of the nitrogen family, and it occurs naturally in rocks, soils, and waters that come in contact with these rocks and soils. Arsenic is odorless and tasteless.\n\nArsenic can combine with other elements to form inorganic and organic arsenicals. In general, inorganic derivatives are regarded as more toxic than the organic forms. While food can contain both inorganic and organic arsenicals, primarily inorganic forms are present in water.\n\nExposure to arsenic at high levels poses potential serious health effects as it is a known human carcinogen, or cancer-causing agent. It also has been reported to affect the vascular system in humans and has been associated with the development of diabetes.\n\nArsenic enters the human body principally through the mouth, according to the CDC, and inhaled arsenic also is absorbed through the lungs into the bloodstream. \"Small amounts of arsenic may enter the body through the skin, but this is not usually an important consideration,\" reads the CDC's Public Health Statement on arsenic.\n\nIs my private well at risk?\n\nThere are wells in some parts of the Southwest and other localized areas around the U.S. that exceed the U.S. EPA arsenic standard for drinking water. Your state's Department of Natural Resources or Geological Survey Office may have information on any areas of your state that may be prone to the presence of high levels of arsenic.\n\nPrivate well water should be tested annually for bacteria, nitrates, and anything else of concern to the well owner, such as arsenic. Testing should be conducted by a certified drinking water laboratory. The U.S. EPA offers a state-by-state listing of certification officers, or call the National Ground Water Association at (800) 551-7379. The certification officer in your state can provide a list of certified labs in your area.\n\nIf you do have an arsenic level in your water that is higher than you would like, there are water treatment technologies available to address the problem. Do not attempt to remove arsenic by boiling water. This will only concentrate the arsenic.\n\nWhat types of treatment solutions are available to private well owners?\n\nNSF International, a not-for-profit organization that develops standards, product testing procedures, and certification services for products including water treatment devices, has certified point-of-use reverse osmosis and distillation devices for the reduction of arsenic in drinking water. Pretreating water through chlorination or oxidation may be necessary to make reverse osmosis devices effective for arsenic removal. NSF also is working on certification standards for filtration devices that can be used to reduce arsenic. For more information or a list of NSF-certified devices, contact the organization at 877-8-NSF-HELP.\n\nSome of the treatment technologies may not be amenable to point-of-entry, or whole-house, treatments. In these cases, point-of-use units, which treat water at the tap, may be the best option.\n\nFollowing installation of a treatment device, water quality should again be tested to verify the operation of the device. After that, water should be tested at least annually to confirm treatment effectiveness. A maintenance agreement for such devices is highly recommended.\n\nAgain, since water quality varies greatly, be sure to have your water tested, and consult a local water professional for advice before purchasing a water treatment system.\n\nHow does arsenic enter a private water system?\n\nArsenic occurs naturally in rocks and soil, water, air, and plants and animals. It can be further released into the environment through natural activities such as volcanic action, erosion of rocks, and forest fires, or through human actions. Approximately 90 percent of industrial arsenic in the U.S. is currently used as a wood preservative, but arsenic is also used in paints, dyes, metals, drugs, soaps, and semi-conductors. Agricultural applications, mining, and smelting also contribute to arsenic releases in the environment. Arsenic-related pollutants enter the ground water system by gradually moving with the flow of ground water from rains, melting of snow, etc.\n\nTesting water for arsenic in areas where arsenic is a concern is an important strategy for private water well owners to safeguard the health and well being of their family. Working with a water professional to monitor and maintain the quality of the well and water supply is an important responsibility of the private water system owner. Your ground water contractor is your central source of information about caring for your system. Keep your contractor's phone number handy. Your contractor is often your best source of local information for testing, treatment, and maintenance information.\n\nWhat is the measurement of arsenic?\n\nArsenic in drinking water is measured in parts per billion (ppb). The U.S. EPA-established maximum level for arsenic in drinking water was changed in November 2001 from 50 ppb to 10 ppb. The U.S. EPA does not regulate private water wells, but its drinking water rules provide a good standard by which to measure your water quality.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of overexposure to arsenic?\n\nWhere can I get more information?\n\nFor more information, contact National Ground Water Information Center at (800) 551-7379 for literature on arsenic occurrence and treatment. Get a state-by-state list of NGWA-member ground water contractors in your area."

      "text": "What is Acidic Water?\n\nAcidic water (often referred to as electrolyzed water) is water with a potential hydrogen (pH) of less than 7. pH refers to the amount of hydrogen mixed in with the water. pH is measured on a scale from 0 to 14; 7 represents \"neutral,\" where the water is neither alkaline nor acidic; 0 through 7 indicates acidity; and 7 through 14 indicates alkalinity.\n\nSigns of acidic water include:\n\nHome water sources have been known to have a pH level of less than 5.5, which many water treatment solutions will not guarantee service for or offer systems to deal with.\n\nLike the Richter scale for measuring earthquake intensity, the pH scale is logarithmic. A solution with a pH of 8.0 is ten times more alkaline than a solution with a pH of 7.0. A solution with a pH of 9.0 is 100 times more alkaline than a solution with a pH of 7.0.\n\nThe intake of acidic water along with the acidic foods in the modern diet cause the body to work overtime to maintain the blood pH within the health range. To do so, the body will take alkaline substances from body parts, such as bone. By drinking alkaline water, a person is able to reduce the intake of acids and increase the availability of alkaline minerals, helping the body regulate its pH in a healthier way.\n\nRecent studies of acidic water uses have discovered many home uses; for example a recent patent in Europe has been filed after a study showing acidic water obtained by electrolysis, is a highly effective treatment of dermatosis in domestic animals when applied or sprayed several times at the initial stages of the dermatosis.[1]\n\nMedical and Dental offices often uses acidic water to destroy micro-organisms, as well as a sterilizing hand wash.\n\nThe LIFE Ionizers produce both Alkaline water (for healthy consumption) as well as acidic water. While it has its uses, Humans don't do well drinking acidic water. However, this doesn't mean acidic water doesn't have its own uses.\n\nUses of Acidic Water\n\nAlthough drinking alkaline water is important for optimum health, acidic water also has many beneficial uses as well:\n\nSkin care: Using acidic water to wash your face can improve the complexion of your skin as it works as a natural astringent and removes dirt and oil without the use of chemicals. Acidic water can also relieve dry and itchy skin, and expedite the healing process of cuts, scrapes, insect bites, rashes, athletes foot, nail fungus, blisters, acne, eczema, bisters, and poison oak/ivy irritation.\n\nHair Care: Use acidic water to wash and rinse your hair, as it is great for your scalp and addresses dandruff.\n\nAntiseptic: Acidic water can be used as an antiseptic for abrasions, cuts, and a mouth wash to assist in removing plauqe from teeth."

It is not part of a vast government conspiracy to control the human population.\n\n2. It will not prevent cavities from forming by itself (sorry kids, you still have to brush your teeth)\n\nSo what does it do and why did they start adding fluoride to our drinking water? The simple answer is that a government health review of fluoridated water shows that it helps reduce tooth decay by as much as 60%. Dentists used fluoride treatments to help fight cavities, but that only worked for the people who could afford regular dentist visits.\n\nBy adding fluoride to all drinking water the goal was to give everyone access to the benefit of fluoride treatments. In low doses it is not harmful to humans. About 10% of people may experience Dental Fluorosis due to the presence of Fluoride in their drinking water. Dental Fluorosis only occurs during tooth formation and ranges from mild (symmetrical whitish areas on the tooth) to severe (brownish discoloration) and is considered a cosmetic problem not a health risk.\n\nPersonally I would not want a very high amount of fluoride added to the public water supply, particularly in areas that already have naturally occurring fluoride in the water. But I can also see the benefits of having a small amount added to the water to help preserve healthy teeth.\n\nI get asked a lot whether or not a carbon based water filter will reduce the level of fluoride in water and the answer is no, they do not. If you want to remove fluoride you would need to use a reverse osmosis system, but these are very expensive and in addition to removing fluoride and other harmful contaminants take out all the naturally occurring minerals that your body needs. My advice would be if you are worried about fluoride levels in your water have it tested to make sure it is not too high."

(Now that you're in on the prank, this should be fairly obvious.)\n\nSo, how did the particular myth about the dangers of dihydrogen monoxide in polystyrene get started? In March 2004, someone came across a dihydrogen monoxide hoax on the Internet, and without first verifying the information with an authoritative source, incorporated the bit about polystyrene into a proposed city council ordinance.

They generally do this by raising the pH and precipitating out\nsome of the Ca and Mg.

But bottled water sold is not necessarily cleaner or safer than most tap water, according to a four-year scientific study published by NRDC.\n\nWhile most of the bigger companies take good care to ensure the right processes involved in treatment of water before bottling it, many small local players often fill bottles without proper treatment. The right equipment required for purification of water in large scale is often very expensive, making them unaffordable for the small local bottled water sellers. The products of such companies are very often found to be non-compliant to the standards of drinking water.\n\nConsumers typically buy bottled water under the misconception that it is safer, purer or healthier than tap water. Bottled water companies have spent billions to manipulate consumers into believing that bottled water is safer or healthier than tap water.\n\nBut the true questions that are being asked worldwide are:\n\nIs bottled water really better quality than tap?\n\nDo plastic water bottles leach harmful chemicals?\n\nIs the cost and inconvenience of bottled water just a waste of time and money?\n\nDo you know that bottled water is a leading source of plastic pollution in America?\n\nAre you aware that most studies show bottled water quality to be the same or lower than that of tap water?\n\nAre home water filters a better option and which one is best?\n\nSome of the most common problems faced with bottled/packaged water are:\n\nRisks from plastic bottles – All plastic bottles leach synthetic chemicals into water, some more than others. Even the popular refillable polycarbonate water bottles are known to release BPA (Bisphenol A) into the water. The best and healthiest solution is a quality home water filter and refillable glass water bottles.\n\nCross Contamination of Water Dispensers – 20 litre packaged water cans are very often used in Corporate offices, Hospitals, Educational Institutions and other organizations for consumption of masses. The dispensers on which the cans are mounted are unknowingly often subjected to cross-contamination by the users, when they touch the nozzles of the taps.

      "text": "Water hardness is the amount of dissolved minerals found in water. A large amount of dissolved minerals means the water is hard, a small amount means the water is soft.\n\nWater becomes hard by filtering through permeable rock, e.g. limestone or chalk. Indications of hardness include limescale on pipes, taps and inside kettles, and scum forming on water when soap is added. Hard water is seen in areas such as Lake Malawi, where the fish have adapted to a high pH and hardness.\n\nLimescale and soap scum do not occur in soft water areas. Soft water runs over impervious rock such as granite or filters through leaf litter or peat so does not pick up as many minerals. Jungle streams are a good example of soft water habitats, where fish such as tetras and corydoras have adapted to the acidic water with a low level of dissolved minerals. Leaf litter and peat add tannic acid to the water, which then turns brown. This is known as 'blackwater'.\n\nThere are 2 types of hardness- carbonate or temporary hardness (also known as alkalinity) and general or total hardness. Carbonate hardness is mostly calcium carbonate (CaCO3) which comes from chalk and limestone and can be removed from water by boiling. A higher level of CaCO3 in water means the water has a great buffering capability and the pH will be more stable than water with lower KH. General hardness includes all minerals dissolved in the tap water. Boiling water will not remove general hardness.\n\nHardness is measured in several ways: KH is carbonate hardness is measured in mg of CaCO3 per litre or ppm. General hardness measures all dissolved minerals. This is the type of hardness that is generally referred to in fish care. It is measured in mg CaCO3 per litre or ppm (even though other minerals are present) or in dH. 1 dH is equal to 17.9mg of CaCo3 per litre.\n\nMonitoring the water hardness in the aquarium is very important as water that is too hard or soft for the fish can cause the fish's immune system to drop, leaving it susceptible to infection.\n\nCan you tell me how to lower water hardness.I live in the London area,where the water is generally hard,and would like to lower the Gh and Kh due to the fish I keep. I have tried doing water changes with Ro water,any other advice would be most welcome."

The primary reason, according to the report: The laws intended to protect our water supplies, the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), are not being enforced. In fact, researchers found, barely 3 percent of violations resulted in fines or other significant penalties by state officials responsible for enforcing the law.\n\nIs your water safe?\n\nWhether you water is safe or contaminated depends on several factors: its source, what treatment it receives (if any), and the quality of the pipes in your home. Follow these simple steps to check out the quality of your water:\n\n* Find out about your water system. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulates the community water systems that supply drinking water to most Americans. Every water system is required to publish a yearly \"consumer confidence report\" detailing contaminants or violations of water quality standards. You can see the report for your water system by contacting the system directly. To find your water system, visit\n\n* Have water from your own well tested. Wells, which are not typically regulated by the SDWA, are more likely to contain contaminants than municipal water systems. The EPA advises that you test well water annually, especially if you see signs of trouble like corroded pipes, strange odors or stained laundry.\n\n* Check to see if there are free or low cost testing services available. Your municipality, county or state health department may offer free or low-cost testing services; otherwise, you can use a laboratory certified in your state. The EPA has a list at  For further information on well water quality, the EPA suggests consulting nonprofit groups like the American Ground Water Trust.\n\n* Decide which contaminants to test for. Ask for guidance from the lab or your local health department on which contaminants to test for. Find out whether radon or heavy metals like arsenic are present in underground rocks or soils in your area. Tell the laboratory if you live near a farm, an industrial cattle-feeding operation, a gas station, a mine, a factory, a dump or any kind of operation that might produce contaminants that can find their way into ground water.\n\nNRDC recommends that you test your tap water for lead contamination, particularly if you have young kids, are pregnant, or thinking about becoming pregnant, since lead is especially dangerous and levels can vary enormously from house to house. A lead test costs about $25 (see, for example, University of North Carolina's low-cost testing information).\n\nWhat should you do if your water is contaminated?\n\nOnce you have identified the problem, you can take the appropriate steps to fix it.\n\n* If the problem is corroded pipes in your home, consider replacing them.\n\n* If your well is contaminated by bacteria, you can have it disinfected or you can drill a deeper well.\n\n* If your water contains other contaminants—including heavy metals, pesticides, volatile organic chemicals, minerals, parasites or bacteria—you should consider installing a filtration system.

They don't expect\nmuddy water, or salmonella-diseased water. This is because we've gotten used to\nhaving water treatment plants collect, store, filter, purify, and deliver our\nwater into our house for us. The very cleanest water has been distilled, but\nover a long period of time, distilled water can be bad for you because you're\nmissing out on the trace minerals that are normally obtained through your\nwater. Most of the water we drink has chlorine added into it at some point\nalong the line because chlorine is very cheap and yet very effective at killing\nthings in the water. If the time ever came when the faucet didn't spout clean\nwater, whether through power disruption or some other cause, most of us would\nbe in trouble.\n\nMost people just imagine drinking\nout of a lake or stream. I think they literally picture dipping their cup into\ntheir (private) water source, and just drinking it. Maybe the Indians could get\naway with it, but our immune systems have gotten weak from lack of serious use,\nand we can't handle that kind of thing. I've never seen specific research, but I suspect even they had some serious\nillness/death from that from time to time.\n\nThe first step is some kind of a\nfilter. They can range anywhere from a clean sock, to something like a Big Berkey. Even if you're only collecting rain water from your roof, that water\ncan pick up some nasty things from off of your roof, and needs to be filtered.\nThere are 2 nice thing about roof water; it won't be as disease-ridden as a\npond's water, and you can collect a lot of it. For a calculator, click\nhere.\n\nOnce you've collected and filtered\nyour water, you must get rid of the bacteria/viruses in the water itself. Since\nvery few filters clean these out due to their small size, you must kill them.\n\nThe best solution is obviously\nboiling. Since most of us aren't surrounded by massive forests that can be\naccessed, and many situations that involve a cutoff of water involve a cutoff\nof electricity, that's out of the question.\n\nFor me, the solution is to store\ncalcium hypochlorite powder, and use it only if necessary. Again, make sure\nyou've filtered it first very well. The cloudier your water is, the more\nchlorine it takes. (Chlorine isn't the best for you since it's so corrosive, so\nyou don't want to be adding any more than you need.)\n\nSodium hypochlorite and calcium\nhypochlorite are the easiest ways to get chlorine to purify your own water.\nSodium hypochlorite is a liquid, commonly called bleach, while calcium\nhypochlorite is a powder (the main ingredient in most pool shocks). Either one\nworks, and both are equally good, but they have their advantages/disadvantages.\n\nSodium hypochlorite (bleach)\n\nCalcium hypochlorite (pool shock)\n\nAdvantages\n\nDisadvantages\n\nAdvantages\n\nDisadvantages\n\nEasier to store\n\nMore expensive\n\nCheaper\n\nHarder to store\n\nLess suspicious sellers\n\nSooner expiration\n\nLater expiration\n\nMore suspicious sellers\n\nEasier to measure\n\nHarder to measure\n\nThe easiest to buy/store/use is\nregular bleach. You will want to leave the bottle unopened, as doing so aids in\nthe deterioration process. You don't want bleach with any chemicals added. You\ndon't want bleach with \"watermelon scent\". You want regular unscented bleach.\nAlso, the idea of using bleach isn't reserved to the prepper group. I just went\nthrough a Harris county emergency response class, and they briefly spoke about\nit. Also, its use is referred to on the FEMA website here.\nIf you're looking for the ratios of bleach-to-water, they are listed at the\nbottom of the page.\n\nEven more than bleach, I like\ncalcium hypochlorite, the major component of pool shock. It has some major\ndisadvantages, though. There are horror stories on the internet about it\nrusting through ammo cans and penetrating into/out of plastic buckets. The way\nI understand it, the best way to store it is in a glass bottle with a glass lid\nin a shed where you have no food, and no metal items. That seems a little\noverdoing it to me, but I don't know. I have mine still in the original sealed\nbag, then sealed in 2 ziplocs, 1 inside of the other, then all that is in one\nof those glass jars with the metal clamps that clamps the glass lid with the\nrubber seal against the mouth of the jar. Then, I double wrapped the whole\nthing in trash bags, and zip tied it shut. Another disadvantage is when you go\nto buy it. I triggered a few odd looks when I was looking for it. For\nsome reason, the Wal-Mart near me had a certain brand that had what appeared to\nbe chemicals in it. I think I found what I was looking for a Leslie's pool\nsupply store near me. I know the clerk was worried about me, because right away, he asked me what kind of pool I was getting it for, and I told him I didn't have a pool, and that I was getting it to purify water. He was very helpful, and printed out the\nhazard sheet on it. I made sure to pay in cash, just in case he started\nwondering if I was a terrorist with some big ideas. The last disadvantage is because it's so potent, it's very easy to add too\nmuch or too little when purifying smaller amounts of water.\n\nDespite the major disadvantages\nabove, it's still my top pick for a few reasons. First of all, it's cheap; I\npaid under $5 for a 1 pound bag of it. ¼ ounce will purify about 100 gallons,\nso a 1 pound bag will purify roughly 6,400 gallons, or enough for a family of 4\nto use just over 4 gallons each per day for a year. If you tried to store that\nmuch water, it would weigh over 26 tons, and take up 850 cubic feet. That's a\nlot of water purified for $5!\n\nThere are a few warnings I need to\ngive about using this stuff.\n\n1. In high enough concentrations, it WILL kill you. In low enough\nconcentrations, it won't be effective. Since we aren't depending on this to\nsurvive yet, we don't have\nexperience in telling how much to use. Most people seem to advocate using 1 tsp\nof pool shock for 100 gallons of water, but others say just to add more powder\nuntil you smell it.\n\n2. Don't store water you've added bleach to in plastic. I've heard that it\nwill break down the plastic and the water will absorb it. Personally, I\ndon't think it's that big of a deal. With the tiny amount of chlorine present,\nI don't think it would do that much to the plastic.\n\n3. Opened liquid bleach breaks down into water and chlorine gas. That\nmeans it loses its potency. If you've had a opened bottle of bleach under the\nsink for the last year, it might work, but it might take double the dosage.\nThat's another advantage to using the pool shock powder, since it lasts longer.\n\n4. Although chlorine kills viruses and bacteria, it won't kill cysts. Cysts\nare hard-shelled bacteria that build a shell to protect themselves against\nhostile environments, then, when they are in a more favorable environment, they\nbreak down the shell, and go about their business. The best way to kill cysts\nis to boil water for at least 1 minute.\n\n5. Use more in cloudy water. Again, I'm not going to give you a 'for\nsure' dosage, since I'm not a scientist who studies this type of thing, but it\nloses its effectiveness when you are using cloudy water.\n\nThere are a bunch of numbers out\nthere for what ratios to use, so I'm going to write down a few, and links to\nthe places where I got them, so you can decide for yourself who to trust."

Unlike TB, these infections are not contagious.\n\nIt is not clear that sinus rinsings with tap water caused these infections, as the water in the homes of patients was not tested for atypical TB.\n\nSinus rinsing involves squirting salt water into one nostril, up into the sinuses and out the other side. Sinus rinses are commonly used by allergy patients to rinse out pollen from the nose.\n\nAll the study patients had rinsed their sinuses with tap water and salt, so infection from water is a possibility. Several special antibiotics cleared up Bill's TB-like infection.\n\nDoctors say more studies need to be done on tap water-TB-like sinusitis connection.\n\n\"At this point, to be the safest, we are suggesting that patients use sterile saline water to irrigate their nose,\" Walsh said.\n\nThis is a very preliminary report, with many unanswered questions. Most sinus infections are caused by viruses and some by germs that are sensitive to standard antibiotics. But for an infection that don't get better for weeks, a patient might consider this very unusual infection and check with a doctor."

Tesco have tried to say that it comes from a source in France, but have admitted that it is UK Mains water and Asda have admitted that it comes from filtered Yorkshire Water. The supermarkets and suppliers are enjoying a mark up 2,500%.\n\nTesco have tried to say that it comes from a source in France, but have admitted that it is UK Mains water\n\nWhilst it is at least good that the water does in fact come from the UK instead of France, why does Tesco put caring about supporting other country's economies before the UK's economy first by sourcing things from countries like France and Belgium etc?\n\nWhen I was in the UK, I have brought bottled spring water from shops before, and it is sourced from Scotland, yet the price was still dirt cheap!\n\nIts not really a shock but i wouldn't be suprised if they disapeared off the shelves soon due to falling sales as Dasani water did afew years ago.It doesn't really matter either way because all water is recycled.To me the only thing that matters is that it isn't grey and doesn't have bits floating in itQuote:\n\nAsda said: 'Our two-litre bottle is 17p. For comparison – if a customer bought a Brita water filter jug at £16 and used it for the recommended 40 gallons, it would cost 21p to produce two litres of filtered water. We're saving our customers time and money – as well as providing a container.'\n\nI am really quite impressed that the seemingly sleazy DM has actually published this front page journalism at the expense of two of their largest advertisers instead of quietly burying it. How strange.\n\nHasn't this been known for ages? I thought anything not labelled mineral water could legally be tap water?\n\nIt can but to lead people to believe it is anything other than tap water is illegal , and that is what many stores are doing. Including the Tesco spokesperson\n\nShe said: 'My understanding from speaking to our water buyer is that it originates from a spring in France.' Asked whether it was filtered mains tap water, she said: 'No, absolutely not. No, its origin is French, but it is bottled in the UK – I think somewhere in the West Midlands\n\nThey should be made to label them with the fact that it is filtered tap waterCompletely agree! Our tap water is absolutely fine for making hot drinks like tea and coffee, but if I want to just drink cold water I always have a cheap bottle of water in my fridge. Tastes loads better and costs next to nothing!Well that has to be the biggest load of nonsense i ever read, you only buy the jug once, after that filters are about 3 quid each making it around 3p for 2 litres."

      "text": "High fluoride levels in drinking water are (a little contentiously) associated with a decrease in IQ, yet only at levels far exceeding safe fluoride levels in the US (over 4 mg/L generally, and reaching as high as 11 mg/L, compared to the CDC recommended level of 0.7–1.2 mg/L). However, many of these studies are performed in China, and confounding factors (including arsenic contamination) are common.\n\nThis paper highlights some common concerns and questions about fluoridation.\n\nBrief extract:\n\nThe charges raised by opponents tend to be more sophisticated variations on themes used since the inception of water fluoridation, namely, unproven adverse health consequences (eg, cancer, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]) and infringement on freedom of choice. Their strong appeals and messages associating fluoridation with cancer and AIDS, although disproven, can and have had a powerful influence on the public.\n\nAlthough antifluoridationists have gained much publicity in an attempt to create the illusion of scientific controversy over fluoridation, claims of health hazards from water fluoridation at the appropriate level are unfounded. Fluoridation is perhaps the most thoroughly studied community health measure in recent history.\n\nI'm not qualified to opine on any of those medical concerns, but the second one struck a nerve with me.\n\nI wouldn't pose a danger to my community if I don't drink flouridated water - why then can the government essentially require me to participate in a non-essential medical procedure?\n\nPersonally, I'd still participate. I've been drinking tap water my entire life (growing up in NYC) - but I'm growing more sympathetic towards people who want the option to opt out of something like this.\n\nPoint 2 is a judgement that I don't agree with. It would be true only if everyone MUST consume fluoridated water, not merely have it provided as their tap water. There are very small portions of the population who probably shouldn't drink fluoridated water and those options are available to them. Should the government provide some compensation for the additional costs on these people? Possibly. The issue is even non/low fluoridated water is readily accessible and cheap which makes the costs concerns fairly negligible. Just look in your grocery store for reverse osmosis/distilled water. Those living in rural enough areas where grocery stores might not keep water in stock are nearly guaranteed to be consuming well water anyway. In which case any fluoride in the water is from natural sources and that person needs to take it upon themselves to find an appropriate solution."

      "text": "When bottled water first hit the states, it was considered to be chic and European (Evian, Perrier.) As its popularity grew, people mocked the idea that someone would actually pay that much money for water. Then, due perhaps to its convenience and a lack of trust in our water supply, it became an ubiquitous part of everyday life. This has led to staggering statistics, such as the fact that we consume 53 billion gallons of bottled water a year globally and that we throw 3 billion pounds of empty water bottles into landfills every year.\n\nTake our survey and read on for more bottled water statistics.\n\nDid you know that 40% of all bottled water is taken from municipal water sources (aka tap water) and it takes three times the amount of water to produce the bottle as it does to fill it? Or that 17 million barrels of oil are used in the production of water bottles yearly and this is enough oil to fuel 1 million cars for a year? Check out this infographic for more statistics.\n\nComments (37)\n\nWe only buy bottled if we're out and didn't bring our own water with us, or occasionally my husband will get some to bring to work when his Nalgene is too bulky (e.g. if he's not bringing his bag). But it's pretty rare that we do.\n\nI'm not sure about everywhere else, but where I'm from (near Toronto, Ontario), the standards on testing for tap water are MUCH more strict than for bottled. It's checked several times a day rather than a few times a year!!\n\nThere should be another option: I buy filtered water in reusable, ecco-friendly jugs (3- and 5-gallons). It is not a choice; it is a necessity.\n\nWe rent and cannot afford to move right now. Over the years, our tap water has become increasingingly contaminated with black specks or rust, so we cannot use tap water for drinking or cooking.\n\nThis is relatively common in areas where a city has not upgraded its water piping for decades upon decades or the houses are very old.\n\nWe use those large refillable jugs you can buy at Whole Foods and refill them once a week. We had our water tested, and were told to use it mostly for showers, washing clothes or watering plants to avoid consuming the rusty or particle-filled water, so we use the refill jugs for cooking and drinking for ourselves and our pets.\n\nWe use filters for the shower, washing machine, and dishwasher. We cannot have an ice maker in our fridge. Our hot water heater gets replaced every few years due to the sediments (we also live in a very hard-water area).\n\nAt least this way we don't have to worry about floating particles or off-tastes. Using counter-top filters such as Britta is not feasible because we tend to go through about 20 to 25 gallons a week, but feel the extra expense and effort to refill the large jugs is worth it. We purchased a stand for the jugs that heats or cools the water from the jugs as we need/use it.\n\nAlso, because we are buy the latest version of the bottles, clean them regularly as recommended, and examine them for cracks or warping, we feel we are not harming the environment or our health. The jugs, properly cared for, will last for a long time and supposedly can be recycled.\n\nI dont buy bottled water, but I dont filll from the tap either. We have a whole-house water softener and filtering system. Yes, it was very expensive, but over time it pays for itself and was one of the best investments we made. Our clothes last longer, our skin doesn't get all dried-out feeling, and we can cook and drink fresh clean water whenever we need it.\n\nI just drink tap; even from *gasp* public water fountains.\nI carry around a refillable water bottle, which I fill with tap. I don't think I've bought bottled water in about 10 years. Not dead yet! But to each their own (except when you litter w/ your bottles...think of the whales!)\n\nThe only tap water I decided not to drink was quite close to a fracking site, smelled heavily of sulphur, stained/bleached clothing, and caused gastrointestinal distress in those that drank it.\nBe careful, West Virginia.\n\nIf I am buying a beverage, it is usually going to be water, so yes I still purchase bottled water. At home I use a Brita filter pitcher. I agree it is usually safe to drink tap water, but it simply tastes horrible. If people who buy bottled coke aren't going to be persecuted, I really don't see why those who drink water should be. There just aren't fountains everywhere anymore, unlike Italy where I drank from delicious (ancient!) fountains.\n\nI have three, two-gallon jugs that I fill with filtered water from our grocery store for drinking and making our coffee and tea. Our tap water is fine, but I just can't stand the taste of it. But I think bottled water is gross, too. Tastes like plastic.\n\nThe only bottle water I buy is distilled (to put in my cpap device) and of course tonic water. You pay taxes to support an amazing infrastructure that brings healthy water right to your tap. Moving plastic bottles of water halfway around the world is a scandalous waste of our finite resources!\n\nIf I'm out and need a drink, and my option is bottled water or a bottle of pop, I'm going with water. We also bought a ton of bottled when the Boston area was under a boil water order and we had no stove to boil it on (kitchen renovation). Other than that, I think it's a waste of money.\n\nFor those of you buying jugs of filtered water from the grocery store: you might want to check out getting your own filter - either the pitcher type or the kind you mount on your faucet. I'd bet it would be a lot cheaper.\n\nI never ever buy regular bottled water. In fact, I just got a SodaStream and am enjoying making my own seltzer and soda with it. However, I do occasionally buy bottled sparkling mineral water, but only for special occasion dinners, maybe once every few months, if that.\n\nUnfortunately, I still buy it in bottles for work. At home, I drink tap. I fill glass bottles and keep them in the door of the fridge. I like my water cold. I hate the feeling and taste of water out of my Sigg bottle. I tried really hard to get over it, but just haven't been able to handle it. It's almost like I get a mild electric shock from it. :::shudder:::: So, at work, I still drink bottled water. The glass bottles aren't practical for a teacher. And after talking all day, I really need the hydration.\n\nI used to be a frequent flyer and I felt my options were always so sadly limited going through airports. There's rarely water fountains to fill up reusable bottles (like my beloved SIGG) and it's just as wasteful to get a cup of water from an airport food court than a full bottle. If someone could invent a water fountain / refilling station for airports, you'd hit a gold mine.\n\nI recently left a position where I flew at least twice a month. I always traveled with my Sigg and my stainless travel mug. Both containers would go through security empty, and my Sigg would get filled at the first water fountain that I'd see. Unlike Everything But The..., I had no problem finding water fountains both here in the US and internationally.\n\nWhen the TSA at the Capital building made me throw out my 3 year old 1 liter Sigg (which was empty!), I stepped up and bought a combo widemouth/standard bottle. With this I was able to get a full liter in the bottle before departure.\n\nI love seltzer water but felt so bad about the energy that went into making and shipping the bottles that I invested in a Soda Stream. I love it!! If you drink seltzer on a regular basis, it is seriously the best thing you could buy!\n\nI buy bottled water. I buy gallon sized bottles of distilled and spring. I buy the 12 ounce bottles and fill a wine cooler up. I buy bottled tonic water. I recycle faithfully and that is that. I've seen plenty of people use filters, tap etc - and I'm sorry that doesn't seem like fresh water - the filters get yucky, your faucet is yucky - just buy bottled water in moderation and recycle or repurpose the bottles!\n\nI never buy bottled water. I try not to be a heartless environmentalist, but it really bothers me when people say things like \"I just cannot get over the taste of tap water from a steel bottle\". Grow up. A slightly different tasting water is a really selfish, and unnecessary use of resources.\n\nRecently I've been thinking about this... regarding food safety and plastic container (doesn't help after watching a german english documentary about it!)\n\nwhere I live (Hungary), I buy daily at least 2 x 1.5 litre bottle of mineral water. We just don't like the taste of tap water. We send the bottles for recycling. At the moment, I don't see other option other than using a filter in the future.\n\nI never bought bottled water when I lived in the US, but like kriszti, I now live in Hungary (hi!), where the ingestion of ásványvíz (mineral water) is a way of life and is considered to be beneficial to one's health. so I buy sparkling mineral water (about 1 L a week), drink tap at home, and drink the bottled mineral water provided by my work.\n\nThe college I work at has actually removed all bottled water and installed filtered water machines in a few places on campus (I work at a college in a metropolitan area, so the \"campus\" is only two buildings!). I just bring my aluminum water bottle with me and fill it up, which is great.\n\nWhen I get home, I use a Brita, although I know our tap water is safe (I cook with it!), I just like the cold, fresh taste of water from the fridge.\n\nFor long road trips, I buy bottled water because I live in Arizona, where you don't take off across the desert in the car without water. Since these are rare for me, it doesn't make sense to maintain a dedicated reusable water bottle -- it'd just get dirty in the car or lost in the back of the kitchen cupboards.\n\nI do store bottled water in the pantry in case I have guests and they prefer it, but I take a refillable water bottle to work and fill it before I go. The water in the town I work in is so horrible that even the county water workers won't drink it!\n\nOn a side note, I also refuse to buy Figi water after they tried to bully the country into not taxing them any more!\n\nOnce Figi refused to back down, the water company came clean and said they didn't plan on stopping operations. They also bought a local winery where I live which I won't frequent anymore either! Sorry for the side note...\n\nI use steel Kleen Kanteen bottles for iced tea made with tap water. Usually when we go on vacation, I'll buy one bottle of water after I go through the TSA's \"security theater\" area, then refill it from the tap as needed.\n\nI took it upon myself to take charge of recycling the water bottles we use at work and you would not believe the number of them we go through. The amount of waste involved is just staggering, and if I didn't recycle them, they'd just throw them all away.\n\nI try not to, but sometimes if I need a portable water container and I don't have a water bottle with me, I'll pick one up. Usually this is if I spontaneously decide to go for a hike while I'm out or something like that.\n\nI only buy it if I am out running and can't find a working fountain to drink from. So during the winter this is more often as they turn off the fountains, but otherwise it's very rare.\n\nThere are water fountains virtually everywhere and they are free, even in places with expensive bottled water (museums, concert venues, etc) and bars must give free water. There's no excuse to buy a bottle unless you are in a pinch -"

      "text": "Posts Tagged 'water purification'\n\nSometimes, it's the simplest technologies that have the greatest potential impact on people's lives. Take the Vestergaard Frandsen Group's mobile personal filtration system, otherwise known as LifeStraw. It is a powder-blue plastic tube—much thicker than an ordinary straw—containing filters that make water teeming with typhoid-,cholera- and diarrhea-causing microorganisms drinkable. Now, to be clear, we do not sell this item…yet. We just love to report what's going on out there in the water purification world.\n\nThe filters, made up of a halogenated resin, kill nearly 100 percent of bacteria and nearly 99 percent of the viruses that pass through LifeStraw. A University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill evaluation tested the device's performance in water containingEscherichia coli B and Enterococcus faecalisbacteria and the MS2 coliphage virus as well as iodine and silver. The results indicated that LifeStraw filtered out all contaminants to levels where they don't pose a health risk to someone drinking the water.\n\nBut the device does not filter heavy metals such as iron or fluoride nor does it remove parasites like cryptosporidium or giardia, although the Switzerland-based company's CEO, Mikkel Vestergaard Frandsen, says there is a version of LifeStraw available to relief groups in Bangladesh and India that can filter arsenic.\n\nAt less than 10 inches (25 centimeters) long, the device can filter up to 185 gallons (700 liters) of water, estimated to be about a year's supply for one person. The device is no longer usable when its filters become too clogged to pass water through, typically after a year of hard use.\n\nThe success of the personal filtration system led Vestergaard Frandsen to introduce earlier this month its LifeStraw Family device, an instant microbiological purifier that provides about 2.6 gallons (10 liters) of safe drinking water in an hour and about 4,000 gallons (15,000 liters) over its life span for a family of six. LifeStraw Family is designed to sieve dirt, parasites, bacteria and viruses, and will be available starting in May.\n\nThink about where your water comes from….and we don't just mean the sink! Expand your mind and remember that water comes from unclean, natural resources like rivers and lakes, which contain pollution and contaminants that are unfit for consumption. To be clean, the water should undergo a number of treatments necessary to make it drinkable.\n\nWater treatment additives such as chlorine, fluoride, and other toxic chemicals\n\nBacteria and viruses such as giardia, cryptosporidium, coliform and E-coli\n\nToxic Heavy Metals\n\nWater purifiers are specifically designed to eliminate or reduce these certain pollutants that are in our drinking water. They also improve the quality and taste of the water by\neliminating its chlorine content.\n\nIt is virtually impossible to know what is in tap water at any given time because municipal water quality as well as private well water varies from place to place, season to season, and house to house.\n\nEven if all of the toxic metals could be completely filtered at the local water treatment facility, they could still end up in your drinking water because rust and sediment build up in the water pipes within our homes. Even this minimal exposure can cause symptoms similar to the flu, such as headaches, diarrhea, cramps, nausea or vomiting.\n\nThe only way we can have any control over the quality of water we drink is by having a personal water filter system. Filtered drinking water is the most reliable and least expensive way to get healthy water!\n\nDepending on where you live, your drinking water may need some type of filtration, but which is right for you? Do you need a water filter or a water softener? What if you need both? How do you know which one is right for you?\n\nWell, to answer these questions, let's take a look at what water filters and water softeners do, then you can decide on the best solution for you and your family's water filtration needs:\n\nWater Softeners\n\nSo, what exactly does a water softener do and why do you need it? Well, simply, they soften hard water. Hard water is full of minerals and deposits such as calcium and magnesium. Although no harm will come to you from hard water, it's nightmare for cleaning showers, tubs and causes problems for pipes and plumbing fixtures.\n\nBy using a water softener, you will break down the hardness or materials in the water. Different softeners use different methods including: ion, electrical and magnetics. It's best to get your water tested to find out for sure, if you have hard water. Then decide on what method works best for you.\n\nWater Filters\n\nWithout purifying our drinking water, you could consume things that contribute to disease and illness. To prevent this, most water treatment facilities employ chemicals such as chlorine to treat the water. This, however, introduces new problems for us. I mean, you would you want to drink something that resembles the water in a swimming pool? I didn't think so. So counter this, there's water filters.\n\nBasically, water filters take out all the bad things in your water like the chlorine and other chemicals – leaving you with clean tasting and smelling drinking water. The most common filter is a carbon-based filter – it can remove the majority of chemicals in your water.\n\nWhat's Best For Your Water?\n\nFor many a water filter is all they will ever need. For others, a water softener plus water filter is a requirement. Remember how we said to test your water? Well, if you find out you have hard water, it's best to get yourself a combination filter and softener to clean out the impurities in your drinking water. Otherwise, stick with a single water filter for your water purification needs.\n\nOver 1.2 billion people around the globe don't have access to potable water. Many of them live in the continent of Africa. So it should come as no surprise that a solution to this problem might come from an inventor who lives there.\n\nMeet Dr. Eugene Cloete. A microbiologist by training, Cloete is currently the Dean of Natural Sciences at the University of Stellenbosch, just outside Cape Town, South Africa. In addition to his teaching ability, Dr. Cloete apparently has a knack for invention. With nine patents to his name, the first of which he earned at the age of 23, Eugene has adopted a way of thinking different than that of most peoples'. \"[creativity is] like reading and writing,\" said Cloete, \"the more you use it, the better you get.\"\n\nWith much of South Africa's tap water riddled with disease-causing bacteria, heavy metals, and pesticide residue, something needed to be done. In short, Dr. Cloete has invented a disposable filter, which looks very similar to a tea bag, to filter water as it is poured from a bottle. Each filter is capable of ridding bacteria, heavy metals, and harmful chemicals from about 15 liters of water before it needs to be thrown away.\n\nCloete, an expert on inhibiting growth of bacterial slime, says he came up with the idea while on a faculty tour of his current department. He happened to notice a tea bag sitting on the break room counter when he started to explore the idea. It wasn't until he watched a presentation at the university during which a student demonstrated how to spin nanofibers – filaments finer than human hair – that he figured out how to do it. He combined this technology with both that of the anti-bacterial membranes he had already been working on, and the traditional water filtration component activated carbon to yield the filter.\n\nSince announcing the invention in July, Dr. Cloete and his team of two post-doctoral colleges have received hundreds of inquiries from excited philanthropists, aid organizations, and retailers. This little tea bag is sure to save lives.\n\nReverse Osmosis, also known as hyper filtration, is the preferred method of seawater and brackish water purification. As the equipment needed to perform reverse osmosis is cost-effective, and the process requires little input energy compared to other methods of purification, reverse osmosis has become the worldwide leader among desalinization methods. Developed at UCLA, and used commercially since the 1970's, seawater reverse osmosis has served marine professionals for nearly 40 years.\n\nSeawater Reverse Osmosis (SWRO) is used in a wide range of commercial applications. Marine professionals such as commercial fisherman and offshore rig workers rely on SWRO to provide freshwater for routine daily tasks such as bathing, cleaning and of course, drinking.\n\nIn larger applications, such as cruise ships, SWRO is sometimes also used. In such applications, it is necessary not only to desalinize water, but to provide quality freshwater. Cruise liner restaurant professionals count on SWRO for water used for cooking, as well as making coffee, soda and other beverages. Here, consistency is key. By way of its simple yet effective design, reverse osmosis is able to consistently satisfy the needs of those who count on it.\n\nThe process itself is relatively simple and straightforward. In order to purify a liquid, the \"solvent\" (in this case, water) is put under pressure in excess of 250 psi for brackish water and 1000 psi for seawater, forcing it through a semi-permeable membrane. This application-specific membrane allows water molecules to pass through, but catches \"solutes,\" yielding purified water. When employed, reverse osmosis is capable of not only of de-salting water, but also removing other impurities such as bacteria, ions and particulates.\n\nUltraviolet water sterilization is a process by which the threat of microorganisms and other biological contaminants, which are present in municipal water supplies and private sources (like wells), can be effectively nullified through exposure to a specialized ultraviolet bulb.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nSterilization systems which employ ultraviolet radiation operate on a few simple principles. First, a UV source, which is usually as simple as a specialized light bulb, is placed inside a reflective quartz sleeve. This sleeve is placed over a flow chamber which exposes all water passing through the system to a unique, specially determined germicidal wavelength of 254 nanometers.

When fecal sludge is filtered through a porous scaffolding, these particles will react with the waste matter to generate recycled resources, like water, hydrogen, electrolytes or methane. These can either be used immediately or stored for later use.\n\nimage via Shutterstock\n\nWith the funding from the Gates Foundation, the team will now get to work turning their concept into a functioning prototype. First, they'll focus on developing a stand-alone sanitation device that will make it cheaper for people in developing countries to adopt the technology where large sewage networks may not exist. Where sewage infrastructure is in place, the technology could be hooked into the system, minimising implementation costs for home owners.\n\n\"In the future, we may see homes in the U.K. generating their own clean water, energy and fertilizer simply by doing what comes naturally to us all once or twice day,\" said Martyn McLachlan of Imperial College, in a statement. \"More important are the implications for developing countries, where the provision of clean drinking water is essential for supporting life and self-generated energy could be used to support economic growth.\""

Growing up, this is how it worked with milk for our family! Besides, this might also be cheaper for the manufacturers, since their drinking water product could be transported in larger quantities and distributed over a small, inexpensive local vending station."

Tons of Americans have been in Rio over the last few years to help grow the partnership.Just because you don't here much about r&d outside of the petroleum and engineering industries, doesn't mean it's not there.\nJust because something has an \"American\" brand to it like Glaxo Smith Kline, doesn't mean it's not Brazilian.Just because Brazilian industries haven't reached the same size as American ones, doesn't mean they aren't among the biggest or most advanced in the world.Finally, if Brazil occasionally gets around the hurdles of Big Pharma to help people by breaking IP regs, then so be it. Bostonians gets around their ridiculous prices by illegally importing drugs from Canada. Did Massachusetts suddenly leave the US and become a third world country that doesn't invest in research?\n\n1) two wrongs don't make a right. Besides, individual action does not equal state sponsorship. Importing drugs into the US from Canada is ILLEGAL and the gov't certainly tries to stop it.\n\n2) Fio Cruz does exist. In fact, a relative of mine works there. But, how is that relevant to the issue at hand? Seems like you are most interested in talking about pride, the typical chip on your shoulder that's so omnipresent in Brazil...\n\nJust because Brazil does SOME research it should be able to violate IP? No.\n\n3) Who said the patents were held by the US? They are held by companies, universities, etc. It's that simple. Patents represent financial investment, not to mention intelligent management and human toiling. Trust me, I used to do bench work@expat666 - Why the attack mode? Just so you know the process, you call a guy to bring you water. He brings you new galões filled with water and TAKES AWAY the old galões to be re-used again. For the individual bottles I bought today, they will most likely be recycled.\n\n@sven, I mentioned that here I wouldn't be surprised if they really did use tap water . There's actually a distributor not far from where I live. I have seen large trucks of water coming into their \"compound\" and them taking the water from the truck and filling the galões. The owner claims that water is SUPER FISCALIZED here. He gave me a couple of examples when I saw him @ the buteco, but I was probably drinking caxaça at the time and I have since forgotten.\n\n-\n** Just sayin' **\n** Make lemonaid out of lemons. **\n** Trolls get old...**I am from Fortaleza and I live in Germany right now. but I want to go to Brazil and open a business in Fortaleza. I am looking for a business partner. Are you still interested?\nPlease contact me.I have the knowledge, and good ideaIf I lived closer to the US, I would probably have already bought a couple of these cheap houses just to rent out.\n\nEven here, when you go to look at a place to rent or to buy, it's usually got so many problems that you are going to spend money to fix it up.\n\nThis is a cultural thing to me: there are so many Brazilians that live in an apartment or rent commercial space that do nothing but put in gambiarras because they don't want to spend 1 centavo.\n\nIf the owner loves the property and keeps it in good shape, they are going to bend-you-over on the rent or on the sale price. Frustrating... that's why I try to do the *maximum* that I can possibly do myself. When something is difficult and I have to call someone, rest assured that I stay there to watch what they are doing"

It is our responsibility to keep the waters clean and without help from individuals, communities, and corporations, water could be undrinkable and dangerous to our bodies and to our environment. Water pollution comes in many shapes and sizes. It could be from the toilet we flush to the way we dispose of our garbage. Currently, we have existing laws that help protect our waters to an extent, but much more needs to be done in order to ensure safe waters for our future generations. Our streets, yards, and our environment are exposed to polluted waters but there are simple solutions to water pollution that can be implemented by even the youngest person.\n\n1) Law Enforcement – There are environmental policies in place based on extensive scientific research. By enforcing the environmental laws we will reduce the amount of water pollution all around the world. It does not require special education or training to enforce environmental policies. The only requirement is the ability to act.\n2) Reduce or Eliminate Pesticides and Insecticides – The runoff of the chemicals in these produces are a large contributing reason to the pollution problem. Water runoff carries these chemicals to the nearest sewer system or waterway, leading to contamination and pollution issues.\n3) Stop Littering – Littering is not only illegal, it is one of the leading causes of water pollution. Common litter products are plastics. These products have BPA, an endocrine disruptor, which leads to health problems in both male and female.\n4) Air pollution leads to water pollution – Air pollution is caused by burning plastics and other compounds, driving excessively, and improper disposal of acids, amongst other things.\n\nAs time goes on more and more creative ways of finding solutions to our water pollution problems are being explored and implemented creating a cleaner earth.\n\nLow Impact Development\n\nCommunities around the world are finding solutions to water pollution and one of them is low impact development. This development reduces the amount of pollutants that get back into the waterways and water systems in the local community. It combines the utilization of xeriscaping, landscaping, and technology to provide ways for rainfall and water runoff to evaporate back into the atmosphere instead of polluting nearby bodies of water. Development of this sort is being seen all across the country regardless of how big or small the community is.\nAs low impact development continues to pick up steam, it is important for everyone to get involved in the act of reducing water pollution. It is our responsibility to keep our waters safe for ourselves and future generations to come. Because so much of life depends on clean water, we must remain active and vigilant. Our diligence in keeping our waters pollution-free will net numerous benefits.\n\nJennifer Ramin is a conservation writer, she works with NRDC and other organizations to protect our health and environment.

      "text": "Water\n\nThis post is developed to display why the water we're drinking is bad for us, because it is highly unlikely that the urban water filters that are in spot can filter out all of the little contaminants that are present in the water. Those contaminants are listed as portion of the effects of urbanization on our water.\n\nThese contaminants will acidify the water when they begin to decompose and as a result you will finish up drinking acidic water which pushes your already higher level of acidity even greater. All of these industrial pollutants, brought on by the industrial visitors can be filtered out by water ionizers and leave you with pure water to cleanse your body with.\n\nWaterborne pathogens\n\nWaterborne pathogens can be illness-inducing protozoans, viruses or bacteria that are absorbed by a person when they drink unprocessed or insufficiently treated water. There are two major protozoans which are getting media coverage lately and they are Giardia and Cryptosporidium. Consumption of those can result in grievous issues within the digestive program, which could probably be life-threatening for these individuals who are either quite young or extremely old or these with impaired immune systems.\n\nA huge quantity of cities routinely examine urban streams to decide the level of specified bacteria inside them, which have equivalent origins to the waterborne pathogens, despite the fact that they are not detrimental. The sources are waste from humans or animals. The nontoxic bacteria as a result execute the function of indicators to alert the monitors of the likely occurrence of other bacteria that are unsafe. The water coming out of wastewater treatment plants which has been treated is also screened for these bacteria. Furthermore, in some larger cities further testing of drinking water has started.\n\nHeavy Metals:\n\nThe deposits of different toxic metals have a tendency to accrue inside of the food chain and they can harm living organisms. Previously, the majority of toxic metal pollution originated from mining activities and person sources, for instance wastewater-treatment method plants and smoke-stack emissions. Even so, Federal and State regulations have resulted in the lowering of the level of toxic metal issuing from these sources. Even so metals have a predisposition to affix themselves to sediment and dirt, and as a result they are nonetheless ever-present inside of the banks and of beds numerous urban streams.\n\nPesticides\n\nPesticides are substances, either chemical or biological in nature, projected to handle pests, such as algae, insects, bacteria and weeds. Pesticides are utilized a excellent deal on arable land, but inside urban areas, it is primarily used on residential and commercial properties. However when storms hit, the rains runoff from each yards and roadsides and carry harmful pesticides into regional streams, where they may possibly injure aquatic life and enter drinking-water supply intakes.\n\nThe results present that pesticides are prevalent inside of streams and ground water sampled inside agricultural and urban places of the Nation. As anticipated, the substances that have been heavily utilized are the substances that are discovered most often. They occur in geographic and standard patterns that mostly match the allocation of land use and the associated use of pesticide. The rate of recurrence of pesticide contamination, however, is far greater than predicted. At the extremely least 1 pesticide was identified in practically each sample of water and fish composed from streams and in about one particular-half of all wells sampled. In addition the person substances were seldom found alone, the majority of the fish samples from streams and about half of all samples from wells with a measurable pesticide contained two and at times a lot more pesticides.\n\nIf you use water ionizers you will obtain the pure alkaline water that your physique really demands. The ionizer will counteract all the impurities that have been put in the water throughout the course of urbanization. The ionizer as a tool to counteract the impact of urbanization on our water has turn into far more and a lot more crucial as time has passed and the situation of our water has decreased.\n\nWater ionizers support us to counteract the effects of urbanization on us and specifically on our water. These appliances will help us to cleanse and purify the bodies that have been badly affected by the method of urbanization, largely due to the deterioration in the state of our water. The switch to ionized water from plain tap water is turning into more and more needed if we are to live healthful lives in this urban age.\n\nWater characteristic fountains modify your house and employment spaces into a encouraging website echoing with the sounds of mellifluously water. Globe renowned for their consoling and thrilling capabilities, these waterfalls incorporate a good ambiance into your location. These water fountains are supplied in a wide array of styles.\n\nWith several materials on hand you can find a fountain that will fit into your theme quite nicely. Silver and bronze mirrors and beautiful metals like stainless steel and copper are obtainable which match contemporary buildings and even tie in with the sources getting employed in modern building like stainless steel appliances and brushed chrome faucets and granite counters. Clear glass is turning out to be very in style in urban buildings as windows turn out to be bigger to permit a lot more organic luminosity to flood work and living places. The brand new line of dual-sided floor fountains with generously proportioned glass panels fit into this idea.\n\nWall water capabilities will produce an touch of flair and dignity to any area. The great issue about wall fountains is that they do not take up any floor area and are easy to install on most walls. Logos can be extra to the glass and stone materials panels that will enable them to serve as advertising or branding indicators which are a lot much more interest grabbing and profitable then traditional billboards are. The distinctiveness of the item sets a business apart from competitors and the point is remembered a great deal longer.\n\nWaterfalls are more and far more sold on-line and mailed to you immediately in order to conserve on cost tag to enable these luxurious furnishings to stay reasonably priced and to carry the widest feasible. No matter what type you choose I believe these a single of a type items will happen to be one particular of your favored interior decor pieces.\n\nWater fountains are systems in which water cascades from a altitude into an additional water physique at the base. They may possibly be environmental or simulated. There is something distinctive about a waterfall that seems to draw us. Possibly it is the scene of the water cascading over the surfaces or perhaps it is the raw power that the water symbolizes. Some believe that with so much natural force a waterfall will take on a rather awe inspiring characteristic. We may perhaps observe ourselves drawn to waterfalls due to the fact of the uplifting coolness that fills the sky all-about the waterfall and the magnificent thoughts that surface when contemplating them.\n\nAn additional constructive characteristic of water function fountains is their probably health positive aspects. There are several well being attributes known by being near a water source and it doubtless has to do with the organic power and liveliness that flows from moving water. Feng Shui philosophy recognizes that Chi energy arises from moving water and when flowing towards a habitat can be a huge good lift for all who reside there.\n\nThe health positive aspects of fountains consist of worry decrease but also incorporate things like getting rid of dust from the air while adding moisture to the air. Take time out each and every day to get pleasure from the relaxing water sounds and relax. Taking the time to genuinely unwind will produce will add to your whole awareness of well staying."

      "text": "Health Concerns\nContaminants in drinking water always are cause for concern. However,\nit is important to distinguish between the acute and chronic effects\nof harmful substances.\n\nAcute Effects\n\nAcute effects appear shortly after ingestion of contaminated water,\nusually within several weeks. They ususally appear soon after exposure\nto a toxic substance. For example, a farmer who accidentally spills a\npesticide may shortly thereafter suffer nausea, dizziness and\nvomiting.\n\nIn Idaho and the rest of the nation the most commonly detected\ndrinking water problem is bacterial contamination caused by improper\nwell construction and maintenance. Bacterial contamination is a common\ncause of acute toxicity, producing symptoms as mild as upset stomach\nand diseases as serious as dysentery, typhoid fever and hepatitis.\nHousehold cleaners and garden chemicals are other examples of\ncontaminants that can produce acute effects.\n\nChronic Effects\n\nChronic effects appear after longer incubation periods, possibly even\nafter a number of years. Chronic effects result from exposure to a\nsubstance over weeks or years. For example, a coal miner who breathes\ntraces of coal dust for many years may later develop serious\nrespiratory problems.\n\nOver time, some drinking water contaminants can damage the liver,\nkidneys, heart and other body organs. Health officials are almost\nalways concerned about chronic effects of drinking-water contaminants\nsuch as low-level nitrates, radon and volatile organic chemicals. Such\neffects may include cancer or damage to the central nervous system.\n\nDrinking Water Standards\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards for drinking water\nfall into two categories -- primary standards and secondary\nstandards.\n\nPrimary Standards\n\nPrimary standards are based on health considerations and are enforced\nby the EPA. They protect you from three classes of toxic pollutants:\npathogens, radioactive elements and toxic chemicals. Primary standards\nset a limit, called the maximum contamination level (MCL), on the\nhighest allowable concentration of a contaminant in drinking water\nsupplied by municipal water systems. The MCL is usually espressed in\nmilligrams per liter (mg/l), which is the same as parts per million\n(ppm).\n\nSecondary Standards\n\nSecondary standards cover contaminants that cause offensive taste,\nodor, color, corrosivity, foaming and staining. The concentration\nlimit is called the secondary maximum contaminant level (SMCL).\nSecondary standards are not enforced. They are guidelines for water\ntreatment plant operators and state governments attempting to provide\ncommunities with the best possible water quality.\n\nIdaho Standards\n\nThe state of Idaho has established water quality standards based on\nthe actual or intended use of water. These uses include domestic,\nagricultural and recreational uses and use for aquatic organisms.\n\nContaminants or potential contaminants covered by Idaho regulations\ninclude hazardous, deleterious and radioactive materials; floating,\nsuspended or submerged matter; excess nutrients; oxygen-demanding\nmaterials and sediment. Standards for Idaho water quality are\nestablished and enforced by the Division of Environmental Quality,\nIdaho Department of Health and Welfare. While existing standards help\nensure safe water, standards do not exist for many additional\ncontaminants.\n\nIdaho drinking water standards do not apply to individual\nwater systems, only to community water systems serving 10 or more\nresidences or 25 people.\n\nIdaho drinking water standards are established based on current\nknowledge to provide a reasonable assurance that water will not cause\nhealth problems. They cannot always guarantee zero risk.\n\nIdaho drinking water standards can be made less or more\nrestrictive in accordance with the Idaho Administrative Procedures Act\nto meet specific water conditions at a particular site.\n\nIdaho standards for\ndomestic water supplies.\n\nSubstance\n\nMaximum allowable\nconcentration\n\n(mg/l or ppm)\n\nArsenic\n\n0.050\n\nBarium\n\n1.000\n\nCadmium\n\n0.010\n\nChromium\n\n0.050\n\nCyanide\n\n0.200\n\nFlouride*\n\nDegrees\n\nup to 12.0 C (54 F)\n\n2.400\n\n12 C (55 F) -- 15 C (58 F)\n\n2.200\n\n15 C (59 F) -- 18 C (64 F)\n\n2.000\n\n18 C (65 F) -- 21 C (71 F)\n\n1.800\n\n22 C (72 F) -- 26 C (79 F)\n\n1.600\n\n26 C (80 F) -- 32 C (90 F)\n\n1.400\n\nLead\n\n0.050\n\nMercury\n\n0.002\n\nNitrate (as N)\n\n10.000\n\nSelenium\n\n0.010\n\nSilver\n\n0.050\n\nEndrin\n\n0.0002\n\nLindane\n\n0.004\n\nMethoxychlor\n\n0.100\n\nSodium\n\nNo maximum established; 20\nsuggested as optimum\n\nToxaphene\n\n0.005\n\nTrihalomethanes\n\n0.100\n\n2, 4-D\n\n0.100\n\n2, 4, 5-TP Silvex\n\n0.010\n\nColiform bacteria\n\n2 per hundred\nmilliliter (ml) for any individual sample\n\nTurbidity\n\n5 nephelometric\nturbidity units (NTU) for any individual sample\n\n* As determined by the average annual maximum daily\nair temperature for the area where the water is to be used.\n\nThe Authors -- Roy Taylor is Extension agricultural\nengineer, Ernestine Porter is Extension textiles and clothing\nspecialist and Robert L.

      "text": "Water Purification System May Result from Space Research at NASA Lewis Research Center\n\nCleveland, OH -- A new material for removing toxic metals from water may benefit hundreds of industries that produce large\namounts of contaminated waste water.\n\nResearchers at NASA's Lewis Research Center have developed an ion exchange material that in laboratory tests can\neffectively remove contaminants from water such as mercury, lead, cadmium, silver, copper, zinc, nickel, yttrium and chromium.\n\n\"The tests also show that the new material is easy to use and inexpensive to produce. It is strong, flexible and chemically very\nstable in storage,\" according to Dr. Warren H. Philipp, Senior Research Chemist in the Materials Division. He and Ken Street, Head of the Chemical Sampling and Analysis Branch of the Office of Environmental Programs, invented the material.\n\nThe ion exchange membrane originally was developed as a separator in batteries for use in space flight. The separator can be made\nin many different forms and sizes including thin films, coatings, pellets and fibers for use in larger systems.\n\nThese various forms allow the material to be usable in many different applications, including woven fiber filters for home water filters, packed columns of pellets for industrial use and coatings on screens which can be drawn through ponds and lakes needing cleaning.\n\nDrs. Philipp and Street point out that another important feature of the ion exchange material is that adsorbed or collected metals\ncan be easily reclaimed by either a destructive or a non-destructive process.\n\nThrough the destructive process, the used ion exchange material is ashed and produces carbon dioxide and water vapor. Oxides\nof the adsorbed metals remain as ash and can be recycled.\n\nWith the non-destructive process, the heavy metals are removed from the ion exchange material and reclaimed by an acid\nstripping process. The material then is reusable, and the metal concentrate can be recycled.\n\nTo extend the effort beyond the laboratory, NASA Lewis Research Center has signed a space act agreement with Aetna Plating\nCompany, Cleveland, to validate the ion exchange material in an industrial setting.\n\nUnder terms of the agreement, Aetna will allow testing of the ion exchange material in their industrial electroplating operation to assess\nthe material's effectiveness as an agent for removing heavy metals.\n\nThe Lewis Technology Utilization Office is responsible for project management. Cooperating and assisting on the project are the\nCleveland Advanced Manufacturing Program's Advanced Manufacturing Center and Cleveland State University.\n\nThis ion exchange material is an example of technology transfer - technology developed for one purpose that can be applied to\nuses different from the original intent.\n\nThrough its Technology Utilization Program, NASA seeks to encourage greater use of the knowledge bank by providing a link\nbetween the NASA research community and those that might develop the product of that research into a commercial technology or product"

While there are many positives for the use of recycled water for industry and non-drinking applications, there are also many negatives for the use of recycled water for drinking water. Can you trust the local government to ensure this water is fit for human consumption? Accidents and mistakes do happen, think back to the fluoride overdose from SEQ water in 2009.\n\n1. Professor Patrick Troy, of Australian National University (ANU), says the recycled sewage could be used for things like cooling water in power stations, watering gardens, flushing toilets and in laundries rather than potentially \"subjecting the population to diseases and a variety of illnesses.\"\n\n2. Microbiologist Peter Collignon, from the Canberra Hospital, says a mistake or malfunction (at the treatment plant) for just one day in every three to five years could lead to a contamination which could potentially affect hundreds of thousands of people.\n\n1. Professor Troy, whose expertise is in planning, said the safety of recycled water had not been proved in any long-term epidemiological studies. \"It will not be possible to remove all biologically active waste molecules from the system,\" he said. \"The probability is that something like 8 per cent of these impurities will get through, and that is assuming the system is working properly.\"\n\n1. In the first project of its kind in Australia, recycled water will soon account for up to 25 per cent of southeast Queensland's drinking water.\n\n2. Despite the fact the Hinze Dam, which generally receives more rain than those in the other areas, is almost 95 per cent full, Gold Coast residents could receive drinking water that contains recycled sewage when the Hinze Dam levels fall again.\n\n3. Professor Troy said residents with allergies would be particularly at risk of infection. \"What's happening here is that the authorities are playing Russian roulette with the health of the population,\" he said."

      "text": "Some Bottled Water Isn't Better, States Fear\n\nAmericans' growing thirst for bottled water is leading a handful of states, most recently joined by Illinois, to push ahead of the federal government in regulating the purity of purchased H2O.\n\nA new Illinois law, which starting next year will require the annual inspection of bottled-water plants and water sample tests, was proposed after constituents of State Sen. Susan Garrett (D), including her children, expressed suspicion over the variety of bottled water on store shelves.\n\n\"We started asking: Could someone just put water in a bottle and put a fancy label on it and sell it in Illinois?'\" Garrett told Stateline.org. \"And the answer was, Yes.'\"\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration is responsible for monitoring bottled-water plants. But Garrett says that because the FDA is so understaffed, businesses are inspected only every five to seven years. In addition, the majority of bottled water is packaged and sold within a state, putting those products outside of the FDA's regulatory authority, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group that has studied bottled water regulation.\n\n\"Bottled water is technically covered at the federal level,\" said Satya Rhodes, policy associate for the State Environmental Resource Center, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group based in Madison, Wisconsin. \"But in practice, ... it's effectively unregulated at the federal level.\"\n\nBesides Illinois, California requires water samples from bottled-water plants every six months and licenses manufacturers. Michigan and New York also license bottled-water plants. In Kentucky, water-bottling facilities must meet the same requirements as public drinking water systems.\n\nMaine, Montana, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Vermont have regulations stricter than the FDA's, according to a 1997 report by NRDC, the environmental group.\n\nMore than half of Americans drink bottled water, more than a third drink it regularly, and almost half of consumers say they feel it is healthier than tap water, according to the NRDC report. The study provides the most recent look at state regulatory measures.\n\nGovernment and industry estimates say that 25 to 30 percent of bottled water in the United States comes from municipal tap water, according to the NRDC report.\n\nThe NRDC reports, however, that federal standards for bottled water actually are lower than those for city tap water, which is monitored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe International Bottled Water Association, which includes all the major brands except Dasani and Aquafina, also regulates the industry, said the association's manager of communications, Bridget Wells. Membership in the group requires plants to submit to an annual, unannounced inspection.\n\nCurrently, Illinois doesn't even know how many bottled-water manufacturers operate in Illinois. The Illinois Department of Public Health estimates the number at 40, said spokeswoman Tammy Leonard.\n\nThe new Bottled Water Safety Act, which was signed Aug. 5 by Gov. Rod Blagojevich and takes effect Jan. 1, 2005, requires bottlers to obtain $150 permits to operate in Illinois and will allow the state Department of Public Health to inspect water-bottling facilities annually. Bottled-water manufacturers in Illinois are required to test their products internally and make the results available to the state, Leonard said.\n\nThe new law will allow the state to know precisely how many manufacturers operate in the state. \"That gives us the ability to contact them in case of a recall or contamination,\" Leonard said.\n\nPlants that do not meet health or safety standards could face fines of up to $1,000, Leonard said. Out-of-state bottlers selling water in Illinois also will need a permit to distribute their water in the state.\n\n\"It clearly will prevent the ability for somebody to just put together a bottled water company by buying plastic bottles, putting tap water in [them] and putting on a decorative label,\" Garrett, the legislation's sponsor, said.\n\nThe most difficult part of passing the legislation was coordinating with Illinois' water bottlers, she said. During hearings, company officials wanted to ensure the fees were not exorbitant and the government wasn't breathing down their necks, Garrett said.\n\nGary McNeil, owner of D'Angelo Natural Spring Water in East Dundee, Ill., said the legislation would stop entrepreneurs who may have jumped into the industry just to make a quick buck. But he said he doesn't relish having to pay another fee on top of food licenses he has to renew annually for several municipalities"

      "text": "Hot Topics:\n\nMakeShift 02: Analysis, Commentary, and Winners\n\nIntroduction\n\nTragically, the MakeShift 02 challenge is all too plausible: you visit a rural\nvillage in East Asia that has a contaminated water supply. Serious illnesses are\ncropping up and spreading fast. The villagers have neither the knowledge nor the\nresources to do anything about it. Now the real-world challenge: the United Nations\nestimates that approximately 1.1 billion people in the world are forced to drink\nfrom unsafe water sources. As a result, millions of people die each year &mdash most of\nthem children. The most common culprits are physical contaminants (e.g., sediment\nand suspended matter), biological contaminants (e.g., bacteria, viruses, cysts,\nand parasites), and chemical contaminants (e.g., arsenic and benzene). The bad\nnews is that these contaminants exist in some combination in virtually every water\nsupply on the planet. The good news is that with a little ingenuity and education,\nmost contaminated water can be made potable through the creative use of local\nmaterials. That is what this MakeShift challenge is about: applying creativity to\nsolve an important global problem, and educating others as to how it can be done.\nThanks to all the MAKE readers who took on this very difficult and important\nchallenge.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThere are two basic approaches to this challenge: (1) solve the problem in a way\nthat has nothing to do with the obvious parameters of the problem, and (2) find a\nway to purify the contaminated water.\n\nFew readers opted for the non-obvious approach, which in this scenario would be to\nforget about purifying the contaminated water and seek alternative sources of potable\nwater. J. Crossen was one of the few, and eloquently describes one such source:\n\nA great water purifier would have self-manufacturing, solar-powered nanotechnology\nand also be cheap. A coconut palm! The trees already use a combination of capillary\naction and semi-permeable membranes to purify the local water, and they even package\nit in biodegradable bottles. The water inside a healthy young coconut (aged 6 to 9 months)\nis perfectly sterile and contains a mix of electrolytes and nutrients similar to that\nof a sports drink. As well as keeping the villagers hydrated, it will keep their muscles\nworking in top form. Each coconut contains about 750ml of water, and each villager will\nrequire at least two liters of water per day, so each villager will need about 2.5 coconuts\nper day. This means the entire village will need about 75 coconuts per day, which is a\ngood yearly yield for a single coconut palm. With a small factor of safety for bad coconuts\nand dead trees, the village will need an orchard of about 400 palms to supply them with\ndrinking water all year.\n\nC. Granier-Phelps also embraced the \"nutty\" approach and offered a detailed process for\nefficiently harvesting the coconuts. I should note that Granier-Phelps is a subscriber\nfrom Caracas, Venezuela, who claims to \"often throw coconuts at passersby,\" so I think\nwe should consider him an expert on this subject. Here is his procedure:\n\nFlip coins to determine who gets to climb the coconut trees each day. Climb coconut tree.\nThrowing things (sticks, rocks, or the car battery) at the coconuts won't work... believe me.\nUse a belt or cut one of the bicycle's inner tubes and wrap yourself around the coconut tree's\ntrunk. Move the belt up with both hands and slowly climb the tree with the arches of your feet.\nEventually you'll be able to do it without a belt, but safety first.\n\nUse a saw or a machete to cut the coconuts from the tree. Let them drop on the soft sand, but\navoid hitting the village elders.\n\nClimb down from tree. Avoid the urge to jump.\n\nUsing a machete or an edge of the car battery, open each coconut, trying not to spill the\ncoconut water. First remove the outer thick skin and save it in one of the barrels for the\nnight's campfire; that way, you'll keep dengue-carrying mosquitoes away. Make a small hole\nin the hard coconut shell that's left after removing the skin.\n\nDrink the coconut water or save it in one of the water bottles for later. Coconut water\ndoesn't hold for very long, so don't cut any more coconuts than you need.\n\nOpen the hard coconut shell and eat the white skin.\n\nMake a nice cup or bowl with the hard shell.\n\nWhen you get sick of all that coconut water (although, literally speaking, you'll be a\nlot healthier), take some time off to think of ways to purify the toxic waste mentioned in\nthe article.\n\nAny excess coconuts that fall from the trees should be dumped into the river in a designated\narea (demarcated using bamboo tubes and cable made from the steel wool). Ideally they'll absorb\nthe toxic water, filter the bad stuff using the skin's fiber, and store clean water inside. Use\nthem if you ever run out of coconut trees.\n\nAssuming the villagers can be persuaded to center their existence around coconuts, this a perfectly\nviable solution for the short term. Long term, a village of 20-30 people will need about one gallon\nper person per day to live comfortably, for a total 20-30 gallons per day. And they will need near-\npotable water for sanitation, etc. So the coconut solution allows us to avert the crisis, but it will\nnot give us the output required to be a total solution. What are the alternatives? A summary of\npossible approaches was provided by J. Earnest:\n\nAs we are attempting to engineer a way to purify contaminated water, a good starting point is to\nperform some basic research as to how modern systems are used in city water treatment facilities.\nMost water treatment facilities make use of four main stages of treatment. Filtration is the\nscreening of large particles from the water. Flocculation involves the addition of chemicals which\ntrap contaminants in the form of floc. Rapid sand filters then remove the floc particles. Finally,\nin the disinfection phase, chlorine gas, ultraviolet light, or ozone is used to kill any\nmicroorganisms that have survived the process thus far. Other methods such as reverse osmosis,\nboiling/distilling, carbon filtering, and ion exchange systems are used by some facilities.\n\nThis is a nice list and provides a good starting point. To help organize the alternatives, I offer\nthe following mnemonic: FADD, for Filtration, Adsorption, Disinfection, and Distillation. Smart use\nof these four methods will render most contaminated water safe to drink. Here is a quick review of\neach before we look at some of the proposals.\n\nFiltration works by blocking or trapping contaminants. Filters are particularly effective for\nremoving physical contaminants. Examples of filters include sand, cloth, and charcoal. Adsorption\nworks by attaching contaminants to a \"sticky\" molecular surface. It is generally used for removing\nchemical contaminants, but works for other types of contaminants as well. Examples of good adsorbents\n(chemically \"sticky\" surfaces) include activated charcoal and iron oxide (rust). Disinfection works\nby killing biological contaminants. You can disinfect water by adding chemicals such as iodine or\nchlorine or by boiling it. Distillation works by separating the water from contaminants by vaporizing\nit and then condensing it. The process removes all physical and biological contaminants and chemical\ncontaminants with a boiling point above that of water. Each of these methods has their strengths and\nweaknesses. The key will be to consider the various approaches in light of the short time frame and\nlimited resources available. Let's first look at what is often referred to as a sand or layered\nfilter. F. Valica describes one such design:\n\nGet a few villagers to clean the coconuts, saving the meat and water for food. Keep the shells and\nscrape the hair from the coconut shells.\n\nStart a fire and burn the coconut shells until you get ash/carbon. This may take longer than I've\nallotted for here, but you can build everything except the filter in the meantime.\n\nClean the inside of a three-foot-long, two-inch-diameter tube. Cut two two-inch rings from the\nbike tire. Strip the cloth seat from the bicycle. If it has a hard or impermeable seat cover, then\nfind a piece of cloth. Put this cloth on over the end of the bamboo tube and stretch the bicycle\ntube rubber band around it. Use a larger-diameter bamboo tube for faster flow if the bicycle tube\nstretches larger.\n\nFill half of the tube with pea-sized (or smaller) pieces of coconut carbon. Coconut carbon has\nmore micro-pores than traditional wood, coal, or lignite-based carbon.\n\nClean the change using steel wool and put it in the filter. If you have all pennies, use the\nsteel wool or a file/rock to rub off some copper and expose the zinc. Although we are not dealing\nwith pure alloys, the dissimilar metals should create a redux process and reduce levels of chlorine,\nattract iron and hydrogen ions, and remove heavy metals. According to the FDA, zinc and copper are\ngood for you anyway, although you may only get a trace amount through this process.\n6. Now pack the remaining of the bamboo filter with coconut hair for mechanical filtration. I\nprobably wouldn't use steel wool here since it would rust. Cover the top of the filter with the\ncloth and use the second rubber ring as a rubber band, holding it in place. The filter should now\nbe finished:\n\nF. Valica's Layered Filter\n\nClean both barrels using steel wool. You don't know what's been living in there. Rinse with\ncoconut water. Cut a hole in the bottom of one to accept the bamboo filter. Make it a little smaller\nthan the filter so the bicycle tube acts as a gasket between the barrel and the bamboo.\n\nCut off the rear end of the bicycle, and set it on some rocks. Place the second barrel on top.\nArrange the barrels so the first barrel will pour into the second (through the filter).\n\nPour river water into the first barrel, and let it filter through to the second. Then boil the\nwater in the second barrel. Pour boiled water into holding containers and cool to drink.\n\nThis is the first stage in Valica's purification system and is a good example of how a layered\nfilter works, though he takes it up a notch with the electrochemical layer. This filter should be\neffective at removing most of the physical contaminants and some of the biological contaminants.\nHis second stage boils the water, which will effectively kill the biological contaminants. As\ndesigned, however, it will not do as well with the arsenic and benzene. To address these chemical\ncontaminants, we need to separate them from the water using adsorbents or distillation. A. Thornton\nused two adsorbent layers in his design:\n\nIf the problem is arsenic, then a fairly effective treatment method is to adsorb it with ferric oxide.\nI bet that bike frame is pretty rusty, and I'm sure it's steel, not aluminum. File rust off of it. And\nif it isn't rusty yet, file some steel from it, and boil that in a pan. Let the filings sit in the sun\na while, and generally do whatever you can do to oxidize them quickly. Ferric oxide is going to take\nmost of the arsenic out, but it won't taste very nice and will discolor the water. However, we can\nameliorate that and remove a great many residual nasties by doing a final filtration with activated\ncharcoal. Where are we going to get activated charcoal? Why, both bamboo and coconut shells are\nexcellent sources. Make a mound of coconut husks. Cover it with coconut leaves. Start a fire under\nit and let it burn; occasionally pour water on it to create steam, but not enough to put it out.\nAfter a while, the charcoal at the bottom of the mound will be activated charcoal, because it will\nhave burned in an oxygen-depleted environment. Crush it up and you're ready to put it in your filter.\n\nThornton's one-two punch of using layers of rust and activated charcoal would do a good job of\nremoving the chemical contaminants. Interestingly, mix a lot of rust and sand together and you get\nbetter adsorbency than activated charcoal--on the order of 25%! Simple and effective. Activated\ncharcoal by contrast, though almost magical in its ability to remove a wide range of contaminants,\nis not simple to make. As Thornton notes, source material is no problem: coconut shells. You can\nmake plain charcoal by simply setting a bunch of coconut shells (or bamboo, etc.) on fire. Activating\nthe charcoal is the hard part. To activate charcoal, you need to remove all of the tarry residues\nand non-carbon impurities that clog up its pores. There are two basic ways to do this: (1) soak the\ncharcoal in an acid solution and then cook at high temperatures for a few hours, and (2) immerse the\ncharcoal in superheated steam (around 1,800 °F) for 30 minutes. Method 1 may be possible in primitive\nconditions. Method 2 would be very difficult to do in two days in primitive conditions. Let's look at\nproposals for making activated charcoal using both methods. V. Forgione describes a process of\nactivating the charcoal using acid from the car battery:\n\nCAREFULLY open the vent caps on the battery. The locals should have a plastic container to collect\nthe acid from the battery. CAREFULLY pour the acid into the container. Now, you should have anywhere\nfrom 1.8 liters to over 4 liters of acid, depending on the size of the battery. Let's just say we only\nneed 1 liter of acid, since any more would cost you too much of your drinking water. Battery acid is\nabout 36% sulfuric acid and 64% water. We should use 2 liters of bottled water to get the acid down\nto 9%. When mixing acid with water, add the acid to the water, NOT WATER TO ACID. HOT ACID WILL\nSPATTER! Pour 2 liters of water into another plastic container that the locals have provided, and\nSLOWLY add acid to the water, stirring all the while. You have 3 liters of acid and that should\ntreat enough charcoal for our use. Soak the charcoal in the acid, and then reheat in the charcoal\npile. With luck, this will activate enough of the charcoal to get the arsenic and benzene out of\nthe filtered water.\n\nIf you get the acid solution right and cook it long enough, you have a good shot at activating a lot\nof the charcoal. Method 2 involves heating steam to 1,800 °F--no small feat in a primitive environment.\nAmong the best proposals for doing this was M. Kissler's:\n\nThe final ingredient in the second stage of the water purification will be activated carbon. You must\nconstruct an apparatus to make the carbon and instruct the villagers on its use.\n\nTake the first large barrel and make five two-inch holes in the bottom using the drill. Make one\ntwo-inch hole in the side of the barrel near the top, large enough to snugly fit a bamboo tube of\nmedium diameter. Take the top off the barrel and save it. This barrel will be used to make the\nactivated carbon.\n\nNail a heavy piece of bark, three to four inches square, by one corner above the hole. This will\nbe used to cover the hole when necessary. Bend the nail over inside the barrel so it doesn't come out.\n(If, for some reason, you brought a hammer but no nails, you could just tie the bark around the top of\nthe barrel and slide it down over the hole when necessary.)\n\nSet the barrel up on a few rocks so the bottom is level and high enough off the ground to allow air\nto enter the holes in the bottom.\n\nDrill an identical hole into the side of the second barrel to allow the bamboo tube to connect the\ntwo. Set this barrel over a small pit where a fire can be made and sustained. This barrel will be used\nfor two purposes: it will heat the filtered water and kill remaining bacteria, and the steam produced\nwill be piped into the first barrel to activate the carbon inside.\n\nFor now, take the bamboo tube out of the first barrel.\n6. Put kindling in the bottom of the barrel and light it. If, for some reason, you do not have access\nto fire, you could use the car battery to start a fire by *carefully* placing a strand of steel wool\nbetween the two terminals to create a spark.\n\nOnce you have a good fire going, add the coconut shells to the barrel. Do not pack them tightly:\nthere must be air space between them.\n\nOnce the fire is strong, heap up dirt around the base to restrict the air access. Leave about a\nfour-inch gap. Put the lid on the barrel, leaving the hole in the side open for smoke to exit.\n\nA dense white smoke will come out of the barrel for a time. Bang on the side of the barrel as\nnecessary to ensure the shells move and all burn evenly.\n\nWhen the smoke turns from white to a thin bluish tint, most of the water has been driven off and\nthe charcoal is now burning. Plug the gap in the bottom with soil and plug the hole in the side with\nthe bark covering, filling all gaps with soil to make an airtight seal. The remaining burn will take\nabout four hours.\n\nLet the sealed barrel sit for half a day. Then, stick the bamboo tube in the holes on the sides\nof the two barrels so they are connected. Put the bottled water into the second barrel, and tightly\nclose the lid. (In the future, the villagers will use their filtered water. You will need to place\nlarge rocks on the lids of both the barrels so the pressure from the steam doesn't push the tops off.\nIn addition, remove the dirt from around the bottom of the first barrel to allow for steam exhaust\nonce it has passed through the charcoal--this will help to ensure that the steam displaces the air\nin the charcoal barrel.\n\nLight a fire under the second barrel (the one with the water in it). This will heat the water\nand create steam and pressure. The steam and pressure help to activate the charcoal inside the other\nbarrel. Let this go for at least one hour.\n\nM. Kissler's \"Pressure Cooker\" for Activating Charcoal\n\nCould this be made to work in a couple of days? I am skeptical that any of the proposed systems to\nsuperheat charcoal could be made to work in two days. It turns out that in Kissler's case, however,\nit probably would not matter. The reason is that he cleverly incorporated another filtering material\nthat is every bit as effective as activated charcoal:\n\n...have another group of villagers collect a large quantity of the water hyacinth plants native to\nthe area. Water hyacinth is a weed found in almost every water system on every continent, and is\nespecially prevalent in East Asia. It has been found that its dried and powdered root is an excellent\nabsorbing agent for arsenic in water. According to a report published by the Royal Society of\nChemistry, filtering water using the weed reduces the arsenic content of water to below World Health\nOrganization standards. Have the villagers dry and crush the roots.\n\nConsidered a bioscourge to most ecosystems on the planet, the irrepressible water hyacinth is an\nexcellent filter. If it is not in your part of the world yet, it likely will be soon. In any event,\nit definitely has a presence in East Asia and would be very effective at removing chemical\ncontaminants. Finally, there are approaches that utilize distillation. The problem with distillation\npertains to the chemical contaminants. R. Karnesky describes the problem:\n\nWhile boiling water can be effective at killing bacteria, benzene is more volatile and arsenic less\nvolatile than water. Therefore, neither making a still nor boiling in place will be effective at\nremoving all contaminants. An activated charcoal filter will remove most contaminants in one shot.\nYou don't happen to have one of those, do you? Well, fortunately, you have plenty of coconuts, the\nshells of which are a popular way to obtain activated charcoal.\n\nWhen Karnesky says \"more volatile\" and \"less volatile,\" he is referring the boiling points of the\nchemicals relative to the boiling point of water. The boiling point of water is 212°F. Arsenic is\n\"less volatile\" than water because it has a higher boiling point (1137°F). Benzene is \"more volatile\"\nthan water because it has a lower boiling point (176°F). The implication of this is that boiling a\nwater-benzene-arsenic solution would first vaporize the benzene, then the water, and then the arsenic\n(assuming you could get it to that high of a temperature). So with all this out of the way, let's\nstart with B. Doom's solar still design:\n\nMy solution is based on the condensation of the non-potable water. If the water is evaporated and\ncondensed into a clean container, the sewage, industrial pollution, and parasites will be separated\nfrom the water. One of the barrels is left in the sun and filled most of the way with water. Solar\nheat raises the temperature of the water and increases the humidity of the air trapped inside the\nbarrel. The humid air escapes through vent ports cut in the top surface of the barrel, and travels\nup through bamboo shafts to the upside-down plastic bottles capping the shafts. The bottles are kept\nslightly cooler, and the water in the humid air condenses there, collecting in the bottom of the\nbottles. The level of the water must be kept at a height maximizing the surface area of the water/air\njunction to facilitate evaporation. To this end, a hole is drilled in one end at the given height and\nplugged with coconut shell sealed with coconut husk.\n\nB. Doom's Solar Still\n\nStills are unique in their ability to simultaneously remove all physical and biological contaminants,\nas well as all chemical contaminants that are less volatile than water. Stills are also fairly simple\nto build and start to work quickly, which are important factors when the conditions are primitive and\nthe timeline is short. Doom's still would remove everything except the benzene. Volatile chemicals not\nonly have lower boiling points than water, they have lower evaporation points. Accordingly, the\nbenzene would evaporate into the bottles first and then condense with the water, giving the villagers\nbenzene-water. Not good. The second problem is with output. Calculating evaporation rates is a messy\nbusiness, but a quick back-of-the-envelope swag leads me to think that this system would only produce\nabout 3-5 gallons per day. There are ways to deal with the benzene problem. The output problem is more\nchallenging for a system based on evaporation. It is a good design, and with a few tweaks, it would be\na winner. Thornton offered two such tweaks. He proposed a more traditional fire-heated still design\nthat addressed the benzene problem using an old chemical engineering (and moonshining) trick:\n\nSo now, you heat your barrel over the fire you've made, taking care to keep it far enough off the fire\nthat it doesn't actually burn the barrel. Your water will start boiling; steam will come up the column,\nrecondense on the steel wool, and drip back into the barrel. Eventually, however, steam will start\nmaking it out the top and you'll get a flow out of the tube. You probably want to throw away the first\nbit of liquid that comes out of there. If you've got benzene in there, for instance, it boils at about\n80 degrees Celsius. This is, at least in ethanol distillation, called throwing away the heads. Once\nyou get a good stream going, this is mostly potable water, and if the villagers drank it, it probably\nwouldn't kill them quickly. Most things biological will have been killed by the boiling, and most\nchemical contaminants will have sufficiently different boiling points so that by throwing away the\nheads and not running the still until it's completely dry, they will generally be left behind as well.\nIf you had to stop here, it'd be a decent stopgap solution.\n\n\"Throwing away the head\" can be a very effective method of getting rid of the benzene-rich portion of\nthe solution. Additionally, the specific density of benzene is lower than that of water. This means\nthat if you let the condensed water stand in an undisturbed environment, most of the remaining benzene\nwill rise to the top. Since evaporation is a surface phenomenon (unlike boiling, which occurs\nthroughout a liquid), the benzene will evaporate first.\n\nThus, one approach would be to use a still, throw away the head to get rid of most of the benzene,\nand let the remaining solution gas out in an open barrel for a day, or boil it to burn off any\nremaining benzene. Draw water from the bottom of the barrel (just to be safe) and it should be\npotable. Stills also require far less maintenance than a filter (e.g., no cleaning or replacing of\nmaterials) and will work in a reliable, measurable fashion. The two main problems with distillation:\n(1) it requires a lot of energy as compared to a filter to produce the output required, and (2) it is\nonly about 20% efficient, requiring five gallons of contaminated water to produce one gallon of\ndistilled water. Is there a way to tell how much, if any, benzene remains? Benzene is clear and\ncolorless, but it does have a distinctly sweet odor. Most people can smell benzene in water at two\nparts per million. Concentrations of benzene in water over five parts per billion are considered\nunsafe to drink. Suffice it to say that if you can smell benzene at this point, you shouldn't drink\nthe water, and you should start climbing coconut trees. Now that we are dizzy from the prospect of\nsniffing benzene, it is a good time to close.\n\nConclusion\n\nGiven a two-day time limit with people already getting sick, drawing water from coconuts is the best\nshort-term solution. It will provide pure drinking water with minimal cost and complexity. Long-term,\nhowever, a village needs water for sanitation, washing, cooking, and so on--more water than can\nreasonably be extracted from coconuts. So, short-term let them drink coconut water, but long-term we\nneed a better solution.\n\nSome form of rapid sand or biological filter using a combination of sand, gravel, and carbon is a\nlogical choice. Ideally, you want to activate the carbon. I am skeptical as to whether carbon can be\nreliably activated in a primitive environment. To the extent that it can, I am skeptical that it can\nbe activated in two days. This is where the water hyacinth proposal is particularly intriguing. The\nplant is an effective filter in both living and powdered form. So, in addition to being an element\nin a sediment filter, a basin filled with water hyacinths could be a simple and effective long-term\ncomponent of an overall water treatment strategy. It is also a good back-up strategy in case you fail\nto fully activate the carbon. A problem intrinsic to all of the filtration strategies is that there is\nno easy way to test to what extent the water is potable except for drinking it and seeing if you get\nsick. This is where distillation carries some distinct advantages. Distillation enables you to visibly\nand reliably remove all of the contaminants except for volatile chemicals (in this case, benzene).\nAnd, as described above, there are ways of dealing with the benzene.\n\nA conservative approach would be to have the villagers use the coconuts for drinking water and use the\ndistilled or filtered water to meet sanitation and other needs. Longer term, I prefer the distillation\nprocess described to filtration. It is a simple method that the villagers can apply and achieve\nconsistent results. If you go the filtration route, consider using iron oxide and water hyacinths, if\navailable. They are as effective as activated charcoal and require far less energy to incorporate.\nThat said, activate charcoal if you have the time and kung fu to do it! General factors to consider\nfor all solutions: time to develop, rate of output, effectiveness at removing all types of\ncontaminants, reliability, testability, resources, simplicity, long-term viability, process\ntransferability, and safety.\n\nWinners\n\nI would like to again thank everyone who submitted solutions to the MakeShift 02 challenge. The\nsubmissions were very creative and well thought-out, and as before, selecting two winners from the\nbatch was no easy task.\n\nWinners receive Make T-shirts to celebrate and show off their unique brand of genius and the ultimate\nMakeShift Master tool--the SWISSMEMORY USB Victorinox 512MB--equally useful for hiking and hacking.\nHonorable mentions get fame and recognition for their excellent contributions. In exchange, we at\nMAKE expect great things. Go forth and solve the world's problems!\n\nCongratulations to the MakeShift Masters and the Honorable Mentions (applause…accolades…bowing).\nAll did a great job of taking on this difficult problem and communicating their solutions in a fun\nand effective manner. I encourage all readers to study these winning entries and share this link with\nyour friends. The first step in solving this global problem is education, so please help get the word\nout. Until the next MakeShift challenge, happy making!\n\nAs mentioned, the problem with Doom's Solar Still was that Benzene would also evaporate with water, creating still undrinkable water.\n\nMy idea is this: Why not place that water in an open barrel or better yet, put a siphon on the lid leading to a small bottle, and hoist it above an open fire? One could use something as simple as a thermometer to adjust the fire and barrel and keep the temperature between 176 and 212 F, thus boiling away the benzene still contimating the water. Combining this method and the solar still mentioned, it seems as though it would be a quick and easy process."

      "text": "Thanks for the URL, Helen,\nJohn Todd et al have indeed done some interesting work with water\npurification (including removal of heavy metals) using algae and water\nplants. They've to some extent focused on treatment of seriously polluted\nwater, as opposed to normal, household black and grey water streams. To me,\nwhat this means is that 1) the systems are technical and\nmaterials-intensive as compared to what a pc'er might contemplate for a\nhome 'waste' system, and )2 the nutrients are disposed of instead of used\nmost efficiently with an eye toward productivity.\nThe very idea of 'waste', in fact, leads to 'treatment of wastes' instead\nof 'use of resources'. In practical terms, this means that the value of the\nwastes (ie, as fertilizers) is purposely dissipated and 'disposed of'\ninstead of being taken advantage of. This is how we treat rural waste\nstreams, with septic tanks and leach fields that dispose of the effluent\nwithout regard for its value. This is also true of constructed wetlands,\nwhere most of the nutrient value of a waste stream is absorbed and\ndissipated by bacteria in gravel beds, as opposed to being used for\nproduction. Better than a leach field (nitrates are better kept out of\ngroundwater), but not using the nutrients to best advantage.\nI think it makes better sense, on a practical home-based level, to consider\nsystems which treat dissolved nutrients as resources and use them\nproductively instead of dissipating them. These would include: hydroponic\nsystems which use septic tank effluent to fertilize plants growing in\ngravel beds (kind of high-tech); systems which use septic tank effluent as\nsprays or sub-surface irrigation to grow trees or mulches (mid-tech); and\ncomposting toilets (nice, low-tech -- yea!).\nTodd et al do use the nutrients in their systems for feeding fish and other\naquatic organisms of value, and a similar setup exists in hybrid aquaponics\nsystems where fish in intensive cultivation have their water cleaned by\nbeing run through growing beds of veggies/herbs in gravel growing media (at\nabout 3:1 growing beds:fish tank, measured as surface areas -- see\n for an overview of commercial systems).\nLots of possibilities, all probably best guided by remembering that septic\nwastes are agriculturally very valuable -- human waste treatment streams,\nin fact, pose one of the largest gaps between what we take and what we\nreturn from our ecosystems, and are a major waste of valuable phosphorous.\nJack"

Water pollution, water diseases, and other forms of contamination effecting oceans, lakes, rivers, dams, creeks, and including contaminated ground water, is a major problem despite water quality management.\n\nIt's estimated 14,000 people die each day due to drinking from a contaminated water supply. In countries across Asia and Africa an estimated 2 million die each year from water related disease, and that around 1 billion people worldwide do not have access to clean water or basic water purification systems.\n\nWhile we associate water contamination with third world countries, where the lack of water purifiers and access to clean water is without doubt a critically acute problem, the Western world also face growing challenges.\n\nEstimated effects of water pollution indicate 45% of the streams in the U.S.A., 47% of lake surface and 32% of coastal bays and estuaries suffer from water borne diseases and pollution, however, pollution in water is not always man-made. Causes of water pollution include climatic fluctuations leading to algae blooms, flooding, storms and earthquakes.\n\nContamination is assessed by the ability of the body of water to support marine or aquatic life, or as a drinking water system, particularly for human life. Contaminated groundwater or surface water may be caused by a range of contaminants such as pathogenic microbes including, viruses, parasitic protozoa, and bacteria, pesticides and herbicides, oil and petrol, salts and radioactive substances.\n\nContaminated water from industry, agriculture, storm water and untreated sewage significantly impacts on the purity of our water systems. While water quality can be critical for all sorts of activities such as farming, it is in the area of providing individual drinking water filters for human use that SureAqua products really excels.\n\nSurprising Water Contamination in Bottled Water\n\nImportant point to note when you are travelling – particularly with babies or young infants – bottled water is often just tap water, and is not sterile.\n\nBacteria in non-threatening numbers are naturally present in bottled water, however, within 30-days, and depending on the temperatures reached, these bacteria can grow substantially, prompting the World Health Organization to issue warnings directed to the elderly, pregnant women, and young children with a 'heads up' to all adults.\n\nCleanse Contaminated Drinking Water with SureAqua Filtration Devices\n\nAll SureAqua products are approved by a National Association of Testing Authorities laboratory to cleanse bacterial water contamination, and purify water of dangerous Cryptosporidium, and Giardia.\n\nThese chemical-free devices cleanse up to 500 liters (SureAquaStraw) or 1000 litres (SureAquaStraw+ and SureAquaBottle+) and are an ecologically friendly, compact and economical. SureAqua products are ideal for overseas trekking, airline or shipboard travel, hiking and camping – and is totally safe for all the family."

      "text": "3 Responses to \"If You've Drank Water Today—Consider Yourself Lucky\"\n\nIn my opinion I see water as a basic human right. I did a presentation of water and the global South. Through my research I found out about water.org, a nonprofit organization co-founded by Gary White and Matt Damon (yeah the actor). Their website has plenty of useful information about water and how it is essential for human life. One piece of information that really stuck with me is the amount of hours mothers and daughters work just to go out and fetch potable water. Collectively, women spend 200 million hours collecting water. That is time that can be spent learning, receiving an education, and getting a job. And according to some statistics, educated women usually have fewer children. And fewer children mean less of a strain on natural resources.\n\nWater privatization at a state or federal level makes sense because the water has a legitimate system to go through that makes sure it gets to the people it needs to get to. I like knowing I can turn on the faucet and my water will not come out murky or filled with visible waste. Growing up in San Francisco, I was privileged to some very enjoyable tap water. However, privatization on a private corporation level seems to be the greatest hoax in commodification. Corporations are allowed to fill plastic bottles with fairly unregulated substances they refer to as \"pure\" and mass produce them. If corporations are allowed to take millions of gallons of water and do what they want with them, then millions of people should be given the same priority and respect to access water as well.\n\nI believe that as every human being has the right to breathe fresh air, they also have the right to drink safe water. Unfortunately, we are living in a nation that despite having access to safe drinking water, we tend to pay extra and use bottled water instead. Moreover, we are so wasteful to the treated water we receive in the tap while millions of people in poor countries don't even know what the meaning of safe drinking water is. It is interesting that we are so used to having access to clean water and don't appreciate what we have. Poor nations' governments should consider ways to treat the water and have it available and accessible to its population. In my opinion they should not suffer just because they are poor."

      "text": "Water purification is a controversial issue: some mountain travellers will tell you they have never done anything to purify their water and in many years they've never had a problem. Others take a more cautious approach. Those who have suffered from the effects of giardia, for example, are likely to be numbered amongst the cautious! Personally, I'd rather be safe than sorry...\n\nThere are some basic precautions that you can take to minimise the risk of catching something nasty:\n\nTake water from a fast-flowing stream or river; only use a pool or lake when there is no alternative and then with great care.\n\nWalk upstream for a short way to check for dead animals or other contamination in the stream.\n\nIf water is muddy, if possible let it settle before taking some; if it has bits in it, filter it roughly using a bandana or T-shirt before further treatment.\n\nAvoid using water in farming or lowland areas where agricultural chemicals are likely to be washed into surface water.\n\nThere are 4 main approaches to water purification: boiling, filtering, chemical treatment and UV light treatment.\n\nBoiling water is usually regarded as a safe option, as long as any particulate matter has been removed and you boil it for long enough. General advice seems to be to bring the water to a rolling boil and keep it boiling for at least one minute. At higher altitudes, water boils at a lower temperature and a longer period such as 3 minutes is recommended (I guess at some point boiling ceases to be effective as the temperature reached is never high enough). Boiling affects the taste of water, it's a real pain in the neck, and uses lots of fuel. In my view it's best kept for emergencies!\n\nFiltering has been very popular amongst outdoor folk. There are various types, including activated carbon and ceramic. This is a handy summary, from Katadyn, one of the leading manufacturers of water filters for travellers. Gravity filters are easy to use, but take a long time. Pump filters are more common, but even then the flow rate is not that marvellous. My own experience is that pump-filtering can become a real chore, especially when you are tired at the end of the day. It can be very tempting to not bother filtering, which could all too easily lead to an attack of the nasties. If you do decide to go down this route, then before purchasing a filter check its flow rate and work out how long it will take you to filter what you will need. On-demand filters, such as this one from Aquagear, can be useful during the day, as you fill up the bottle when convenient and only filter the water when you drink.\n\nChemical treatment is physically easier than boiling or filtration, but you need to be careful to use the right type of treatment at the right time. In the UK, we are used to our tap water being treated with chlorine: it's effective, but sometimes leaves a rather unpleasant taste, depending on how much chlorine our water company has had to add. Iodine is effective, but also suffers from a nasty aftertaste, and there are questions over its safety over long periods (3 to 6 months plus, depending on which resources you consult). Neutralising tablets or drops can be used to remove the bad taste, but only once treatment has completed. A variation of chlorine-based treatment is produced by McNett and used to be called Aquamira but is now known as Aquaventure. It is available in drop and tablet form, uses chlorine dioxide and leaves no aftertaste. Treatment takes about 20 minutes.\n\nUV light treatment is technically interesting and a newcomer to the outdoors scene. Steripen is the brand that most are familiar with. Treatment is quick, takes just about no physical effort, and is reportedly very effective. On the negative side, you need to buy batteries (and make sure you don't run out) and there have been some reports of reliability issues."

BWL says it water is clean, but is encouraging customers to let the tap water run for at least 30 seconds and avoid cooking and drinking hot tap water.\n\nOfficials say the job will take 10 years at a cost of about $30 million. They say high on the priority list are schools, day care centers, and homes with small children.\n\nBWL says they have already replaced pipes in about a few thousand homes in the last 10 years, and says it speeding up the process now because they feel a sense of obligation.\n\nContact the Lansing Board of Water and Light for more information on public hearings it will be holding during the next three weeks.\n\nwilx.com's Extended Web Coverage\n\nGetting the Lead Out\n\nLead was banned from house paint in 1978.\n\nU.S. food canners quit using lead solder in 1991.\n\nThe 25-year phase-out of lead in gasoline reached its goal in 1995.\n\nLead Absorption\n\nAdults absorb about 11 percent of lead reaching the digestive tract\n\nChildren may absorb 30 to 75 percent of lead reaching the digestive tract.\n\nWhen lead is inhaled, up to 50 percent is absorbed, but less than one percent of lead is absorbed when it comes in contact with the skin.\n\nThe body stores lead mainly in bone, where it can accumulate for decades.\n\nCalcium deficiency especially increases lead absorption, as does iron deficiency, which can also increase lead damage to blood cells.\n\nA high-fat diet increases lead absorption, and so does an empty stomach.\n\nRisks of Lead\n\nLead disrupts the functioning of almost every brain neurotransmitter.\n\nWhile a child's chronic exposure to relatively low lead levels may result in learning or behavioral problems.\n\nHigher levels of exposure in children can be associated with anemia and changes in kidney function, as well as significant changes in the nervous system that may include seizures, coma and death.\n\nIn adults, lead poisoning can contribute to high blood pressure and damage to the reproductive organs.\n\nAmerica's No. 1 source of lead exposure in children is deteriorating lead paint in older housing.\n\nBecause young children frequently put their thumbs and fingers and objects they handle in their mouths, they are easily poisoned from chronic ingestion of lead paint chips and house dust or soil that may have lead particles in it.\n\nWorkplace Hazards:\n\nOccupations that may expose workers to lead include painting, smelters, firearms instruction, automotive repair, brass or copper foundries, and bridge, tunnel and elevated highway construction.\n\nBesides their own exposures, workers may bring lead dust home on clothes, hands or hair, exposing children in the household.\n\nDrinking Water:\n\nThe main culprits of water contamination are corroded lead plumbing, lead solder on copper plumbing, and brass faucets.\n\nLead is highest in water left in pipes for a long time--for example, when the faucet isn't used overnight.\n\nCeramics:\n\nSome ceramicware has lead in the glaze and may introduce small amounts of lead in the diet, which the body can tolerate, the major problem with ceramicware is the rare poorly made piece with very high levels of lead.\n\nAntique ceramicware may leach high levels of lead. Consumers can use a lead test kit from a hardware store on such pieces and on other hand-painted ceramicware they may already own."

In some areas the water has high concentrations of fluorides, and metals such as calcium, magnesium, cadmium and iron. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) has been observed in some of the areas. The general idea is that CKD is induced or connected with water quality although it has not been scientifically proven. The pH level of water also ranges from 6 to 8. Some people use aluminium pots for cooking and one hypothesis is the formation of aluminium fluoride complexes that are responsible for CKD.\n\nThe average family size in these areas is about four to five members and a typical community has about 20 households. Communities use dug wells or surface water bodies as the source for drinking water. UNDP Sri Lanka is looking at options to provide low cost water purification methods for the communities. I am writing to seek inputs from Community members on:\n\nWhat are the available water purification systems/technologies that can be provided to individual households or communities that are easy to build and operate?\n\nAre there low cost filters available that are easy to maintain and operate with less energy?\n\nYour inputs will help us in devising community level water purification methods."

Case study of the water table in Brazzaville, Congo\n\nSummary : Brazzaville has a population of about 1 million people, and more than two-thirds of these inhabitants live in the suburbs. These areas do not have a supply of clean drinking water, nor an organised sewage disposal system. The residents often use water holes, springs, and rainwater for their water supplies. This situation cannot continue without serious degradation of the public health situation. Diseases linked to fad water quality, such as amoebiasis, typhoid fever, severe diarrhoea are thus the main cause of death. The Brazzaville hydrology laboratory is fully aware of this situation. A study on degradation of the water table was implemented in 1995. Measurements were obtained from 1995 to 1999 with a break in 1997 due to the political situation. Overall, 6,815 chemical quantitative analyses and 612 bacteriological analyses were performed. The results indicated that 34% of the bacteriological analysis samples had traces of faeces contamination. The dissolved matter concentration was in line with standards set out by the World Health Organisation for drinking water."

Until now we would not give the idea much thought. But why not? We make \"sun tea\" where you put tea bags in a container of water and place the container outside in the sun to naturally brew the tea. So why not utilize the power of the sun to filter water?\n\nPuralytics, a privately funded technology company located in Beaverton, Oregon is pioneering a new photochemical technology for water purification. They are building solutions to improve filtration for the global water challenges by combining the latest technological innovations with advanced engineering. The invention of the Solar Bag uses an effective and simple process for water purification.\n\nThe Puralytic Solar Bag has a backpack with handles that makes it easy to transport water to and from an available water source. Once the bag is filled with any water through the inlet debris filter, the bag is placed in the direct sunlight. It can either lie flat or hung from a tree or post. Once purified, the Solar Bag can be dispensed by a valve into a canteen or pot as required. By harnessing the power of the sun to purify water, the Puralytics Solar Bag will deliver clean drinking water that meets the World Health Organization (WHO) standards in remote areas.\n\nThe Solar Bag incorporates a 5 photochemical process that works synergistically to break down or remove harmful contaminants from the water:\n\nIn remote areas, it is difficult to build a water well or some type of stationary water filtration system to provide clean drinking water to those who are not fortunate enough to have access to it. If there is not a way to accommodate these areas by constructing a water filtration system, then the Solar Bag is ideal for fulfilling a need with the latest technology. The process is environmentally sustainable and cost effective.\n\n31\n\n08 2011\n\n24\n\n08 2011\n\nTea connoisseurs know that next to superior grown tea, you cannot enjoy the true essence and bouquet of a fine cup of tea without good quality water. The water must be free of waterborne minerals and contaminants to brew a good cup of tea. Water must contain the presence of a sufficient amount of oxygen to enhance the natural flavor of your tea. If the water tastes good alone, your brewed tea will taste great!\n\nHard water, which is high in dissolved minerals, can affect the taste and appearance of tea by making it dark and cloudy. The taste can be chalky and minerals can cause limescale accumulation that could lead to costly repairs or equipment failure in teapots and infusers. Bottled water with high mineral content has the same negative impact, especially if it does not include substantial oxygen (aeration). Oxygen plays an important part in the brewing process because it helps to release the flavors of your tea. You should always use fresh water that was not previously boiled to brew your tea. Re-heating water that was previously boiled has lost much of its dissolved oxygen. According to the Tea Association of the United States:\n\nWater softening equipment will help to reduce or eliminate water hardness caused by excessive mineral content. An activated carbon filter is used to remove soluble organic chemicals, chlorine, taste and odor causing compounds.\n\nYour water supply is an integral part of your tea experience. In the United States it generally comes from municipal water, spring water, well water or bottled water. The predominant supply of water is municipal water. Although this source is controlled by EPA standards, regulations do not eliminate the entire presence of harmful minerals and contaminants. Usually chlorine is added to municipal water to kill bacteria, but when chlorine is present it has a distinctive and unfavorable taste.\n\nIn rural areas, spring and well water are major water sources, but both are subject to serious contamination because they are unregulated. Individual springs and wells must be tested to determine the source and level of contamination. The Hach Water Hardness, Iron & pH Test Kit is a cost effective and complete kit for testing and determining the hardness and quality of your water.\n\nOnly companies using a multi-step process of filtration, purification and oxygenation would be considered reliable for brewing good tasting tea. Purified water must be infused with oxygen to assure you are getting the best flavor of tea. The process of water purification filters out minerals and contaminants. When choosing your water you want to make sure that you get the best taste from your brewed tea. Water quality is just as important as the quality of the tea leaves to a tea lover. These tea aficionados are persnickety about their preference of pure water for producing a crisp flavor and clear brew of tea that is aesthetically pleasing.\n\n17\n\n08 2011\n\nCool, crisp, clean, clear water. In the hot summer days of August, there is nothing better. We run to the faucet or Brita Pitcher when temperatures reach over 100 degrees. Imagine a truly sizzling hot day, running for the tap, turning on the cold faucet and the water that comes out is not the regular water you are used to, but cleaned wastewater. As the name implies, cleaned wastewater is water that \"has been used in your toilet or sink or shower is purified through a variety of technological processes that make it clean enough to drink\" (Alix Spiegel, NPR Article) Would you feel the same relief from the heat? Or would your mind stop you from enjoying the cool glass of water?\n\nSome scholars say yes. Dr. Carol Nemeroff, of the University of Southern Maine speculates that many people are not able to get over the \"ick\" factor of drinking water that could have previously been found in their toilet. The scientific term, contagion, refers to the phenomenon of people thinking that once something has contact with another thing, those two things are always joined. In this case, water and your toilet. Significant research of over 2,000 people suggests that it is difficult for people to dispel this kind of thinking; regardless of if it is scientifically proven that the cleaned wastewater is safe for consumption.\n\nTherefore, getting Americans on board for the use of wastewater as drinking water may involve less science, and more psychology. The key it seems is to change the identity of the filtered water by connecting it closer to nature. As water reuse expert Dr. Haddad says, people feel more comfortable if the treated water sits in an underground aquifer for a significant period of time. However, this brings up additional problems, as exposing already treated water back to nature can have negative effects on the quality of the water.\n\nIt is clear that our water thinking has a significant impact on the way water is used and distributed in this country. Now that we have the science to turn wastewater into drinkable water, we need to find a way to change its identity so that people no longer have visions of drinking water formally found in the bottom of a bath tub or toilet bowl.\n\nOne of the most common forms of social networking that used to be all the rage in offices everywhere was meeting at the water cooler to catch up on the latest office gossip and rumors. Gathering near the company water dispenser that housed a huge upside down water bottle, while holding one of those little cone-shaped paper cups, was indeed a Kodak moment.\n\nThe days of purchasing bottled water is taking a backseat to the newest concept in filtered water. Bottleless water coolers are becoming a new topic among today's water cooler dialogues. One of the most popular residential and commercial bottle-free water coolers is the Pura Ultimate Ultraviolet Bottleless Water Cooler. This advanced system features UV sanitation to protect your water from bacteria and BioCote technology that offers antimicrobial protection against waterborne contaminants like mold, fungi and unpleasant odors. It is equipped with three water filters:\n\nAn Activated Carbon Filter to reduce odor and chlorine taste.\n\nA Sediment Filter to reduce sediments and turbidity\n\nA Reverse Osmosis Filter to reduce total dissolved solids in your water.\n\nThis water dispensing system is ideal for offices, gyms, schools, churches, doctor's offices and homes. The Pura Ultimate UV water cooler dispenser provides an endless supply of water with safety and security in mind. With three convenient water temperature settings this reverse osmosis water cooler has leak detection with an automatic shut-off to prevent water damage. The initial cost of this system is an investment that will pay off for years to come. It takes less money to own and maintain a Pura bottle-free water cooler than it is to frequently purchase bottled water.\n\nThis bottle-less water cooler is ideal for residential and commercial applications. Companies like Carolina Coolers conveniently installs bottle-free water dispensers for your home or office. The sleek modern design and steady supply of clean water is definitely a hot topic by your snazzy new water cooler!\n\n10\n\n08 2011\n\nWe wanted to do a follow-up on a previous post we did in June, Stockholm Junior Water Prize: A Different Class of Science Competition.

This year the U.S. Stockholm Junior Water Prize was hosted by the Illinois Water Environment Association, held in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nAlison Bick representing Millburn High School\n\nCongratulations to Alison Bick from Short Hills, N.J. for being the recipient of the U.S. 2011 Stockholm Junior Water Prize. Alison developed a low-cost portable and publicly accessible method for testing water potability. Alison attends Millburn High School and worked for over four years researching and developing several devices to accurately test water for inorganic materials and harmful bacteria.\n\nThe four U.S. finalists include Jenifer Brown from Hillsborough, North Carolina, Collin McAliley of Melbourne Beach, Florida, Leila Musavi from Orono, Maine, and Nishith Reddy from Naperville, Illinois. The 2012 U.S. Stockholm Junior Water Prize National Competition will be held in Boston, Massachusetts. The New England Water Environment Association will host three days of camaraderie, competition and celebration where like-minded students will exchange ideas and discuss their research projects.\n\n03\n\n08 2011\n\nIs there really such a thing as a fragrance providing water to those who need it? Until now, this is a subject that definitely leaves you scratching your head. Tous H20 is an aquatic fragrance developed by perfumer Sonia Constant that provides water to people who live in countries where water is a precious commodity.\n\nTous H2O is a new ecochic perfume for women inspired by the brand's H2O jewelry collection that is the union of beauty and sustainability. This fragrance features organic alcohol with notes of organic lemon, organic lavender, rose, jasmine, mandarin, cedar, white amber and Australian sandalwood from sustainable development. The glass bottle is made from 25% recycled glass while the packaging and handling is carried out by the Special Employment Center of the Arco Iris Foundation, using materials certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. The Forest Stewardship Council was created to change the dialogue about and the practice of sustainable forestry worldwide.\n\nSo just how does this fragrance provide water? Proceeds from the sale of each bottle of Tous H2O will be destined to fund Oxfam UK projects, an NGO which specializes in action programs to increase access to safe drinking water in situations of drought, emergencies and conflict in disadvantaged countries.\n\nWater is the theme behind this perfume, from the droplet-inspired bottle to the light, fresh scent, which has top notes of lemon and lavender that mingle into rose and mandarin. For every bottle sold, 15 liters of water will be provided to one person each day for ten days in one of those countries where the organization is working (15 liters = 15.85032315 quarts). According to international standards, 15 liters of water is what it takes for each one of us to bath, shower, cook and clean every day.\n\n13\n\n07 Know Your H2O project educ\n\n15\n\n06 2011\n\nDo you remember the popular projects that high school students entered into science fairs which included exhibits such as the evolution of trees and plants, the formation of rain clouds or the path of lava flowing from a volcanic eruption? Content was a vital part of your exhibit, but if you had a functional mobile presentation, that made a tremendous impression among your counterparts. Now-a-days, many science projects are focusing on environmental awareness and modern technology.\n\nThe world's most prestigious youth award for a water-related science project is the Stockholm Junior Water Prize. This prize taps into the unlimited potential of today's high school students as they seek to address current and future water challenges. Any high school student (grades 9-12) creating a water-related science project is eligible to participate in the U.S. Stockholm Junior Water Prize competition. Projects should focus on local, regional, national or global issues that require using scientifically accepted methodologies for experimentation, monitoring reporting and statistical analysis.\n\nThe foundation for the entries submitted into this competition includes the following criteria: creativity, relevance, methodology, subject knowledge, report and presentation, along with practical skills. This competition weights heavily on the quality of the scientific research paper more than the poster presentation. Between June 23-25, state winners for this water prize will compete in the upcoming national competition hosted by the Illinois Water Environment Association in Chicago.\n\nSchool age students are doing more to make a difference by finding doable solutions for improving the quality of how we use water in our society. Science and technology are two key areas for current and future job opportunities. With some of the amazing water quality science projects that state winners are entering into the national Stockholm Junior Water Competition, it is certain that we will look at water from a new and innovative perspective. We are eager to hear the announcement of who receives the national prize for this award later this month.\n\n08\n\n06"

They often are made of biodegradable material and will split or deteriorate in a short time.\n\n6) If you run out of your water supply, make sure you purify whatever water you can find. Boil water at a full boil for at least 15 minutes, plus an additional five minutes for every thousand feet you are above sea level. As an additional precaution, add iodine compounds for water purification, available at camping and sporting goods stores.\n\n7) If the need arises, remember you have additional sources of water in your home. Your water heater contains anywhere from 25 to 75 gallons of good, clean water, and each toilet tank (not bowl) contains several gallons. You can fill your bathtubs up and can count on another 15-20 gallons per tub"

How does industry achieve and maintain improved wastewater treatment at less cost?\n\nThat's a good question because, most of the time, people are coming in wanting to sell equipment, and what essentially overwhelms are the inefficient procedures...\n\n2. How does industry conserve water and be profitable?\n\nSometimes you can just reuse water: you can just simply take the water from one application, reuse it back for another, and that is going to increase your profitability. There are several ways you can conserve on water and be profitable...\n\n3. How has wastewater treatment progressed over the years and what are future trends?\n\nThere are two main processing units which can help achieve this. The first one is ultrafiltration, and you can actually use ultrafiltration equipment to reduce the physical solids. And then, once you get those physical solids out, you can actually purify the water with equipment like reverse osmosis...\n\n4. What has been the impact of EPA regulations on municipalities and industry?\n\nThis is really big, because the EPA is like the mother of all regulations -- a federal environmental agency, the federal regulatory arm, and they just establish regulations that go down to the states...\n\n5. What is the importance of safety/security in wastewater operations?\n\nSafety and security in the workplace is paramount. It has always been important. However, as we learn more about the connection between safety and security and the general health and the environment, we do place a greater emphasis on safety and security...\n\n6. How does industry finance new projects in this economy?\n\nThat is a really primary question, because industrial companies are basically being forced to find alternative financing through government and also through public grants to fund their projects...\n\n7. How do wastewater treatment plants deal with emerging contaminants?\n\nThis problem is evolving in increasing frequency. First, if you define emerging contaminants, you see that they are hazardous materials or mixtures that are threatening to the human health..."

If you guessed bottled water, give yourself a pat on the back.\n\nThink about it. It's normal water, right? According to CNN, popular brands Dasani and Aquafina are simply purified tap water.\n\nIn fact, it's quite possible that bottled water is actually less safe than the water that comes out of the drinking fountains, because tap water is subject to far greater government regulation. For example, the BBC reported in 2004 that Dasani was removed from the British market after it was found to contain bromate, a suspected carcinogen.\n\nMoreover, according to USA Today, the bottled water that does come from an actual spring or artesian well is no better than municipal water. There is not to my knowledge a company that markets water bottled from Lourdes.\n\nCurious as to why anyone would wish to squander their money in such a foolish manner, I asked food director Jennifer Adams why there is such demand for bottled water.\n\n\"It's convenient,\" she replied.\n\nAm I the only one who thinks this is an incredibly silly reason to buy at great cost something that you can get for free and of the same quality from a drinking fountain? Convenient. Is it really that difficult or time-consuming to drink out of a re-usable water bottle?\n\nMany students believe that the water that comes out of the drinking fountain tastes bad.\n\n\"It's kind of disgusting,\" sophomore Ryan Paw said.\n\nBut ABC News conducted blind taste tests that show people often couldn't tell the difference between tap and bottled water. And even if you seriously dislike the admittedly unique taste of our drinking fountain water, is bottled water really worth the price, which is currently higher than gasoline?\n\nConsider the environmental implications of bottled water. According to the Web site Refill Not Landfill, in 2006 Americans drank about 50 billion plastic bottles of water a year. Only 23 percent of them got recycled.\n\nThat left roughly 38 billion bottles to litter the sides of our roads and fill our landfills. 38 billion. It's a big number. And if each of those bottles is 0.5 liters, the space they take up is almost 20 times the volume of the Empire State Building, which is one million cubic meters. Picture it. It's an awful lot of waste for \"convenience.\"\n\nGranted, the school isn't doing all it could to encourage students to use the drinking fountain rather than buy water from the lunchline. The drinking fountain in the high school is in poor condition, because of student vandalism. It would be nice if someone would fix it.\n\nAdditionally, why doesn't the Student Council sell re-usable water bottles? It would bring in funds for Council activities, as well as encourage environmental responsibility in the student body.\n\nBut failing those, it's still our duty as citizens of this planet to preserve and protect it with responsible water usage. Invest in a re-usable water bottle, Nalgene or something else. It's really a very easy way to do your part to take care of this planet, the only one around that we can use.\n\nAll school newspaper content is copyrighted by individual schools and protected by copyright law.

Their report published in ACS's journal Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research indicates that minced banana peel performs much better than a plethora of other purification materials, when used in water.\n\nGustavo Castro and his colleagues have found that wastes from industrial, mining and even agricultural processes can severely affect the condition of waterways especially by deposition of heavy metals such as lead and copper. Such harmful components can have adverse effect on health and environment; but at the same time, the methods of removing them can prove to be costly, cumbersome as well as pernicious in the long run.\n\nHenceforth, many researchers have tried to find out the chemical free 'naturalistic' solution for this dilemma. As a matter of fact, plant wastes such as coconut fiber and peanut shells have been previously used to remove potential toxins from water. The researchers found that minced banana peel could in fact quickly and efficiently remove lead and copper from rivers at a much improved level than other materials. According to their test, a purification contraption composed of minced banana peel can be used up to eleven times without losing its metal-binding properties.

      "text": "Hot Topics:\n\nMakeShift 02: Analysis, Commentary, and Winners\n\nIntroduction\n\nTragically, the MakeShift 02 challenge is all too plausible: you visit a rural\nvillage in East Asia that has a contaminated water supply. Serious illnesses are\ncropping up and spreading fast. The villagers have neither the knowledge nor the\nresources to do anything about it. Now the real-world challenge: the United Nations\nestimates that approximately 1.1 billion people in the world are forced to drink\nfrom unsafe water sources. As a result, millions of people die each year &mdash most of\nthem children. The most common culprits are physical contaminants (e.g., sediment\nand suspended matter), biological contaminants (e.g., bacteria, viruses, cysts,\nand parasites), and chemical contaminants (e.g., arsenic and benzene). The bad\nnews is that these contaminants exist in some combination in virtually every water\nsupply on the planet. The good news is that with a little ingenuity and education,\nmost contaminated water can be made potable through the creative use of local\nmaterials. That is what this MakeShift challenge is about: applying creativity to\nsolve an important global problem, and educating others as to how it can be done.\nThanks to all the MAKE readers who took on this very difficult and important\nchallenge.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThere are two basic approaches to this challenge: (1) solve the problem in a way\nthat has nothing to do with the obvious parameters of the problem, and (2) find a\nway to purify the contaminated water.\n\nFew readers opted for the non-obvious approach, which in this scenario would be to\nforget about purifying the contaminated water and seek alternative sources of potable\nwater. J. Crossen was one of the few, and eloquently describes one such source:\n\nA great water purifier would have self-manufacturing, solar-powered nanotechnology\nand also be cheap. A coconut palm! The trees already use a combination of capillary\naction and semi-permeable membranes to purify the local water, and they even package\nit in biodegradable bottles. The water inside a healthy young coconut (aged 6 to 9 months)\nis perfectly sterile and contains a mix of electrolytes and nutrients similar to that\nof a sports drink. As well as keeping the villagers hydrated, it will keep their muscles\nworking in top form. Each coconut contains about 750ml of water, and each villager will\nrequire at least two liters of water per day, so each villager will need about 2.5 coconuts\nper day. This means the entire village will need about 75 coconuts per day, which is a\ngood yearly yield for a single coconut palm. With a small factor of safety for bad coconuts\nand dead trees, the village will need an orchard of about 400 palms to supply them with\ndrinking water all year.\n\nC. Granier-Phelps also embraced the \"nutty\" approach and offered a detailed process for\nefficiently harvesting the coconuts. I should note that Granier-Phelps is a subscriber\nfrom Caracas, Venezuela, who claims to \"often throw coconuts at passersby,\" so I think\nwe should consider him an expert on this subject. Here is his procedure:\n\nFlip coins to determine who gets to climb the coconut trees each day. Climb coconut tree.\nThrowing things (sticks, rocks, or the car battery) at the coconuts won't work... believe me.\nUse a belt or cut one of the bicycle's inner tubes and wrap yourself around the coconut tree's\ntrunk. Move the belt up with both hands and slowly climb the tree with the arches of your feet.\nEventually you'll be able to do it without a belt, but safety first.\n\nUse a saw or a machete to cut the coconuts from the tree. Let them drop on the soft sand, but\navoid hitting the village elders.\n\nClimb down from tree. Avoid the urge to jump.\n\nUsing a machete or an edge of the car battery, open each coconut, trying not to spill the\ncoconut water. First remove the outer thick skin and save it in one of the barrels for the\nnight's campfire; that way, you'll keep dengue-carrying mosquitoes away. Make a small hole\nin the hard coconut shell that's left after removing the skin.\n\nDrink the coconut water or save it in one of the water bottles for later. Coconut water\ndoesn't hold for very long, so don't cut any more coconuts than you need.\n\nOpen the hard coconut shell and eat the white skin.\n\nMake a nice cup or bowl with the hard shell.\n\nWhen you get sick of all that coconut water (although, literally speaking, you'll be a\nlot healthier), take some time off to think of ways to purify the toxic waste mentioned in\nthe article.\n\nAny excess coconuts that fall from the trees should be dumped into the river in a designated\narea (demarcated using bamboo tubes and cable made from the steel wool). Ideally they'll absorb\nthe toxic water, filter the bad stuff using the skin's fiber, and store clean water inside. Use\nthem if you ever run out of coconut trees.\n\nAssuming the villagers can be persuaded to center their existence around coconuts, this a perfectly\nviable solution for the short term. Long term, a village of 20-30 people will need about one gallon\nper person per day to live comfortably, for a total 20-30 gallons per day. And they will need near-\npotable water for sanitation, etc. So the coconut solution allows us to avert the crisis, but it will\nnot give us the output required to be a total solution. What are the alternatives? A summary of\npossible approaches was provided by J. Earnest:\n\nAs we are attempting to engineer a way to purify contaminated water, a good starting point is to\nperform some basic research as to how modern systems are used in city water treatment facilities.\nMost water treatment facilities make use of four main stages of treatment. Filtration is the\nscreening of large particles from the water. Flocculation involves the addition of chemicals which\ntrap contaminants in the form of floc. Rapid sand filters then remove the floc particles. Finally,\nin the disinfection phase, chlorine gas, ultraviolet light, or ozone is used to kill any\nmicroorganisms that have survived the process thus far. Other methods such as reverse osmosis,\nboiling/distilling, carbon filtering, and ion exchange systems are used by some facilities.\n\nThis is a nice list and provides a good starting point. To help organize the alternatives, I offer\nthe following mnemonic: FADD, for Filtration, Adsorption, Disinfection, and Distillation. Smart use\nof these four methods will render most contaminated water safe to drink. Here is a quick review of\neach before we look at some of the proposals.\n\nFiltration works by blocking or trapping contaminants. Filters are particularly effective for\nremoving physical contaminants. Examples of filters include sand, cloth, and charcoal. Adsorption\nworks by attaching contaminants to a \"sticky\" molecular surface. It is generally used for removing\nchemical contaminants, but works for other types of contaminants as well. Examples of good adsorbents\n(chemically \"sticky\" surfaces) include activated charcoal and iron oxide (rust). Disinfection works\nby killing biological contaminants. You can disinfect water by adding chemicals such as iodine or\nchlorine or by boiling it. Distillation works by separating the water from contaminants by vaporizing\nit and then condensing it. The process removes all physical and biological contaminants and chemical\ncontaminants with a boiling point above that of water. Each of these methods has their strengths and\nweaknesses. The key will be to consider the various approaches in light of the short time frame and\nlimited resources available. Let's first look at what is often referred to as a sand or layered\nfilter. F. Valica describes one such design:\n\nGet a few villagers to clean the coconuts, saving the meat and water for food. Keep the shells and\nscrape the hair from the coconut shells.\n\nStart a fire and burn the coconut shells until you get ash/carbon. This may take longer than I've\nallotted for here, but you can build everything except the filter in the meantime.\n\nClean the inside of a three-foot-long, two-inch-diameter tube. Cut two two-inch rings from the\nbike tire. Strip the cloth seat from the bicycle. If it has a hard or impermeable seat cover, then\nfind a piece of cloth. Put this cloth on over the end of the bamboo tube and stretch the bicycle\ntube rubber band around it. Use a larger-diameter bamboo tube for faster flow if the bicycle tube\nstretches larger.\n\nFill half of the tube with pea-sized (or smaller) pieces of coconut carbon. Coconut carbon has\nmore micro-pores than traditional wood, coal, or lignite-based carbon.\n\nClean the change using steel wool and put it in the filter. If you have all pennies, use the\nsteel wool or a file/rock to rub off some copper and expose the zinc. Although we are not dealing\nwith pure alloys, the dissimilar metals should create a redux process and reduce levels of chlorine,\nattract iron and hydrogen ions, and remove heavy metals. According to the FDA, zinc and copper are\ngood for you anyway, although you may only get a trace amount through this process.\n6. Now pack the remaining of the bamboo filter with coconut hair for mechanical filtration. I\nprobably wouldn't use steel wool here since it would rust. Cover the top of the filter with the\ncloth and use the second rubber ring as a rubber band, holding it in place. The filter should now\nbe finished:\n\nF. Valica's Layered Filter\n\nClean both barrels using steel wool. You don't know what's been living in there. Rinse with\ncoconut water. Cut a hole in the bottom of one to accept the bamboo filter. Make it a little smaller\nthan the filter so the bicycle tube acts as a gasket between the barrel and the bamboo.\n\nCut off the rear end of the bicycle, and set it on some rocks. Place the second barrel on top.\nArrange the barrels so the first barrel will pour into the second (through the filter).\n\nPour river water into the first barrel, and let it filter through to the second. Then boil the\nwater in the second barrel. Pour boiled water into holding containers and cool to drink.\n\nThis is the first stage in Valica's purification system and is a good example of how a layered\nfilter works, though he takes it up a notch with the electrochemical layer. This filter should be\neffective at removing most of the physical contaminants and some of the biological contaminants.\nHis second stage boils the water, which will effectively kill the biological contaminants. As\ndesigned, however, it will not do as well with the arsenic and benzene. To address these chemical\ncontaminants, we need to separate them from the water using adsorbents or distillation. A. Thornton\nused two adsorbent layers in his design:\n\nIf the problem is arsenic, then a fairly effective treatment method is to adsorb it with ferric oxide.\nI bet that bike frame is pretty rusty, and I'm sure it's steel, not aluminum. File rust off of it. And\nif it isn't rusty yet, file some steel from it, and boil that in a pan. Let the filings sit in the sun\na while, and generally do whatever you can do to oxidize them quickly. Ferric oxide is going to take\nmost of the arsenic out, but it won't taste very nice and will discolor the water. However, we can\nameliorate that and remove a great many residual nasties by doing a final filtration with activated\ncharcoal. Where are we going to get activated charcoal? Why, both bamboo and coconut shells are\nexcellent sources. Make a mound of coconut husks. Cover it with coconut leaves. Start a fire under\nit and let it burn; occasionally pour water on it to create steam, but not enough to put it out.\nAfter a while, the charcoal at the bottom of the mound will be activated charcoal, because it will\nhave burned in an oxygen-depleted environment. Crush it up and you're ready to put it in your filter.\n\nThornton's one-two punch of using layers of rust and activated charcoal would do a good job of\nremoving the chemical contaminants. Interestingly, mix a lot of rust and sand together and you get\nbetter adsorbency than activated charcoal--on the order of 25%! Simple and effective. Activated\ncharcoal by contrast, though almost magical in its ability to remove a wide range of contaminants,\nis not simple to make. As Thornton notes, source material is no problem: coconut shells. You can\nmake plain charcoal by simply setting a bunch of coconut shells (or bamboo, etc.) on fire. Activating\nthe charcoal is the hard part. To activate charcoal, you need to remove all of the tarry residues\nand non-carbon impurities that clog up its pores. There are two basic ways to do this: (1) soak the\ncharcoal in an acid solution and then cook at high temperatures for a few hours, and (2) immerse the\ncharcoal in superheated steam (around 1,800 °F) for 30 minutes. Method 1 may be possible in primitive\nconditions. Method 2 would be very difficult to do in two days in primitive conditions. Let's look at\nproposals for making activated charcoal using both methods. V. Forgione describes a process of\nactivating the charcoal using acid from the car battery:\n\nCAREFULLY open the vent caps on the battery. The locals should have a plastic container to collect\nthe acid from the battery. CAREFULLY pour the acid into the container. Now, you should have anywhere\nfrom 1.8 liters to over 4 liters of acid, depending on the size of the battery. Let's just say we only\nneed 1 liter of acid, since any more would cost you too much of your drinking water. Battery acid is\nabout 36% sulfuric acid and 64% water. We should use 2 liters of bottled water to get the acid down\nto 9%. When mixing acid with water, add the acid to the water, NOT WATER TO ACID. HOT ACID WILL\nSPATTER! Pour 2 liters of water into another plastic container that the locals have provided, and\nSLOWLY add acid to the water, stirring all the while. You have 3 liters of acid and that should\ntreat enough charcoal for our use. Soak the charcoal in the acid, and then reheat in the charcoal\npile. With luck, this will activate enough of the charcoal to get the arsenic and benzene out of\nthe filtered water.\n\nIf you get the acid solution right and cook it long enough, you have a good shot at activating a lot\nof the charcoal. Method 2 involves heating steam to 1,800 °F--no small feat in a primitive environment.\nAmong the best proposals for doing this was M. Kissler's:\n\nThe final ingredient in the second stage of the water purification will be activated carbon. You must\nconstruct an apparatus to make the carbon and instruct the villagers on its use.\n\nTake the first large barrel and make five two-inch holes in the bottom using the drill. Make one\ntwo-inch hole in the side of the barrel near the top, large enough to snugly fit a bamboo tube of\nmedium diameter. Take the top off the barrel and save it. This barrel will be used to make the\nactivated carbon.\n\nNail a heavy piece of bark, three to four inches square, by one corner above the hole. This will\nbe used to cover the hole when necessary. Bend the nail over inside the barrel so it doesn't come out.\n(If, for some reason, you brought a hammer but no nails, you could just tie the bark around the top of\nthe barrel and slide it down over the hole when necessary.)\n\nSet the barrel up on a few rocks so the bottom is level and high enough off the ground to allow air\nto enter the holes in the bottom.\n\nDrill an identical hole into the side of the second barrel to allow the bamboo tube to connect the\ntwo. Set this barrel over a small pit where a fire can be made and sustained. This barrel will be used\nfor two purposes: it will heat the filtered water and kill remaining bacteria, and the steam produced\nwill be piped into the first barrel to activate the carbon inside.\n\nFor now, take the bamboo tube out of the first barrel.\n6. Put kindling in the bottom of the barrel and light it. If, for some reason, you do not have access\nto fire, you could use the car battery to start a fire by *carefully* placing a strand of steel wool\nbetween the two terminals to create a spark.\n\nOnce you have a good fire going, add the coconut shells to the barrel. Do not pack them tightly:\nthere must be air space between them.\n\nOnce the fire is strong, heap up dirt around the base to restrict the air access. Leave about a\nfour-inch gap. Put the lid on the barrel, leaving the hole in the side open for smoke to exit.\n\nA dense white smoke will come out of the barrel for a time. Bang on the side of the barrel as\nnecessary to ensure the shells move and all burn evenly.\n\nWhen the smoke turns from white to a thin bluish tint, most of the water has been driven off and\nthe charcoal is now burning. Plug the gap in the bottom with soil and plug the hole in the side with\nthe bark covering, filling all gaps with soil to make an airtight seal. The remaining burn will take\nabout four hours.\n\nLet the sealed barrel sit for half a day. Then, stick the bamboo tube in the holes on the sides\nof the two barrels so they are connected. Put the bottled water into the second barrel, and tightly\nclose the lid. (In the future, the villagers will use their filtered water. You will need to place\nlarge rocks on the lids of both the barrels so the pressure from the steam doesn't push the tops off.\nIn addition, remove the dirt from around the bottom of the first barrel to allow for steam exhaust\nonce it has passed through the charcoal--this will help to ensure that the steam displaces the air\nin the charcoal barrel.\n\nLight a fire under the second barrel (the one with the water in it). This will heat the water\nand create steam and pressure. The steam and pressure help to activate the charcoal inside the other\nbarrel. Let this go for at least one hour.\n\nM. Kissler's \"Pressure Cooker\" for Activating Charcoal\n\nCould this be made to work in a couple of days? I am skeptical that any of the proposed systems to\nsuperheat charcoal could be made to work in two days. It turns out that in Kissler's case, however,\nit probably would not matter. The reason is that he cleverly incorporated another filtering material\nthat is every bit as effective as activated charcoal:\n\n...have another group of villagers collect a large quantity of the water hyacinth plants native to\nthe area. Water hyacinth is a weed found in almost every water system on every continent, and is\nespecially prevalent in East Asia. It has been found that its dried and powdered root is an excellent\nabsorbing agent for arsenic in water. According to a report published by the Royal Society of\nChemistry, filtering water using the weed reduces the arsenic content of water to below World Health\nOrganization standards. Have the villagers dry and crush the roots.\n\nConsidered a bioscourge to most ecosystems on the planet, the irrepressible water hyacinth is an\nexcellent filter. If it is not in your part of the world yet, it likely will be soon. In any event,\nit definitely has a presence in East Asia and would be very effective at removing chemical\ncontaminants. Finally, there are approaches that utilize distillation. The problem with distillation\npertains to the chemical contaminants. R. Karnesky describes the problem:\n\nWhile boiling water can be effective at killing bacteria, benzene is more volatile and arsenic less\nvolatile than water. Therefore, neither making a still nor boiling in place will be effective at\nremoving all contaminants. An activated charcoal filter will remove most contaminants in one shot.\nYou don't happen to have one of those, do you? Well, fortunately, you have plenty of coconuts, the\nshells of which are a popular way to obtain activated charcoal.\n\nWhen Karnesky says \"more volatile\" and \"less volatile,\" he is referring the boiling points of the\nchemicals relative to the boiling point of water. The boiling point of water is 212°F. Arsenic is\n\"less volatile\" than water because it has a higher boiling point (1137°F). Benzene is \"more volatile\"\nthan water because it has a lower boiling point (176°F). The implication of this is that boiling a\nwater-benzene-arsenic solution would first vaporize the benzene, then the water, and then the arsenic\n(assuming you could get it to that high of a temperature). So with all this out of the way, let's\nstart with B. Doom's solar still design:\n\nMy solution is based on the condensation of the non-potable water. If the water is evaporated and\ncondensed into a clean container, the sewage, industrial pollution, and parasites will be separated\nfrom the water. One of the barrels is left in the sun and filled most of the way with water. Solar\nheat raises the temperature of the water and increases the humidity of the air trapped inside the\nbarrel. The humid air escapes through vent ports cut in the top surface of the barrel, and travels\nup through bamboo shafts to the upside-down plastic bottles capping the shafts. The bottles are kept\nslightly cooler, and the water in the humid air condenses there, collecting in the bottom of the\nbottles. The level of the water must be kept at a height maximizing the surface area of the water/air\njunction to facilitate evaporation. To this end, a hole is drilled in one end at the given height and\nplugged with coconut shell sealed with coconut husk.\n\nB. Doom's Solar Still\n\nStills are unique in their ability to simultaneously remove all physical and biological contaminants,\nas well as all chemical contaminants that are less volatile than water. Stills are also fairly simple\nto build and start to work quickly, which are important factors when the conditions are primitive and\nthe timeline is short. Doom's still would remove everything except the benzene. Volatile chemicals not\nonly have lower boiling points than water, they have lower evaporation points. Accordingly, the\nbenzene would evaporate into the bottles first and then condense with the water, giving the villagers\nbenzene-water. Not good. The second problem is with output. Calculating evaporation rates is a messy\nbusiness, but a quick back-of-the-envelope swag leads me to think that this system would only produce\nabout 3-5 gallons per day. There are ways to deal with the benzene problem. The output problem is more\nchallenging for a system based on evaporation. It is a good design, and with a few tweaks, it would be\na winner. Thornton offered two such tweaks. He proposed a more traditional fire-heated still design\nthat addressed the benzene problem using an old chemical engineering (and moonshining) trick:\n\nSo now, you heat your barrel over the fire you've made, taking care to keep it far enough off the fire\nthat it doesn't actually burn the barrel. Your water will start boiling; steam will come up the column,\nrecondense on the steel wool, and drip back into the barrel. Eventually, however, steam will start\nmaking it out the top and you'll get a flow out of the tube. You probably want to throw away the first\nbit of liquid that comes out of there. If you've got benzene in there, for instance, it boils at about\n80 degrees Celsius. This is, at least in ethanol distillation, called throwing away the heads. Once\nyou get a good stream going, this is mostly potable water, and if the villagers drank it, it probably\nwouldn't kill them quickly. Most things biological will have been killed by the boiling, and most\nchemical contaminants will have sufficiently different boiling points so that by throwing away the\nheads and not running the still until it's completely dry, they will generally be left behind as well.\nIf you had to stop here, it'd be a decent stopgap solution.\n\n\"Throwing away the head\" can be a very effective method of getting rid of the benzene-rich portion of\nthe solution. Additionally, the specific density of benzene is lower than that of water. This means\nthat if you let the condensed water stand in an undisturbed environment, most of the remaining benzene\nwill rise to the top. Since evaporation is a surface phenomenon (unlike boiling, which occurs\nthroughout a liquid), the benzene will evaporate first.\n\nThus, one approach would be to use a still, throw away the head to get rid of most of the benzene,\nand let the remaining solution gas out in an open barrel for a day, or boil it to burn off any\nremaining benzene. Draw water from the bottom of the barrel (just to be safe) and it should be\npotable. Stills also require far less maintenance than a filter (e.g., no cleaning or replacing of\nmaterials) and will work in a reliable, measurable fashion. The two main problems with distillation:\n(1) it requires a lot of energy as compared to a filter to produce the output required, and (2) it is\nonly about 20% efficient, requiring five gallons of contaminated water to produce one gallon of\ndistilled water. Is there a way to tell how much, if any, benzene remains? Benzene is clear and\ncolorless, but it does have a distinctly sweet odor. Most people can smell benzene in water at two\nparts per million. Concentrations of benzene in water over five parts per billion are considered\nunsafe to drink. Suffice it to say that if you can smell benzene at this point, you shouldn't drink\nthe water, and you should start climbing coconut trees. Now that we are dizzy from the prospect of\nsniffing benzene, it is a good time to close.\n\nConclusion\n\nGiven a two-day time limit with people already getting sick, drawing water from coconuts is the best\nshort-term solution. It will provide pure drinking water with minimal cost and complexity. Long-term,\nhowever, a village needs water for sanitation, washing, cooking, and so on--more water than can\nreasonably be extracted from coconuts. So, short-term let them drink coconut water, but long-term we\nneed a better solution.\n\nSome form of rapid sand or biological filter using a combination of sand, gravel, and carbon is a\nlogical choice. Ideally, you want to activate the carbon. I am skeptical as to whether carbon can be\nreliably activated in a primitive environment. To the extent that it can, I am skeptical that it can\nbe activated in two days. This is where the water hyacinth proposal is particularly intriguing. The\nplant is an effective filter in both living and powdered form. So, in addition to being an element\nin a sediment filter, a basin filled with water hyacinths could be a simple and effective long-term\ncomponent of an overall water treatment strategy. It is also a good back-up strategy in case you fail\nto fully activate the carbon. A problem intrinsic to all of the filtration strategies is that there is\nno easy way to test to what extent the water is potable except for drinking it and seeing if you get\nsick. This is where distillation carries some distinct advantages. Distillation enables you to visibly\nand reliably remove all of the contaminants except for volatile chemicals (in this case, benzene).\nAnd, as described above, there are ways of dealing with the benzene.\n\nA conservative approach would be to have the villagers use the coconuts for drinking water and use the\ndistilled or filtered water to meet sanitation and other needs. Longer term, I prefer the distillation\nprocess described to filtration. It is a simple method that the villagers can apply and achieve\nconsistent results. If you go the filtration route, consider using iron oxide and water hyacinths, if\navailable. They are as effective as activated charcoal and require far less energy to incorporate.\nThat said, activate charcoal if you have the time and kung fu to do it! General factors to consider\nfor all solutions: time to develop, rate of output, effectiveness at removing all types of\ncontaminants, reliability, testability, resources, simplicity, long-term viability, process\ntransferability, and safety.\n\nWinners\n\nI would like to again thank everyone who submitted solutions to the MakeShift 02 challenge. The\nsubmissions were very creative and well thought-out, and as before, selecting two winners from the\nbatch was no easy task.\n\nWinners receive Make T-shirts to celebrate and show off their unique brand of genius and the ultimate\nMakeShift Master tool--the SWISSMEMORY USB Victorinox 512MB--equally useful for hiking and hacking.\nHonorable mentions get fame and recognition for their excellent contributions. In exchange, we at\nMAKE expect great things. Go forth and solve the world's problems!\n\nCongratulations to the MakeShift Masters and the Honorable Mentions (applause…accolades…bowing).\nAll did a great job of taking on this difficult problem and communicating their solutions in a fun\nand effective manner. I encourage all readers to study these winning entries and share this link with\nyour friends. The first step in solving this global problem is education, so please help get the word\nout. Until the next MakeShift challenge, happy making!\n\nAs mentioned, the problem with Doom's Solar Still was that Benzene would also evaporate with water, creating still undrinkable water.\n\nMy idea is this: Why not place that water in an open barrel or better yet, put a siphon on the lid leading to a small bottle, and hoist it above an open fire? One could use something as simple as a thermometer to adjust the fire and barrel and keep the temperature between 176 and 212 F, thus boiling away the benzene still contimating the water. Combining this method and the solar still mentioned, it seems as though it would be a quick and easy process."

What else is in our tap water?\n\nPeople often ask if we drink tap water at home. \"Not if we can help it\" is the honest answer, but I rarely say so. I wouldn't want anyone to feel their choice is wrong simply because it's not my choice. Anyway, we bathe in tap water and water the vegetable garden, too. Whatever your pleasure, we all ingest our regional tap water. We're currently looking into the possibility of drilling a well, though I've yet to determine the cost. Luckily, Environmental Working Group has created a great tool to inform (and justify) our water investments.\n\nShouted out in Toxic Shockers by Alexa Joy Sherman in the July-August issue of Natural Health Magazine, The Environmental Working Group's National Drinking Water Database is a font of information for water consumers. EWG reports there are \"Over 300 Pollutants in US Drinking Water,\" some of which are regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act, some aren't.\n\nPlug your zip code into the search engine and you'll get a full report on all the chemicals detected in your local tap water, including those which are \"not subject to health or safety regulations and can legally be present in any amount.\"\n\nThe database also features fascinating general information about the state of the US water supply, and surprising factoids like this one:\n\n\"Water utilities spend 19 times more on water treatment chemicals every year than the federal government invests in protecting lakes and rivers from pollution in the first place.\"\n\nSo How's The Water In Lower Merion, PA?\n\nThe Environmental Working Group Report on Aqua Pennsylvania Inc. (Aqua) - Valley Forge, PA Serves 820,000 people - Test data available: 2004-2009 This drinking water quality report shows results of tests conducted by the water utility and provided to the Environmental Working Group (EWG) by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. It is part of EWG's national database that includes 47,667 drinking water utilities and 20 million test results. Water utilities nationwide detected more than 300 pollutants between 2004 and 2009. More than half of these chemicals are unregulated, legal in any amount. Despite this widespread contamination, the federal government invests few resources to protecting rivers, reservoirs, and groundwater from pollution in the first place. The information below summarizes test results for this utility and lists potential health concerns.\n\nIn this drinking water system, 6 chemicals exceeded Health Guidelines (the national average is 4), and 2 chemicals exceeded Health Standards (the national average is 0.5). Overall, 14 chemical pollutants were found.\n\nDespite these findings, drinking water for the town of Bryn Mawr, PA, where AquaAmerica, AquaPA's parent company is headquartered, ranked 49th in the nation in EWG's Ratings of Big City Water. Philadelphia did not make the top 100."

Radon accumulates in groundwater due to radioactive decay of uranium and radium in aquifer materials and concentrations in groundwater are typically 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than surface water bodies, where radon is lost due to air-water exchange and radioactive decay.\n\nIn terrestrial hydraulic systems, radon is typically discretely sampled and analyzed using liquid scintillation methods. Instead a continuous, real-time, in situ radon gas detector can be used to analyze for radon-in-water concentrations. These methods have been recently developed by the oceanographic and hydrologic community [Burnett, et al., 2001; Burnett, et al., 2006; Kluge et al. 2007]. A commercial radon-in-air detector (RAD7) is outfitted with an air-water exchanger, called RAD-Aqua. Surface water is pumped continuously into the air-water exchanger and the concentration of 222Rn-in-air (which equilibrated with the surface water) is calculated by measurement of the daughters 214Po and 218Po. Radon-in-water concentrations are calculated from radon-in-air concentrations using the temperature dependence of the air-water phase equilibrium of radon [Burnett, et al., 2001]. Radon concentrations are measured over 10 minute intervals with an uncertainty of 0.02 Bq/L. Alternatively, radon-in-water concentrations can be measured using discrete samples in either the RAD-H20 or Rad-Aqua Plus."

      "text": "Can Fluoridated Drinking Water Harm the Body?\n\nBy Dr. John Reizer\n\nEditor at NoFakeNews.net\n\nTap water, from your local municipality, contains sodium fluoride or the chemical, hexafluorosilicic acid. The rationale for placing a fluoridating agent in public drinking water, according to most public health officials, is to lower the number of dental caries within the general population.\n\nFor many years, people have been arguing with local and state governments about whether fluoride, in drinking water, can harm the human body. In one corner, there are fluoride advocates pointing to the benefits of fluoridating water supplies. They claim people enjoy fewer cavities because local water companies add fluoride to their product at treatment facilities. In the other corner, outspoken individuals claim fluoride is a toxic substance that causes irreparable harm to human beings.\n\nAt the center of this controversy is an important question that proponents of fluoride refuse to address. Why are people being medicated without first having a proper medical evaluation? There are plenty of angry citizens objecting to the outrageous policy of mass medicating the general population.\n\nAccording to the National Toxicology Program, Fluoride can cause genetic damage and cancer in humans. There is also strong evidence that Fluoride can have damaging effects to the brain. (Chioca LR, et al. (2007). European Journal of Pharmacology Oct 25; [Epub]\n\nBut you don't have to be a medical researcher to know that fluoride is a serious poison. Just pick up a tube of common tooth paste and read the warning message printed on the back of the tube. It reads something like this: \"WARNING: Keep out of reach of children under 6 years of age. If you accidental­ly swallow more than used for brushing, seek profession­al help or contact a poison control center immediatel­y.\" Perhaps the majority of people, in the United States, have been exposed to fluoride for so long that they have permanent brain damage and are incapable of fighting local, state, and federal government on this most important health issue.\n\nPlease take the time to learn more about this poison and how it is directly affecting you and your loved ones every time you drink a glass of water, take a shower, and eat foods that have been cooked or washed in water.\n\n26 Responses to \"Can Fluoridated Drinking Water Harm the Body?\"\n\nParacelcus said it well way back in the 16th century: \"All substances are poison. There are none that are not. The difference between a remedy and a toxin is dosage\". Fluoride at 0.7 PPM is NOT toxic.\nRegarding \"mass medication\": No court of last resort has ever ruled fluoridation \"mass medication\" nor described it a drug. A 2011 case in Port Angeles, WA demonstrates this\"\nA lawsuit seeking to stop the use of fluoride in the drinking water in Port Angeles and Forks has been dismissed.\n\nJefferson County Superior Court Judge Craddock Verser dismissed the case Friday on the grounds that fluoride cannot be considered a prescription drug when used in a public water supply.\n\n\"Because the FDA does not regulate public drinking water or drinking water additives, it is impossible for plaintiffs to prove that the first requirement for being a [prescription drug] under Washington law is met,\" he said.\n\nToday, 74% of Americans on public water systems enjoy the public health benefit of fluoridation. That is 204 million citizens of this great country.\n\nThank you for commenting on NoFakeNews.net. I appreciate your perspective on the article I wrote concerning Fluoride.\n\nThere are many people that have debated this controversial issue. As I wrote in the article, both camps have very strong opinions about why water fluoridation is a good or bad thing. I have, personally, read a lot of research on the topic and have had the unique advantage of studying many courses in the biological sciences. Unfortunately, most individuals have probably not taken the time to review the lengthy studies that have been published on this subject matter.\n\nIf a person was to take an honest look at the large body of research that has been performed by independent scientists, not tied to government agencies, he or she would immediately see that Fluoride is a dangerous poison that can and does adversely affect the overall integrity of a person's expression of health.\n\nContrary to what the great Paracelsus stated in the 16th century, not every substance is a poison. When a human being consumes something, the body reacts to the contents being consumed in one of two ways. It either identifies the consumed product as something that is friendly to the biological system or it identifies the product as something that is a poison. When a person swallows small or large quantities of fluoride, his or her body always identifies the product as a poison!\n\nFluoride is a poison no matter how you slice it. It also accumulates within the tissues of the nervous system over time. Because it does, the idea that small dosages are acceptable in the body is absurd! This crap is extremely toxic, and you really shouldn't kid yourself into thinking otherwise. The ADA (American Dental Association) has been promoting this line of misinformation for the longest time.\n\nI believe there are zero benefits to be gained by human beings from water fluoridation programs. And yes, it is mass medication of society regardless of a judge's opinion. The reason the public health agencies are placing fluoride into the water is supposedly to prevent dental caries. The public health police continue to make the ridiculous claim that the product (drug) is a preventive pharmaceutical agent against tooth decay. There has never been any proof whatsoever that this is the case. When you place a chemical in the public water supply for the sole reason of preventing tooth decay, the product should definitely be considered a drug.\n\nIn this case, the judge ruled incorrectly and the decision should be appealed and overruled by a higher court. His opinion was obviously based on biased information originating from research journals that have been heavily influenced by powerful health care unions. These are the same health care unions that are funded by petrochemical companies. They have a vested interest in keeping people's immune systems weak. They sell more drugs this way. To mass medicate a group of citizens without giving them proper health evaluations, by licensed physicians, is medical negligence at the highest level.\n\nYour belief that 74% of society is gaining some type of health benefit from being forced to consume poisoned water is disturbing to say the least. In my opinion, this is one of many reasons that so many people are suffering from autoimmune disorders and related cancers in this great country!\n\nIn recent years, numerous municipalities within Europe and the United States have made very good decisions to stop adding fluoride to public water supplies due to new research that continues to demonstrate the physiological dangers that are inherently present for all human beings that consume this poison.\n\nJohn,\nFluoridation is a 20th century adaptation of a naturally occurring process. There are many water systems in the U.S. that have naturally occuring fluoride concentrations. And the citizens lucky enough to live in these communities had better teeth. That's how Dr. Frederick McKay discovered that fluoride in the water was the reason. By the way, is this water \"medicated\"?\nI am a dentist and was trained in a fluoridated city, and I was somewhat ambivilent about fluoridation, because, guess what, poor people without access to care and lack of education, had greater amounts of cavities. It wasn't until I moved to a non-fluoridated community that I realized that the sugar-acid challenge threshold or that level when enamel starts breaking down was much lower in a non-fluoridated community.\nWhile I have raised two daughters to be virtually cavity free in a non-fluoridated community, they enjoyed the benefit of education, prevention, and access to care. Oral hygiene was non-negociable and they took fluoride supplements from birth until they were 13 years old. They are 29 and 25 now, college educated, and happy and productive members of society.\nI could give you many references but here's one I share often: \n\nYour reply to me was filled with a conspiracy theory tone (public health police, health care unions funded by petrochemical companies). Quite frankly, John, what a crock!! You obviously don't trust the CDC either.\nI know that I will not change your opinion, but I am very sure that you are a relative \"lone wolf\" in your opinions on fluoridation as a poison at any concentration. And virtually every judge in the U.S. that had ruled on fluoridation share similar views that differ from your incorrect conclusions.\nHarvard, Brown, Yale, Columbia, Georgetown, Duke, U. of Chicago, Northwestern, USC, UCLA, UC Berkeley, and Stanford: all are located in long-standing fluoridated communities.\n\nI could tell right away that I was communicating with a dentist. First, I want to make it perfectly clear that I believe many of the procedures that dentists perform for patients are very important and a benefit to human health. Having written that, let me also write that the use of fluoride and amalgam fillings are definitely not two of the bright spots for your profession.\n\nSince the topic of our discussion centers on the poison commonly known as fluoride, I will limit my comments to this subject. It is absolutely amazing how many health care professionals are clueless when it comes to fluoride. The first thing that traditional dentists like to do is to begin quoting statements from the CDC and other public health agencies. These agencies cannot and should not be trusted because they are the source of tremendous misinformation. In case you haven't figured it out yet, this website is not dedicated to glorifying mainstream news sources that cannot be trusted. Such sources cannot be trusted because they have been bought off and are compromised. This is also true in the case of the CDC, FDA, WHO, NIH, and a number of other organizations that you probably have placed a great deal of faith in.\n\nYou call me a conspiracy theorist because I disagree with your premise that fluoride is good for human teeth. I couldn't care less that you disagree with me. The views that I have are shared by thousands of health care professionals throughout the world. Many of these individuals are dentists and have been practicing for many years. This is not a conspiracy theory, just a conspiracy!\n\nAnd you're a chiropractor and don't believe in immunizations. I'm glad you live thousands of miles from me an my family.\n\nThere is a Grand Canyon divide between our opinions. And thousands of dentists. Sorry, John, another \"crock\".\n\nYour references reveal the truth about your opinions:\n\nFluoridealert??? \"Let's go to the most polluted countries in the world and find studies that have nothing to do with fluoridation, but scare people anyway, Mercola, the snake-oil salesman ??, Osmunson??, Please………….., and the IAOMT?? David Kennedy and Jeff Green. This list of references reminds me of a comment Benjamin Disraeli made to his fellow colleagues in Parliment: \"There are 3 kinds of lies: lies, damn lies, and statistics\".\n\nTooth Truth, you're so brainwashed that you're unable to be objective! You will defend your core beliefs about this subject and continue to parrot the same lies over and over again. What does it matter that I am a chiropractor? Do you think the fact that I am a chiropractor changes the toxicity of fluoride? You are funny and predictable. You want to play the chiropractor is a quack card.\n\nDo you think the poison label on the tube of tooth paste is there for the heck of it? Wake up man! You are supposed to be a health professional. Do some research and stop being so gullible.\n\nI have spent time in dental seminars and talked with many of your colleagues that disagree, very much, with your conventional dogma!\n\nYou may have consumed more fluoride than you think! You were probably over immunized, too! Let me guess, you fell for that bag of lies also?\n\nSeriously, you need to stop living in a state of denial. Trying to paint me and the thousands of other health care professionals as \"conspiracy nuts\" is getting old. How about trying to be objective for a change? Maybe you could take the high road and question some of the propaganda you were taught at dental school? Sometimes the truth hurts. Sometimes the truth causes financial problems. But in this case the truth can help save your patients and that's what I care about. Maybe you should, too!\n\nThose \"references\" you listed in your discussion with ToothTruth are not legitimate science. At the very least, real (and referenceable) medical science has sufficient quality to be included in the National Library of Medicine's database.\n\nMercola is really beyond the pale . .he has repeatedly been in trouble with the FDA for making unfounded claims for the various nostroms he sells.\n\nThe Texas legislature commissioned a study of the dental bills saved with fluoridation with similar findings and a recent New York Medicaid study also confirmed the remarkable effect.\n\nAn economic analysis from Colorado found that of all the options available to treat this condition, community water fluoridation was the most cost effective returning 150% in dental bill savings for the money invested in CWF.\n\nI respect your opinion about the validity of the sources I cited. I disagree that they are not legitimate sources. Any person that disagrees with conventional medical views are ridiculed, attacked, and ostracized from their profession by their peers and colleagues. This is unfortunate, but the truth.\n\nThere are powerful health care unions out there guarding concepts/practices such as fluoridation, immunization, and some others that are considered protected sciences. These ideas are not to be questioned or attacked by anyone at anytime. If they are attacked, the individuals are categorized as quacks.\n\nBilly, let me tell you the difference between good science and junk science. Good science is funded by petrochemical companies and junk science is not! Independent studies are performed all the time and get swept under the carpet, so to speak. They very rarely see the light of day. When they do see the light of day they are conveniently retracted and the doctor's credibility attacked.\n\nWe can debate this topic all day and you and the good dentist can cite government study after government study and it doesn't mean a thing. Those sources cannot be trusted! The agencies and sources you are citing all have ties to pharmaceutical companies.\n\nYou can refer to me as a conspiracy theorist or \"lone nutter\" but it really doesn't change the fact that millions of people are getting ill from these practices.\n\nEven if you take away the sources I cited and label them as unreliable, there are thousands of dentists in the United States calling for the removal of fluoride from tap water. They are also calling for a ban on mercury fillings. I'm not making this stuff up! When you have thousands of dentists calling for actions such as these, there has to be something of substance behind their claims.\n\nI've been a chiropractor for 26 years. If I discovered tomorrow that what I was doing was a detriment to my patients, I'd retire immediately. The practice of chiropractic, from a neuroscience perspective, is so damn logical it's amazing that it hasn't been embraced by every health care institution on the planet. I can tell you for certain that it scares the living daylights out of the medical profession. The reason it is attacked and made to look like a less than scientific practice is because it is a threat to the traditional health care paradigm. Because of this fact it is made to look like quackery. It is not! This is not a conspiracy theory…it's the truth. If the powers that be can do this to an entire profession, it's easy for them to create sources that will lie about fluoridation and immunization practices.\n\nOnce again, thanks for participating. Because I disagree with you doesn't mean I don't respect your opinion!\n\nI think the chiropractor makes more sense than you. It says the tooth paste is a poison. I have never realized this before. I just looked at two tooth pastes in my house and they both of them have poison warnings. What the hell?\n\nWhat you have discovered regarding the tubes of toothpaste is accurate. Any toothpaste product that contains a fluoridating agent is extremely toxic. By law, the manufacturers of these products have to place a warning label on the package, or in this case the tube.\n\nIt's amazing how dense some people really are. It seems the more educated people are, the more gullible they become. No matter how many sources I provide for the dentist and others like him, the individuals will attack the information and say that the sources are not valid. No matter how many published studies are offered to this man he will attack the works and say they are not valid. This is how the game is played. If the conventional and popular opinion is attacked by anyone, the traditional health care practitioners and supporters will gang up and attack the damaging source.\n\nAs anyone following this forum can easily read, the dentist went from initially writing a contrary opinion about my article, to attacking my sources, and finally he just through me into a category that he believed would help his point of view in the public's eye…he labeled me as a deranged and crazy chiropractor that doesn't know what he is talking about. By trying to attack the credibility of the source, any published studies that are in opposition to his traditional viewpoint, and then finally my own professional credibility, the dentist has done what he and other traditionalists have been doing for years. They dismiss the truth as quackery and promote real quackery as the truth.\n\nJulio…the truth is in your hands. Read the warning label and you have your answer. If you want to know if fluoride is a poison you don't have to have a Harvard education. The answer has been conveniently printed on every package of fluoridated toothpaste product in existence. Yes, my friend it is a poison and it can harm your health when you use the product several times a day on a yearly basis!\n\nFluoride is a toxin and a dangerous chemical for human beings to consume regardless of the dilution. In reality, recent studies have demonstrated that fluorides are responsible for tooth decay and not a benefit to human teeth. An article that I just linked on this website titled, \" Fluoride: Worse than We Thought\" contains great information about this topic. The article states, \"Fluorides are cumulative toxins. The fact that fluorides accumulate in the body is the reason that US law requires the Surgeon General to set a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for fluoride content in public water supplies as determined by the EPA. This requirement is specifically aimed at avoiding a condition known as Crippling Skeletal Fluorosis (CSF), a disease thought to progress through three stages. The MCL, designed to prevent only the third and crippling stage of this disease, is set at 4ppm or 4mg per liter. It is assumed that people will retain half of this amount (2mg), and therefore 4mg per liter is deemed \"safe.\" Yet a daily dose of 2-8mg is known to cause the third crippling stage of CSF.10,11\n\nI encourage my readers to take the time to read this article as it covers many of the issues currently being debated within this forum.\n\nIs it a drug? You can buy it at the drugstore only if you have a doctor's prescription; however, no doctor has ever prescribed this to an adult because it is a deadly poison and has absolutely no use and cures nothing in the body. Over 200 to 300 communities have decided to reject fluoridation in the last 10 to 15 years. Only 5% of the world uses it.\n\n50% of all fluoride you consume collects in the bones, the brain and the glands. So even if it were good for children's teeth, exactly why would adults want to take this poisonous drug in every glass of water every day for the rest of their lives?\n\nDr. Reizer: Tnank you for the informative site. I would like to add one other opinon to the debate.\n\nFluoridation is a Waste of Tax Money\n\nEven if fluoride was helpful to teeth, distributing any drug in drinking water is the most expensive and wasteful method.\n\nAs a Civil Engineer, I know that people drink only 1/2% (one-half percent) of the water they use. The remaining\n99 ½ % of the water with toxic fluoride chemical is dumped directly into the environment (pollution) through the sewer system in toilets, showers, washing machines, dish washers, etc outdated practice.\n\nSo, for each $1000 the city spends each year in order to distribute fluoride, only $0.50 of this chemical is consumed by the children. It is a wasteful scandal.\n\nThis waste would be comparable to buying one gallon of milk, using six-and-one-half drops of it, and pouring the rest of the gallon in the sink.\n\nA company CEO would be arrested immediately if they dumped their toxic waste fluoride (Hexafluorosilicic acid, which is waste material flushed directly from industrial smokestacks) into a river because it is illegal. The only way they can do it legally is to run it through the community drinking water system first. It is an absolutely insane condition.\n\nFluoridation surely is in contention as the most wasteful and most polluting government program. A different method of distributing a drug such as giving away fluoride tablets free to anyone who wants them or adding it to salt would be far cheaper and certainly more ethical, because then we would have the freedom to choose.\n\nYou make a very valid point. If we throw out the initial argument about fluoride being a toxic chemical, which it certainly is, the issues of wasting taxpayers' hard earned money and offering society the freedom to choose what chemicals/drugs it wishes to be exposed to on a daily basis has to be seriously examined.\n\nThere are currently various local and state governments making broad decisions affecting the health and well being of individual citizens. Government has no right to force individual citizens to swallow or receive by injection any drug/chemical intended to prevent cavities or other disease processes. Chemicals that are artificially added to the public water supplies, for the purpose of preventing dental caries, should be defined as drugs. The publicly stated intent of placing the chemical in the water, in the first place, is to prevent a disease process. Individuals should be given all the facts concerning any dangerous chemicals/drugs and the freedom to choose what they want placed in their bodies.\n\nAccording to Billy's logic, it would be okay to reduce the concentration of foot powder to a small enough amount so that it would not be toxic to people. That too, I guess should be added to the water supplies? Then when we take a shower the water could protect us from athlete's foot and in the case of men — jock itch.\n\nWhat about hemorrhoids, Billy? They're a pain in the arse, too. Should we put that type of medicine in the public water systems also?\n\nWhen will the insanity of government and medical intrusion in our lives finally stop?\n\nYou make an excellent point. Where and when does the insanity stop? Why stop the campaign to medicate the public at dental caries? What about athlete's foot — fungi? What about tranquilizers for anxiety disorders? What about vaccines that some people can't afford or are purposely avoiding? Does government have the right to mass medicate the world?\n\nIt would be just as absurd to place these medicines in our water systems as it is to place fluoride in the water to prevent dental problems.\n\nWith no disrespect intended towards Billy Budd, jwille, or you, I have to fall back on my high school chemistry to figure out some of the information you all have talked about with toothpaste.\n\nNow, I agree that it's concerning that the toothpaste tube contains the labeling to call poison control or get medical help if more than used for brushing is swallowed. Having children of my own, this really woke me up. But I dug a bit deeper into the subject to understand the warning. You know, Inquiring Minds Want to Know.\n\nWhen my child was about 40 pounds, I calculated the fluoride in a tube of toothpaste relative to the lethal dose for a child of her weight. At 40 pounds, or roughly 20kg, she would have to ingest about 480mg at one time to meet her demise.\n\nUsing calculations based on the % of fluoride in toothpastes based on the different fluorides available (SnF, MFP, NaF), the common denominator was that all toothpaste contains around 33.3mg of fluoride per ounce.\n\nLooking at what was available on the shelves and in my bathroom, which is where my kids love to brush, my tube of toothpaste contains 6.4 ounces. Doing the math above, I calculated my tube to contain around 213mg of fluoride. So, for my munchkin to die from eating toothpaste, she'd have to eat 2 full tubes of my toothpaste at one time to get enough fluoride to approach her lethal dose.\n\nNow, that's a far cry from saying that the warning on the back of the toothpaste tube proves that fluoride is a toxic because of its warning label. Reading on the back of the tube a little further reveals the word Supervise. I'd have to say that I would be the toxic one to allow my child to eat 1, let alone 2 full tubes of toothpaste without supervising them.\n\nLet's be fair in our analysis. Most anything we come into contact with can be good or bad for us. The amount we get is the determining factor. As a chiropractor you use x-rays daily to diagnose problems with your patients. But on the other hand, we come into radiation contact daily from our kids playing outside in the sun. So what do we do about both? We weigh the risks and the benefits. We don't take x-rays in your office in a casual way, and we don't let our kids play in the sun without making sure they're monitored. So why wouldn't we do the same with their toothpaste? Fluoride gives them cavity protection. Let's use it wisely, just as we do radiation sources.\n\nThanks for participating on NoFakeNews.net. I appreciate the commentary very much. You bring up some very interesting points regarding the posts that have been published here concerning the article I wrote a few days ago.\n\nI agree with you that there are many products that we, as human beings, regularly come into contact with and use in our everyday lives that require proper supervision. X-rays that are commonly taken in a doctor's office or hospital setting provide valuable information for practitioners while exposing patients to radiation. This radiation is also accumulative in nature and the body has to deal with the radiation. But keep in mind that the taking of x-rays is both supervised and administered with the patient's consent. The procedure is not done repeatedly and the exposure amounts are minimal, probably a lot less than if you spent a few hours in the sun on the beach. In addition, there is valuable information gleaned from the x-ray diagnostic procedure by a medical doctor, dentist, or chiropractor. Those practitioners can use that information to solve a health care challenge for a particular person.\n\nIn the case of fluoride, there are no benefits to be be gleaned by humans when they consume this poison. You and I have been fed a very deceitful package of information over the years that sells the false perception that sodium fluoride, artificially placed into public water supplies, helps prevent tooth decay. This is absolutely not true! In fact, fluoride can actually destroy the integrity of teeth and bones and regularly does so when people come into contact with the chemical.\n\nKeep in mind, Sam, that there is a vast difference between naturally occurring fluorides found in some natural springs and hexafluorosilicic acid, which is an industrial waste material and inserted into our water supplies.\n\nThe other important thing to remember is that the mass medicating of a population base is wrong. These fluoridation programs are being executed without our consent and there is absolutely no supervision of patients on an individual basis. Every human being has different tolerance levels to chemicals/drugs/poisons. Also keep in mind that fluoride uptake by the body is an ongoing process and the poison accumulates over time and destroys your physiology indefinitely.\n\nSam, every person has to weigh the risks when exposing themselves to toxins. You said it yourself in your post. If you want to buy a toothpaste that contains added fluoride, you should have the right to purchase that product. You make the decision to add fluoride to your body and not the government. But if you perform some research, on your own, and decide to use a toothpaste product that does not contain fluoride, you can also buy that product, as many people commonly do. When the government adds fluoride to your tap water, without asking your opinion about this, we have a completely different can of worms on the table.\n\nSam, knowledge is power and that's why there is so much misinformation being published by research companies that are directly controlled by petrochemical companies. The mainstream research outlets are more polluted than the tap water you drink. This breach of integrity concerning research includes the Ivy league schools that so many conspiracy haters like to point to in defense of their mainstream ideas.\n\nDo your own research, Sam, and make the best decision you can for your family and loved ones.\n\nI'm still not clear on the initial post where you said that fluoride is a serious poison as one could see by picking up a tube of toothpaste and looking at the warning label.\n\nThis doesn't make sense to me. The label says that if you swallow more than is used to brush your teeth with, seek medial help or call poison control. Unless I'm missing something here, that amount of fluoride swallowed would in no way be toxic to a child. In my example I showed how irresponsible a parent/caregiver would have to be to let a child eat enough toothpaste to reach a lethal dose. As with vitamins that my child takes which bears the same label, the intake amount is the critical factor. If the child was unattended and took an unknown amount of vitamins or tubes of toothpaste, then this indeed could be a serious issue. But to use that label as an indication of fluoride being a poison is on par to me to saying that vitamins should be looked at the same way. I know that it is common for cereals and milk to be fortified with vitamins. And we purchase these products without a concern.\n\nI am reading a lot about fluoride from trusted sources in science. I have always found the CDC and the WHO to be in agreement with recommendations for the health of children and adults. So are the AMA and the American Academy of Pediatrics. But what concerns me in what I read here from those that post here is that they aren't looking at the scientific authorities are saying. This reminds me of the conspiracy theorists we had in school in one class I took. It was supposed to make us think critically by questioning everything. They taught us that the moon landing was faked; the 911 attack on the Pentagon was a missle from the US, and not a plane flying into it; and many others. Now, I got the point of the class. Don't be one of the blind mice. However, we must use our brains to realize that everything cannot be looked at as a conspiracy. To do so undermines the health and welfare of our country and the world. At some point we all have to agree that we need to put our faith somewhere.\n\nAs I read more, I may revisit your site. i have the points you've made written down to study. But at this point, I'd have to say that I'm becoming more and more convinced that fluoride in water is safe and helpful. I also know that from dissociation chemistry, that when a compound dissociates, it releases its components. Fluoride is the ion of Fluorine. There are no different forms of fluoride. Except of course when it is labeled radioactively so that it can be traced. But that's not what the compounds used to fluoridate water are. They're the fluoride ion. And that comes from basic chemistry.\n\nOne last thought. I read the abstract from the link on fluoride and cardiovascular disease that you had above. I also was able to get my hands on a library copy of the full article.\n\nIn reading that article and abstract, did you misunderstand that the purpose of the radioisotope of fluoride, 18F, was used as a marker to see where the sugar that it was bound to was used by the body? The plaques in the arteries that were most likely to cause serious vascular accidents were the ones that had the greatest uptake of this sugar. The fluoride (18F) was there to allow this to be seen on the PET scan. The study was designed to show active plaques based on their sugar use in metabolism. The radioactive fluoride was just a marker that had a very short half life and was not the basis of the study.\n\nI could see how it would be easy for you to draw this conclusion though by reading the abstract only. The last part of the abstract used the word fluoride once instead of 18F in making a point. If you have access to the full article, I think you'd be quite surprised to find out that the conclusion you drew was not the conclusion of the study. Clarifying this for your readers would help alleviate fears that your interpretation may have caused.\n\nI think we will have to agree to disagree. I am not comfortable with the sources you trust and I guess you feel the same about the sources I have provided in my article and followup posts. If you want to trust the AMA, CDC, WHO, NIH and other agencies, that is your choice. But even if you trust those sources and believe fluoride is beneficial to the integrity of human teeth, the idea that people should be medicated without their consent is wrong!\n\nBy the way, this was the conclusion of the study and it stated the following:\n\n\"CONCLUSION: sodium [¹⁸F]fluoride PET/CT might be useful in the evaluation of the atherosclerotic process in major arteries, including coronary arteries. An increased fluoride uptake in coronary arteries may be associated with an increased cardiovascular risk.\"\n\nIn the end, we all have to make the decisions on what is best for us and what we can live with. That's the Blessing that the good Lord gave us in the form of a brain and reasoning powers. And I agree with you that it's ok to disagree.\n\nI do want you to look into the study above more fully. Since my last post I consulted an interventional radiologist who discussed in detail the full study and the methodology of using 18F. The study uses the radioisotope piggybacked onto a sugar substrate to mark which of the vessels have plaques that are actively metabolizing the sugar. WIthout some form of marker, this would not be possible to track. Since 18F has an extremely short half-life, this makes it an ideal marker that the full body PET Scan can pick up.\n\nI would stronly suggest that you consult a researcher in this area so that the study and its findings can be explained to you and your misunderstanding of the implication of fluoride as a bad guy can be put to rest.\n\nI wouldn't let my kids near this poison. I've read through the different threads here and all I see are a few dentists trying to engage in damage control.\n\nThe warning label on toothpaste packages is all any sane parent should need to read. As for the poisoning of the water supplies, it's absolutely upsetting that people are arguing in favor of this policy.\n\nI also have to comment about Sam's strange position about conspiracies. Don't be so damn gullible, SAM. Conspiracies happen all the time. You can't just dismiss them because they seem inconvenient and because you feel they might undermine the health and welfare of our country. What kind of logic is that?\n\nLook, if you want to shove poison down your kid's throat, be my guest. But don't tell me that I'm crazy or wrong for asking the government not to place this garbage in my tap water.\n\nI thank you very much for the supporting documentation. I think that we are beginning to make some real progress in getting this campaign halted. It's always interesting to see the types of responses one gets when broaching this subject. The fluoride defenders come out of the woodwork and make it seem like there is no one complaining about anything except for a few fringe conspiracy theorists (laugh, laugh).\n\nI walked into a dental seminar, a few years back, and listened to hundreds of dentists discussing the serious dangers associated with fluoride and amalgam fillings. It was quite an educational experience to say the least."

      "text": "Bottled vs. Tap\n\nFrom our Green Inc. blog comes this summary of the debate between advocates of tap water and those of bottled water. The first group includes most people I know, an increasing number of restaurateurs, and the United Nations, and the second includes the bottled water industry.\n\nI happen to like faucet water just fine (except for San Diego's), but this being America, a semi-free country, people certainly should be able to purchase and drink any type of water, in any type of container, they darn well please.\n\nAll the hooey about landfills v. recycling is getting just a bit overblown, too. There is no shortage of landfill space in the United States, and there never will be. Doubt me? Search right here on the Times website for John Tierney's very fine article, \"Recycling Is Garbage.\"\n\nAnd after all, Carlos #5, all that stuff in landfills will give archaeologists of the future plenty of material to dig up. Just think of all the good things they will learn about us from all that crap. Otherwise I am not not sure that John Tierney is much of an expert on the viability of our ever expanding town dumps.\n\nI think that video is full of straw men. Lies from the bottle water industry about tap water contamination? Where are those? I never heard them, perhaps because I never heard anything from them. Whatever PR efforts the industry may be making are ineffective, and unrelated to the bottle water issue.\n\nHere's why I drink bottle water: Convenience and water conservation.\n\nI like cold water, from the fridge. I drink it directly from the 2-liter bottle. When I'm done with a bottle I chuck it in the Type 1 PET recycle bin for my city to pick up.\n\nWith tap water I have to either use a pitcher and glass, or use a reusable bottle. I have to wash the glass or bottle after each use. I have to use a lot of tap water and some detergent to do that. And I have to use my time to do it.\n\nIf you're drinking orange juice or a strongly flavored beverage, fine, but with water the detergent taste remains. You really have to take time and use water and rinse out the container repeatedly to return to a neutral taste.\n\nIs bottled water safer than tap water? The answer is that they are both plenty safe, way safer than necessary. Lake and river water are safe too most of the time. This is not related to why people use bottled water.\n\nThe answer should be pretty obvious. The EPA puts more regulations on tap water than bottled water. Tap water is safer, and far less expensive for consumers.\n\nAnd in terms of landfill issues, i don't agree that a surplus of space to dump garbage makes for a valid argument as to whether it is sensible to dump recyclable material into a landfill or not. If you can recycle a product like a plastic bottle or allow it to contribute to a toxic landfill, why not choose the former rather than the latter?\n\nI walk on the beach almost every day (OR coast). I'd say that the two most common pieces of litter on the beach are: the plastic bits that apparently are shed/fall off of barges heading to/from Japan (to be used in manufacturing plastics) and plastic bottles. Often plastic water bottles.\n\nPlenty of plastic water bottles aren't even making it to the landfill. They're clogging our waterways & oceans instead. I doubt if they're performing a useful function & the plastic bits are very likely endangering some species that lives in the ocean or waterways.\n\nNot to mention the increased use of petroleum to make the bottles, the water that is undoubtedly used in some way to make those bottles, the by products (probably semi-toxic to toxic) of the plastic bottle manufacturing process also need to be taken into consideration. Fewer plastic bottles being manufactured for one time use (since, as you say, they don't need to be recycled) may eventually be a factor in increasing prices at the pump. Have you ever heard of conservation?\n\nBottled water is killing us. The thing about tap water is that it contains minerals our bodies need. Bottled water does not – remember it's \"pure\" no minerals. Think about it, if all you drink is bottled water you are flushing out all the minerals in your body and replacing them with?? It might not be so bad if our national diet was so abhorent, and we actually ate more fruits and vegeatbles than processed foods, but we don't. If you have to drink bottled, opt for purified tap water like Dasani orAquafina – at least you still get your minerals.\n\nI am of the generation that has never felt the need to constantly be in possession of a container of water. Watching adults sucking on these bottles reminds me of babies and pacifiers. Cute for babies, repulsive for adults.\n\nThe people who are now wailing about bottled water abuse are the same people who used to wail about how dangerous our tap water was. They like telling other people what to do. Most of them seek jobs in government. Ignore them.\n\nCarlos, it's not about the amount of space. It's about the environmental and social effects of plastic. First there is the production. Where does plastic come from? Petroleum. What does it become? It stays around forever, leaching out the toxins held in the plastic that were present in the oil we sucked out of the ground to produce the plastic. Plus this limitless landfill space you talk of. Where is it? In your back yard? It's in someone's back yard, and as the materials in it degrade (while plastic is 'forever', it does degrade, and during that degradation it releases toxins) the toxins enter the soil, the water, etc.\n\nSo sure, drink your plastic water to your heart's content. But don't pretend it's not without consequence.\n\nI didn't even address the politics of drilling oil and the loss of life that has, and continues, to accompany that drilling. It's not just about our little corner of the world, but also about how our actions affect other little (and big) corners. Right now there are wars being fought for resources that we are using to produce our throw-away trash. People are dying. Their environments are being destroyed. Is the convenience of having throw-away plastic containers that important to your quality of life? Really?\n\nI underscore the comment made in #8 above – there is more legislation and regulation governing the purity of municipal tap water than there currently exists for bottled water. The next time you drink bottled water, see if you can find information on coliform count – a very routine safety check for municipal water. This information is easily available for the water coming out of your tap (online in my community).\nIf you don't think this is important, okay, you're probably right for the most part … until there is an outbreak of some kind of waterborne illness. But consider the safety of plastic bottles, besides Bis-phenol A (BPA) who knows what is leaching into the water as it sits there. I try to be reasonable but why take a risk it if you can avoid it? Then there's the issue of plastic as garbage. Plastic bottles abound in landfills, of that I have no doubt. Just looking around the cities I've lived in, I see the number of plastic water bottles thrown aside. Again, why add to the problem when the solution is so simple?\nJust invent the $10-$25 for a metal water bottle and fill it whenever you want to take water with you. It won't take long to make up the cost. And as for the poster who objects to the time it takes to clean up a glass (remind me not to have dinner at your house), don't wash it! A weekly rinse with boiling hot water and a wipe of the drinking spout (in & out) should do the trick.\n\nInteresting to see all the comments from the bottle-haters. Problem is, their neighbors don't agree. They like the convenience, and the bottles (and their production and disposal) do no real harm other than offend bottle-haters Therefore, water bottlers should be able to sell their product, and consumers should be able to buy it and dispose of it if and as they please, without nanny-state interference.\n\nHere in Portland, Oregon, anyone who asks for bottled over tap is outed as a pretentious snob since everyone who lives here knows we have some of the best tasting and purest tap water (as shown by several studies) in the nation. Fresh off Mt. Hood and filtered through the pristine Bull Run watershed, it's water to envy. Lucky us!\n\nAfter my acute kidney failure I stopped drinking tap water (which did have a strange taste for some time before my hospitalization). In answer to tputnam, doctor's orders were to be sure to drink a lot of water every day. I tried several types of bottled water until I found one with the best taste. In contrast to Jill's experience, most water brands in my area have similar lists of mineral contents – they are not distilled deionized water but some kind of water from mountain springs (or at least they have the minerals listed).\n\nI've had some bad-tasting/smelling tap water but I don't mind San Diego's if it is ice cold, ice ice cold. Otherwise, I'd prefer bottled. But when I can't have ice cold or bottled, my \"cure\" is to add a green tea bag, or a squeeze of lemon or lime, or a few jamaica (hibiscus) flowers and the taste really perks up.\n\nI live on an island in the US and I assure you that around here we are very rapidly running out of \"landfill\" space.\n\nMy tap water comes from mountain streams, which sounds all pure and natural, but is, in fact, contaminated by animal waste and organic matter. It's heavily chlorinated to kill the disease-causing organisms from the animal waste, which makes it taste really awful, and the chlorine interacts with the organic matter to form carcinogenic nitrosamines. From time to time we get notification that various contaminants were detected in levels above EPA standards, during testing three months prior to the notification. Hell, no I don't drink tap water, and neither does my friend who works at the water treatment plant.\n\nMy solution is to filter my tap water (at the very least, it tastes better) and to transport it in stainless steel bottles.\n\nIndependent study on bottled water by the Environmental Working Group. Basically filtered tap water is an \"A\" rating, while most brands of bottled water are at best \"B\" and [mainly] \"F\" ratings. Not sure about you, but I would rather drink tap water after reading this:\n\nThose who provide \"reasoning\" for bottled water such as 'convenience' and 'there's enough landfill space,' just substantiates that such a person is merely selfish and only cares about what is 'convenient' for him/herself. After all, why should we think about others when clearly the world revolves around each of us and our interests?\n\nI personally, believe that drinking bottled water is completely unnecessary in most cases. For those of us who live in developed countries where the tap water is safe to drink, we should have no issue with using it.\n\nIn response to Marko's comment, you can still have cold water from the fridge, even if you are using tap water. If you purchase a filter, such as a Brita, you can fill up the pitcher in the morning, and use it throughout the day to fill up glasses if you are at home, or a reusable water bottle if you are on the go.\n\nAlso Marko, why must you wash the reusable water bottle after each use? You are going to be the only one using it, and if all you have in it is water, it shouldn't be essential that you wash it after every single use. And even if you really want to wash it, throw it in the dishwasher at the end of the day with your other dishes!\n\nI also agree with Garnet in saying that the majority of garbage I see lying around is from plastic water bottles. By significantly reducing the number of disposable water bottles that are used, we could also be cleaning up the amount of litter that trashes our streets.\n\nOverall, an excuse to not drink tap water is out of pure laziness, unless the water is actually undrinkable. Sure, drinking tap water may be more expensive in the beginning, because you might want to invest in a BPA free bottle and a Brita filter if you wish. It also may involve a little bit more effort. But trust me, it is worth it in the end, because we will be living on a cleaner, happier planet."

The aim of secondary treatment is to remove the suspended and dissolved solid particulates. The biological organisms are used for this purpose. The microorganisms in the treated effluent of secondary treatment are further subjected to tertiary treatment.\n\nTertiary treatment system: This treatment is extremely important than primary treatment and secondary treatment system. It is because the effluent from tertiary treatment directly adjoins estuaries, fresh water stream, irrigational field and at times domestic supply.

However, hundreds of studies and an abundance of evidence prove them wrong, reports the New York State Coalition Opposed to Fluoridation, Inc. (NYSCOF).\n\nHere's what happened in 2011\n\n1) U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recommends lowering water fluoride levels due to fluoride's harmful dental effects\n\nFor over 6 decades, HHS assured Americans that artificially fluoridated water was safe for everyone to drink. But they were wrong. About 50% of U.S. adolescents have fluoride-ruined teeth or dental fluorosis – white spotted, yellow, brown and/or pitted teeth. So HHS' recommends lowering \"optimal\" water fluoride levels.\n\nMany government, health and dental agencies report that babies who consume fluoridated water are more apt to have fluoride-discolored/damaged teeth without benefit of less tooth decay. (References: \n\nThe prestigious National Research Council found EPA's current safe water fluoride levels can adversely affect bones and teeth. EPA's Office of Water will lower safe water fluoride levels\n\n4) U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports growing numbers of U.S. children have fluoride-damaged teeth, arguably at epidemic proportions.\n\nDue to fluoride over-exposure, the CDC reports that over 41% of 12-15 years olds are afflicted with dental fluorosis. However, no research was conducted to discover what fluoride over-exposure has done to children's bones.\n\nColgate joins many government, health and dental organizations in advising that infant formula should not be mixed with fluoridated water to lower babies' risk of developing dental fluorosis ( but this is little publicized.\n\n7) Infant juices contain non-labeled tooth-damaging fluoride levels\n\nCommonly-consumed infant fruit juices contain fluoride, some at levels higher than recommended for pubic water supplies, according to research presented at the International Association for Dental Research annual meeting.\n\n8) More studies published linking fluoride to human brain damage and lower IQ\n\nA review of studies published in Neurologia reports, \"The prolonged ingestion of fluoride may cause significant damage to health and particularly to the nervous system.\" The research team reports, \"It is important to be aware of this serious problem and avoid the use of toothpaste and items that contain fluoride, particularly in children as they are more susceptible to the toxic effects of fluoride.\"\n\n9) New Study Fails to Refute Fluoride-Osteosarcoma Link\n\nA paper in the Journal of Dental Research by dentist Chester Douglass and colleagues, \"An Assessment of Bone Fluoride and Osteosarcoma,\" claims to show no association between fluoride bone levels and osteosarcoma, a form of bone cancer. However, Douglass' study has serious scientific flaws and is incapable of disproving a previous study (Bassin et al., 2006) which linked water fluoridation to osteosarcoma.\n\n10) Prominent Hispanic Civil Rights Group Opposes Fluoridation\n\nThe League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) opposes fluoridation as a civil rights violation and because \"the National Research Council in 2006 established that there are large gaps in the research on fluoride's effects on the whole body; a fact that contradicts previous assurances made by public health officials and by elected officials, that fluorides and fluoridation have been exhaustively researched.\"\n\n12) Tennessee House Speaker, Other Legislators Call for Halt to State Promotion of Fluoridation\n\nBipartisan group cites risks for citizens and water utilities. Tennessee, once 99% fluoridated, is now down in the low 90's according to the American Dental Association News.\n\n13) Water Fluoridation Injury Lawsuit Filed in Federal Court\n\nA 13-year-old's fluoride-discolored teeth were allegedly caused by drinking fluoridated bottled water since infancy. Her mom is suing the bottlers for the cost to cover up the unsightly teeth.\n\n14) Review of Fluoride Supplement Studies Show No Evidence of Safety - No Benefit Either\n\nAccording to the Cochrane Oral Health Group, fluoride supplements fail to reduce tooth decay in primary teeth, permanent teeth cavity-reduction is dubious and health risks are little studied -- The Pennsylvania Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends NO fluoride supplementation because \"Too much fluoride causes streaks in the teeth\" and it's impossible to determine a child's individual daily fluoride intake from all sources. Sodium fluoride supplements \"have not been found by FDA to be safe or effective,\" according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.\n\nIn a Master's thesis, a dental hygienist, with 20 years experience in a clinic for low-income children, noticed these children had significant tooth decay in spite of fluoridation. When people were educated about fluoride's risks and benefits, they stopped drinking fluoridated water, she reported.\n\n16) CDC Reveals Fluoridation Fails Alaskans\n\nThe CDC reports that 91% of rural Alaskan Native adolescents have cavities whether their water is fluoridated or not. The CDC acknowledges that poor diets and lack of dental care are the probable culprits.\n\n17) Pew Charitable Trust uses propaganda, PR and political clout to force more fluoride into people who don't want it.\n\nThe Pew Charitable Trust paid for lobbyists to misinform Arkansas state legislators into mandating fluoridation statewide which nullified local referendums where residents said NO to fluoridation. Pew continues to contaminate local fluoridation politics in New Hampshire, Iowa, Austin and elsewhere.\n\n18) The Council of Canadians, Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment and Great Lakes United demand an end to fluoridation\n\nCouncil of Canadians' Unfluoridate It! campaign. Great Lakes United statement against the 'practice of artificial drinking water fluoridation.'\n\n concentrate\n\nI don't know what the solution is. But I do know that when we put the merely miseducated in with the truly malevolent, we drive potential allies further away from the neutral ground where we might be able to connect and enlighten. Not saying I am any good at it! And of course, public health professionals are even more prejudiced against us as a group. But in my experience with the Council of Canadians and Green Party over three years, it was the ability of Elizabeth May and Maude Barlow to deliver a soft answer to my wrath and invite me to step into the middle ground for further discussion that has resulted in their two powerful national resolutions calling for an end to fluoridation in Canada. Council of Canadians has been a staunch supporter of water fluoridation in the past.\n\nAll I can suggest is that you keep politely pressing them for evidence that fluoride supplement of 700 micrograms per day provided by on quart of fluoridated water used to make formula for an infant under six months is safe (as they claim on this 'warning') when fluoride supplement of 250 micrograms  per day should not be given at all to any infant under six months, breastfed or bottle fed, because it is not protective of systemic overdose known to cause dental fluorosis.\n\nNita, there may be a person every so often among them (e.g. Michael Easeley) who does lack the ability to feel empathy for other's suffering (that the research lit indicates can be caused by pharmaceuticals, toxins, congenital brain abnormality or is learned behaviour usually as a result of abuse or early emotional neglect), but virtually all of the public health people I've met are just mis-educated and unconsciously biased due to having a basic loyalty to their peer group in their profession. The loyalty to their profession and peers makes it impossible to accept the idea that fluoridation is harmful and what they've been promoting all their professional lives is harming not only their community's children – but their own. So they are True Believers that fluoridation is always The Right Thing To Do. They are not evil and not sociopathic. But like all of us, they will seek to avoid being caught in a serious mistake that shows them up as foolish or incompetent even if the mistake is genuinely not their fault. The drive to avoid humiliation, maintain power/status and save face is even more powerful than the drive to avoid starvation.\n\nI do think that in order to allow them to back down with dignity, we must find a way to end fluoridation on neutral information and impartial rule of law.\n\nAugie is feeling the effects of challenging their integrity firsthand. My, my, how times don't change since good ole Mr. Bull started helping fluoridation get established and deal with objectors. John Yiamouiyannis was reprimanded, demoted and then fired. Dr. Waldbott and Dr. Spira encountered the same closing of ranks and hostility from governing bodies. Bryson, Limeback, Bassin, Mullenix – all suffered serious career setbacks as a result of breaking from the ranks.\n\nDoug's experience with WIC is one I should learn from too. I confess I am not exactly gentle in my scathing reprimands of people who, but for capricious circumstance, are mostly just like me.\n\nIn California the WIC advisors were told to not to tell the parents anything unless the parents had asked specifically about the risk of fluorosis. And since very few parents know about this very few were being told.\n\nHow truly evil to know about something that will hurt people--especially babies-- and purposefully keep quiet about it. A sin of omission is as serious and can cause as much harm as a sin of commission. And how doubly revolting to order others that they have power over to hush up too. I hate to think of the awful mental anguish some of those WIC advisors who know how bad fluoride is are going through as a result of the hush up orders from their superiors.\n\nIf those at the top who are giving the hush up orders do not care about doing the right thing then so be it--basic human decency cannot be forced upon someone--either they are truthful and moral and live their lives doing the right thing or they are not--and there are some very bad names for this sort of person. This sort of person has absolutely no business working for a public health agency. In my opinion such a person is corrupt. I'm sure some of this type of person is reading this right now since this board is monitored.\n\nHowever they are being incredibly stupid if they are too boneheaded to realize that the day is coming when they will end up being deposed for lawsuits and sued silly for failure to warn. Oh and just think of all the WIC advisors being deposed and telling how their bosses told them not to warn and to keep quiet unless specifically asked. Oh my just imagine what juries will do when they hear about that !!! And to add to their upcoming legal woes a sizeable percentage of WIC families are minorities which opens up a whole new world of Civil Rights Violations lawsuits where these health officials PERSONAL ASSETS CAN BE GONE AFTER.\n\nSure hope the \"monitors\" spread this post across the country to the public health community !!!\n\nDid anybody ever think about fluoridating water being the most inefficient means of preventive dentistry?\n\nAlmost everyone drinking the water is over- or underdosing. They say a person needs eight glasses of water a day. (That assumes they don't drink milk, soda, fruit or vegetable juice or eat moist food like spaghetti.) Eight glasses of water is about half a gallon a day per person.\n\nWhen you flush a toilet you use a week's dosage of fluoride. A shower uses three to four weeks, and a bath six or seven weeks' worth.\n\nI won't guess how much for laundry or dish washing. And don't forget we water our lawns with it in summer and the city parks department buys it for watering the many acres of parks we have.\n\nMost of it goes into things that don't even have teeth. I am not a chemist and don't know how cumulative it is in the ground, but over the years there must have been some change in the chemical make-up of soil and plants watered with fluoride.\n\nForty years ago I bought a water distiller and still use it to avoid chlorine and fluoride. And I asked at my favorite restaurant if they were giving me city water and I was told they have an efficient filter on their water. It may be (and should be) required by state health inspectors.\n\nThink of it like this. Fluoride is available in prescription doses in pills. The city buys you one of these pills every day and you take it and have great teeth. But for each pill they buy an undetermined number of the same pills (hundreds at least and some days thousands) which they dump on the ground or flush down the sewer every single day.\n\nInternational Bottled Water Association Disputes New York Times Article On Children's Cavity Rates\n\nThe International Bottled Water Association (IBWA) issued the following statement regarding a March 6, 2012, New York Times article concerning recent increases in children's cavity rates.\n\nThe International Bottled Water Association (IBWA) issued the following statement regarding a March 6, 2012, New York Times article concerning recent increases in children's cavity rates:\n\n\"The New York Times article, Preschoolers in Surgery for a Mouthful of Cavities, (March 6, 2012), notes that the causes of increased dental problems in young children vary, from a simple lack of brushing to too many sugary foods and beverages. Unfortunately, the article also incorrectly states that drinking bottled water instead of `fluoridated tap water' can contribute to tooth decay. This statement is both inaccurate and misleading. There is absolutely no correlation between consumption of bottled water and an increase in cavities. In fact, bottled water does not contain ingredients that cause cavities, such as sugar.\n\nFor consumers who want fluoride in their drinking water and wish to choose bottled water, approximately 20 IBWA member companies make clearly-labeled fluoridated bottled water products under stringent FDA guidelines. For a complete list of these brands, which are available in many markets across the country, please visit IBWA's Website,\n\nThere are many sources of fluoride, and the amount of fluoride exposure varies greatly by community and individual. Approximately two-thirds of communities in the Unites States fluoridate their public drinking water supplies. Those who live in communities that do not fluoridate public drinking water, who get their drinking water from wells, or who filter their fluoridated tap water will not be getting fluoride in their drinking water. Fluoride is present in many foods and beverages and almost all toothpaste contains fluoride. Too much exposure to fluoride can lead to a condition called fluorosis, which results in stains to the teeth. Consumers should therefore look at how much fluoride they are receiving as part of an overall diet and should contact their health-care provider or dental-care provider for their recommendation.\n\nAs a packaged food product, comprehensively regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), bottled water labels must contain the name and place of business of the bottler, packer or distributor, and virtually all bottled water products provide a telephone number. With this information, consumers may contact the bottled water company directly to obtain information about the product. Bottled water companies must also follow fluoride labeling guidelines should fluoride be added to the product or be present at a naturally occurring level as set for the by FDA regulation (21C.F.R. §165.110(b)\n\nFormer U.N. ambassador Andrew Young and Dr. Gerald Durley were civil rights\nleaders in south in the 1960's. Along with Bernice King, daughter of Martin\nLuther King, they are now opposed to water fluoridation and are calling for a\nrepeal of the Georgia mandatory fluoridation law.\nOne thing we can do is thank these people for their support. They have come\nunder a lot of pressure since they took this stand. After they wrote the\nletters they had a meeting with some powerful high level people in federal\npublic health. However, they have not withdrawn their letters.\nIf you go to  you will find the letters written by\nYoung and Durley in the \"endorsements/letters\" section.\nI posted a message on Andrew Young's facebook page, which is here:\n\nI also wrote a letter of support to Dr. Gerald Durley, his address is on his\nletter found on the \"spots on my teeth\" website. I wrote a letter for former\nPresident Jimmy Carter, who signed the mandatory bill when he was governor of\nGeorgia.\nDan Stockin was the person who informed these leaders. He asks that any letters\nof support be respectful, and please don't ask them to do anything else\nregarding fluoride or another issue. They are very busy with many things on\ntheir plates.\n\nCity cuts fluoride levels in water supply\n\nAspen's drinking water will contain less fluoride, City Council decided at Monday's meeting.\n\nEffective immediately, the city will adapt the amount of fluoride it adds to the water supply to new federal standards recommending levels be set at 0.7 parts per million. The chemical is added to drinking water because of its ability to stem cavities in children, but is controversial because it is also a toxin with adverse health effects in high enough doses.\n\nThe city for decades has added enough fluoride, which is naturally occurring in lower levels in area streams, to bring the level up to 1.0 parts per million.\n\nThe official action by council comes after years of debate on the issue. Removing fluoride from public water supplies has become a cause for some, and officials within the city's water department have become concerned over the years about adding the substance.\n\n\"We have the best water in the world,\" said water treatment supervisor Charles Bailey, a 20-year veteran of the water department. \"We cringe when we load\" the fluoride bags into the water supply, he said, noting the chemical's industrial Chinese origin. There are no domestically available sources of fluoride additive, he said.\n\nBailey likened the practice of adding fluoride to polluting the water.\n\nCouncilman Torre was in favor of eliminating fluoride altogether, saying the practice is like medicating \"nine out of 10 people because one out of 10 needs it.\"\n\nFile photo\n\nJake DeWolfe, treatment operator for the city of Aspen's water department, pours fluoride into a hopper that dispenses the chemical into the water system in this photo taken in 2011. When handling fluoride, one must wear a full-body protective suit, gloves and a respirator mask.\n\nCouncilman Steve Skadron, recognizing the issue's ability to stir passions on both sides, said there are \"significant trade-offs and competing benefits and risks.\" He felt that lowering the amount of fluoride added, as opposed to eliminating it, best addressed all concerns.\n\nCouncilman Derek Johnson said he is concerned by reports from some local dentists, who claim that children in Basalt and Carbondale have higher incidents of cavities than their counterparts in Aspen. Basalt and Carbondale do not add fluoride to their water supplies.\n\nHowever, he said the city should stay on top of the issue and continually monitor the fluoride added to the water supply to see what's really in it and keep up with federal recommendations.\n\nThe plan approved instructs the water department to \"create a more extensive testing protocol\" on fluoride levels, and report back annually to council on fluoride.\n\nC.J. Oliver, the city's director of the environmental health department, wrote in a memo on the issue that the government must rely on \"peer-reviewed\" studies in deciding which way to go. While too much fluoride has been shown to degrade tooth enamel and lead to more bone fractures, the jury is still out on whether the levels of fluoride in Aspen's water are truly dangerous, the memo says. Other claims, including concerns that fluoride causes cancer and lowers IQ levels, are unsubstantiated at this time, Oliver wrote.\n\nCity will continue adding fluoride to water\n\nCouncil says it was swamped with info on controversial issue\n\nTesting the \"product\" that is coming from China needs to be done to each batch. I guess that will also change the the \"$1 spent gives $38 in savings\" , which is not accurate to begin with. Exactly what method will be used to test it? Ion-chromatography with chemical suppression of eluent conductivity would be the best and what is the cost to do it? Even better would be to require testing of individuals serum fluoride, thyroid function, kidney function, IQ, dental fluorosis, etc. and correlating it to other health conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, kidney disease, diabetes, and especially heart disease. I guess this would again cause the \"for every $1 spent\" to be diminished. If you truely want to get the big picture all this and MORE is needed.\n\nI've been informed that all the members of the New Jersey senate health\ncommittee were issued literature proving that NJ dental records are the same if\nnot better than more fluoridated states.\nI'd like to get that literature if possible. Does anybody know who gave them\nthat literature?\nThanks.\n\nUnapproved Drugs: Drugs Marketed in the United States That Do Not Have Required FDA Approval\n\nFederal law generally requires that prescription drugs in the U.S. be shown to be both safe and effective prior to marketing. The FDA's evidence-based system of drug approval and the OTC monograph system play essential roles in ensuring that drugs are both safe and effective. For instance, during the drug approval process the applicant must demonstrate that its manufacturing processes can reliably produce drug products of expected identity, strength, quality, and purity. Furthermore, FDA's review of the applicant's labeling insures that health care professionals and patients have the information necessary to understand a drug product's risks and its safe and effective use.\n\nThe Agency has serious concerns that drugs marketed without required FDA approval may not meet modern standards for safety, effectiveness, quality, and labeling. Physicians and other healthcare practitioners, along with consumers, cannot assume that all marketed drugs have been found by the FDA to be safe and effective. For a variety of historical reasons, some drugs, mostly older products, continue to be marketed illegally in the U.S. without required FDA approval. The manufacturers of unapproved drug products have not received FDA approval and do not conform to a monograph for making over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. The lack of evidence demonstrating that these unapproved drugs are safe and effective is a significant public health concern.\n\nUnapproved Drugs Initiative\n\nIn June 2006, the FDA announced a new drug safety initiative to remove unapproved drugs from the market, including a final guidance entitled \"Marketed Unapproved Drugs—Compliance Policy Guide (CPG),\" outlining its enforcement policies aimed at efficiently and rationally bringing all such drugs into the approval process. The FDA uses a risk-based enforcement program in order to concentrate its resources on those products that pose the highest threat to public health and without imposing undue burdens on consumers, or unnecessarily disrupting the market. For all unapproved drugs, the CPG gives highest enforcement priority to the following:\n\nDrugs with potential safety risks\n\nDrugs that lack evidence of effectiveness\n\nHealth fraud drugs\n\nDrugs that present direct challenges to the new drug approval and OTC drug monograph systems\n\nUnapproved new drugs that are also violative of the Act in other ways\n\nDrugs that are reformulated to evade an FDA enforcement action\n\nSummary of Compliance Policy Guide\n\nThe Marketed Unapproved Drugs—Compliance Policy Guide (CPG):\n\nprovides official notice that any illegally marketed product is subject to FDA enforcement at any time\n\nclarifies that the FDA intends to use a risk-based approach to enforcement\n\nonce the risk-based assessment has been made, the FDA can and will take any number of enforcement actions, including but not limited to:\n\nWhat are unapproved drugs and why are they on the market?\n\nThe original Federal Food and Drugs Act of 1906 brought drug regulation under federal law. That Act prohibited the sale of adulterated or misbranded drugs, but did not require that drugs be approved by FDA. In 1938, Congress required that new drugs be approved for safety. In 1962, Congress amended the 1938 law to require manufacturers to show that their drug products were effective, as well as safe. As a result, all drugs approved between 1938 and 1962 had to be reviewed again for effectiveness. To be consistent with current regulations and to ensure that all drugs have been shown to be safe and effective, all new drugs are required to have an approved application for continued marketing.\n\nMany healthcare providers are unaware of the unapproved status of drugs and have continued to unknowingly prescribe them because the drugs' labels do not disclose that they lack FDA approval. In addition, since many unapproved drugs are marketed without brand names and have been available for many years, it is often assumed that these unapproved drugs are generic drugs. This is not correct. Generic drugs have been evaluated and approved by FDA to demonstrate bioequivalence to a brand name reference drug. Healthcare professionals and consumers can be assured that FDA-approved generic drug products have met the same quality, strength, purity and stability as brand name drugs. Additionally, the generic manufacturing, packaging, and testing sites must meet the same quality standards as those of brand name drugs. Unapproved drug products have not been evaluated and approved by FDA. Unapproved drugs are not generic medications, and neither their safety nor their efficacy can be assuredI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThis Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) describes how we intend to exercise our enforcement discretion with regard to drugs marketed in the United States that do not have required FDA approval for marketing. This is a revision of a guidance of the same name that was issued in June 2006. The guidance has been revised to state that the enforcement priorities and potential exercise of enforcement discretion discussed in the guidance apply only to unapproved new drugs (including new drugs covered by the Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drug Review), except for licensed biologics and veterinary drugs, that are commercially used or sold\n\n2 prior to September 19, 2011\n\nshould in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII. BACKGROUND\n\nA. Reason for This Guidance\n\nFor historical reasons, some drugs are available in the United States that lack required FDA approval for marketing. A brief, informal summary description of the various\n\n1\n\nThis guidance has been prepared by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) at the Food and Drug Administration. 2 For the purposes of this guidance, the term \"commercially used or sold\" means that the product has been used in a business or activity involving retail or wholesale marketing and/or sale.\n\n2\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\ncategories of these drugs and their regulatory status is provided in Appendix A as general background for this document. The manufacturers of these drugs have not received FDA approval to legally market their drugs, nor are the drugs being marketed in accordance with the OTC drug review. The new drug approval and OTC drug monograph processes play an essential role in ensuring that all drugs are both safe and effective for their intended uses. Manufacturers of drugs that lack required approval, including those that are not marketed in accordance with an OTC drug monograph, have not provided FDA with evidence demonstrating that their products are safe and effective, and so we have an interest in taking steps to either encourage the manufacturers of these products to obtain the required evidence and comply with the approval provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) or remove the products from the market. We want to achieve these goals without adversely affecting public health, imposing undue burdens on consumers, or unnecessarily disrupting the market.\n\nThe goals of this guidance are to (1) clarify for FDA personnel and the regulated industry how we intend to exercise our enforcement discretion regarding unapproved drugs and\n\n(2) emphasize that illegally marketed drugs must obtain FDA approval.\n\nB. Historical Enforcement Approach\n\nFDA estimates that in the United States today perhaps as many as several thousand drug products are marketed illegally without required FDA approval.\n\n3 Because we do not have complete data on illegally marketed products, and because the universe of such products is constantly changing as products enter and leave the market, we first have to identify illegally marketed products before we can contemplate enforcement action. Once an illegally marketed product is identified, taking enforcement action against the product would typically involve one or more of the following: requesting voluntary compliance; providing notice of action in a Federal Register notice; issuing an untitled letter; issuing a Warning Letter; or initiating a seizure, injunction, or other proceeding. Each of these actions is time-consuming and resource intensive. Recognizing that we are unable to take action immediately against all of these illegally marketed products and that we need to make the best use of scarce Agency resources, we have had to prioritize our enforcement efforts and exercise enforcement discretion with regard to products that remain on the market.\n\nIn general, in recent years, FDA has employed a risk-based enforcement approach with respect to marketed unapproved drugs. This approach includes efforts to identify illegally marketed drugs, prioritization of those drugs according to potential public health concerns or other impacts on the public health, and subsequent regulatory follow-up. Some of the specific actions the Agency has taken have been precipitated by evidence of safety or effectiveness problems that has either come to our attention during inspections or been brought to our attention by outside sources.\n\n3\n\nThis rough estimate comprises several hundred drugs (different active ingredients) in various strengths, combinations, and dosage forms from multiple distributors and repackagers.\n\n3\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIII. FDA'S ENFORCEMENT POLICY\n\nIn the discussion that follows, we intend to clarify our approach to prioritizing our enforcement actions and exercising our enforcement discretion with regard to unapproved, illegally marketed drug products.\n\nThe enforcement priorities and potential exercise of enforcement discretion discussed in this guidance apply only to unapproved drug products that are being commercially used or sold as of September 19, 2011. All unapproved drugs introduced onto the market after that date are subject to immediate enforcement action at any time, without prior notice and without regard to the enforcement priorities set forth below. In light of the notice provided by this guidance, we believe it is inappropriate to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to unapproved drugs that a company (including a manufacturer or distributor) begins marketing after September 19, 2011.\n\nFor unapproved drugs commercially used or sold as of September 19, 2011, FDA's enforcement priorities are described below.\n\nA. Enforcement Priorities\n\nConsistent with our risk-based approach to the regulation of pharmaceuticals, FDA intends to continue its current policy of giving higher priority to enforcement actions involving unapproved drug products in the following categories:\n\nDrugs with potential safety risks.\n\nRemoving potentially unsafe drugs protects the public from direct and indirect health threats.\n\nDrugs that lack evidence of effectiveness.\n\nRemoving ineffective drugs protects the public from using these products in lieu of effective treatments. Depending on the indication, some ineffective products would, of course, pose safety risks as well.\n\nHealth fraud drugs.\n\nFDA defines health fraud as \"[t]he deceptive promotion, advertisement, distribution or sale of articles . . . or done without adequate knowledge or understanding of the article\" (CPG Sec. 120.500). Of highest priority in this area are drugs that present a direct risk to health. Indirect health hazards exist if, as a result of reliance on the product, the consumer is likely to delay or discontinue appropriate medical treatment. Indirect health hazards will be evaluated for enforcement action based on section 120.500, Health Fraud - Factors in Considering Regulatory Action (CPG Sec. 120.500). FDA's health fraud CPG outlines priorities for evaluating regulatory actions against indirect health hazard products, such as whether the therapeutic claims are significant, whether there are any scientific data to support the safety and\n\n4\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\neffectiveness of the product, and the degree of vulnerability of the prospective user group (CPG Sec. 120.500).\n\nDrugs that present direct challenges to the new drug approval and OTC drug monograph systems.\n\nThe drug approval and OTC drug monograph systems are designed to avoid the risks associated with potentially unsafe, ineffective, and fraudulent drugs. The drugs described in the preceding three categories present direct challenges to these systems, as do unapproved drugs that directly compete with an approved drug, such as when a company obtains approval of a new drug application (NDA) for a product that other companies are marketing without approval (see section III.C, Special Circumstances – Newly Approved Product). Also included are drugs marketed in violation of a final and effective OTC drug monograph. Targeting drugs that challenge the drug approval or OTC drug monograph systems buttresses the integrity of these systems and makes it more likely that firms will comply with the new drug approval and monograph requirements, which benefits the public health.\n\nUnapproved new drugs that are also violative of the Act in other ways.\n\nThe Agency also intends, in circumstances that it considers appropriate, to continue its policy of enforcing the preapproval requirements of the FD&C Act against a drug or firm that also violates another provision of the FD&C Act, even if there are other unapproved versions of the drug made by other firms on the market. For instance, if a firm that sells an unapproved new drug also violates current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations, the Agency is not inclined to limit an enforcement action in that instance to the CGMP violations. Rather, the Agency may initiate a regulatory action that targets both the CGMP violation and the violation of section 505 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 355). This policy efficiently preserves scarce Agency resources by allowing the Agency to pursue all applicable charges against a drug and/or a firm and avoiding duplicative action. See United States v. Sage Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 210 F.3d 475, 479-80 (5th Cir. 2000).\n\nDrugs that are reformulated to evade an FDA enforcement action.\n\nThe Agency is also aware of instances in which companies that anticipate an FDA enforcement action against a specific type or formulation of an unapproved product have made formulation changes to evade that action, but have not brought the product into compliance with the law. Companies should be aware that the Agency is not inclined to exercise its enforcement discretion with regard to such products. Factors that the Agency may consider in determining whether to bring action against the reformulated products include, but are not limited to, the timing of the change, the addition of an ingredient without adequate scientific justification (see, for example, 21 CFR 300.50 and 330.10(a)(4)(iv)), the creation of a new combination that has not previously been marketed, and the claims made for the new product.\n\nB. Notice of Enforcement Action and Continued Marketing of Unapproved Drugs\n\nFDA is not required to, and generally does not intend to, give special notice that a drug product may be subject to enforcement action, unless FDA determines that\n\n5\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nnotice is necessary or appropriate to protect the public health.\n\n4 The issuance of this guidance is intended to provide notice that any product that is being marketed illegally is subject to FDA enforcement action at any time.5 The only exception to this policy is, as set forth elsewhere, that generally products subject to an ongoing DESI6 proceeding or ongoing OTC drug monograph proceeding (i.e., an OTC product that is part of the OTC drug review for which an effective final monograph is not yet in place) may remain on the market during the pendency of that proceeding7 and any additional period specifically provided in the proceeding (such as a delay in the effective date of a final OTC drug monograph).8 However, once the relevant DESI or OTC drug monograph proceeding is completed and any additional grace period specifically provided in the proceeding has expired, all products that are not in compliance with the conditions for marketing determined in that proceeding are subject to enforcement action at any time without further notice (see, for example, 21 CFR 310.6).\n\nFDA intends to evaluate on a case-by-case basis whether justification exists to exercise enforcement discretion to allow continued marketing for some period of time after FDA determines that a product is being marketed illegally. In deciding whether to allow such a grace period,\n\n9 we may consider the following factors: (1) the effects on the public health of proceeding immediately to remove the illegal products from the market (including whether the product is medically necessary and, if so, the ability of legally marketed products to meet the needs of patients taking the drug); (2) the difficulty associated with conducting any required studies, preparing and submitting applications, and obtaining approval of an application; (3) the burden on affected parties of\n\n4\n\nFor example, in 1997, FDA issued a Federal Register notice declaring all orally administered levothyroxine sodium products to be new drugs and requiring manufacturers to obtain approved new drug applications (62 FR 43535, August 14, 1997). Nevertheless, FDA gave manufacturers 3 years (later extended to 4 (65 FR 24488, April 26, 2000)) to obtain approved applications and allowed continued marketing without approved new drug applications because FDA found that levothyroxine sodium products were medically necessary to treat hypothyroidism and no alternative drug provided an adequate substitute.\n\n5\n\nFor example, FDA may take action at any time against a product that was originally marketed before 1938, but that has been changed since 1938 in such a way as to lose its grandfather status (21 U.S.C. 321(p)).\n\n6\n\nThe Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) was the process used by FDA to evaluate for effectiveness for their labeled indications over 3,400 products that were approved only for safety between 1938 and 1962. DESI is explained more fully in the appendix to this document.\n\n7\n\nOTC drugs covered by ongoing OTC drug monograph proceedings may remain on the market as provided in current enforcement policies. See, for example, CPG sections 450.200 and 450.300 and 21 CFR part 330. This document does not affect the current enforcement policies for such drugs.\n\n8\n\nSometimes, a final OTC drug monograph may have a delayed effective date or provide for a specific period of time for marketed drugs to come into compliance with the monograph. At the end of that period, drugs that are not marketed in accordance with the monograph are subject to enforcement action and the exercise of enforcement discretion in the same way as any other drug discussed in this CPG.\n\n9\n\nFor purposes of this guidance, the terms grace period and allow a grace period refer to an exercise of enforcement discretion by the Agency (i.e., a period of time during which FDA, as a matter of discretion, elects not to initiate a regulatory action on the ground that an article is an unapproved new drug).\n\n6\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nimmediately removing the products from the market; (4) the Agency's available enforcement resources; and (5) any special circumstances relevant to the particular case under consideration. However, as stated above, FDA does not intend to apply any such grace period to an unapproved drug that was introduced onto the market after September 19, 2011.\n\nC. Special Circumstances — Newly Approved Product\n\nSometimes, a company may obtain approval of an NDA for a product that other companies are marketing without approval.\n\n10 We want to encourage this type of voluntary compliance with the new drug requirements because it benefits the public health by increasing the assurance that marketed drug products are safe and effective — it also reduces the resources that FDA must expend on enforcement. Thus, because they present a direct challenge to the drug approval system, FDA is more likely to take enforcement action against remaining unapproved drugs in this kind of situation. However, we intend to take into account the circumstances once the product is approved in determining how to exercise our enforcement discretion with regard to the unapproved products. In exercising enforcement discretion, we intend to balance the need to provide incentives for voluntary compliance against the implications of enforcement actions on the marketplace and on consumers who are accustomed to using the marketed products.\n\nWhen a company obtains approval to market a product that other companies are marketing without approval, FDA normally intends to allow a grace period of roughly 1 year from the date of approval of the product before it will initiate enforcement action (e.g., seizure or injunction) against marketed unapproved products of the same type. However, the grace period provided is expected to vary from this baseline based upon the following factors: (1) the effects on the public health of proceeding immediately to remove the illegal products from the market (including whether the product is medically necessary and, if so, the ability of the holder of the approved application to meet the needs of patients taking the drug); (2) whether the effort to obtain approval was publicly disclosed;\n\n11 (3) the difficulty associated with conducting any required studies, preparing and submitting applications, and obtaining approval of an application; (4) the burden on affected parties of removing the products from the market; (5) the Agency's available enforcement resources; and (6) any other special circumstances relevant to the particular case under consideration. To assist in an orderly transition to the approved product(s), in implementing a grace period, FDA may identify interim dates by which firms should first\n\n10\n\nThese may be products that are the same as the approved product or somewhat different, such as products of different strength.\n\n11\n\nFor example, at the Agency's discretion, we may provide for a shorter grace period if an applicant seeking approval of a product that other companies are marketing without approval agrees to publication, around the time it submits the approval application, of a Federal Register notice informing the public that the applicant has submitted that application. A shortened grace period may also be warranted if the fact of the application is widely known publicly because of applicant press releases or other public statements. Such a grace period may run from the time of approval or from the time the applicant has made the public aware of the submission, as the Agency deems appropriate.\n\n7 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\ncease manufacturing unapproved forms of the drug product, and later cease distributing the unapproved product.\n\nThe length of any grace period and the nature of any enforcement action taken by FDA will be decided on a case-by-case basis. Companies should be aware that a Warning Letter may not be sent before initiation of enforcement action and should not expect any grace period that is granted to protect them from the need to leave the market for some period of time while obtaining approval. Companies marketing unapproved new drugs should also recognize that, while FDA normally intends to allow a grace period of roughly 1 year from the date of approval of an unapproved product before it will initiate enforcement action (e.g., seizure or injunction) against others who are marketing that unapproved product, it is possible that a substantially shorter grace period would be provided, depending on the individual facts and circumstances.\n\n12\n\nThe shorter the grace period, the more likely it is that the first company to obtain an approval will have a period of de facto market exclusivity before other products obtain approval. For example, if FDA provides a 1-year grace period before it takes action to remove unapproved competitors from the market, and it takes 2 years for a second application to be approved, the first approved product could have 1 year of market exclusivity before the onset of competition. If FDA provides for a shorter grace period, the period of effective exclusivity could be longer. FDA hopes that this period of market exclusivity will provide an incentive to firms to be the first to obtain approval to market a previously unapproved drug.\n\n13\n\nD.\n\nRegulatory Action Guidance\n\nDistrict offices are encouraged to refer to CDER for review (with copies of labeling) any unapproved drugs that appear to fall within the enforcement priorities in section III.A. Charges that may be brought against unapproved drugs include, but are not limited to, violations of 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 352(f)(1) of the FD&C Act. Other charges may also apply based on, among others, violations of 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B) (CGMP), 352(a) (misbranding), or 352(o) (failure to register or list).\n\n12\n\nFirms are reminded that this CPG does not create any right to a grace period; the length of the grace period, if any, is solely at the discretion of the Agency. For instance, firms should not expect any grace period when the public health requires immediate removal of a product from the market, or when the Agency has given specific prior notice in the Federal Register or otherwise that a drug product requires FDA approval.\n\n13\n\nThe Agency understands that, under the Act, holders of NDAs must list patents claiming the approved drug product and that newly approved drug products may, in certain circumstances, be eligible for marketing exclusivity. Listed patents and marketing exclusivity may delay the approval of competitor products. If FDA believes that an NDA holder is manipulating these statutory protections to inappropriately delay competition, the Agency will provide relevant information on the matter to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In the past, FDA has provided information to the FTC regarding patent infringement lawsuits related to pending abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), citizen petitions, and scientific challenges to the approval of competitor drug products.\n\n8\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nBRIEF HISTORY OF FDA MARKETING APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS AND CATEGORIES OF DRUGS THAT LACK REQUIRED FDA APPROVAL\n\n14\n\nKey events in the history of FDA's drug approval regulation and the categories of drugs affected by these events are described below.\n\nA. 1938 and 1962 Legislation\n\nThe original Federal Food and Drugs Act of June 30, 1906, first brought drug regulation under federal law. That Act prohibited the sale of adulterated or misbranded drugs, but did not require that drugs be approved by FDA. In 1938, Congress passed the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), which required that new drugs be approved for safety. As discussed below, the active ingredients of many drugs currently on the market were first introduced, at least in some form, before 1938. Between 1938 and 1962, if a drug obtained approval, FDA considered drugs that were identical, related, or similar (IRS) to the approved drug to be covered by that approval, and allowed those IRS drugs to be marketed without independent approval. Many manufacturers also introduced drugs onto the market between 1938 and 1962 based on their own conclusion that the products were generally recognized as safe (GRAS) or based on an opinion from FDA that the products were not new drugs. Between 1938 and 1962, the Agency issued many such opinions, although all were formally revoked in 1968 (see 21 CFR 310.100).\n\nB. DESI\n\nIn 1962, Congress amended the Act to require that a new drug also be proven effective, as well as safe, to obtain FDA approval. This amendment also required FDA to conduct a retrospective evaluation of the effectiveness of the drug products that FDA had approved as safe between 1938 and 1962 through the new drug approval process.\n\nFDA contracted with the National Academy of Science/National Research Council (NAS/NRC) to make an initial evaluation of the effectiveness of over 3,400 products that were approved only for safety between 1938 and 1962. The NAS/NRC created 30 panels of 6 professionals each to conduct the review, which was broken down into specific drug categories. The NAS/NRC reports for these drug products were submitted to FDA in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The Agency reviewed and re-evaluated the findings of each panel and published its findings in\n\nFederal Register notices. FDA's administrative implementation of the NAS/NRC reports was called the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI). DESI covered the 3,400 products specifically reviewed by the NAS/NRCs as well as the even larger number of IRS products that entered the market without FDA approval.\n\n14\n\nThis brief history document should be viewed as a secondary source. To determine the regulatory status of a particular drug or category of drugs, the original source documents cited should be consulted.\n\n9\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nBecause DESI products were covered by approved (pre-1962) applications, the Agency concluded that, prior to removing products not found effective from the market, it would follow procedures in the FD&C Act and regulations that apply when an approved new drug application is withdrawn:\n\nAll initial DESI determinations are published in the\n\nFederal Register and, if the drug is found to be less than fully effective, there is an opportunity for a hearing.\n\nThe Agency considers the basis of any hearing request and either grants the hearing or denies the hearing on summary judgment and publishes its final determination in the\n\nFederal Register.\n\nIf FDA's final determination classifies the drug as effective for its labeled indications, as required by the FD&C Act, FDA still requires approved applications for continued marketing of the drug and all drugs IRS to it – NDA supplements for those drugs with NDAs approved for safety, or new ANDAs or NDAs, as appropriate, for IRS drugs. DESI-effective drugs that do not obtain approval of the required supplement, ANDA, or NDA are subject to enforcement action.\n\nIf FDA's final determination classifies the drug as ineffective, the drug and those IRS to it can no longer be marketed and are subject to enforcement action.\n\n1. Products Subject to Ongoing DESI Proceedings\n\nSome unapproved marketed products are undergoing DESI reviews in which a final determination regarding efficacy has not yet been made. In addition to the products specifically reviewed by the NAS/NRC (i.e., those products approved for safety only between 1938 and 1962), this group includes unapproved products identical, related, or similar to those products specifically reviewed (see 21 CFR 310.6). In virtually all these proceedings, FDA has made an initial determination that the products lack substantial evidence of effectiveness, and the manufacturers have requested a hearing on that finding. It is the Agency's longstanding policy that products subject to an ongoing DESI proceeding may remain on the market during the pendency of the proceeding. See, e.g.,\n\nUpjohn Co. v. Finch, 303 F. Supp. 241, 256-61 (W.D. Mich. 1969).15\n\n2.\n\nProducts Subject to Completed DESI Proceedings\n\n15\n\nProducts first marketed after a hearing notice is issued with a different formulation than those covered by the notice are not considered subject to the DESI proceeding. Rather, they need approval prior to marketing. Under longstanding Agency policies, a firm holding an NDA on a product for which a DESI hearing is pending must submit a supplement prior to reformulating that product. The changed formulation may not be marketed as a related product under the pending DESI proceeding; it is a new drug, and it must be approved for safety and efficacy before it can be legally marketed. See, e.g., \"Prescription Drugs Offered for Relief of Symptoms of Cough, Cold, or Allergy\" (DESI 6514), 49 FR 153 (January 3, 1984) (Dimetane and Actifed); \"Certain Drugs Containing Antibiotic, Corticosteroid, and Antifungal Components\" (DESI 10826), 50 FR 15227 (April 17, 1985) (Mycolog). See also 21\n\nU.S.C. 356a(c)(2)(A). Similarly, firms without NDAs cannot market new formulations of a drug without first getting approval of an NDA.\n\n10 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nSome unapproved marketed products are subject to already-completed DESI proceedings and lack required approved applications. This includes a number of products IRS to DESI products for which approval was withdrawn due to a lack of substantial evidence of effectiveness. This group also includes a number of products IRS to those DESI products for which FDA made a final determination that the product is effective, but applications for the IRS products have not been both submitted and approved as required under the statute and longstanding enforcement policy (see 21 CFR 310.6). FDA considers all products described in this paragraph to be marketed illegally.\n\nC. Prescription Drug Wrap-Up\n\nAs mentioned above, many drugs came onto the market before 1962 without FDA approvals. Of these, many claimed to have been marketed prior to 1938 or to be IRS to such a drug. Drugs that did not have pre-1962 approvals and were not IRS to drugs with pre-1962 approvals were not subject to DESI. For a period of time, FDA did not take action against these drugs and did not take action against new unapproved drugs that were IRS to these pre-1962 drugs that entered the market without approval.\n\nBeginning in 1983, it was discovered that one drug that was IRS to a pre-1962 drug, a high potency Vitamin E intravenous injection named E-Ferol, was associated with adverse reactions in about 100 premature infants, 40 of whom died. In November of 1984, in response to this, a congressional oversight committee issued a report to FDA expressing the committee's concern regarding the thousands of unapproved drug products in the marketplace.\n\nIn response to the E-Ferol tragedy, CDER assessed the number of pre-1962 non-DESI marketed drug products. To address those drug products, the Agency significantly revised and expanded CPG section 440.100 to cover all marketed unapproved prescription drugs, not just DESI products. The program for addressing these marketed unapproved drugs and certain others like them became known as the Prescription Drug Wrap-Up. Most of the Prescription Drug Wrap-Up drugs first entered the market before 1938, at least in some form. For the most part, the Agency had evaluated neither the safety nor the effectiveness of the drugs in the Prescription Drug Wrap-Up.\n\nA drug that was subject to the Prescription Drug Wrap-Up is marketed illegally, unless the manufacturer of such a drug can establish that its drug is grandfathered or otherwise not a new drug.\n\nUnder the 1938 grandfather clause (see 21 U.S.C. 321(p)(1)), a drug product that was on the market prior to passage of the 1938 Act and which contained in its labeling the same representations concerning the conditions of use as it did prior to passage of that act was not considered a new drug and therefore was exempt from the requirement of having an approved new drug application.\n\nUnder the 1962 grandfather clause, the FD&C Act exempts a drug from the effectiveness requirements if its composition and labeling has not changed since 1962 and if, on the day before the 1962 Amendments became effective, it was (a) used or sold commercially in the United\n\n11\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nStates, (b) not a new drug as defined by the FD&C Act at that time, and (c) not covered by an effective application. See Public Law 87-781, section 107 (reprinted following 21 U.S.C.A. 321); see also\n\nUSV Pharmaceutical Corp. v. Weinberger, 412 U.S. 655, 662-66 (1973).\n\nThe two grandfather clauses in the FD&C Act have been construed very narrowly by the courts. FDA believes that there are very few drugs on the market that are actually entitled to grandfather status because the drugs currently on the market likely differ from the previous versions in some respect, such as formulation, dosage or strength, dosage form, route of administration, indications, or intended patient population. If a firm claims that its product is grandfathered, it is that firm's burden to prove that assertion. See 21 CFR 314.200(e)(5); see also\n\nAs mentioned above, the Agency believes it is not likely that any currently marketed prescription drug product is grandfathered or is otherwise not a\n\nnew drug. However, the Agency recognizes that it is at least theoretically possible. No part of this guidance, including the Appendix, is a finding as to the legal status of any particular drug product. In light of the strict standards governing exceptions to the approval process, it would be prudent for firms marketing unapproved products to carefully assess whether their products meet these standards.\n\nD. New Unapproved Drugs\n\nSome unapproved drugs were first marketed (or changed) after 1962. These drugs are on the market illegally. Some also may have already been the subject of a formal Agency finding that they are new drugs. See, e.g., 21 CFR 310.502 (discussing, among other things, controlled/timed release dosage forms).\n\nE. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drug Review\n\nAlthough OTC drugs were originally included in DESI, FDA eventually concluded that this was not an efficient use of resources. The Agency also was faced with resource challenges because it was receiving many applications for different OTC drugs for the same indications. Therefore, in 1972, the Agency implemented a process of reviewing OTC drugs through rulemaking by therapeutic classes (e.g., antacids, antiperspirants, cold remedies). This process involves convening an advisory panel for each therapeutic class to review data relating to claims and active ingredients. These panel reports are then published in the\n\nFederal Register, and after\n\n12\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFDA review, tentative final monographs for the classes of drugs are published. The final step is the publication of a final monograph for each class, which sets forth the allowable claims, labeling, and active ingredients for OTC drugs in each class (see, e.g., 21 CFR part 333). Drugs marketed in accordance with a final monograph are considered to be generally recognized as safe and effective (GRAS/GRAE) and do not require FDA approval of a marketing application.\n\nFinal monographs have been published for the majority of OTC drugs. Tentative final monographs are in place for virtually all categories of OTC drugs. FDA has also finalized a number of\n\nnegative monographs that list therapeutic categories (e.g., OTC daytime sedatives, 21 CFR 310.519) in which no OTC drugs can be marketed without approval. Finally, the Agency has promulgated a list of active ingredients that cannot be used in OTC drugs without approved applications because there are inadequate data to establish that they are GRAS/GRAE (e.g., phenolphthalein in stimulant laxative products, 21 CFR 310.545(a)(12)(iv)(B)).\n\nOTC drugs covered by ongoing OTC drug monograph proceedings may remain on the market as provided in current enforcement policies (see, e.g., CPG sections 450.200 and 450.300, and 21 CFR part 330). This document does not affect the current enforcement policies for such drugs.\n\nOTC drugs that need approval, either because their ingredients or claims are not within the scope of the OTC drug review or because they are not allowed under a final monograph or another final rule, are illegally marketed. For example, this group would include a product containing an ingredient determined to be ineffective for a particular indication or one that exceeds the dosage limit established in the monograph. Such products are new drugs that must be approved by FDA to be legally marketed.\n\nMy health has taken a nosedive since the artificial fluoridation of our water supply. The chemical used has never been tested for safety. It is an unrefined highly contaminated toxic industrial hazardous waste product which contains hydrofluorosilicic acid (not natural calcium fluoride) and a whole slew of other contaminants including arsenic, mercury, lead, radioactive particles etc. It is not good for anyone but in my case I am deathly allergic/sensitive to it.\n\nEven with our whole house and yard water fluoridation filter system there are water hazards everywhere. It is like living in a war zone filled with snipers, tossed grenades without warning and land mines everywhere I turn. I can't even take a walk safely in case sprinklers go off or a street sweeper truck goes past. I'm so severely allergic/sensitive to the fluoridation solution I even react to fluoridated water mist in the air--my sister (who suffers from the same problem) and I call the produce aisle in the supermarket \"The Aisle of Death\" because of the water misters : (\n\nI was told by one doctor that I needed a colonoscopyso I was referred to the appropriate specialist. He was a doctor I had never seen before but he took my concerns and severely adverse medical history concerning fluoride seriously. Most general anesthesia drugs and several sedatives (e.g.Versed) arefluorinated drugs. He seemed to be unaware that Versed for example was fluorinated until I told him.\n\nResearching colonoscopies in advance of my consultation appointment I learned that even some drugs used for it that aren't fluorinated are sometimes dissolved in a fluorinated solution so BEWARE!!! Because so many drugs--especially fluorinated drugs are dangerous to me it was deemed--and I agreed--needlessly risky to have a colonoscopsy because of the drugs used and risk of medication error when we could try a barium enema with air first since it is done without drugs. Then we could see if everything was okay and if it wasn't then I would need to have the colonoscopsy.\n\nI asked the doctor if there was fluoride in the barium enema or if there was any tap water involved in the procedure and he said no there wasn't. I asked if he was sure there wasn't and he said he was sure. I was offered my choice between the colonoscopsy and the barium enema with air and opted for the barium since I had previously had an upper GI with barium and didn't have a problem with barium.\n\nBefore I left home this morning for the test my sister and I had prayed for my safety--good thing we did.\n\nAt the hospital there is a big water fountain near the front door so I had to take a longer way in since I could not walk past the fountain because of the water mist in the air from it. So far so good.\n\nI went in the exam room and the technician was wiping down the table but I saw he was using some sort of commercially prepared wipe from a pop up container and not a tap water dampened sponge. Oh my was I glad to see that since even the slightest dampness from tap water even on my skin causes a serious systemic reaction. Because he was busy cleaning up after the last patient I had time to chat with him instead of my test being done immediately.\n\nI told him I was glad he wasn't using tap water on the table because I was violently and deathly allergic/sensitive to it because it was fluoridated and that I couldn't even be touched with hands that were the slightest bit damp from tap water--I react systemically from even tiny dermal exposures. He said that was okay since he used gloves so no tap water damp hands would touch me and he asked if I was allergic to latex. We both found the irony mildly amusing that I couldn't have tap water even touch me--something he had never heard of before and yet I had no problem with latex which is a dangerous allergen for many people--and we laughed a little about it.\n\nSince my doctor told me no tap water was involved I felt safe but just to be sure I asked if there was tap water in the enema. The technician said no--they used a barium solution instead and that they didn't use tap water. As he started to get the supplies together for my test I told him I was very glad I wouldn't have to worry because I could not be exposed to the tap water.\n\nBut then to my horror I saw him reach for the water faucet--It turns out that they mix the barium solution with warm tap water : ( !!! For some reason he did not comprehend that mixing the fluoridated tap water into the barium solution was as dangerous to me as using plain tap water. If I hadn't been so noisy and \"paranoid\" from previous medical errors that would have literally been the end of me.\n\nYou can bet that they would have tried to blame my death on an allergic reaction to the barium or to the latex instead of the tap water but it is in my chart that I tolerate both of those but not fluoridated tap water. There would have been a big legal battle but the truth would have come out.\n\nHe said that the barium used for the lower GI is too thick to be used as is and has to be watered down. They mix the tap water and barium solution together in the enema bag. I asked if there was any bottled water he could use but he said no because they always use warm tap water. I said if only I had known I would have brought my own bottled water to use. I had a small bottle of safe water in the car but it wouldn't be enough. He devised a way to thin the lower GI barium with the barium used for upper GI's which is thinner.\n\nI asked if he was positive no tap water had been added to either bottle and he said yes. However I was so scared of another potential error I asked if I could taste some of the barium since I can actually taste the slightest trace of the tap water fluoridation solution due to my severe sensitivity to it. (I am the worst fluoride allergy/sensitivity case my allergist has ever seen and she has seen a lot of them).\n\nTasting it--even the tiniest amount--was very risky for me in case there was tap water in it but it was safer than what they were going to do to me if it was contaminated with tap water. Thankfully it was okay--I could tell that no tap water had been added to the bottles--so they were able to proceed with the test.\n\nI really dodged a bullet today. If they had put the barium mixed with tap water solution directly inside me that would have been it--and my death would have been a truly terrible one. I really don't care at this point if I do drop dead--there is only so much a person can take--but I am worried about my family so I have tried to take precautions to stay alive for their sake but it is getting to the point where it is useless. You can only struggle so long against odds that keep getting worse and worse.\n\nFor those of you with fluoride allergy/sensitivity or allergy/sensitivity to any other drugs or substances heed my cautionary tale. Doctors and technicians are often wrong about substances administered. Even pharmacists can be wrong--one told me the antibiotic Cypro did not contain fluoride but it does as I learned the hard way after taking one. Check out every procedure in advance to the slightest detail including anything the active drug may be mixed with--solid, liquid, powder, gas-- that may not be classified as a drug per say. Do not overlook the fact that often drugs are mixed with carrying agents/solutions etc.\n\nDo not take anything for granted. Do not assume that because you have told the doctor and even written it in your patient questioner that you are allergic/sensitive to something that he or she won't give it to you anyway. My father was a doctor and warned us about how common this is with doctors.\n\nMy mother was permanently damaged and got Parkinson's from a drug the doctor gave her after I warned him she was severely allergic/sensitive to it and had even told him to write it in big red letters on her chart to avoid any mistakes. Of course he made the mistake of giving it to her anyway.\n\nOr for instance many of you will remember the time I had a simple breast biopsy and warned the doctor about my severe allergies/sensitivities and yet she put a stainless steel clip inside me to mark the lump. She was positive it was a titanium clip--she did not read the package. Unfortunately I am seriously allergic to nickel which is one of the metals in stainless steel. What a disaster that turned out to be : (\n\nThese sorts of medical errors are a common everyday occurrence--but tragically the consequences to the unfortunate patient can be serious and even deadly.\n\nFeel free to forward this to others too--it may very well save a life.\n\nBelleville resident, council join debate on fluoride safety\n\nLong after they were outlawed by the Food and Drug Administration, fluoride tablets may still be making their way onto drug store shelves and pediatricians' offices.\n\nAccording to documents provided to the Belleville Times by township resident Mike Perrone, fluoride tablets and fluoride drops for infants were introduced to the marketplace in the late 1950s without prior FDA approval. The FDA ultimately sent out regulatory letters in 1975 to no less than 35 fluoride tablet drug manufacturers, which stated that their tablets/drops were in violation of the federal Food and Drug Act, along with a request that they be removed from the marketplace. Some, but not all, of the 35 companies supposedly have complied with the FDA's request.\n\nClinical trials conducted in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s were said to have been illegal, because no related toxicology studies had also been conducted. It was also determined that using fluoride tablets did not prevent tooth decay, but rather stained and mottled tooth enamel in a process known as dental fluorosis.\n\nA strong link between osteosarcoma, or bone cancer, and fluoridated water was also determined in the 1990s in studies made by the New Jersey Department of Health through the involvement of Assemblyman John V. Kelly. Perrone said that Kelly assigned him the task of gathering information on the safety and effectiveness of fluoride tablets and drops, and Perrone subsequently consulted with agencies including the American Dental Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the National Institute of Dental Research. It was later found that those agencies and others had not conducted any studies on the safety of fluoride tablets and drops, had no scientific references for any such studies, and that the FDA had never approved any of their drugs.\n\nThe issue of fluoride in municipal water was recently brought up at a Belleville Township council meeting last month. As part of its consent agenda on Feb. 14, the council passed a resolution opposing Assembly Bill 3709, which was approved on Feb. 9 and mandates fluoridation of municipal water supplies. According to the council's resolution, fluoride has been identified at both the state and federal levels as a drinking water contaminant.\n\nLongtime Belleville resident David Harris asked why the council was against the bill, and Third Ward Councilman Vincent Cozzarelli replied that he had come across reports that stated that the total amount of fluoride deposited in water could not be measured.\n\n\"It's no different than other states,\" said Cozzarelli, in regards to tooth decay and its prevention, and he didn't see a reason why fluoride should be added to New Jersey municipal water.\n\nTownship Manager Victor Canning, who is leaving Belleville after almost six years on the job to take a similar position in Montville, said at that meeting that the fluoride additive would actually be hydrofluorosilicic acid, which was considered hazardous by the Center for Disease Control. The council resolution also stated that hydrofluorosilicic acid was listed as an extremely hazardous chemical by both the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.\n\nCanning also said that there was no correlation between water fluoridation and healthy teeth, while Deputy Mayor Steven Rovell added that no other country fluoridated its water.\n\nTwo studies were conducted to explore the effects of twice daily topical applications of NaF, SnF 2, and an amine fluoride at equivalent fluoride concentrations (0.1%) upon plaque and gingivitis in the dog. Although some trends toward modest benefits were noted in certain instances, none of the agents exerted a significant effect upon either parameter\n\nThere have been numberous of studies evaluated the effects of various topical fluorides on gingivitis in children. J.J. Murray in 1969 investigate the prevalence of gingivitis in 15 year old children from high fluoride (1.5 to 2 ppm) and low fluoride (0.2 ppm) areas. He reported that up to the level of 2 ppm, fluoride in drinking water has no influence on prevalence of gingivitis, on its extent or on the relative distribution of gingivitis in individual labial papillae and the margins associated with anterior teeth in 15 year old children. This study was in agreement with James et al. in 1960 who reported that there was no significant increase in incidence and severity of gingivitis in children living in the high fluoride areas. On the contrary, Ast and Schlesinger in 1954 measured gingivitis in children aged 6-9 years from the fluoride city of Newburgh (1-1.2 ppm F) and the control city of Kingston (F= .1ppm) and concluded that a slight but significantly more gingivitis was observed amongst Kingston children than among those in Newburgh. Russell in 1957 carried out a similar study involving school children of 7-14 yrs old and found that proportions of children free form overt signs of periodontal disease (including gingivitis) were higher throughout the age range in children of high fluoride city than the low fluoride city. It is rather difficult to assess whether the lower prevalence of gingivitis observed in children from fluoride areas is directly or indirectly associated with the F content of drinking water. One theory would be since application of fluoride involved involved mainly tooth brushing, the effect of gingival inflammation may well be a result of mechanical oral hygiene effort. Fluoride treatment, nevertheless, have not been shown to have significant effect on periodontal surgical healing in animal. Fluoride actually causes healing time to increase (delay wound healing). Another area of application of fluoride is hypersensitivity teeth. The use of sodium fluoride has been reported in many studies as an effective agent in treatment dentinal hypersensitivity (Stout et al. in 1955, Hoyt et al. in 1943).\n\nA large number of studies reported no detrimental effects of fluorides on periodontal tissue. Side effect included staining, mild blanching of the gingiva when high concentration of SnF2 were applied topically (only on 5% of subjects), sloughing of gingival tissue of children within an hour of topical application of APF. This effect was related to the presence of inflammation, the more inflammation, the more sloughing. Crevicular epithelium was more susceptible to sloughing than the papillary gingiva. Branemark studied the effect of commonly used topical fluoride solutions on intact connective tissue, damaged connective tissue, and epithelium in hamster, rabbits, and humans. Changes noted varied with concentration of NaF and went from slight and reversible trauma to definite destruction of tissue cells leading to necrosis and subsequent proliferative reparative phenomena. Prolonged contact with fluoride solution may aggravate the existing chronic inflammation. Finally, titanium does not withstand certain acidic fluoride prophylactic agents. The use of fluoride near the implant restoration should be avoided. Lothar Probster et al. in 1992 examined the use of sodium fluoride gel, amino-fluoride gel, sodium fluoride solution, aminofluoride solution, and sodium fluoride lacquer. Drops of 4mm in diameter were placed on the polished titanium surfaces. Surface roughness was investigated with profilometer and SEM. They also placed and IMZ implant and its transmucosal abutment in Oral B fluor gel for 24 hours. The results showed significant increase of surface roughness in acidulated fluoride agent. Scannic electron microscope illustrated the corrosive effect of the acidic agent. The implant and abutment which was stored for 24 hours in Oral B gel showed massive corrosion and the effect is compatible to the cast titanium used in the study. Acidic fluoride agents should not be used in patients with titanium implants or restoration.\n\nGingivitis in 15-year-old children from high-fluoride and low-fluoride areas\n\nEvidence concerning the influence of fluoride drinking water on gingivitis is inconsistent. In order to determine whether fluoride in drinking water up to the level of 2 ppm has any effect on the prevalence, extent or pattern of gingivitis in anterior labial units, the gingival health of 386 15-year-old children, continuously resident in West Hartlepool, a high fluoride area (1.5–2.00 ppm F), was compared with that of 38115-year-old children from York, a low fluoride area (0.2 ppm F).\n\nThe method of measurement was that described by Jackson (1965).\n\nIt was concluded that fluoride in drinking water, at least up to the level of 2 ppm, has no influence of clinical significance on the prevalence of gingivitis, on the extent, or on the pattern of gingivitis in individual papillae and margins associated with incisor and canine teeth in 15-year-old-children.\n\nIn both communities prevalence of gingivitis was higher in boys than in girls. However, when only those children with a good standard of oral cleanliness were considered this sex difference disappeared, suggesting that the observed sex difference could be due to differences in the standards of oral cleanliness between boys and girls.\n\nA distinctive pattern of gingivitis in papillae and margins associated with anterior teeth was observed in all four groups studied, and this pattern was essentially the same as that observed independently by Jackson (1965) and Sutcliffe (1968), suggesting that this pattern is universally true.\n\nGingivitis and gingival recession in adults from high-fluoride and low-fluoride areas\n\nThe prevalence of gingivitis and gingival recession in 1884 dentate adults, aged 15–65 yr, continuously resident in the natural fluoride area of Hartlepool (1.5–2.0 ppm F.) was compared with that in 2015 dentate adults from the low-fluoride town of York (0.15–0.28 ppm F.).\n\nThe measurement of gingivitis was restricted to the anterior labial gingival sites, after the method described by Jackson (1965). The prevalence of gingivitis did not vary with increasing age. Therefore, data for all age groups were combined. Eighty nine per cent in Hartlepool and 87 per cent in York had one or more gingival sites inflamed. In both communities, the slightly higher prevalence of gingivitis in males than in females disappeared when only those with good oral cleanliness were considered. In Hartlepool, the site prevalence of gingivitis was 37.2 per cent and in York 35.4 per cent. In those with good oral cleanliness, the site prevalence of gingivitis was 21.8 per cent in Hartlepool and 19.8 per cent in York. The maximum divergence between the two communities was 0.4 gingival units.\n\nNo sex difference in the prevalence of gingival recession was observed in either community. Therefore, data for males and females were combined. In Hartlepool at 15–19 yr of age, 3.0 per cent were affected by gingival recession; at 60–65 yr, virtually 100 per cent were affected. The trend with age in York followed exactly the same pattern as that observed in Hartlepool. The percentage of teeth with gingival recession also increased steadily with age. In Hartlepool at 15–19 yr of age, 0.2 per cent of teeth had gingival recession. At 60–65 yr, 66.7 per cent of teeth were affected. The corresponding values in York were 0.2 per cent and 63.8 per cent. No significant differences were observed between Hartlepool and York data.\n\nIt was concluded that fluoride in drinking water, at least up to the level of 2 ppm, has no effect of clinical significance on the prevalence of gingivitis or gingival recession in adults.\n\nGingivitis and periodontal disease are the oral diseases requiring most urgent intervention. Over 90% of the U.S. population over 13 is affected. Strong links have been made to heart disease and low birth weight and infant mortality. For heart disease the association with gingivitis is stronger than the one for smoking or high cholesterol. As heart disease is the #1 killer in the US, many efforts are undertaken to reduce this alarming figure. In Canada large pictures of a diseased heart are placed on cigarette packs alerting to the fact that smoking causes heart disease.\n\nIt is of great importance that warning labels and pictures of periodontal disease, oral cancer, diseased hearts, pituitary and thyroid glands, as well as Alzheimer's brains - just to name a few - are placed on all oral care products containing fluoride.\n\nWhy?\n\nA patent by the pharmaceutical company Sepracor discloses that concentrations of fluorides from fluoridated toothpastes and mouthwashes activate G proteins in the oral cavity, thereby promoting gingivitis and periodontitis, as well as oral cancer. Incomprehensibly, this vital information is being withheld from the public by all parties involved, including the company, at least two well-known Universities, and numerous oral disease experts. This includes a much-decorated ADA scientist who was involved in setting the CDC recommendations for fluoride intake in children, served as head of a Food and Drug Administration subcommittee that decides which dental products to make available to the public, and who chaired the panel on safe use of fluoride for the Centers for Disease Control (CDC, 2001).\n\nAn extensive section of this Newsletter deals with biochemical aspects [Part 4].\n\nMany of our children have experienced oral diseases which miraculously disappeared when fluoride intake was curtailed. For example, some had consistent \"white spots\" on their gums which vanished upon elimination of fluoridated toothpaste, but returned as soon as such toothpaste was used again.\n\nSome of these white spots and patches were diagnosed as pre-cursors to oral cancer (squamous cell carcinomas), while others were deemed to be \"allergic reactions\" by medical professionals. Yet other doctors identified oral yeast infections (Candidiasis).\n\nWhen we investigated the scientific literature on fluoride toxicity we found that such oral conditions have been related to fluoride intake countless times. There is extensive evidence of such disease in humans from areas with water fluoridation, from toothpaste and mouthrinse use, as well as in workers exposed to fluorides.[See:Part 3]\n\nStudies in workers exposed to fluoride have shown that the severity of periodontal disease is directly correlated to the fluoride levels in systemic fluids(i.e. Domazalska, 1972). The more fluoride in the system - the more severe the periodontal disease. The same findings have been made for Asthma.\n\nTHE PATENT\n\nIn 1996 three biochemists (Aberg, Jerussi & McCullough, 1998), working for the pharmaceutical company Sepracor, speculated on fluoride implications in periodontal disease. Realizing that fluorides activate G proteins, they reasoned that fluorides would also be involved in the activation of those G proteins which regulate the pathways involved in gingivitis and periodontitis - and they decided to test for the ability of fluoride to activate two integral receptors involved in periodontal disease - the prostaglandin E2 receptor (PGE2) and the thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor. Both are coupled to G proteins called G q/11.\n\nThe scientists conducted a test with sodium fluoride based on a well-established in-vitro protocol model involving HL-60 cells. These are Human Leukemia cells often used in biochemistry investigations, as one can observe fundamental and critical signals involved in the activation of the body's immune system - because of the cells' ability to respond to foreign organisms.\n\nThe authors reported:\n\n\"We found that fluoride, in the concentration range in which it is used for the prevention of dental caries, stimulates production of prostaglandins and thereby excaberates the inflammatory response in gingivitis and periodontitis.... Thus, the inclusion of fluoride in toothpastes and mouthwashes for the purpose of inhibiting the development of caries may, at the same time, accelerate the process of chronic, destructive periodontitis.\"\n\nA very important finding as it relates to public health!\n\nIn the 1986 National Institute of Health (NIH) survey, 93% of adults indicated that their children used toothpaste with fluoride, obviously putting all at risk. Gingivitis and periodontal disease constitute THE major public oral health problems in the US.\n\nThe patent findings supply the biochemical explanation for earlier reports by many researchers who had found increased gingivitis and gum inflammation due to fluoridated water, or other sources of fluoride.\n\nEven T. Dean himself - the so-called \"Father of Fluoridation\", made such observations.[see: Part 3]\n\nHowever, instead of alerting the public health officials to their findings, those men apparently decided to take another avenue.\n\nThey went looking for an agent which would counteract the adverse effects of fluoride and therefore could be used together WITH fluoride. After all, fluoride was/is the \"proven caries fighter\"!\n\nThey chose a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID) called ketoprofin, conducted more studies to see if ketoprofin was efficient in off-setting the damaging fluoride effects, and then filed a patent on their new concoction now containing both fluorideand ketoprofin (Aberg et al, 1998).\n\nSubsequently, a study was instigated at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine (funded by Sepracor), documenting the `wonderful' effects of ketoprofin upon gingivitis. The first study on beagles included one of the three co-inventors (McCullough) together with two Assistant Professors from two separate well-respected Universities, and was subsequently published in the Journal of Clinical Periodontology in 1997 (Paquette et al, 1997).\n\nIn the study not one word is mentioned about fluoride being a causative/promoting agent of gingivitis, as stated in the patent claims.\n\nAnother study - this time on rats, and again as a direct result of the patent research - was conducted involving yet another of the three co-inventors from Sepracor(Jerussi).\n\nThis time the study was done with two professionals from the University of Rochester, one being Prof. Bowen, the much-adorned and decorated ADA scientist involved in setting the 2001 CDC recommendations on fluoride intake.\n\nResults of this study were published recently in the Journal of Oral Diseases (Bowen et al, 2000)Full Text\n\nAgain, not one single word about fluoride promoting and causing gingivitis appears in the entire text.\n\nGINGIVITIS - Statistics\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR; Brown et al, 1996), over 90% of persons 13 years or older experience some form of periodontal disease.\n\n74.9 % of all people between 35 and 44 years suffer from periodontal disease (Fig.4.7, Oral Health Report, 2000). 29% of males and 15 % of females between 35 and 44 years old have destructive periodontal disease (Healthy People 2010-Conference Edition).\n\n60% of all people between 18 and 44 suffer from periodontal disease (Figure 4.8, OHR).\n\nCompared to these figures - up to 46% of adults over 18 years old have untreated caries (Figure 4.5, OHR).\n\nNot surprisingly, periodontal disease has recently become the primary focus for dental researchers because of the very strong links which have been made to other conditions such as heart disease (Loesche 1994, 1998; Herzberg and Meyer 1996), as well as infants with low birth weight and premature births. For heart disease the association is stronger than for smoking (Loesche et al, 1998).\n\nThe NID(C)R, in their 1999 appeal to the Appropriation Committee for $276,518,000 in funding, stated that gum disease is now also known as a high risk factor for low birth weight babies. Said Crawford in his plea for the big money:\n\n\"Care of low birth weight babies costs the nation approximately $5 billion dollars each year. If we can lower the incidence of low birth weight babies by treating gum disease it will mean that 1:10 babies born in the US have a better chance of a healthy start in life.\"\n\nFurther, he reasoned:\n\n\"As we come to the end of this, century, 50% of heart attacks (the number one cause of death in the Western World) and 25% of low birth weight babies have no aditional risk factors associated with them. We now have strong evidence that gum disease is a risk factor for both these conditions - in fact - as strong a risk factor for heart disease as elevated cholesterol or smoking!\"(Crawford, 1999)\n\nThis clearly means that fluorides - by promoting gingivitis - also contribute to heart disease and low birth weight. Heart disease has long been known to be higher in workers exposed to fluorides, or caused by fluorides in medications (PFPC, 2001). Biochemical investigations have identified the pathways.\n\nThe patent findings implicating the fluoride \"topical\" activation of G proteins in the oral cavity have many far-reaching and serious implications - not only for periodontal disease, but also for oral cancers - which involve \"mutated\" G proteins, and which are activated by fluoride, often even \"preferring\" fluoride activation.[see Part 4: Biochemistry]\n\nORAL CANCER - Statistics\n\nOral cancer is the sixth most frequent cancer in the world (Buffalo Sisters Hospital, 2000).\n\nOral cancer claims the life of one American every hour. Over thirty thousand Americans are diagnosed with oral or pharyngeal (throat) cancer every year and 8,000 people die annually from these cancers. Only half survive more than five years. This overall 5-year survival rate (52 percent) has not changed in the past five decades - coincident with the appearance of fluoride as a `preventive treatment' for caries.\n\nBlack people have higher incidence and mortality rates than other subgroups (OHR, 2000; Caplan et al. 1993; NIH Press Release, 1996), as they do with most thyroid hormone-related disorders, including, of course, \"dental fluorosis\" (PFPC, 2000).\n\n\"White Patches\" - Cancer\n\nAs was mentioned in the INTRO, many of our kids have had these \"white patches\" in the mouth, often diagnosed as \"precursors\" for an `oral squamous carcinoma'.\n\nA benign squamous papilloma is the obligate precursor of squamous cell carcinoma, and again, numerous laboratory investigations have shown that these are brought about by fluoride. Mere ras oncogene activation is sufficient to produce the papilloma phenotype in skin cancers, and fluoride is known to act additively with the ras oncogene in producing this papilloma (Camp & Hoffman, 1993). (-> Cancer promotion).\n\n[see Part 4: Biochemistry]\n\nPart 2\n\nFLUORIDATION AND ORAL CANCER\n\nIn 1981 Dr. John Yiamouyiannis and Dean Burk, chief chemist emeritus of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), first showed very convincingly that there was an increase in oral cancer in fluoridated areas.\n\nAn investigation done by the Battelle Institute on behalf of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) (NTP, 1991; also see: Yiamouyiannis, 1993) showed a clear dose-response relationship between oral cancers and fluoride intake in the animals tested.\n\nAccording to the late Yiamouyiannis, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) - in response to the NTP findings - decided to examine the incidence of oral cancer in fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas. The resulting data showed at least a 33% to 50% increase in the incidence of oral cancers in fluoridated areas, indicating at least an additional 5000 - 7500 or more cases or oral and pharyngeal cancer per year as a result of fluoridation alone (Yiamouyiannis, 1993).\n\nAn increase in oral carcinomas and their precursors has also been observed in workers exposed to fluorides.[see next section]\n\nPart 3\n\nBRIEF LITERATURE REVIEW - EVIDENCE (Compiled by Wendy Small)\n\nGingivitis and oral diseases due to fluoride excess have been reported many times in the world literature.\n\nIn 1936 Dean - the \"father of fluoridation\" himself - wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association:\n\n\"From observations that I made in areas of relatively high fluoride concentration (more than 4 parts per million of fluorine) there is sufficient evidence to suggest that there is an apparent tendency toward a higher incidence of gingivitis.\"\n\nRemember, at that time water with fluoride at 4ppm was thought to produce a total intake of 4 mg/day. In 1991 the US PHS estimated that TOTAL intake exceeded 6.5 mg/day in U.S. cities having one part per million (1ppm) of fluoride in their water supply!\n\nIn 1953 Leo Spira had identified gingivitis and bleeding gums as signs of chronic fluoride poisoning. In 1957 Ramseyer observed gingivitis in older rats drinking water fluoridated at 1 ppm. By 1982 Domazalska observed a direct correlation between the severity of periodontal disease and fluoride levels in systemic fluids.\n\n==========================================\n\nFrom around the world...\n\n\"Most children in both urban and rural areas had gingivitis...Children who brush their teeth every day were 88.5% in urban and 72.8% in rural areas and most of them used fluoride tooth paste.\"\n\n\"Fluorosis was endemic...Periodontal disease was moderate at 15 yr of age, but seemed to be a predisposing factor in caries from the late teens onward. ... More than half of persons in the 55-64 yr age group required full maxillary and mandibular dentures while 10% already possessed them.\"\n\n\"....We are more prone to caries...The incidence of dental fluorosis is on the rise in Bathinda. Experts reveal that the disease is commonplace due to fluoride contamination in the ground water of the region. Studies indicate that nearly 90 per cent of the population ...is suffering from dental caries and chronic gingivitis, which often leads to pyorrhoea [periodontitis]...\"\n\n\"There were some controversies in the results of fluoridation studies with one study reporting as high as 47.2% of the children to be afflicted with enamel fluorosis.... 93% of the 12-yr-olds had bleeding, 98% had calculus and 15% had shallow pockets, with 100% of the children needing prophylaxis.\"\n\n\"The article deals with the problem of relation of the incidence and prevalence of various parodontal diseases in subjects with various degrees of fluoride intake to the content of this element in various systemic fluids. ...A correlation was observed between the parodontopathy index of Kotzschke and F levels in the systemic fluids calculated by means of the correlation coefficient of Pearson.\"\n\nDomazalska W - \"Incidence of periodontal diseases in subjects with various degree of exposure to fluorides\" Czas Stomatol 25(10):1005-1011 (1972)\n\n====================================\n\n\"Stomatological and mycological examinations of the workers [exposed to fluorides]at the fusion department of the RZWM \"Silesia\" showed a considerable intensification of paradontium diseases (about 80% of cases). Leukoplakia [pre-cancerous growth] and candidiasis were the most common changes found on the mucous membrane in the oral cavity. Mycological investigations carried out on the Sabourand culture showed Candida albicans in 73.7% of cases.\"\n\n\"Five expressions of dental fluorosis are described in cattle exposed to industrial fluoride pollution: 1. Hypercementosis with tooth ankylosis, cementum necrosis and cyst formation; 2. Delayed eruption of permanent incisor teeth; 3 Necrosis of alveolar bone with recession of bone and gingiva; 4. Oblique eruption of permanent teeth, hypoplasia of teeth with diastemata; and 5. Rapid progression of dental lesions. The five entities are not recognized in the \"standard for the classification of dental fluorosis\" by the National Academy of Sciences. Since this classification it too limited and superficial, adherence to this standard has left severe cases of fluoride intoxication in cattle undetected in field surveys.\"\n\n\"OBJECTIVES: Numerous studies have revealed that conventional glass-ionomer cements might release fluoride into an aqueous environment. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of fluoride on human pulp cells in vitro. STUDY DESIGN: H33258 fluorescence, cell proliferation, protein synthesis, and mitochondrial activity assay were used to investigate the pathobiological effects of fluoride on cultured human pulp cells. RESULTS: Fluoride was found to be a cytotoxic agent to cultured human pulp cells by inhibiting cell growth, proliferation, mitochondrial activity, and protein synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Fluoride release has significant potential for pulpal toxicity.\"\n\nAs we have stated many times in the past, fluoride is known as the \"universal G protein activator\" in biochemistry, meaning it can activate all G protein families. The only known receptor which is capable of doing the same, in the human organism, is the receptor for the thyroid-stimulating-hormone (TSH) (Gudermann et al, 1997).\n\nThis complex and multifunctional actvity of TSH is the reason why so many different diseases are associated with thyroid hormone dysfunction. It is also the reason why the same associations have been made in fluoride poisoning - fluoride being a TSH clone.\n\nWhile for many years it was presumed that the TSH receptor was only expressed in the thyroid gland itself, TSH receptors have now been detected in liver, gastrointestinal tract (Duntas et al, 1998), orbital tissue and dermal fibroblasts (Paschke et al, 1994), peripheral lymphocytes, fat, cardiac muscle (Drvota et al, 1995), thymus, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, osteoblasts and osteosarcoma cells (Inoue et al, 1998), or the brain - where it is overexpressed in patients with Down Syndrome or Alzheimer's Disease (Labudova et al, 1999).\n\nIn order for us to understand fluoride poisoning better, we have concentrated on the matter of Gq/11, as this is what TSH does - at elevated levels it activates the Gq/11-mediated pathways.\n\nWhat are G q/11 proteins?\n\nG q/11 proteins are membrane-associated proteins involved in signal transduction - the way cells communicate with each other.\n\nGq/11 are coupled to receptors which cross the cell membrane seven times (\"transmembrane receptors\"). Gq/11 proteins are located in the membrane of a cell.\n\nUpon receptor activation, they may send information directly from the membrane to the cell's nucleus. Consider them an essential \"relay station\" for cell information, the initiators of other cascades of events. One such cascade involves the mitogen-activated-protein-kinase (MAPK). MAPKs are regarded as \"switch\" kinases in the phosphorylation cascade.\n\nGq/11 may be released directly from the plasma membrane to an intracellular location in response to activation by aluminofluoride complexes [AlF(x)], directly translocating immunoreactivity (i.e. Arthur et al, 1999).\n\nFluoride not only directly augments the already existing hormonal (TSH) activation of Gq/11, it may activate such proteins even in the absence of TSH. [Without TSH, G proteins involved in thyroid hormone regulation are thought to be inactive (Utiger, 1995).]\n\nG q/11 Diseases\n\nGq/11-regulated pathways have profound effects not only on the pathology of gum disease, but of chronic inflammation overall, as well as cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer's Disease, Autism, etc. - in short - all those conditions which represent the most significant health care problems in the developed world today. We have come to describe this as the \"G q/11 disease\".\n\nFor example, in heart disease - which kills 725,192 people a year in the U.S. alone, making it the #1 cause of death (CDC, 2002) - it is G q/11 over-expression which leads to enlargement of the heart, in turn leading to congestive heart failure. Therefore recent pharmacological research has focused on creating so-called \"decoys\" for G q/11 - non-working versions of Gq to prevent the activation and reception of molecular signals that normally would produce such enlargement of the heart (Akhter et al, 1998; Adams et al, 2001).\n\nNeedless to say, G q/11 are also involved in dental pulp and enamel formation and are also involved in the condition known as \"dental fluorosis\" (enamel hypoplasia) (Pozo et al, 2000; Bawden et al, 1996). Gq/11 have been unequivocally established to be the transducing G proteins for all Ca(2+)-mobilizing receptors (i.e. Exton,1993).\n\nIn Alzheimer's and Down Syndrome patients Gq/11 is elevated in the brain regions. Virtually all Down Syndrome patients suffer from Alzheimer's in their 40's.\n\n[NOTE: It is no coincidence that up to 90% of villagers around the NALCO aluminum smelter in Angul, India are experiencing \"senility\" before the age of 50 (Hindustan Times, Aug. 15, 1999). In fact, Indian parliamentary discussions disclose that, out of 14,000+ fluoride-poisoned villagers in the area, 5,000 are suffering from Alzheimer's Disease (Lok Sabha Debates, 1999).]\n\nFluorides are most-established Gq/11 activators, ensuring a firm and most-important rogue role for fluorides in all of the above diseases. Both inorganic and organic fluoride compounds may activate G q/11. It is a matter of degree in the amplification of the F- signal.\n\nAs fluoride mimics TSH, we usually check on Down Syndrome first - as all DS patients have shown to have higher TSH levels, they will often show us what fluoride poisoning does. As TSH activates G q/11 - to which PGE2 and TXA 2 are coupled - similar oral conditions should be observable in DS. Needless to say, DS patients also have a high degree of periodontal disease (Decoq, 1995;Wilkins, 1994; Ulseth et al, 1991; Barnett et al, 1986).\n\nBiochemical research in the \"search for cancer\" conducted during the last few decades has firmly established the involvement of mutated G proteins in the pathogenesis of cancer, including oral cancer (Das et al, 2000; Yoo et al, 2000).\n\nOne such well-known mutated G protein is the \"ras\" oncogene.\n\nThese ras oncogenes were first found in human bladder cancer cells, and have now been identified further in pancreas, breast, prostate, thyroid, lung, and uterine cancers, myeloid leukeamias, etc. as well as skin and oral cancers.\n\nAmong the cancers which most often include mutated ras genes are adenocarcinomas of the pancreas (90%) (Almoguera et al., 1988), adenocarcinomas of the colon and cancers of the thyroid (50%), as well as carcinomas of the lung and myeloid leukeamias (Bos,1989).\n\nDuring the last 10 years frantic research has been conducted by the pharmaceutical companies directed at finding agents to counteract ras activity.\n\nIn efforts to define the very pathways of ras in cancers - so that treatments can be developed - biochemists have used sodium fluoride or aluminum fluoride extensively in the past, at many different levels, and under various conditions.\n\nThis is because fluoride can substitute directly for the ras oncogene, and at levels even below those seen in the Sepracor patent investigations, especially when combined with aluminum.\n\nAlthough the \"patent\" scientists cite a paper by Kawase et al (1991) which documents the potentiating power of the mere trace amounts of aluminum upon sodium fluoride activation on prostaglandin receptors - in their own calculation with sodium fluoride they fail to account for this important fact. Potentiating effects of aluminum might well exceed 500%, making the fluoride concentrations required for prostaglandin activation much lower than those observed in the patent (see: Imai et al., 1996; Turinsky et al, 1992; Kawase et al, 1989).\n\nAlready in 1989 Kawase et al had shown in HL-60 cells - the cells used in the patent investigation - that in the presence of mere trace amounts of aluminum, NaF concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1 mM increased PGE2 synthesis in a dose-dependent manner, whereas NaF alone at lower concentrations (below 0.1 mM) did not show such a significant effect.\n\nFurther, when Kawase investigated HL-60 cells treated with sodium fluoride only, he had many more additional findings to report: not only did sodium fluoride increase prostaglandin E2 production, but NaF- produced marked changes in cellular morphology, increased cellular adhesion to plastic, reduced the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, increased cellular expression of chloroacetate esterase, and stimulated production of interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), IL-6, and the tumor necrosis factors (Kawase, 1989).\n\n\"White Spots\" - Candidiasis\n\nAs mentioned above, the \"white spots\" in the mouths of our kids were also frequently attributed to candidiasis (yeast infection) by medical professionals.\n\nCandidiasis is an infection of the moist cutaneous areas of the body, and is generally caused by the fungus Candida albicans. It involves the skin, oral mucous membranes, respiratory tract and vagina.\n\nIn workers exposed to fluorides, Candida albicans was seen in 73.7% of cases. 80% of the cases showed a considerable intensification of periodonatal diseases. Leukoplakia [pre-cancerous growth] and candidiasis were the most common changes found (Ilewicz et al, 1982).\n\nOther studies on workers have since confirmed those findings (Borysewicz-Lewicka, 1983; Sroczynski et al, 1991). Case reports on candidiasis caused by fluoride mouthrinse are also known (i.e. Axell & Edwarsson, 1978). [see:Part 3]\n\nIn women with general periodontitis all hormonal systems were shown to be excessively shifted (Puzin et al, 1996).\n\nWendy Small compiled the following \"anecdotal evidence\" from past newsgroup/e-mail postings:\n\n1) \"The pockets around my gums started getting deeper & the dentist had me coming in every 3 months, instead of the usual 6 months. The pockets got so bad I had to have scaling of one area. On my last visit there was a huge difference. I noticed at this time my TSH was 1.3, so I really think our thyroid level effect this. I go back in May & my TSH has increased slightly, hopefully not enough to increase the pocket size again.\"\n\n#2) \"My own periodontal issues did not begin to resolve until after probably six months of thyroid treatment ...My own periodontist had no clue about the connection between hypothyroid and beginning- or worsening- gum disease, until he saw my own problems stabilize and then begin to heal after a few months of thyroid meds. Prior to my dx of hypo I had been receiving treatment for periodontal disease for a couple of years, and it was just getting worse, little by little - never improved one bit until thyroid supplementation began...\"\n\n3) \"Monday I went to the dentist for a routine cleaning. I had noticed for about a week or two that my gums were sensitive and bleed some when I brush, but nothing really bad. Or so I thought. The first thing the hygienist did was a periodontal measuring (don't know the official name for what she did) but it consisted of taking a very thin pick with measurement marks on it and inserting between my gums and teeth. She did this at a couple of different places on each tooth and noted the numbers. This is supposed to tell them if I have signs of gingivitis or periodontal disease. Anyway, the point of all of this is that by the time she had done all my teeth my mouth was bleeding so bad she wouldn't finish the cleaning. All she did was a treatment with some sort of antibacterial solution (felt like she used a water-pik) and sent me home with some medicine to rinse with. I go back in a few weeks for a recheck and a cleaning. I asked my doctor if it was related and he said he didn't think so, but I was just wondering if anyone else has had similar problems.\"\n\nWe have exciting news! This week the largest state legislature in the U.S. passed a bill mandating infant fluoride warnings on all water bills in fluoridated communities.\n\nOn Thursday, March 15th, the New Hampshire House of Representatives voted 253-23 in favor of HB-1416 following a 13-2 recommendation from the House Resources, Recreation, and Development committee. While there was a lot of opposition to the bill in committee, there was no debate on the House floor because of the insurmountable 13-2 committee recommendation.\n\nThe bill will now go to the Senate, where it will have a public hearing before either the Health or Municipal committee during the next several weeks. While in the Senate, we know that the NH Dental Association, Delta Dental, and the American Water Works Association will continue to oppose this bill. The NH Dental Association has contributed more than $40,000 to NH Senators over the past 5 years, so we expect a battle.\n\nWe would like to thank those who contacted NH legislators and committee members. Many legislators told me personally that they received hundreds of emails, dozens of letters, and many personal phone calls, all of which influenced their decision significantly.\n\nWe will need this same level of support as this bill heads into the Senate. We need NH Senators to hear from medical and scientific professionals, NH citizens, and from people who have been harmed by water fluoridation. I believe that if we can keep this pressure on NH legislators, then HB-1416 will successfully become law, setting a new precedent in disclosure of the risks associated with water fluoridation.\n\nBe on the lookout for future updates from NH as the bill is referred to a committee and has its public hearing scheduled.Three or four years ago Carole Clinch filed a petition with the Canadian government (Auditor General, who is supposed to be an impartial arbiter, not a politician) using the Canadian Fisheries Act which says much the same thing as that Fish and Game Code.\n\nHowever, the Canadian Water Quality Guideline for fluoride of 0.12 ppm is not enforceable and the petition was essentially ignored. The Fisheries Department responded that there was no evidence that water fluoridation chemicals diluted in tertiary treated municipal sewage effluent harm the fish in downstream environment. If there is a spill or industrial accident that wipes out a fishery, it's a prosecutable offence, but they claimed that water fluoridation doesn't do that so it's no problem.\n\nI think there is scientific evidence that fish and keystone food chain species are harmed by the amount in effluent, not so much by direct fluoride toxicity, but by fluoride's well known affinity for taking calcium ions out of solution. It is the loss of calcium, which is essential for forming fish scales and insect exoskeletons, dropping it below a certain critical ratio in soft water with low mineral buffers, that harms aquatic species severely when even a tiny increase in fluoride occurs.\n\nAliss\n\nFrom: FluoridePoisoning@yahoogroups.com [mailto:FluoridePoisoning@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of mommy2baron@...

The Township Council is expected to vote this week on a resolution in opposition of New Jersey Senate Bill 959, which would require state entities to enforce the fluoridation of all public community water systems within one year of its effective date. The bill does not apply to systems where the water is naturally laced with sufficient fluorides to conform with the affiliated rules and regulations, which Councilman Joseph Smolinski noted may very well pertain to West Milford as one of the few areas with naturally occurring fluoride.\n\nHowever, Council President Lou Signorino said he requested the drafting of a resolution since the other 15 Passaic County municipalities do not and will have to abide by rules that he said could be less about safety and more about making people money.\n\nHe noted that fluoride can be toxic in large quantities and needs to be highly-regulated in these situations.\n\nCouncilwoman CarlLa Horton said she understands the dental health concerns of some state legislators, but does not want the local Municipal Utilities Authority or any other entity to be saddled with another costly requirement from the state. A draft version of municipal resolution 2012-115 reflects the claim that the implementation of the proposal would be an unfunded mandate and \"a betrayal of the public trust.\"\n\nThe bill has been opposed for similar reasons by the New Jersey League of Municipalities, which has recommended a careful cost analysis, noting that only a small fraction of water used by public community water systems is actually consumed. Most is used for cleaning, sanitation, and gardening, as noted by a recent memorandum from William Dressel, the league's executive director.\n\nNational fluoride critic would love to attend Athens forum on the issue\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nAs the lead author of the book \"The Case Against Fluoride\" (Chelsea Green, 2010), I would be very happy to participate in a public forum on the issue of water fluoridation if one were held in Athens.\n\nIn our book, every single argument was carefully documented (80 pages of references). It is now 15 months since our book was published, and proponents have attempted no cogent scientific response. If fluoridation was as good as promoters claim it to be, why are they unable to defend the practice?\n\nI applaud City Council member-at-large Elahu Gosney for pursuing this matter. If proponents cannot defend the matter in open public debate, then local governments should not have the confidence to force this outdated practice on their citizens.\n\nHopefully, with the help of other communities, Athens can get Ohio's mandatory fluoridation bill overturne; it is an anomaly in the 21st century. We are forcing communities to do to all their citizens what an individual doctor can do to no one – force them to take medicine without their informed consent.\n\nThe vast majority of countries do NOT fluoridate their water supply but their teeth are no worse than the few countries that do. Meanwhile, we have 25 studies that have found an association between modest levels of fluoride and lowered IQ in children.\n\nFluoride costs escalate\n\nWednesday, March 21, 2012\n\nBecky Gillette\n\nThe Carroll Boone Water District (CBWD) board will meet at 10 a.m. April 19 to consider proceeding with fluoridation of public drinking water despite not having sufficient grants to cover startup costs. The board will discuss whether to use district funds to implement fluoridation.\n\nState legislation in 2011 that mandated fluoridation of all water systems with more than 5,000 customers specified that money for fluoridation equipment had to be obtained from outside grants, not tax money or user fees.\n\nDelta Dental, an oral health insurance company, pushed for the mandatory fluoridation law in the legislature, and grants from the Delta Dental Foundation were supposed to be used to pay for the fluoridation equipment. But DDF underestimated what it would cost.\n\nDelta Dental has reportedly offered CBWD about $763,000, while the cost estimated by engineers to institute fluoridation for the\n\ndistrict that serves 25,000 people, including residents of Eureka Springs, Berryville and Harrison, is $1.23 million.\n\nJames Yates of Harrison, president of the CBWD board, said he has to follow state law requiring fluoridation.\n\n\"My feeling, personal or otherwise, doesn't apply to the board,\" Yates said. \"I have no control over what the health department does. We can't just come up and say, 'Look, this is bad, guys. We aren't going to do it.' They have told us to do it.\n\n\"They are the ones who tell us what we have to do. If the state mandates we have to put fluoride in our water and the people managing the grants make a statement that we are only entitled to so much money for startup costs because they won't cover certain things, we are going to do it right.\n\n\"We are not going to put any of our employees at risk. If they say we have to do it and the law mandates we do it, we will do it the safest and most effective way for both employees and customers. That is our number one priority.\"\n\nOn Monday, State Rep. Bryan King (R-Green Forest) obtained an opinion from the State of Arkansas Bureau of Legislative Research that said: \"You asked whether the Carroll Boone Water District is obligated to pay for fluoride implementation under Act 197 of 2011 even if grant funds fall short. The answer is probably 'No'.\n\n\"Under subsection (d)(1) of Act 197 of 2011, codified at Arkansas Code § 20-7-136, water systems are not required to implement the law until funds are available from some source other than taxes or fees regularly collected by the water system. Unless non-tax, no-fee funds are available for capital start up costs, the water system is not required to carry out any of the requirements of the act. That is, unless the capital costs are covered by some outside funds, the water system is not required to maintain the fluoride levels established by the Department of Health under the act.\"\n\nKing said he did not vote for the fluoride mandate in the Public Health Committee or on the House floor, and the majority of constituents who have contacted him oppose fluoridation.\n\n\"Concerns have come from all over the political spectrum,\" King said. \"Usually in Carroll County it is liberal versus conservative, or the east side of the river against the west side of river. But this issue has raised a lot of concerns all over the county. A lot of people just don't like the mandate, that they aren't able to decide themselves whether they should fluoridate or not. There have been some people who are supportive of it, but the majority of people who have contacted me have been opposed to it for a wide variety of reasons.\"\n\nKing said he wouldn't be surprised to see an effort in the next legislative session to overturn the mandate. Opponents said it was rushed through in seven days without an opportunity for adequate public comment.\n\nFluoride added to drinking water is a controversial subject, with the official government position being that it saves money by preventing cavities. Opponents say it can cause health problems such as hypothyroidism, heart disease and learning disabilities in children.\n\nA recent study by the CDC showed 41 percent of children aged 12 to 15 were over-fluoridated, with resulting irreversible damage to their teeth from dental fluorosis.\n\nThe Arkansas Department of Health recently set fluoride limits at the level the CDC said could cause fluorosis, rather than at the lower level now recommended by the CDC.\n\nArkansas allows up to 1.2 milligrams per liter as opposed to the CDC's recommendation of an amount nearly half that level, .7 milligrams per liter.\n\nThe health department also denied that lead leaching could be issue in Eureka Springs, which has twice voted against fluoridation.\n\nThe city's contract with CBWD forbids the introduction of corrosive water into the city's drinking water supply. Concerns have been raised by the 12 employees at the Carroll Boone Water District (CBWD) that the corrosive nature of fluoride could leach lead from water distribution systems in historic cities like Eureka Springs.\n\nThat has happened in other areas of the country, like Washington D.C., leading to excessive levels of lead in children and pregnant women. According to the CDC, lead causes development delays in children, damages kidneys and the nervous system, and interferes with red blood cell chemistry.\n\nThe EPA said in 1995 that 69 million people served by 4,167 community water systems in the U.S. exceeded the lead action levels due to corrosive water.\n\nThe corrosiveness of fluoride has also been shown to damage water system equipment. Poughkeepsie's Joint Water Board in Dutchess County, N.Y., discontinued use of fluoride after 18 months due to damage to equipment, according to Citizens for Safe Drinking Water.\n\nIt is possible that later on grant funds will become available to implement mandatory fluoridation. DDF has announced plans to try to raise an additional $10 million to pay for fluoridation startup costs statewide, but if CBWD accepts the $763,000 grant currently offered, they would not be eligible to receive any more funding from DDF.\n\n\"While the benefits of fluoridation may be debatable, the cost factor is certainly not,\" said CBWD operator René Fonseca. \"Those of us who work at the CBWD plant believe there are other more important priorities for infrastructure improvements.\n\n\"The West Plant has run 24 hours a day for the past 30 years. It needs money for rehabilitation. Plans for a $1-million-plus parallel pipeline we need for future growth has been put on hold for over a year. These needs are a higher priority than adding fluoridation equipment.\"\n\nFonseca said that if the district is forced to proceed with fluoridation, changes will have to be made in its engineering to add chemicals to help with corrosion control.\n\nCurrently water leaves the plant at a neutral pH of about 7.2. Adding fluoride would make the water more acidic, and chemicals would have to be added to bring the pH back up. This would involve a new engineering study that would include how to add more chemicals, which would cost money; and adding anti-corrosive chemicals would also raise the yearly costs of fluoridation.\n\nAccording to a letter explaining terms of the grant, by accepting money from DDF, CBWD has to agree to fluoridate the water for at least ten years, or pay back a pro-rated share if fluoridation is stopped.\n\nEmployees of the CBWD are on record as opposed to fluoridation on the grounds that some studies show adverse health effects from drinking fluoridated water; equipment can be damaged by the highly corrosive chemicals; and the chemicals are highly hazardous to workers.\n\nOperators have also raised concerns about recent studies showing the sodium fluorosilicate additive contained 17 trace elements of a toxic nature including lead, arsenic, and thorium, a radionuclide.\"\n\nFonseca said operators, who are well trained and must pass licensing tests, will stand firm about refusing to add this substance to the water unless there is proper disclosure as required by law. He said it appears there are no domestic suppliers of the fluoride additives, so CBWD will start searching for foreign sources.\n\n\"Who wouldn't want to know the amount of radionuclides in a product?\" Fonseca asked. \"If you buy even a candy bar in a store, you get a list of ingredients. Shouldn't we know what we are putting in our drinking water?\"\n\nBut a presentation by the EPA reveals CDC's actual statistics show that 60% of 12-15 year-olds are afflicted with dental fluorosis - white spotted, yellow, brown and/or pitted teeth - the outward sign of fluoride's toxicity to the human body \n\n(Slide 18)\n\nIf fluorosis is no big deal, then why the need to downgrade fluorosis levels. And why are dentists telling the national media that children lack fluoride because they drink bottled water when there's no data to support that but loads of data showing American children are fluoride-overdosed and dentist-deficient?\n\n-- Posted by nyscof on Wed, Mar 21, 2012, at 4:11 PM\n\nFluoridation is a Waste of Tax Money\n\nAs a Civil Engineer, I know how wasteful fluoridation is. People drink only 1/2 % (one half percent) of the water they use, soIt is pure propaganda for the dental groups to claim savings of $38 for each $1 invested in fluoridation.\n\n-- Posted by jwillie6 on Thu, Mar 22, 2012, at 12:23 AM\n\nThe cost is said to be $1.23 million. Does that include the costs changes made in its engineering to add chemicals to help with corrosion control,a new engineering study that would cost money; and adding anti-corrosive chemicals would also raise the yearly costs of fluoridation? NO!\n\nSo, $1,230,000 divided by 25,000 people =\n\n$49.20 / person\n\nThe claim that for every dollar spent that savings of $38 accrue! Is that per year or for life of each person?\n\n\nPetrolia's fluoride debate starts\nPosted 19 hours ago\nDavid Pattenaude\nThe Petrolia Topic\nFluoridation of drinking water has been a contentious debate in communities for\nyears and the debate has begun in Petrolia — and may continue at Petrolia\ncouncil's April 23 meeting.\nCouncillors have received inquiries about fluoride being added to the town's\ndrinking water so the town asked for the opinion of Dr. Christopher Greensmith,\nLambton County's Medical Officer of Health.\nGreensmith has told the town in a letter that \"...community water fluoridation\nis beneficial to all residents, especially children, low income families and the\nelderly. Over 90 international organizations (such as the World Health\nOrganization, Public Health Agency of Canada and the U.S. Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention) support the addition of fluoride into community water\nsupplies.\"\nGreensmith added it's important that children have access to fluoride \"...to\nstrengthen their teeth enamel and prevent dental disease.\"\nBut Petrolian Al Petersen, speaking to council at its March 19 meeting, said\n\"...the risks (of fluoride) outweigh the limited benefits.\"\nHe gave council a report, based on his research, that said \"...producing safe\ndrinking water does not require fluoride to be added to it.\"\nPetersen asked council to take a precautionary approach and discontinue\nfluoridation.\nFluoride (fluorosilic acid) is added at the town's water treatment plant in\nBright's Grove at a dosage rate between .60 and .70 parts per million, according\nto town corporate services director Scott Gawley.\nOntario Clean Water Agency operators contracted by the town to operate the water\ntreatment plant are responsible for adding fluoride to the drinking water, as\nrequired under the plant's certificate of approval issued by the Environment\nMinistry, said Gawley in a report to council.\n\"The addition of fluoride in the town's drinking water is primarily a municipal\nissue in consultation with the public and the medical officer of health, he\nsaid. After the meeting, Gawley explained the ministry doesn't require a\nmunicipality to use fluoride.\nGawley said staff is checking to see how long fluoride has been added to\nPetrolia's drinking water.\nPetersen's report also said fluoridation is not required under Ontario's Safe\nDrinking Water Act; it is a municipality's option.\nHis report said Petrolia council \"...assumes full responsibility for verifying\nthe safety of the product (fluoride) used, its application to the water supply,\nand the health risks which occur; yet take it on faith from other authorities\nthe product used not only meets the criteria, but is otherwise safe, even though\nit's up to the town alone to make that final determination.\n\"The Ministry of Environment, local medical officer of health, Health Canada,\nand the American Water Works Association can state in a general sense the\nconcept of fluoridation is beneficial because they assume no liability for\nresponsibility and decisions about Petrolia's drinking water system and chemical\nsupplies.\"\nPetersen said fluoride is only potentially effective in protecting teeth as a\ntopical treatment; not from ingestion. He added because fluoride is also\ningested with mouthwash, food, toothpaste and beverages, \"...total fluoride\nexposure needs to be limited.\"\nHe said by adding fluoride to the water supply, council is accepting unnecessary\nliability for potential damages and health impacts.\nPetersen said ending the use of fluoride would:\n• Eliminate the risk of chronic workplace exposure to hydrofluorosilic acid\nchemical emissions for water treatment plant operators;\n• Eliminate the potential risk to the health of drinking water consumers; and\n• Eliminate exposure to liability for damages and impacts.\nPeterson said it's challenging to determine if exposure to low concentrations of\nany known hazardous compound over a long period of time causes health impacts.\nBut he said many municipalities have discontinued using fluoride and added \"It's\nclear from a simple risk/benefit analysis the benefits of water fluoridation\ndon't justify the cost and the risk.\"\nCouncil tentatively tabled discussion about fluoride to its April 23 meeting\nafter Councillors Mary-Pat Gleeson and Joel Field said Peterson's report and\nsupplementary information is a \"lot of information\" to digest.\n\"There's a lot of information to go through, to make sure we are making the\nright decision,\" said Field.\nMayor John McCharles said a municipal referendum would be needed to take\nfluoride out of the town's drinking water\nGawley said after the meeting staff is checking to see if a referendum would\nactually be needed; and is also checking to see if a referendum was used to\nbegin the use of fluoride. If a referendum was used to start it, another would\nbe needed to end it, he said.\nGawley said April 23 is only a tentative date to continue the fluoride debate\nbecause the town is still trying to secure the attendance of people such as\nGreensmith and Petersen.\nCouncil meetings start at 7 p.m.\n\nPaducah is the main US uranium enrichment facility. It releases 88% of all US industrial ozone-layer-eating CFC-114. It should have been closed decades ago. Now that it finally IS closed, the nuclear industry is starting to panic.\n\nI\nexplained to the council that the fluoridation materials are not legal. Wash\nlaw says that the materials must comply with NSF 60. NSF 60 says that tox\nstudies are done and that additives had to be safe at maximum use levels. But\nNSF official Stan Hazan has said under oath that tox studies are not being\ndone. Fluoridation can only be done with materials that comply with NSF. Therefore\nthere are no legal fluoridation materials and fluoridation itself is illegal.\n\nNow\nthat the fluoride has been turned off, the tables have turned. They are going to\nhave to take affirmative action to turn it back on. That will be an illegal\naction.\n\nThe\nadditional good news is that the op-ed editor says that he will publish as many\nintelligent 300 word letters to the editor as we send him. He has been\nlistening via the web to all the speeches that Fluoride Class Action and\nWashington Safe Water have been giving.\n\nOn\nFriday Audrey Adams and I – representing Washington Action for Safe Water\nand Fluoride Class Action – attended the Snohomish Health District\nseminar on Fluoride.\n\nHoward\nPollack, defender of the fluoride faith, cruised along from 8:30 until 10:00\nabout how great fluoridation was.\n\nThereafter\nHoward Pollack seemed to be flustered. He asked me if I knew Paul\nConnett, and I said \"of course\".\n\nAudrey\nand I asked a lot of questions and made our arguments.\n\nAlso\npresent was Mark Weeks, who gave a virtual tour of the water treatment plant. I\nasked him if they ever suited up in hazmat gear when working with the fluoride.\nHe said they did not even have one. He said they didn't even use\nbreathers or masks. He said they did not even own any hazmat suits. He said\nthat the ventilation removed ten volumes of air every hour and that was\nprotection enough.\n\nThe\nWashington Dental Foundation was there too. They are unquestioning supporters\nof fluoridation. I think they are funded by the Pew Foundation. The lady said\nthat if she knew there was anything wrong with fluoridation, they would not\nsupport it. I intend to write them a letter.\n\nI\nwill publish more about the conference when I have time. Now back to work.\n\nKeep hammering on them JRD and all. The success of Everett and San Deigo (if\nand when) are going to be the blueprint for me and my town.\nIf the FDA would truely do their job none of this would be necessary.\nRon\n--- In FluoridePoisoning@yahoogroups.com, \"James Robert Deal\"\n<jamesrobertdeal@...> wrote:\n>\n> 3-24-12\n>\n> The news from Washington:\n>\n>\n>\n> I put an ad in the Everett Herald:\n> \n> e-3-18-121.pdf\n>\n> Which linked to this page:\n> \n>\n>\n>\n> So we had guests show up at the city council meeting, and we made new\n> members who seem interested in helping organize.\n>\n>\n>\n> I delivered the city council a copy of the press release:\n> \n>\n>\n>\n> I explained to the council that the fluoridation materials are not\n> legal.

      "text": "HERE'S what it's like to take a mineral bath at the Saratoga Spa. An attendant ushers you into a spacious chamber done in austere Depression-vintage decor. The floor is covered with tiny black and white tiles. There is a plain single bed and a rattan chair. Sydney Greenstreet would not look out of place sitting there in a wrinkled white suit. A 60-gallon tub, roughly twice the size of the average home model, is filled with greenish spring water heated to 98 degrees. The attendant discreetly withdraws.\n\nYou submerge. The smell of the waters is piquant, shall we say. Almost at once tiny bubbles begin to collect on the hairs of your chest (if you are so lucky to have any) as the carbon dioxide comes out of solution. You sink deeper, submersing your ears - the room is exceedingly quiet anyway, the bathhouse being a good mile from the highway.\n\nSoon you begin to notice an interesting phenomenon. Breathe in and your torso rises to the surface. Breathe out and you slowly sink back down into bubbly depths. Extend your arms and they float weightlessly. This is due to the high content of dissolved minerals, same as if you were swimming in the Great Salt Lake.\n\nBy and by the attendant returns and wraps you in a warm sheet. You are invited to snooze on the bed for a while. You do not even hear him leave. Next, the masseur wakes you. You slide on top of his portable padded table and all the cares and woes of life in an election year are expelled from your muscle fibers. You depart feeling as though your backbone had been surgically removed.\n\nLong before the famous race track was carved out of the pines and bracken, Saratoga was renowned for its carbonated mineral springs. Sir William Johnson, the beloved diplomat to the Iroquois nation, was carried here on a litter by the Mohawks in 1767 to cure a siege of gout. Alas, the treatments did not avail, but word got out about the curious fizzy waters, slightly redolent of eggs gone bad. George Washington was lured over in 1783, after an inspection of Fort Ticonderoga, and briefly thought about building a summer place here - but then the Constitution came along and somebody had to be president.\n\nDuring the 1800's, a village grew up around Gideon Putnam's hotel, Congress Hall. New springs were easily tapped by drilling a few hundred feet down into the dolomitic limestone, and the elaborate pavilions built to house them became popular gathering spots. Soon the best families of the East came to sojourn in the ''season,'' as July and August were called.\n\nThe Saratoga that lives in the popular imagination today is a Victorian fantasia of mammoth hotels, outlandish characters like Diamond Jim Brady, languid summer romance, and the kind of wretched excess that only vast amounts of money can buy. As a way of life it died out as completely as the civilization of the Incas. In the 1920's 30's and 40's, the town entered a shady phase when its allure was based on illicit gambling that flourished in fancy nightclubs operated by the mob, where society swells rubbed elbows with gangsters like Arnold Rothstein, Owney Madden and Charles (Lucky) Luciano. The Kefauver Commission would put an end to that scene after World War II.\n\nThere was also a push in those days to make Saratoga into a health spa on the order of Baden-Baden and similar European resorts. This became a reality when Gov. Franklin Roosevelt was elected President in 1932. Because of his own health problems, Roosevelt was an aficionado of hydrotherapy. So the new President channeled millions of public works dollars into what eventually became the Saratoga Spa Reservation."

      "text": "Welcome To The Pool House\n\nNow that you know what's in your water, let's look at how you can build a perfectly balanced pool.\n\nWe call it the Pool House, and it's a simple diagram that clearly shows you the chemical structure of a healthy pool. Think of the various elements within your pool water like the different components you'd use to build a house. The foundation for crystal clear water begins with a total alkalinity of 70 to 140 ppm (ideal range varies based on pool finish). Moving up to the first floor, pH levels should be maintained as close to the ideal of 7.4 as possible. A proper chlorine level of 2 to 4 ppm forms the second floor, and a stabilizer reading of 40 ppm tops everything off as the roof. Calcium hardness is the walls which keep the floors in place, and should be maintained at 200 to 400 ppm. So keep this structure in mind when testing your water – it's an easy way to clearly picture the components of a perfect pool.\n\nPassing The Water Test With Flying Colors\n\nAll this talk of pH and ppm seems confusing until you apply it to a test kit, which is a simple way to determine the various characteristics of your pool water. That's where it all comes together. There are many types of test kits available, including test strips. For the most accurate assessment of your pool water, you should use (at the very minimum) a test kit that allows you to test for chlorine, pH and total alkalinity. Test kits are also available to test calcium hardness, stabilizer, and lots of other things.\n\nYour Pinch A Penny expert can help you select the test kit that's right for you, to help you keep track of your pool's health in between your free water analyses at Pinch A Penny. Remember to store your test kit in a cool, dark place and replace your test kit reagents annually. Just date the bottles when you buy the kit and be sure to bring them into Pinch A Penny after a year\nfor replacement.\n\nNow that you know what a test kit is, here's how to use it to your advantage. First, each time try to perform your water test at the same time of the day and before you add any chemicals. During summer months, a test every day can help avoid the problems associated with heavy pool use or rain.\n\nTesting the waters. Here's the proper way\nto get a water sample.\n\nTo get the best results, after the pump has been running for at least one hour, take water from the deep end of your pool, submerging your collection vessel upside down up to your elbow\nbefore filling. Put your water sample into the appropriate tubes and follow the directions for adding specified solutions (usually just a few drops) to the appropriate tube. Changes in water color will tell you the chemistry levels.\n\nTest Strips\n\nTest strips, the easiest method for pool and spa water testing, are fast and simple to use because they eliminate the need to measure samples and count drops. Typically, you simply dip a strip in the water for one second and then remove it. You then compare the color on the strip to a color chart provided to get the results.\n\nTest strips are comparable in accuracy to liquid kits. In fact, many believe they actually deliver greater accuracy than liquid kits because they are more user-friendly and easier to utilize for reliable results. Many local and state health departments now recognize test strips as an approved testing method. This means that professional pool and spa service technicians, as well as other industry experts, trust the accuracy of pool and spa test strips. Test strips are available to measure all of the critical water parameters such as chlorine, pH, total alkalinity, hardness, cyanuric acid and much more.\n\nFree 7 Point Water Test\n\nEven though you test your water at home, you should always follow up your own readings with a free water analysis at Pinch A Penny every week or two. Using Pinch A Penny's 7-point free water test program, our experts can help spot a potential problem a home test kit can miss. And because we keep a history of your pool's condition each time we test it, we get to know your pool better each time you bring us a sample.\n\nHow to know just how much fun your pool holds.\n\nWater testing and correcting potential problems can't be accurately done if you don't know how much water your pool holds. Plus, you can end up spending a lot more in chemical treatments in the long run. Here's a simple method for measuring the number of gallons in your pool. Once you have this figure, it's important to bring it in with you when you have your water analyzed.\n\nFirst of all, you need to determine your average depth. The simplest method is to tie a string that's been marked off in feet to a weighted object and measure the deep end, then the shallow end. Add these two numbers together and divide by two to get your average depth. Use your average depth number in the following calculations to determine your pool's capacity:\n\nFor Circular Pools\n\nFor Oval Pools\n\nLong diameter x short diameter x average depth x 5.9 = Total gallons.\nExample: If the long diameter is 30 feet, the short diameter is 15 feet and the average depth is 6 feet, the pool holds 15,930 gallons."

      "text": "Water Disinfection for Travelers\n\nHoward D. Backer\n\nRISK FOR TRAVELERS\n\nWaterborne disease is a risk for international travelers who visit countries that have poor hygiene and inadequate sanitation, and for wilderness visitors who rely on surface water in any country, including the United States. The list of potential waterborne pathogens is extensive and includes bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and parasitic helminths. Most of the organisms that can cause travelers' diarrhea can be waterborne. Where treated tap water is available, most travelers' intestinal infections are probably transmitted by food, but where untreated surface or well water is used and there is no sanitation infrastructure, the risk of waterborne infection is high. Microorganisms with small infectious doses can even cause illness through recreational water exposure, via inadvertent water ingestion.\n\nBottled water has become the convenient solution for most travelers, but in some places it may not be superior to tap water. Moreover, the plastic bottles create an ecological problem, since most developing countries do not recycle plastic bottles. All international travelers, especially long-term travelers or expatriates, should become familiar with and use simple methods to ensure safe drinking water. Table 2-09 compares benefits and limitations of different methods.\n\nFIELD TECHNIQUES FOR WATER TREATMENT\n\nHeat\n\nCommon intestinal pathogens are readily inactivated by heat. Microorganisms are killed in a shorter time at higher temperatures, whereas temperatures as low as 140°F (60°C) are effective with a longer contact time. Pasteurization uses this principle to kill foodborne enteric pathogens and spoiling organisms at temperatures between 140°F (60°C) and 158°F (70°C), well below the boiling point of water (212°F [100°C]).\n\nAlthough boiling is not necessary to kill common intestinal pathogens, it is the only easily recognizable point that doesn't require a thermometer. All organisms except bacterial spores, which are not usually waterborne enteric pathogens, are killed in seconds at boiling temperature. Therefore, any water that is boiled for 1 minute (to allow for a margin of safety) should be adequately disinfected. Because the boiling point decreases with increasing altitude, water should be boiled for 3 minutes at altitudes above 6,562 ft (2,000 m). To conserve fuel, the same results can be obtained by bringing water to a boil and then turning off the stove but keeping the container covered for several minutes.\n\nIf no other means of water treatment is available, a potential alternative to boiling is to use tap water that is too hot to touch, which is probably at a temperature between 131°F (55°C) and 140°F (60°C). This temperature may be adequate to kill pathogens if the water has been kept hot in the tank for some time. Travelers with access to electricity can bring a small electric heating coil or a lightweight beverage warmer to boil water.\n\nFiltration and Clarification\n\nFilter pore size is the primary determinant of a filter's effectiveness, but microorganisms also adhere to filter media by electrochemical reactions. Microfilters with \"absolute\" pore sizes of 0.1–0.4 µm are usually effective to remove cysts and bacteria but may not adequately remove viruses, which are a major concern in water with high levels of fecal contamination (Table 2-10). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designation of water \"purifier\" indicates that company-sponsored testing has substantiated claims for removing 106 bacteria, 104 (9,999 of 10,000) viruses, and 103 Cryptosporidium oocysts or Giardia cysts, although EPA does not independently test the validity of these claims. NSF International is a nonprofit, nongovernmental organization that develops standards and product certification for public health and safety. They are a designated collaborating center of the World Health Organization (WHO) for Food and Water Safety and Indoor Environment. They are accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International Accreditation Service (IAS), and the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) for third-party certification. Some water filtration units have been evaluated by NSF International under the NSF/ANSI Standard 53. A listing of certified water filtration products can be found at \n\nNew portable filter designs include hollow fiber technology, which is a cluster of tiny tubules with variable pore sizes that can remove virus-size particles. Reverse-osmosis filters can both remove microbiologic contamination and desalinate water. The high price and slow output of small hand-pump reverse-osmosis units prohibit use by land-based travelers; however, they are important survival aids for ocean voyagers.\n\nCoagulation-flocculation (CF) removes suspended particles that cause a cloudy appearance and bad taste and do not settle by gravity; this process removes many but not all microorganisms. CF is easily applied in the field. Alum, or one of several other substances, is added to the water, stirred well, allowed to settle, then poured through a coffee filter or fine cloth to remove the sediment. Tablets or packets of powder that combine flocculent and hypochlorite disinfection are available (commercial products such as Chlor-floc or PUR).\n\nChemical Disinfection\n\nHalogens\n\nThe most common chemical water disinfectants are chlorine and iodine (halogens). Worldwide, chemical disinfection with chlorine is the most commonly used method for improving and maintaining the microbiologic quality of drinking water. Sodium hypochlorite, the active ingredient in common household bleach, is the primary disinfectant promoted by CDC and the WHO Safe Water System at a 1.5% concentration for household use in the developing world. Other chlorine-containing compounds, such as calcium hypochlorite and sodium dichloroisocyanurate, which are both solids, are also effective for household water treatment.\n\nGiven adequate concentrations and length of exposure (contact time), chlorine and iodine have similar activity and are effective against bacteria, viruses, and Giardia cysts ( (PDF). Because many factors in the field are uncontrolled, extending the contact time adds a margin of safety. However, some common waterborne parasites, such as Cryptosporidium, are poorly inactivated by halogen disinfection, even at practical extended contact times. Therefore, chemical disinfection should be supplemented with adequate filtration to remove these microorganisms from drinking water. Cloudy water contains substances that will neutralize disinfectant, so it will require higher concentrations or contact times or, preferably, clarification through settling or filtration before disinfectant is added. Tablets that combine flocculent and disinfectant are available.\n\nBoth chlorine and iodine are available in liquid and tablet form. Because iodine has physiologic activity, WHO recommends limiting iodine water disinfection to a few weeks of emergency use. Iodine use is not recommended for people with unstable thyroid disease or known iodine allergy. Iodine should not be used by pregnant women because of the potential effect on the fetal thyroid.\n\nThe taste of halogens in water can be improved by several means:\n\nReduce concentration and increase contact time proportionately.\n\nAfter the required contact time, run water through a filter that contains activated carbon.\n\nAfter the required contact time, add a tiny pinch of ascorbic acid.\n\nIodine Resins\n\nIodine resins transfer iodine to microorganisms that come into contact with the resin, but leave little iodine dissolved in the water. The resins have been incorporated into many different filter designs available for field use. Most contain a 1-µm cyst filter, which should effectively remove protozoan cysts. Few models are sold in the United States because of inconsistent test results, but some models are still available for international use.\n\nSalt (Sodium Chloride) Electrolysis\n\nPassing a current through a simple brine salt solution generates oxidants, including hypochlorite, which can be used to disinfect microbes.\n\nChlorine Dioxide\n\nChlorine dioxide (ClO2) can kill most waterborne pathogens, including Cryptosporidium oocysts, at practical doses and contact times. Tablets and liquid formulations are available to generate chlorine dioxide in the field for small-quantity water treatment.\n\nUltraviolet (UV) Light\n\nExtensive data show that UV light can kill bacteria, viruses, and Cryptosporidium oocysts in water. The effect depends on UV dose and exposure time, and requires clear water because suspended particles can shield microorganisms from UV rays. These units have limited effectiveness in water with high levels of suspended solids and turbidity. They also have no disinfection residual. Portable battery-operated units that deliver a metered, timed dose of UV may be an effective way to disinfect small quantities of clear water in the field; however, more testing is needed for conclusive evidence.\n\nSolar Irradiation and Heating\n\nUV irradiation by sunlight in the UVA range can substantially improve the microbiologic quality of water. Recent work has confirmed the efficacy and optimal procedures of the solar disinfection technique. Transparent bottles (such as clear plastic beverage bottles), preferably lying on a dark surface, are exposed to sunlight for a minimum of 4 hours. UV and thermal inactivation are synergistic for solar disinfection of drinking water. Use of a simple reflector or solar cooker can achieve temperatures of 149°F (65°C), which will pasteurize the water after 4 hours. Solar disinfection is not effective on turbid water. If the headlines in a newspaper can't be read through the bottle of water, then the water must be filtered before solar irradiation is used. If more than half the sky is clouded over, then solar irradiation is not effective and should be repeated before using the water. Solar disinfection of drinking water may be acceptable for austere emergency situations.\n\nSilver and Other Products\n\nSilver ion has bactericidal effects in low doses and some attractive features, including absence of color, taste, and odor. The use of silver as a drinking water disinfectant is popular in Europe, but it is not approved for this purpose in the United States, because silver concentration in water is strongly affected by adsorption onto the surface of the container, and there has been limited testing on viruses and cysts. In the United States, silver is approved for maintaining microbiologic quality of stored water.\n\nSeveral other common products have antibacterial effects in water and are marketed in commercial products for travelers, including hydrogen peroxide, citrus juice, and potassium permanganate. None have sufficient data to recommend them for water disinfection in the field.\n\nTable 2-09.

Optimal treatment of highly contaminated or cloudy water may require CF followed by chemical disinfection. On long-distance, oceangoing boats where water must be desalinated during the voyage, only reverse-osmosis membrane filters are adequate."

No matter if you eat zero carbs or 3 servings of beef jerky each day, water is the cornerstone of every diet.\n\n\nBottled water It's becoming more and more popular, despite costing a dollar or two per bottle. There are typically two kinds of non-flavored water you can purchase – mineral and spring. And yes, there is a difference between the two. Spring water derives its name from the fact that it comes from underground water springs. It receives the same filtration treatment that all water receives, including tap water, but that's it. It is the more natural water and is typically characterized as tasting more refreshing.\n\nMineral water is spring water that goes through a chemical treatment process. This adds minerals to the water, but in exchange, causes water to lose some of its refreshing taste. The technical name for the added minerals is \"Totally Dissolved Solids.\" If there are less than 250 mg/liter in the water, it's considered spring. Above 250 and it's mineral water. In fact there are three different levels of mineral water. The low mineral content is what's normally found in stores. Bottles of water typically go for $1.25, or you can buy them in packs of 6 for $5-6.\n\nAnother option is flavored water. Gatorade recently launched its own line of flavored fitness water, but there are many other options. These waters go through a similar process to mineral water, adding not only minerals and vitamin fortification, but also a hint of artificial flavoring. It's not much different than mineral water; its main attraction is for individuals who do not like the taste of plain water. Flavored water costs nearly the same as regular bottled water.\n\nFilters Water filters are a more economically sound purchase. Filters come in several forms; the most popular choices are a filtered water pitcher to be stored in your fridge, or an attachment to your sink faucet. The filters block several elements of tap water, including zinc, chlorine, copper, lead, sediment and other materials, up to 99 percent of each item that comes through your sink. (These additives come from the pipes they flow through, so they are not in bottled spring water). Filters can be purchased for anything from $20 to $60, and are great alternatives to buying bottled water all the time.\n\nWater coolers Thought these were only for the office? While they require a bit more maintenance than filters, water coolers are another alternative to bottled water. The cooling units are more expensive to buy up front, (the cheapest ones start at $100) but in the long run, will save you money. Five-gallon jugs can be purchased for less than $10 and they equate to 32 regular size bottles of water (20 ounces). Plus, companies will regularly bring you new jugs at your convenience.\n\nThe choice is yours, between bottled, flavored, filters or coolers; just make sure you're drinking 8-12 cups per day. Find out what works best for you and stick with it! It could be key to reaching your nutritional goals."

      "text": "The effectiveness of large household water storage tanks for protecting the quality of drinking water.\n\nMany communities along the US-Mexico border remain without infrastructure for water and sewage. Residents in these communities often collect and store their water in open 55-gallon drums. This study evaluated changes in drinking water quality resulting from an intervention that provided large closed water storage tanks (2,500-gallons) to individual homes lacking a piped water supply. After the intervention, many of the households did not change the source of their drinking water to the large storage tanks. Therefore, water quality results were first compared based on the source of the household's drinking water: store or vending machine, large tank, or collected from a public supply and transported by the household. Of the households that used the large storage tank as their drinking water supply, drinking water quality was generally of poorer quality. Fifty-four percent of samples collected prior to intervention had detectable levels of total coliforms, while 82% of samples were positive nine months after the intervention (p < 0.05). Exploratory analyses were also carried out to measure water quality at different points between collection by water delivery trucks and delivery to the household's large storage tank. Thirty percent of the samples taken immediately after water was delivered to the home had high total coliforms (> 10 CFU/100 ml). Mean free chlorine levels dropped from 0.43 mg/l, where the trucks filled their tanks, to 0.20 mg/l inside the household's tank immediately after delivery. Results of this study have implications for interventions that focus on safe water treatment and storage in the home, and for guidelines regarding the level of free chlorine required in water delivered by water delivery trucks."

Bottled water has therefore developed into a hate figure of the environmental movement but why is it so bad for you and the environment:\n\nBottled water adds food miles to a basic necessity through transportation from one water basin to another (sometimes thousands of miles away). Previously we had done this with pipes and pumps; bottled water relies on lorries and plastic. Unnecessary movement means energy is burnt, carbon is released and we make one of our most basic needs yet more carbon intensive.\n\n2) Waste of Oil\n\nTransporting a heavy element results in wasted oil as does the manufacture of the bottles to hold that live giving substance. In a time of peak oil we should not be wasting oil. We need to preserve this oil for the manufacturing of food and plastics that we will need in the future.\n\n3) Plastic Rubbish\n\nFinished with drinking our spring water the majority of us will the throw that plastic bottle into the dump. We are turning one of our most precious resources into rubbish that will then sit in a landfill site for about 450 years or get washed into the sea. Worldwatch Institute highlights the problem:\n\nEach year, about 2 million tons of PET bottles end up in landfills in the United States; in 2005, the national recycling rate for PET was only 23.1 percent, far below the 39.7 percent rate achieved a decade earlier.\n\nThis rubbish is not necessary and it just means more waste, less oil and more costs for both the environment and humanity.\n\n5) Morally Disgusting\n\nLook at the above statistic. We spend that extra so that our water can be wrapped in plastic. 800 million people have no access to clean water. To reach the sanitation and safe water Millennium goal would take some US $ 11.3 billion per year. Americans drinking bottled water works out at 150 billion dollars; how can we morally justify that!\n\n6) Less Regulated\n\nIn the US at least this is the case because tap water falls under the EPAs mandate whereas bottled water, being classified as a food, falls under the authority of the Food & Drug Administration which has weaker regulations. Drinking botttled water means that the company supllying that water has less regulation and the ability to cut corners. Why would you risk it?\n\nPlastic when in contact with water leaches Phthalate which can cause cancers or infertility (so much for part of a healthy lifestyle). There is also the debate whether we expose ourselves to chemicals through drinking or breathing as Sandra Steingraber points out in Having Faith:\n\nthe sense of safety offered by bottled water is a mirage. It turns out that breathing, not drinking, constitutes our main route of exposure to volatile pollutants in tap water, such as solvents, pesticides, and byproducts of water chlorination. As soon as the toilet is flushed or the faucet turned on—or the bathtub, the shower, the humidifier, the washing machine—these contaminants leave the water and enter the air. A recent study shows that the most efficient way of exposing yourself to chemical contaminants in tap water is to turn on a dishwasher. [...] We enjoy the most intimate of relationships with our public drinking water, whether we want to or not.\n\n8) Marketed Rubbish\n\nIt is supposed to make you healthier, younger and sportier, but so does tap water. When Coca Cola launched its Dasani Water in 2004 it was actually water from London's mains supply and not from a spring at all. Another pointless industry supported by clever propaganda, oh sorry I mean advertising.\n\n9) Encourages Privatisation\n\nThrough removing the richest from the water supply you discourage them to invest in the public infrastructure. This privatization in some countries means that water is becoming something of a luxury instead of a basic right. In America there are social movements trying to protect locals historical rights to their water from bottled water companies.\n\nBut wait, Is it really all bad?\n\n10) Does it not take market share from more energy intensive drinks?\n\nIt is now fashionable to drink bottled water and people are moving away from other drinks that are not delivered by the tap and are yet more energy intensive thanbottled water. It can be argued that the shift to bottled water is causing the milk or juice industry to lose market share. Bottled water is therefore actually helping the environment. The only problem is that we could achive yet a greater carbon saving when people switched from milk, juice and cola to tapped water instead of bottled.\n\nWe have created new jobs, new money and a new industrial sector through the bottled water industry but at the same time we have created a major headache for the environment. There is a simple remedy to this headache: it's a tap and a stainless steel thermos.\n\n5 Responses to \"9 Reasons Not to Drink Bottled Water But One Reason Why It's Not so Bad for the Environment\"\n\nTotally agree! I'm in the water business and I test bottle water everyday, most of them are pretty much tap water with a label on it that make it looks good, but it is not!, Tap water is cleaned by every city but runs through miles of rusty pipes before getting to people's houses so what we get is water full of rust and all kind of contaminants. Filter is the solution, specially those that you can hook up under your kitchen sink because you use it not only for drinking but for cooking too!!.\nIm located in Orange County, southern California, contact me for any questions.\nThanks and have a healthy life!\nGuillermo Maldonado\n714-260-5558 cowaypurewater@yahoo.com"

But it can inevitable that at some point, probably in your surprise, the begins turning over cast. Now it can your decision to determine why. Pursuing would be the most popular explanations why a pool some day can suddenly along with unexpectedly become a new cloudy pool another.\n\nChildren's pool water clarity relies on three fundamental components of pool servicing... purification, flow, and normal water chemistry. In case several of the three elements tend to be outside of whack, typically the pool could switch over cast.\n\nPurification - there is doubt that with out sufficient purification, the pool area water will turn over cast. Possible reasons behind inadequate filtration really are a dirty filtration system, a vintage filter element that really needs replacement, but not running the filtration system for long everyday. Insufficient purification can be the consequence of insufficient blood flow... notice beneath.\n\nBlood circulation - start up the pump as well as ensure that the pool offers good blood flow. Merely a stopped up skimmer or pump motor basket limit water flow causing inefficient filtering. If each of the baskets are spending there still isn't very good blood circulation, the water pump impeller might be clogged with dirt and may should be fixewd. Last but not least, check most circulation diverter regulators to be sure they may be from the correct location. If the valve continues to be inadvertently considered block either a good intake line or even a return collection, circulation will probably be interrupted.\n\nNormal water Chemistry - to get pool water hormone balance balanced is really a step to clear h2o. The most typical mistake is allowing the chlorine degree drop to actually zero. This will likely cause cloudy pool area water, the industry sign of earlier algae development. Next examine the ph level, alkalinity, along with calcium rigidity. If some of these parameters are away from normal selection, this might be the condition likewise.\n\nMany cloudy pool h2o headaches are solved by checking these a few parts of pool preservation, a lot more almost daily it might end up being genuine obvious. Or even capable of identify the issue, you want to find an experienced for aid. Call the regional pool store or perhaps a pool service technical assistant to assist troubleshoot and repair the problem."

I wrote a brief summary of their work in our Water Charities List, but we felt like this was such a unique cause that they deserved a bigger spotlight.\n\nWater is Life has developed a filtration technology that filters dirty water through a straw in three stages. When the straw is immersed in water (like a normal drinking straw), it filters particles, membranes and molecules in the first chamber. Then as the water is sipped through the remaining chambers, an iodine filtration system eliminates disease, and charcoal grates remove any bad tastes to provide fresh, clean, safe water. The system filters particles down to 15 microns in size.\n\nThe Water is Life straw has proven to be effective against waterborne diseases such as typhoid, cholera, dysentery, guinea worm and diarrhea, and each straw filters water for one person for up to an entire year.\n\nHowever, the straws are just a short-term solution to those that need immediate assistance. 6,500 people – 5,000 of whom are children – die daily due to the lack of access to clean water. Water is Life distributes the straws as a temporary fix, while they work to develop long-term sustainable solutions like water wells, sand filters and other technology, combined with hygiene and sanitation assistance in each village.\n\nIf you would like to donate to Water is Life, you may do so directly on the website. Each straw costs $10. Volunteers may also get involved by hosting a fundraising event, or by joining a Water is Life team and traveling to distribute straws in Kenya, Ghana, Haiti and other countries.\n\nStay tuned to learn more about a special charity project that Filters Fast will be hosting in the coming months. In the meantime, promote the Water is Life cause to your friends by sharing this post on Facebook and Twitter!"

      "text": "Over the last few months, nearly everyone with a dishwasher has noticed that their dishes and glassware have been coming out more spotted and cloudy than before. The cause for this problem was recently discovered. On July 1st, 2010, all dishwasher detergent manufacturers voluntarily eliminated phosphates from their products in response to 16 states in the United States banning phosphates from dishwasher detergents.\nPhosphates helped the cleaning process but were banned due to their negative effect on the environment. One of the ways the phosphates helped was to eliminate or reduce lime scale inside a dishwasher in hard water areas.\n\nWhat is hard water? Hard water refers to the natural mineral content in water, comprised mostly of calcium, with some iron and manganese. Hardness is commonly measured in grains per gallon (gpg). Most detergent manufacturers say that any water with hardness greater than 10.5 gpg is considered very hard. In the City of Fort Scott our water has an average hardness of 12 gpg. Under typical conditions, the majority of these minerals will stay in solution. However, in the high heat of a dishwasher, boiling pot, coffee pot, etc. the minerals tend to come out of solution and deposit onto surfaces. The minerals are simply left behind as the water is evaporated. This is commonly called lime scale or hard water scale. This inconvenience is now more pronounced on our dishes because of the elimination of phosphates in the dishwasher detergents. The phosphates helps keep the minerals 'bound up,' or in solution, so that they are not easily deposited on dishes.\n\nWhat can be done to help prevent this from occurring? In speaking with our local hardware stores, the owners appear to be very knowledgeable and helpful on this topic. The stores sell a dishwasher additive that will help remove the hard water scaling. Any product with a citric acid base seems to work well. Another practice that can help is turning off the heated drying cycle on your dishwasher and allowing the dishes to air dry. Another option, hand washing dishes, will eliminate the problem.\n\nYour dishwasher is not causing the problem and the water provided by the City of Fort Scott continues to be not only safe, but of excellent aesthetic quality as well. The City is extremely thankful for our abundant access to such high quality water.\n\nPlease share this information with family and friends near and far to save them from unnecessarily purchasing new dishwashers. This problem is being experienced not only here in town, but nearly everywhere in states that has a water supply with hard water.\n\nFor any questions or for a tour of our Water Treatment Plant, please contact Michael Mix at 223-5160."

Memories were still fresh of seeing Ohio's Cuyahoga River actually catch fire, and many of our national waterways were filthy. In the four decades that followed passage of the Clean Water Act, things improved a lot. So much so, in fact, that we're now in danger of taking clean water for granted. That would be a mistake because even though the threats to our water are not as obvious as they were 40 years ago, they're still deadly serious.\n\nAlthough Cuyahoga hasn't caught fire lately, communities across the U.S. are still discovering that their water supplies are being contaminated by industrial and agricultural pollutants like nitrates, perchlorate, and hexavalent chromium. Natural gas fracking, which could contaminate entire aquifers, is rampant and poorly regulated.\n\nAccording to the EPA, nearly 1 in 10 Americans still don't have round-the-clock access to safe, clean drinking water that meets national health standards.

      "text": "Hydration station examination\n\nHydration Stations are popping up all over the UNLV campus, providing free filtered water for students and replacing some drinking fountains.\n\nTara Pike, sustainability coordinator and recycling manager at UNLV, has been conducting water taste tests on campus to see if students can tell the difference between filtered water from the hydration stations and water from the tap or a name brand distributor.\n\nParticipants taste four different kinds of water including tap water, hydration station filtered water, Dasani and Aquafina.\n\nAfter tasting, participants are asked to rank the water based on which water they prefer the most, and the one they least prefer. A survey gauging attitudes about the environment as well as consumption habits was also conducted.\n\n\"I wanted to set these taste tests up to let people know about the hydration stations,\" Pike said. \"It lets them know that filtered water pretty much tastes the same as the bottled water.\"\n\nPike said students today have grown up on bottled water and many are afraid to drink tap water. She said the taste tests show that many students cannot tell the difference between tap water and bottled water.\n\n\"Water is water,\" Pike said. \"It's not like the Pepsi Challenge where you can tell the difference between Coca-Cola and Pepsi. It's just water.\"\n\nPike said the hydration stations use a Brita filtration system that dispenses cold, filtered water that is free of impurities. She said the tap water in Las Vegas is safe, but it has a harsh taste and can be unpleasant to drink.\n\nAny student can walk up to the station and fill up their container of water for free, which Pike claims will help UNLV reduce waste.\n\n\"I have a very big passion for reduce, reuse, refill,\" Pike said. \"This is a reduce thing.\"\n\nPike stated that only 12 percent of bottled water containers are recycled. She said reducing and reusing are far more important than recycling and encourages students to refill with their own containers.\n\nBottled water is usually considered safe by consumers, but according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which is in charge of regulating bottled water, there are some potential risks because bottled water does not undergo the same testing and reporting as tap water.\n\nThe FDA recommends that consumers who have compromised immune systems thoroughly read bottled water labels to make sure that the appropriate water treatment has been used, such as reverse osmosis, distillation or filtration using an absolute one micro filter.\n\nRobert Cochrane, graduate assistant at UNLV, said he thinks the hydration stations are a good idea and said reusing is the best the way to go.\n\n\"I bring a sport bottle everywhere I go just to reduce my use of plastic bottles,\" Cochrane said. \"I think it's wonderful to be able to get good, clean fresh water.\"\n\nHydration Stations are located in Beam Hall, Ham Fine Arts Building, the Campus Services Complex and the Shadow Lane Campus.\n\nNew stations are expected to arrive soon in the Student Union, the Recreation and Wellness Center, Classroom Building Complex, Carlson Education Building, William Boyd School of Law, the Lied Athletic Complex, the Cottage Grove parking structure and the first and second floors of Lied Library.\n\nThere are also plans to install hydration stations in the Tonopah and Dayton residence halls."

      "text": "Saskatoon was incorporated as a village in 1901, and by 1903 had a population of 113. The next few years brought a rush of settlers into the district, and by 1906 the population grew to 5,000 making Saskatoon a city.\n\nIt was in that year that a combined power plant and water treatment plant was built at Avenue H and 11th Street, the site of the present Water Treatment Plant. Steam-driven pumps were used to raise the water from the river to a clay-lined sedimentation basin and detention chamber. The water was then drawn from the basin and pumped directly to the City mains by a steam driven high lift pump. In 1910 and 1911, new electrically-driven centrifugal pumps were installed and a fully equipped rapid sand filtration plant was built. This original filter plant, although upgraded in many ways, is still in service today. The Water Treatment Plant has undergone numerous improvements and expansions to serve the growing population and increasing demand for water from both the industrial/commercial and residential consumers. The most substantial growth period has been in the years following 1948, in which the plant capacity has more than tripled.\n\nWater is taken directly from the South Saskatchewan River through newly commissioned (2012) intakes at a spur dike across from the Queen Elizabeth Power Station. It is screened and then pumped to the Water Treatment Plant. Back-up intakes and low lift pumps, also located at the Water Treatment Plant, are only used during maintenance shutdowns and emergencies.\n\nScreen Chamber\n\nUsed only when the Low Lift is active, this chamber removes large debris such as wood from the water and allows some sand to settle out. This facility received a full upgrade in 2010 and is operating very efficiently.\n\nLow Lift Station\n\nSeven different pumps, including two emergency pumps provide raw water to the Water Treatment Plant as a backup during power failures.\n\nSand Separator\n\nWater from the low lifts are moved through large cyclonic separators to remove smaller particles of sand down to 75 microns. Potassium permanganate is added to the raw water prior to the clarification process. Potassium permanganate is used to eliminate taste and odor problems caused mainly from organic constituents.\n\nClarifiers\n\nThe water then enters the clarifiers, where it is mixed with ferric sulphate and lime. Lime reacts with the hardness in the water to form insoluble carbonates and hydroxides that settle out in the process. Ferric sulphate reacts with particles in the water and the lime to coagulate into a large particle (floc) which becomes heavier than the water and settles out. This process is called floculation.\n\nThe clarifier floc concentration is carefully controlled and maintained as a dense circulating slurry. The clear water is drawn off the outer top of the clarifier through radial launders, while the floc settles and concentrates in the center mixing zone of the clarifier. Excess sludge is flushed back to the Residuals Management Facility. Water quality is monitored under these carefully controlled conditions.\n\nChlorine Contact Basin\n\nChlorine & sodium silico fluoride are added just prior to the water's entrance into a large contact basin. Chlorine is added to disinfect the water while fluoride is added to assist in the prevention of tooth decay.The contact basin provides the necessary time for disinfection reactions and further clarification through settling.\n\nFiltration\n\nThe water is then filtered through dual media filters (sand and crushed coal [anthracite]). The filtration rates are carefully controlled in attempts to maintain water turbidity of less than 0.1 NTU.\n\nFollowing filtration, ammonia hydroxide is added. The ammonia combines with the free chlorine (previously added) to form chloramines. Chloramines have a lower disinfection capability than chlorine but remain active for a much longer period of time. This extended activity permits disinfection to continue throughout the distribution system.\n\nClear Well\n\nOnce the water has passed through the filters, it is retained in the clear well storage beneath the Water Treatment Plant . This water is used for backwashing filters and supplying finished water to the high lift pumps. The Avenue H Reservoir is across the street from the Water Treatment Plant and is used as an extension of this clear well.\n\nHigh Lift Station\n\nThe high lift pumps draw the treated water from the clear well and pump it to the distribution system. The pumps maintain a pressure of 690kPa or 100psi in the domestic water lines that they feed. The high lift pumps also move the water to the reservoirs.\n\nReservoirs\n\nThe City of Saskatoon currently has two water reservoirs, for use when the demand is greater than the plant output. They are located on Acadia Drive and on 42nd Street. These two reservoirs are filled by the high lift pumps and have their own pumps to supply pressure to the distribution system. When pumping out of the reservoir, each reservoir has a pumphouse to pump water back into the distribution system. The pumps in the reservoirs can also be used as booster stations to continue to supply water at the appropriate pressure to the City.\n\nResidual Management Facility\n\nResiduals from the backwash water, filters, clarifiers, and chlorine contact basin go to two sumps in the basement of the facility. Residuals are concentrated in a thickener where the residual is concentrated by removing water in a similar process to the clarifiers. The concentrated residual is pumped to two filter presses where the remaining water is pressed out of it. The solid filter cake is removed and hauled by truck to the Saskatoon Landfill. The water from the thickener and the filter presses are returned to the back wash water sump. This water is pumped to a clarifier in the facility where clear water comes off the top and is dechlorinated before it is returned to the river, the sludge produced from this part of the process is returned to the residuals sump."

      "text": "Some universities across the nation are out to prove that being green does not have to be extreme. They've found a new way to stay hydrated, save money and reduce waste. They're popping up everywhere - in offices and airports and schools. They're called hydration stations and they're putting a cap on bottled water use. \"You can just take your water bottle there, go and fill it up with some clean water. Sounds like a good idea to me,\" says one student. But they still have some students puzzled. \"Isn't it just like a water fountain or something?\" says another student. In fact it's different than a fountain. .A hydration station is a sensor-powered filtered fill-up station. It has a spigot, a fill rate three times faster than a regular drinking fountain and another eco-friendly feature. \"It also keeps track of how many water bottles are technically saved throughout the use of the hydration stations,\" says Matt Bakke, Former Student Body President. It counts the number of disposable bottles those taking over landfills and littering roadways avoided. \"To help save on plastic and encourage people to you know just refill water at a hydration station rather than purchasing another one,\" says Bakke. And the university says they're already paying off. \"The recycling component has gotten to be fairly expensive and it's just an easy way to actually reduce the amount of bottles that have to be recycled,\" says Larry Zitzow, Director of Facilities Management. The International Bottled Water Association says bottled water consumption rose three point five percent last year. Americans average about 28 gallons of bottled water per person. That's about 180 bottles per person per year. \"I do think that not only UND but nationwide we're going to see a huge trend downward of using plastic bottles,\" says Zitzow. So the next time you feel thirsty you may want to take it to the tap and think outside the bottle. Filtered tap water may also be a safer choice. Studies by the Environmental Working Group found fertilizer pharmaceuticals disinfectants and other chemicals in bottled water.\n\nCoupons can be found in the paper online or in the mail. They are changing the way some people shop and making some businesses wonder if they should change their couponing policies. This: (sound of cash register beeping) is music to the ears of couponers. \"I have a variety of coupons for cosmetics, food, and toothpaste. All of the above,\" says one shopper. Their bill is being reduced, which means cash going back into their pockets. \"We have a lot of people coming and asking with coupons in hand and looking for things. I mean every day we are all asked about something, where do we find this where do we find that,\" says Ron Fischer, Grocery Store Bakery Manager. Clipping coupons can be hard work and a time committed task. \"It's a good way for the economy and helping each household out but it is a lot of time consuming,\" says another shopper. There is coupon clipping and then there is a whole other level. Extreme couponers can put anywhere from 40 to 50 hours a week into their money saving habit. \"She went to our Alco store, and they mark things way down. She saved 5000 dollars,\" says another shopper. Many stores now have limits to their coupon use. \"Target coupons policy is one manufacture coupon and one target coupon per item,\" says Amy Nelson, Target Manager. Other restrictions include \"clearing the shelf\" and doubling up coupons which consist of using a manufacturer's coupons combination with a stores coupon to help create multiple layers of savings. Extreme couponers are rare but coupons are a great way to get people in the stores and to save money. The consulting firm Inmar says coupon redemption surged 27 percent in 2009 up to three-point three billion coupons used.\n\nSome people run only when being chased, others only to their car in the cold winter months. But there are some people who run for fun. It's a crisp fall morning and the sun is just rising. Many are still in bed but some people are lacing up their running shoes. Running USA reports that running has increased to 13 million from 10 million runners in 2005. \"My motivation changes all the time, sometimes it is to get in shape for a run, sometimes it's to relieve stress, sometimes it's just to go out and spend some time with some friends,\" says Stacey Kusler: Race director. Running USA says road races have increased 43% in the past decade. While some runners have been passionate about the sport for years, there are many first-timers crossing the finish line too. Stacey: Race director. \"I think these races, the smaller ones are easier for brand new runners to go to vs. a bigger,\" says Kusler. Competitive running can have many benefits like improving your health, supporting a great cause, or checking something off your bucket list. Kids are even lacing up their shoes to keep up with mom and dad. \"This year we have turned it into a family event. If you have kids you want to push in strollers or parents want to run with their 5 year old kids they can do that,\" says Julie Kirkeby Race Director. And some children continue to follow after their parent's footsteps. \"They did it when we were young growing up and my dad was a big marathon runner so it's kind of cool to do something he's done for a big part of his life,\" says Ann Arnason. Running is a healthy, and for many a fun way to exercise. It is a sport you can start at your own pace to make it your finish line. Running USA reports that more women run 5-K's, 10-K's and half-marathons than men. However men make up 59 percent of marathon runners.\n\nHeavy metal bands of the 70's and 80's introduced people to music and antics that were unforgettable. One man embraced the character of a hard rock legend and with the help of his band; relive those days of classic hard rock. Zombies, Music, and Fun. In Grand Forks, North Dakota that means Zombie Music Festival. Something other than flesh is making these zombies come flocking. \"Sharon!\" says Mikaul Ault, Singer and Ozzy Osbourne Impersonator. This man may appear to be the legendary Prince of Darkness, but he is actually a singer living a double life. \"I'm Mikaul and I portray the character of Ozzy Osbourne.\" Mikaul Ault has been singing with the band Aultimate Ozzy for a long time now, \"About 300 years, 380 years to be exact, dog years,\" says Ault. Mikaul's uncanny resemblance to Ozzy made it his destiny to create a tribute band. \"Look at me, it's a curse! It is a blessing and curse all rolled into one,\" says Ault. A blessing for Ozzy fans to see the next best thing. \"The minute I hit the stage I am Ozzy and the minute I walk off I'm Mikaul again,\" says Ault. His fans seem to think so too. \"If you listened to the lead singer and then a song from actual Ozzy Osbourne, the band is identical, this band is just like the real thing,\" says Jeremy Storey, Zombie Jailer. And with this crowd Aultimate Ozzy seems to fit in perfectly. \"What better artist can you have play at Zombie Fest then Ozzy? The word is getting out everywhere we go. We are just killing them. These people are already dead; it's just a no-brainer,\" Aultimate Ozzy, The Band. Although this band may not be one of the walking dead or even the rock legend they imitate, their tribute to Ozzy is certainly enough to arouse this undead crowd. In past performances Mikaul would pretend to bite the head off a bird. Ozzy Osbourne fans would of course recognize this as one of the original rocker's infamous moments..\n\nResilience can come in many forms. A tragedy struck last spring when a fire broke out and although there were no people injured, there was one victim, Sherlock Park. \"It was shocking at first, when I received the phone call actually from my husband, you know I just didn't believe it at first,\" Penny Pape. Penny Pape and her Daughter Katie decided that there would be too big a void in the community with too many memories of Sherlock park. \"They all have some kind of experience here whether it was with friends or birthday parties or grandparent,\" says Katie Nelson, Coordinator. And knowing the true effort of planning and building, they had no problem getting the community together again to make the playground bigger and better. Penny who came up with idea for the original playground back in 2002, had as much support this time as she did during the first construction. \"A lot of the same committee members came on board, which made it really easy and the other ones that were new just stepped right in and ran with the project,\" says Pape. Penny and Katie, along with hundreds of volunteers worked almost non-stop for a week to make Sherlock Park the magical place it once was. \"It's phenomenal, how it's all pulling together and the community is helping everyone,\" says Cheryl Wolff, Volunteer. Even area kids showed their support. \"There's a young girl and she sold lemonade and her grandpa and uncle matched what she sold and she sold over 500 dollars,\" says Pape. Penny and Katie didn't just help rebuild a playground made out of plastic and wood they helped rebuild a symbol of a community that unifies everyone in it. Volunteers of all ages donated and came to help rebuild. The playground is now finished and a ribbon cutting ceremony was held to welcome everyone back to play.\n\nPlanting trees has many benefits. They absorb Carbon Dioxide, act as windbreakers, and can even reduce noise pollution in a city. And fall can even be the best time to plant trees. \"The only difference in spring planting and summer or fall is availability there's not as many plants available at this time of year,\" Darlene Shea, Nursery Co-Owner. If you plant trees in the spring-it can be difficult for roots to establish before the summer heat. The soil during the autumn months is at an optimal temperature and moisture levels that promote rapid root growth. \"We have even planted after we have had a first snowfall because the plants will adjust well to the ground as long as it's not frozen cause that's the warmest part of the year is fall,\" says Shea. Less stress is put on the plants when fall planting. This allows the tree to build a healthy root system so; the tree is able to grow bigger next spring. But there's one important thing to make this work. \"One of the important factors in fall planting is to make sure you water quite well because the plants are going to need the moisture to get through the winter so they do not dehydrate,\" says Shea. The benefits of planting trees are fall soil is warmer and more conditioned making root growth easier, milder temperatures and more dependable rainfall help plants acclimate faster, and trees planted in the fall are better equipped to deal with the heat and drought in the following season."

      "text": "Archive | Chemicals in Water\n\nAn Introduction to Chemicals in Water\n\nChemicals in water come in a variety of forms, safe and unsafe, organic and inorganic. They also come from a variety of sources, from pollution to water treatment.\n\nOrganic and Inorganic Chemicals in Water\n\nWhile some chemicals in water are harmless at lower concentrations, many chemicals in water are toxic. Chemicals in water come in two basic varieties, organic and inorganic. Organic chemicals in water are chemicals that can naturally occur. These include chemicals from food processing waste, petroleum products, and cosmetics. Inorganic chemicals are chemicals that do not naturally occur. Some inorganic chemicals in water come from heavy metals from industrial by-products, cars, and fertilizers.\n\nChemicals in Water: Water Treatment\n\nWe think of water treatment as a process that removes chemicals from water, purifying it. However, in the process of eliminating the chemical contaminants in water, water treatment also adds some chemicals in water. Water treatment is applied not only to drinking water, but also to water that's used for industrial, medical, and other purposes. The goal of water treatment is to make water safe enough to return to natural environments without causing negative ecological effects. Water treatment can refer to water settling and filtration, but it can also refer to the chemical processes of disinfection, desalination and coagulation. Contaminants in water include bacteria, viruses, and chemical pollutants like fertilizers. Water treatment is hugely important because waterborne diseases kill 1.8 million people each year.\n\nNaturally Occurring Chemicals in Water\n\nChemicals in water do not necessarily constitute water pollution. Some chemicals can naturally occur in water (like sodium and calcium, for instance). However, even these chemicals can harm us and Earth's ecosystems if they are too highly concentrated.\n\nWhat Are Phthalates: An Introduction\n\nMany readers may be wondering, \"What are phthalates?\" Phthalates are a group of petroleum-based chemicals that were originally developed to make plastics more flexible. Nearly all people in industrialized and developing countries carry varying amounts of phthalate compounds in their bodies. However, phthalates have also been found to disrupt hormones in animals and humans. Because we use plastics in virtually every part of our lives, we may limit our exposure to phthalates, but never completely eliminate it.\n\nWhat Are Phthalates: Common Uses of Phthalates\n\nOnce we understand what are phthalates, we must understand what they're used for. Phthalates are chemicals that can be found in anything plastic. Food packaging, nail polish, vinyl tiling, garden hoses, shampoos and insect repellent all contain phthalates. In fact, the coveted \"new car smell\" is actually the smell of phthalates vaporizing as plastic parts are exposed to heat. Given our constant exposure to phthalates, it is unsurprising that these chemicals affect human health.\n\nWhat are Phthalates: Health Risks of Phthalates\n\nWhat are phthalates? Dangerous. Phthalates are hormone disruptors. Phthalate exposure in the womb shortens gestation, lowers male children's sperm count and in female children causes endocrine problems that lead to premature breast development. This is especially worrying because, according to a 2000 study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, women of child-bearing age receive twenty times more phthalate exposure than any other segment of the population. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has regulated phthalates as water and air pollutants since 2005. In lab animals, phthalate exposure again lowers sperm count and also causes birth defects and testicular atrophy.\n\nWhat Are Phthalates: How to Avoid Phthalates\n\nAlthough research has proven phthalates' devastating health consequences for animals, research has not yet proven phthalates' health consequences for humans to an extent that would sufficiently justify banning phthalates' usage. However, you can lessen your phthalate exposure in several ways. Avoid products with artificial fragrances, as these products likely contain phthalates. Shop for personal care items that are labeled \"phthalate-free.\" If a product's label lists di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) or diethyl phthalate (DEP) among its ingredients, put it back on the shelf.\n\nWhat Are Phthalates: Common Products That Contain Phthalates\n\nThe Environmental Working Group (EWG) has published a list of 210 common household items that contain phthalates. This list can be accessed at their website and used as a guide to the products you should watch out for. The EWG also publishes a parents' guide to phthalate-free childcare products.\n\nChlorine in Water\n\nChlorine is commonly used to disinfect our water. However, chlorine in water can also harm us. Because of this, we need to learn how to remove the chlorine in water, or how to entirely replace chlorine usage in our water treatment.\n\nWhy Chlorine Is Added into Our Water Supply\n\nChlorine is well-known and widely used to disinfect our water. Chlorine in water deactivates various pathogenic microorganisms (like bacteria or viruses), which cause illness. Authorities chlorinate public water supplies in order to kill the hazardous bacteria present in our water or water pipes. In addition to disinfecting water, chlorine is also used to disinfect various home and hospital areas and to bleach fabrics. We have used chlorine in water as a disinfectant for over two hundred years.\n\nHow Chlorine in Water Can Hurt Us\n\nAlthough chlorine can disinfect our water, it can also hurt us if ingested. Chlorine in water can form into toxins called trihalomethanes (THMs); THMs correlate with diseases like asthma, eczema, bladder cancer, and heart diseases. Studies have shown that drinking large amounts of chlorinated tap water dramatically increasespregnant women's risk of miscarriages and birth defects.\n\nHow We Can Remove Chlorine from Water\n\nCarbon filters remove chlorine, THMs, and other harmful contaminants from our water. Additionally, while they produce the same excellent water quality that electronic filters produce, carbon filters are much cheaper. You can also remove chlorine and other contaminants from water without a home filtration system by placing water in an uncovered container and leaving it inside your refrigerator for twenty-four hours.\n\nWater Treatment Alternatives to Chlorine in Water\n\nAlthough we need to disinfect our water, we don't need to use chlorine to do so. Several Canadian and European cities are disinfecting their water using the ozone instead of chlorine. Some cities in the United States, like Las Vegas and Santa Clara, are also switching to this alternative. However, the easiest way to get rid of the chlorine in water is simply to filter it out.\n\nOil and water don't mix. The effect of an oil spill on water ecosystems is far-reaching, and while some of the effects can be seen immediately, other impacts take years to be fully understood. Between 1989, when the Exxon Valdez ran aground, spilling 750,000 of Prudhoe crude into Alaska's Prince William Sound and 2010, when a blowout preventer failed on BP's Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico, little has been done to improve spill prevention or cleanup procedures.\n\nThe Negative Effects of an Oil Spill\n\nSea and shore birds and marine life like dolphins, sea turtles, otters, penguins and sea lions are coated with oil as they land on or swim through a spill. A harmful effect of an oil spill is that fur and feathers lose their insulating properties, leading to death from hypothermia. For the animals that survive, long term effects include cancers, infections and spontaneously aborted offspring.\n\nAnother effect of an oil spill is fish kills. Fish swim through the spill and become coated with oil. Unable to absorb oxygen through their gills, the fish die. Fish farther from the spill consume contaminated fish and plant life. Contamination of spawning grounds decimates the species' ability to recover.\n\nSpilled oil then moves with tides and winds, creating large, oxygen-free zones that kill everything in their paths. Oil enters every part of the food chain, from plankton to fish to animals that eat fish, including humans.\n\nPerhaps the worst effect of an oil spill is the destruction of wetlands. Not only did the BP spill destroy nesting grounds for hundreds of species of migrating birds, it destroyed the plants that form the delicate wetland ecosystem. Wetlands are a critical part of dispersing storm surges from hurricanes, leaving port cities like New Orleans even more vulnerable to harm.\n\nHow Oil Spills are Cleaned Up\n\nBooms made of absorbent materials are used to keep surface oil in a contained area. Oil is then skimmed or pumped into container ships. Controlled burning has also been done. Chemical dispersants are sprayed to break up oil, causing it to sink to the bottom. None of these methods is particularly effective, and all create an additional effect of an oil spill on water. It is worth noting that cleanup measures are generally developed by oil companies, and have not changed substantially in the years between the Exxon catastrophe and the BP disaster.\n\nPreventing Future Oil Spills\n\nImproved safety and regulation enforcement for both ships and drilling rigs is sorely needed to prevent another catastrophe. An inexpensive redesign of the blowout preventer on BP's Deepwater Horizon rig would have prevented the release of 172 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nMany people wonder how good the water quality in their area is. When water contains contaminants, it leaves behind tiny particles that are dissolved in the water, particles that are called \"total dissolved solids.\" This map charts total dissolved solids in the water. Although this chart doesn't show exactly which contaminants are present in your water and whether they're bad for you, it's still a good measure of water purity.\n\nFluoride in water supplies is quite a controversial topic these days. As with nearly every topic, there are two sides of the fluoride debate. Some believe fluoride to be beneficial, especially in oral health and overall costs. Others, however, believe the possible side effects of fluoride in the water to be far too risky and even unethical.\n\nFluoride in Water Fights Tooth Decay\n\nAccording to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), fluorides prevents tooth decay. Bacterias from certain foods create acids which eat away the natural minerals lining the teeth. Fluoride restores the minerals, preventing further damage to the tooth, and even helping to restore damaged teeth. When it is in the water supply, teeth are repeatedly exposed to the fluoride, allowing for frequent protection. Tooth decay has become extremely prevalent, especially in children and teenagers. Half of teens, ages 12-15, have at least one cavity. Fluoridated water can be very beneficial to people of every age, as studies have shown that over a person's lifetime, tooth decay can be reduced by 25 percent.\n\nFluoride in Water Saves Money\n\nDue to the consistent protection teeth receive through fluoridated water, overall costs of oral health decrease. The outright cost to fluoridate water is about .50 per person, based on a city of 20,000 or more. The CDC claims that \"every $1 invested in this preventive measure yields approximately $38 savings in dental treatment costs.\" Fluoridated water is more cost effective than obtaining fluoride from other means, such as toothpaste or mouth washes, though these methods still provide the same protection.\n\nRisks of Fluoride in Water\n\nNot everyone is convinced that fluoride is beneficial, however, and believe the risks and potential side effects of fluoride outweigh the benefits. Some studies show that fluoride can potentially cause cancer, lower the IQ, cause changes in bone structure and inhibit the immune system. One study in the United Kingdom showing that miscarriages and birth defects were 15 percent more likely in areas with fluoridated water, compared to those without it. Additionally, in this fluoridated city, Down's Syndrome was 30 percent more likely. Like everything, fluoride has potential side effects, but that does not mean that these side effects will come to fruition. The CDC has deemed use of fluoride safe, though risks do still exist.\n\nThe Verdict on Fluoride in Water\n\nThough there are benefits to fluoride in water supplies, there are also risks to be accounted for before deciding one way or another.\n\nGovernment water treatment plants add aluminum in water supplies, along with chlorination, to insure the purity and safety of the nation's drinking water. Aluminum is used as a clearing agent to remove dangerous viruses, parasites and bacteria that are resistant to chlorination. If the water treatment process is done correctly, most aluminum is gone by the time water reaches us. But what happens when the level of aluminum in drinking water is allowed to remain above the 200 micrograms per liter that is recommended? How does aluminum in our drinking water effect our health? Can we remove aluminum from our tap water? These are questions we need answers for.\n\nHow Does Aluminum in Water Collect?\n\nSome aluminum in water occurs naturally, some can be from factory run off and some is put in the water by water treatment plants to remove impurities and microorganisms that cause disease. With the correct treatment, aluminum in the water after this process should be equal to untreated water. Aluminum in water becomes a problem only when the levels are too high. It is recommended, by environmental officials and the World Health Organization, that the level of aluminum not exceed 200 micrograms per liter of drinking water.\n\nHow Does Too Much Aluminum in Water Hurt Us?\n\nWith high levels of aluminum in water the population can be at risk for nervous system disorders, ADD, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Lou Gehrig's disease. Studies are still being done to confirm this. Dr Prolo, a researcher with The University of California, Los Angeles campus, found that in regions of Italy where the levels of aluminum in water are highest, there were more cases of Alzheimer's disease than in areas with lower levels of aluminum in the water. The levels of all types of aluminum in that water were from 5 to 1,220 micrograms per liter. More studies are needed to find the true health risk of aluminum in our water and what levels are dangerous.\n\nHow Can We Remove Aluminum in Water?\n\nWater treatment plants can take steps to keep aluminum at lower levels. Some studies have found that if a level of soluble silicone is maintained in public drinking water, it will protect people from aluminum in the water. The public can use water treatment devices in their homes to get rid of aluminum in the water. Reverse osmosis and distillation water treatment systems are effective. Water softeners and whole house water treatment systems remove aluminum from the water. You can also use under sink reverse osmosis units, or counter top filtration units attached to the faucet. You can also take food supplements like calcium, magnesium or iron to block aluminum absorption in your body. Aluminum in water is unnecessary for treatment.\n\nCadmium is a type of metal that is often found in natural deposits, including ores that contain other elements. It is commonly used for metal plating and coating, photography, and the creation of certain types of machinery. At times, there is cadmium in water supplies, which can have negative health side effects for those who drink it. Below is some basic information about cadmium and what can happen if it enters the water supply in dangerous amounts.\n\nHow Does Cadmium in Water Collect?\n\nCadmium can enter the drinking water in a number of ways. Primarily, it comes from waste released by large-scale metal-producing companies and enters into streams or runoff from landfills. Cadmium in water supplies also often comes from the corrosion of galvanized pipes. The pipes may have eroded and begin to allow this dangerous substance to seep into the water.\n\nHow Will Drinking Cadmium in Water Hurt You?\n\nAccording to the EPA's guidelines for maximum contaminant level goals (MCLG), cadmium consumption becomes dangerous after it reaches 5 parts per billion (ppb). If more than this amount of cadmium in water is consumed, there can be some negative side effects including nausea and, with long-term exposure, kidney disease. Infants and young children are always at higher risk for becoming ill due to exposure to cadmium, so they should always receive properly filtered water for consumption.\n\nHow Can I Remove the Cadmium in Water?\n\nThe most common way to remove cadmium from the water is by using a water filtration system. These can be purchased at any home supply store, and will eliminate the dangerous toxins in your water supply. In order for these water filters to be effective, you must change the filters regularly. Also, consistently check the water delivery pipes for your home to make sure that they are not becoming eroded or cracked.\n\nHow Can I Detect the Cadmium in Water?\n\nIn 1974, Congress passed the Safe Drinking Water Act in order to enforce measures that would ultimately lead to safe drinking water supplies. This requires that water service suppliers regularly check their sources for harmful toxins and to make their findings public. Tests are run each year to check the water supply for harmful elements, including cadmium. If you have any questions regarding the quality of the water supply for your home, contact your local water supplier to find out more information. They will be able to provide you copies of the yearly reports that you may examine to see what types of elements are in your water supply. Tests like these can help you eliminate the cadmium in water.\n\nLead is a heavy metal found in natural deposits and for many years it was used in homes for plumbing lines or water service lines. Today, it is widely known that lead exposure can be toxic, and at times corroded pipes may allow the entrance of lead in water, allowing lead to enter the tap water that many people drink every day. This can have many negative side effects, especially in children. It may also contribute to negative health effects for adults, including high blood pressure or kidney problems.\n\nHow Does Lead in Water Collect?\n\nLead can enter into drinking water in a number of ways. Primarily, lead enters through cracks in water service lines or plumbing. Many homes built before 1986 often have lead pipes that may also contribute to the amount of lead in a water supply. To avoid this, always have your plumbing lines checked regularly for leaks or cracks.\n\nLead in Water Risks\n\nThe health risks associated with lead in water are most dangerous for children, especially those under six years of age. Exposure to lead in water supplies can often cause mental deficits or a shorter attention span. Lead exposure may also cause miscarriages in women who are pregnant. For adults who have experienced prolonged exposure to lead poisoning, the side effects may include kidney damage or increased blood pressure, which may also cause heart disease or heart attack later in life.\n\nAvoid Exposure to Lead in Water\n\nAccording to the EPA, the maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG) for lead in the water supply is zero. This means that there is no safe level to which people should be exposed to lead. However, lead does creep into the water supply from time to time, and there are a couple of precautions to take to avoid dangerous exposure to this substance. First of all, it is recommended to purchase a water filter for tap water locations in your home. Bottled water and other sources of purified water are also acceptable alternatives to drinking contaminated tap water. If you have young children, be sure that they drink only purified, clean water in order to avoid health risks.\n\nRead Local Reports on Lead in Water\n\nLocal water companies are required to produce yearly reports on the water supplies and to provide them to consumers. One way to avoid drinking contaminated water is to read these reports regularly and to stay updated on any changes in the quality of local water supplies. If you have any questions about lead in water in supplies near you or possible contaminants to your tap water at home, contact your local provider."

      "text": "BWQ\n\nNot so fast. Each week, before the weekend, the Environmental Protection Department rates the water quality at 33 beaches open to the public, using a four-grade classification system.\n\nThe system measures the levels of E. coli bacteria, which comes from human waste. It's not a question of whether it's present, it's a question of how much is in the water. According to the EPD:\n\nGrades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.\n\nThe grades are: 1 (Good); 2 (Fair) and 3 (Poor). A Grade 4 beach is one with an E. coli count that exceeds the threshold, regardless of the geometric mean. Grade 4 beaches ought to be rated (Nasty).\n\nGrade 1 beaches are considered safe because the E. coli mean count is less than or equal to 24 per 100ml of water. The number of cases of skin or gastrointestinal illnesses are \"undetectable\" for every 1,000 swimmers.\n\nThis means a Grade 1 beach isn't as big a toilet as a Grade 3, but all beaches fluctuate. A spokesman warned:\n\n... many beaches were likely to be more polluted than their grades suggested during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a storm or heavy rainfall.\n\nWater quality is improving, but I'm not about to take a dip in the ocean; the government has a long way to go before it completes its restructuring of sewage treatment systems across Hong Kong.\n\nUntil then, swimmers can choose between a Grade 1 beach or a public swimming pool, and the beach may not be a bad choice."

      "text": "According to National Geographic, bottled water consumption is at an all-time high thanks to a recovering economy and a higher demand for convenience. Americans drink more bottled water than anyone else in the world to the tune of approximately 100 bottles per person, per year. Although the increase in bottled water consumption could indeed help with the American obesity epidemic (if consumers are replacing sodas and sugary beverages with water), it is causing significant harm to the planet.\n\nIn 2007, The New York Times reported that only an estimated one out of every four bottles of water is recycled in the United States — the rest go to landfills. Yet despite these alarming facts, more Americans are drinking bottled water than ever before, touting taste, convenience and health as reasons for reaching for the Dasani instead of the tap.\n\nThe Bottled Water Epidemic\n\nThe truth is that as many as one in four bottles of water in the U.S. are nothing more than bottled tap water. Americans are choosing to pay for a convenience that they already have. All of those disposable water bottles may be mobile and easy-to-access, but they are filling landfills unnecessarily. By simply choosing to fill a reusable water bottle instead of a disposable bottle, a family can save hundreds and even thousands of dollars per year without sacrificing quality or taste.\n\nHow to Solve the Problem\n\nSo how do you solve a multi-billion dollar problem? After all, bottled water manufacturers aren't going away anytime soon. Currently, there are two approaches being taken to lower the consumption of bottled water and help prevent billions of empty plastic bottles from being disposed of each year.\n\nThe first tactic has been to prohibit the purchase and sale of bottled water in certain areas. For example, the University of Vermont and Loyola University in Chicago are just two examples of campuses that have stopped selling bottled water to students in cafeterias, campus stores and vending machines. Even government municipalities in cities like New York and San Francisco have taken similar steps to prohibit the purchase and sale of bottled water using government funds.\n\nAlthough privatized bans on bottled water are certainly a statement to the public about the environmental dangers of bottled water and the safety of American public water supplies, the prohibitions do nothing to manage the daily bottled water consumption by the average American.\n\nMaking Tap Water More Appealing\n\nOne way of affecting the purchase of bottled water is by educating consumers on the quality of public water sources, as well as the ways reduced bottled water consumption could affect the planet. In addition to the harmful toxins released into the environment during the manufacture of plastic water bottles, more than a million pounds of that plastic is buried in the soil of landfills across the U.S.\n\nSome consumers are driven by their wallets. From a cost standpoint, tap water costs a tiny fraction of the cost of bottled water. In fact, at the going retail price of a single bottle of water, Americans are paying approximately $4 per gallon — a rate many ironically complain is far too high for gasoline.\n\nStill, it is true that many consumers do choose bottled water over tap water due to taste, as some bottled varieties come from fresh springs or are filtered to taste better than traditional tap water. If taste is a factor in choosing bottled water, there are countless home water filtration systems available to improve flavor and filter toxins and particles. Consumers can choose from refrigerator water filters, faucet filters and even water pitchers with built-in filtration systems.\n\nBased on current trends, projected bottled water consumerism will only rise in the coming years. Change must start with consumer demand and education before the environment can begin to benefit. What's your opinion on the bottled water epidemic?\n\nOne Response to \"The Environmental Cost of Bottled Water\"\n\nMike Philip\n\n12. Jun, 2012\n\nThis issue has many facets. You don't hear \"Reduce, reuse, recycle\" very often anymore, but if done in that order it does the most to reduce the impact on our environment. Recycling plastic is growing more common, which is good. There are different levels of commitment a person can do to reduce their impact. Using products with the most post consumer content is good. Reducing the amount of \"stuff\" is better; like having filtered water at home and filling reusable metal or plastic water bottles to take with you."

      "text": "Water-borne diseases on the rise due to monsoon\n\nNEW DELHI: For a city already reeling under the impact of 1,172 reported cases of cholera and 44,857 cases of gastroenteritis, the coming of the monsoon can hardly spell good news.\n\nBecause rains mean more chances of water contamination. Other diseases that make an appearance during the monsoon months include typhoid, diarrhoea, dysentry, amoebiosis, hepatitis A and E and even polio, say prominent city doctors.\n\nApart from the distribution of chlorine tablets, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, however, is not taking any special measures for the control of water-borne diseases.\n\nMunicipal health officer, Dr K N Tiwari, said, \"Rains do not necessarily mean more work for us, it is up to the sanitation department to prevent water-logging and for DJB to supply uncontaminated drinking water.\"\n\nDr Gopal Sachdev, professor of medicine, Lok Nayak Hospital, said, \"Rains inevitably mean a worsening of the quality of ground water, because of seepage of garbage and other contaminants that get dissolved with the rain water. The use of suction pumps is another hazard because unless there is a really good water flow, the pumps often tend to suck in contaminants. Ideally they should be used only for lifting water to the upper floors and not for boosting water supply per se.\"\n\nIn case the supply is really poor, he added, the water for drinking and for use in the kitchen should first be filled without using the suction pump.\n\nExplaining his warning to avoid using shallow ground water for drinking, Dr Umesh Kapil, professor of nutrition, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, said, \"The upper and the lower layers of ground water are separated by a rocky layer.\n\nThis layer, essentially acts as a filter, not allowing contaminated water from the upper layers to seep into the lower strata. But hand pumps are only about 10-15 feet deep, so they cannot take advantage of natural filter bed.\""

You should not expect a backwashing filter to be a magic, one-step solution to any problem. Often, in fact, it is the final stage of a more complex treatment system.\n\nAlthough a backwashing filter may look like a water softener and be the same size, it is altogether different. Softeners are \"ion exchangers\", not filters.\n\nA backwashing filter is a water filter that cleans itself periodically by rinsing away impurities it has filtered from water.\n\nA backwashing filter is a simple device that consists of a large tank that is filled with a filtering substance called a filter medium. (The plural is media.) Water enters the top of the tank through a special control valve and passes downward through the medium, which removes impurities and holds them. Some media do not hold impurities, but cause a change to occur. Calcite, for example, dissolves and in the process increases the pH of acidic water. The treated water then enters a tube at the bottom of the mineral tank, passes upward through the tube (called a riser), and exits the filter via the control valve.\n\nWhen the filter medium is saturated with contaminants, the control valve initiates a backwash. The backwash is an operation in which water passes backward through the filter at a rapid rate. It enters the tank at the bottom via the riser tube, then passes upward through the filter medium, exiting at the top, via the control valve. The rapid upward flow, in addition to washing away stored impurities, fluffs and resettles the medium bed, preparing it for another filtering cycle.\n\nMedia\n\nSome media have numerous applications, like the very useful and widely used GAC, or Granular Activated Carbon, which is used to remove chlorine, the by-products of chlorination, pesticides, herbicides, and chemicals in general. GAC, following proper pretreatment, also removes iron and hydrogen sulfide. It comes in various formulations made from a variety of materials (bituminous coal, coconut shells, wood, etc.), each with its own special properties.\n\nWe prefer a range non-chemically impregnated activated carbons. They have been surface modified during manufacture, to significantly enhance the carbons' capabilities for rapidly decomposing noxious compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, and chloramines.\n\nThey are all produced from high quality coconut shell carbons, and in addition to their capacity to handle sulfides etc. They have much higher surface areas than most other competitive brands. This enables them to remove larger quantities of other organic species which may be present in the system."

      "text": "7 health risks in the wake of Superstorm Sandy\n\nDoctors list carbon monoxide as the No. 1 risk\n\nMold is a concern that may develop after your home has been exposed to standing water for an extended period. Getting the water-damaged items dried and removed is important to prevent mold growth after a flood.\n\nStaying warm with no power can be a challenge, especially in winter weather.\n\nMell suggests wearing several layers of fairly loose clothing, as each layer helps to trap the warm air. Drink warm, sweet things like hot chocolate or coffee or tea with sugar to help maintain body temperature.\n\nWhen inside, try to keep the heat in and the cold out. Close off unneeded rooms, stuff towels in window cracks and under doors and cover windows with blankets. Don't drink alcohol because it causes the body to lose heat faster.\n\nIf you think someone could have hypothermia, check their temperature, call for help and lie close to them to share your own body heat. Give the person something warm to drink.\n\n5. Contaminated drinking water\n\nAccording to the New York City Department of Health, it is safe to drink tap water in an area with flooding. Sewage overflows usually do not affect water supplies in New York City, bit it's a case-by-case issue. Some local water utilities in New Jersey and Connecticut are under a \"boil-water advisory.\" But if you see or smell something odd about the water, don't drink it.\n\nMost public drinking water across the greater New York metropolitan area, including New York and Nassau and Suffolk counties, is fine to drink and does not need to be boiled, Marci Natale of the New York State Department of Health, said in an e-mail. But, she adds, some areas are experiencing problems. \"The largest problem area is Long Beach City in Nassau County, which normally serves about 35,000 people.\"\n\nThe department as of Friday was tracking 26 systems under advisories: 23 systems under boil water orders (21 caused by Sandy), and three systems under \"do not use/do not drink\" orders (all caused by Sandy)."

But concerns about lead, mercury, and other potential contaminants lurking in your water may make you think twice before taking your next sip. How can you make sure that you and your baby are drinking the purest water available?\n\nWater Pollution\n\nWater pollution occurs when the Earth's waterways become contaminated with organisms that don't belong there. More often than not, water pollution is caused by human activities, such as industrial and agricultural manufacturing, food processing, petroleum use, and the improper storage of chemicals. Water pollution has a harmful effect on drinking water supplies and on the environment as a whole.\n\nBottled Versus Tap\n\nMore than 90 percent of the water in the United States meets the tap water quality standards set forth by the EPA. Your local water authority is required by law to send you an annual report detailing the quality of your drinking water and alerting you to any contaminants that have been detected. You may even be able to access you water quality report online at the EPA's website.\n\nUnfortunately, according to the Environmental Working Group, a non-profit agency that specializes in identifying toxins, more than half of the contaminants found in local water systems are unregulated and therefore do not appear on the water tests or reports produced by water facilities. The group reported that the EPA tests and regulates less than 20 percent of the chemicals found in drinking water, 41 of which have been linked to reproductive health risks.\n\nIn 2007, American consumed more than 8.8 billion gallons of bottled water, making it the second largest commercial beverage in the country (next to carbonated beverages). According to the Earth Policy Institute, nearly a quarter of all bottled water must be transported long distances by boat, train, and truck to reach American consumers.\n\nAt one time, most Americans had no choice but to get their water from the tap. In recent years, however, sales of bottled water in the United States have exploded, largely as a result of a public perception of purity driven by advertisements and packaging labels featuring pristine glaciers and crystal-clear mountain springs.\n\nYet, according to the Natural Resource Defense Council's (NRDC) four-year study on the bottled water industry, water that comes from a bottle is no cleaner or safer than water that comes from the tap. In fact, NRDC's study found that at least 25 percent of bottled water is actually just tap water that has been packaged in a bottle.\n\nAnd bottled water takes a much greater toll on the environment than tap. Bottled water uses more energy and resources in its production and shipping than tap water, and it creates the production of disposable plastic bottles that fill up landfills at an alarming rate. Think again before purchasing bottled water. Save money and resources by carrying your own reusable bottle filled with filtered tap water instead."

      "text": "While not yet commonplace in North America, the interest in the sea as a source of municipal drinking water has increased rapidly in the last decade.\n\nFor many years, California has periodically revisited the feasibility of coastal seawater desalination plants, only to shelve the programs when rainfall and snowpack met the water resources requirements of the state.\n\nMore recently, Florida has embarked on the seawater road. Studies by the St. Johns River Water Management District (WMD) and the South Florida WMD have been completed, and a large plant built in the Tampa Bay area. A second Tampa facility has been studied, but has been postponed for the time being.\n\nWhile unfortunate, the problems experienced by the first Tampa Bay facility will undoubtedly be of long-term benefit in the design of future facilities. Just as with brackish water reverse osmosis (RO) applications, every seawater RO application is unique and very site specific. What may be the optimum solution in Tampa will not necessarily be the optimum solution in Carlsbad, or Huntington Beach or Miami.\n\nVariables include salinity, temperature, pretreatment requirements and finished water quality. Some parameters, such as materials, will be constant. Seawater is, after all, seawater. Regardless of location, the predominant component of the seawater is sodium chloride, which experience has taught us requires materials that resist attack by the chloride ion.\n\nPretreatment\nPerhaps the most critical factor in the design of a successful seawater RO facility is acquisition and pretreatment of the source water. There are two techniques for acquiring the raw water, and for a variety of reasons, both are probably not applicable to all cases. Seawater, of course, is predominately a coastal phenomenon and as such occurs alongside beaches, mudflats, swamps, cliffs and other assorted geologic features.\n\nIn most cases, it is unlikely that sufficient seawater for a large plant can be acquired from one of the many options commonly classified as \"beach wells.\" However, if the proposed plant capacity is sufficiently small (<5 mgd), extracting the seawater feed from a beach well or through a constructed infiltration gallery is preferable to open intake because the pretreatment challenges will be less demanding.\n\nFor large plants, surface water intake facilities are required. These are similar to intakes used for coastal power plant cooling water, and are governed by a variety of regulatory requirements connected to the protection of fauna in the marine environment. If the desalination facility is to be collocated with an existing power plant, this intake protocol is already in place, and the feedwater can be extracted from the existing cooling water system. The power plant intake is designed to remove the large chunks, and exclude fish and other marine life, but beyond that will still contain a significant quantity of suspended solids and small marine life such as plankton.\n\nAssuming the feed source is an open seawater intake, the proposed pretreatment scheme must consider the following:\n\nControl of plugging and colloidal fouling;\n\nControl of organic fouling; and\n\nControl of biological activity and fouling.\n\nTraditionally, seawater pretreatment has consisted of flocculation and coagulation with a ferric salt, sometimes applied in conjunction with a polymer, sedimentation and filtration. Depending upon the circumstances, a continuous chlorination and dechlorination procedure sometimes is employed. Intermittent chlorination and dechlorination is also practiced. Chloramination has been used in the Middle East, and is being tested in pilot scale elsewhere.\n\nFiltration has typically been practiced as a two-stage process using dual or multi-media beds. Traditionally, the first filter operates at a relatively low loading rate of 3 to 5 gpm/ft2, while the polishing filter operates at a higher 5 to 7 gpm/ft2. When sizing the filtration equipment, capacity for the production of backwash water must be included.\n\nOther filtration methods have been employed over the years. Currently, membrane filtration is receiving a lot of attention. The Bureau of Reclamation has been sponsoring pilot testing at locations in Texas and California. The modifications currently underway at Tampa Bay will include a pre-coated microfiltration system as the final polishing step for the feedwater. As work progresses on these and other programs, the industry is awaiting the arrival of long-term operating data with anticipation.\n\nMembrane filtration systems are normally supplied complete with automatic controls for backwashing, and in the case of hollow-fiber devices, online membrane integrity testing.\n\nIt should be noted that in a typical membrane filtration application, some form of coarse screening is employed ahead of the membrane system to protect it from large debris. This would not be necessary if the system was preceded by a media filter, but it is present when taking water from a surface water source directly in to the membrane system.\nBiological and organic fouling must also be controlled through the pretreatment process. Disinfection using chlorine, chloramine or ultrafiltration must be carefully designed and integrated into the process.\n\nDesign considerations\nThe effect of water temperature on RO membrane operations is well understood. In the push to lower the cost of seawater desalting, a popular approach has been to collocate the desalination facility with a power plant. This approach can significantly reduce the capital cost by sharing the power plant cooling water system for feedwater intake and concentrate disposal. An added avantage is reducing process energy but taking advantage of the elevated temperature of the outgoing cooling water. In many cases, this can be as high as 100 to 104˚F. There are several drawbacks to this approach that must be considered in process design.\n\nHigh temperature makes biological fouling control more challenging;\n\nThe solubility of calcium carbonate with temperature is an inverse function;\n\nThere is a significant increase in salt passage with temperature; and\n\nThere is the possibility of permanent flux decline due to compaction of the support structure of the membrane.\n\nRecovery\nThe third process parameter that must be considered is recovery. Recovery is defined as the ratio of permeate flow to feedwater flow. One of the key factors is the impact of recovery on the concentration factor, and thus the osmotic pressure on the concentrate side of the membranes. In the case of seawater systems, where the salt rejection of the membranes is very high, the concentration factor can be based on 100% salt rejection. Therefore, the impact of the recovery on concentration factor can be seen.\n\nHistorically, the goal in seawater membrane development was to produce a membrane that combined good specific flux with high sodium chloride rejection. Since the first composite polyamide membranes installed in a plant in the late 1970s, there has been a continuous improvement in seawater RO membrane performance. With early membranes, recovery was limited to about 30% to produce a permeate of <500 mg/TDS.\n\nCurrently, commercially available seawater membranes combine good specific flux with exceptional salt rejection, so much so that single pass desalting to produce drinking water quality permeate can be achieved at higher than historic recoveries. This advance has had the beneficial effect of significantly reducing the power requirement of the RO feed pump; however, increased recovery has its drawbacks. Because of the almost perfect concentration factors, and because the osmotic pressure is such a significant factor in defining seawater RO costs, operating at the highest possible recovery may not always be the most cost-effective option.\n\nClearly there is an energy advantage in increasing recovery. This has always been the case in RO operations. It can be seen that even at 60% recovery, in a single stage the permeate quality is still acceptable. However, the pressure required drives the mechanical components of the system into the next pressure class, and the values of first and last element flux must be viewed with some apprehension.\n\nClearly a more technically sound approach to high recovery would be to go to a two-stage system, with interstage boost.\n\nEnergy recovery\nThe use of energy recovery devices in seawater RO systems is now virtually universal, even for smaller systems. Every cost study performed has shown that the payback period is relatively short, although the devices are relatively costly. Efficiencies have improved, and the materials used allow for a reasonably long life and relatively low maintenance requirements.\n\nThere are basically two types of devices in widespread use today—the work exchanger and the pressure exchanger. The work exchanger converts the work available in the exiting concentrate into a feedwater pressure boost. The rough calculation is fairly easily performed. The restraint on the recovery of the brine work content is the efficiency of the device itself, with typical efficiencies ranging from about 70 to more than 85%, depending on the device chosen and the conditions of its application. The pressure exchanger, as its name implies, converts the pressure in the outlet concentrate stream to an equal or slightly lower pressure on the feedwater. Because there has been a pressure loss in the system, a boost pump is required to add back the lost pressure. This requires that the feed flow into the system be split, with a flow equal to the permeate flow going to the RO feed pump, and a flow equal to the concentrate flow going to the work exchanger and then through the boost pump. Two manufacturers are commonly considered, and the device efficiencies are generally 85 to 90%.\n\nAs with other process design considerations, the application of each type of device to a specific site must be carefully evaluated. Recoverable energy in the concentrate stream can represent 30 to 45% of the energy input needed for the RO system. This is a significant benefit, particularly in areas where electric power costs are high, and represents a significant reduction in overall water cost.\n\nPost treatment\nPost treatment of the permeate generated by a seawater RO system is very critical because the permeate is essentially a dilute solution of sodium chloride, devoid of hardness and alkalinity, and with an aggressive pH. The occurrence of trace components, such as boron (WHO limit is 0.5 mg/L), is also important, and may require that part of the permeate receive additional treatment in the form of a third-pass RO system, or a process such as selective ion exchange. Other considerations may be in the future because WHO is in the midst of a study of the health effects of drinking desalinated seawater.\n\nAs far as stability is concerned, calcium hardness and bicarbonate alkalinity must be added to permeate, together with some pH adjustment, to protect the distribution system and domestic plumbing from corrosion. If the water is to be introduced into an existing system with other sources of drinking water, it may be necessary to match the quality of the two waters. This may require additional desalting to further reduce chlorides.\n\nTo successfully add bicarbonate alkalinity to the RO permeate, carbon dioxide (CO2) must be present in the water. Lime slurries or granular limestone beds may be used to introduce calcium hydroxide to the water, but CO2 must be present to convert hydroxyl alkalinity, which does not contribute to corrosion resistance, to bicarbonate alkalinity, which does.\nThe CO2 can be introduced in two ways. In high recovery systems, it is likely that some feedwater scale inhibition will be required to control calcium carbonate scaling. Acid in the feedwater can be used for this purpose, but it should be applied to minimize CO2 losses through the RO system. Recarbonation of the permeate is the other alternative, in which case a scale inhibitor would be required in the feedwater.\n\nOther post treatment will allow local practice, and may include disinfection, fluoridation and the use of a corrosion inhibitor.\n\nIan C.

      "text": "Ion Exchange\n\nIon exchange is a process during which ions are exchanged between two electrolytes or between an electrolyte solution and a complex, often for the purpose of decontamination, separation or purification. The ion exchange process uses resin beads that trap and exchange ions. There are two types of ion exchange resins: cation resins, which are used for the purpose of trapping positively charged ions; and anion resins, which exchange negative ions. For example, ion exchange can be used to soften hard water. Cation resins are used to exchange the sodium for the calcium in order to produce softened water. Mixed bed resins, or the combination of cation and anion, are used for the purpose of achieving purified water. This is an efficient ion exchange method for exchanging positive and negative ions simultaneously.\n\nIon Exchange and Household Water Softeners\n\nIon exchange is used in a variety of applications, but it is the most common method of water treatment for softening household water for dish washing, laundry, and bathing. Water softeners are needed for household water to remove minerals, such as calcium and magnesium, from hard water. Water softening reduces limescale, calcium buildup, and water spots on dishes and bathroom fixtures.\n\nScale prevention is another household water treatment problem that ion exchange can resolve. Hard water minerals that flow through household appliances such as dishwashers, water heaters and washing machines can create scale buildup and eventually diminish the performance of the appliances. Ion exchange removes the hard minerals from tap water, extending the life of household appliances.\n\nIon Exchange and Industrial Water Treatment\n\nIon exchange is used in managing a number of water treatment problems in a variety of industries. Biochemistry and pharmaceuticals manufacturing are other applications that rely on ion exchange. For example, ion exchange chromatography is the process in which molecules are separated based on the charge of the proteins. In this context, ion exchange is useful when extracting amino acids and DNA. Ion exchange is also used in industrial laboratories for producing pure water, while mixed bed resins are typically used in smaller laboratories.\n\nIon exchange can also be used to recover valuable metals from water streams, including copper, silver and gold. This is a critically important use of ion exchange for industries mandated to remove dissolved minerals from wastewater. Metal finishing and semiconductor manufacturing are typical applications for the use of ion exchange in wastewater treatment.\n\nIon exchange is a powerful water treatment technology for many water treatment problems that require the removal of metals and other elements from water, in a wide variety of applications, including industrial, pharmaceutical, biochemistry and residential. One of the most popular applications for ion exchange is in the home. Water softeners are commonly used to remove calcium and magnesium from water in order to prevent scale and limestone build-up in dishwashers and other home appliances. One of the most common water problems that ion exchange effectively treats is hard water, for which ion exchange is used as a water softener."

Part of the increase, not just in offices but also in homes, schools, and hospitals, is no doubt due to consumers' concerns about the safety of tap water. But, ironically, many coolers may be harboring unhealthful high levels of bacteria that can cause nausea and diarrhea in some people.\n\nWhen scientists checked the bacterial count of water from 10 water coolers on the campus of Boston's Northeastern University, they found that in each case the count reached at least 2,000 potentially harmful organisms for every thousandth of a liter of water, or four times the 500-organism limit the government recommends. In some coolers, particularly those that were used frequently, counts exceeded one million – or 2,000 times the government's recommended ceiling.\n\nThe problem, say researchers, is not, that water delivered fresh in those large, see-through containers has high levels of organisms; water drawn directly from bottles (rather than dispensed through coolers) consistently falls well below the government's recommended bacteria limit. Instead, it appears that organisms from each new bottle of water adhere to a cooler's reservoir – the \"well\" in which the bottle sits – and also to its hot and cold water spigots, accumulating over time and thereby boosting the bacterial count of any water that passes through those areas on the way to a cup or glass.\n\nAlthough healthy people are unlikely to become ill drinking such water, some of the bacteria are capable of causing the vomiting and diarrhea characteristic of an illness known as gastroenteritis.\n\nLearn how a bottle-less water cooler (or Point of Use POU system) can reduce your exposure to bacteria in your drinking water, either at home or at the office"

Of course! You need to have water with you many times and places where it's not available, but use your own bottle and bottle the water yourself from your own tap. Run it through a reusable filter to make it cleaner and better tasting than it might be coming directly from your tap.\n\nIn some parts of the world the tap water is as good or better in terms of purity and taste than the water typically sold in bottles. But your municipal water supply probably has chlorine, perhaps flouride, in it, maybe some heavy metals that you don't need. Maybe it's too hign in iron, or you don't like the taste. If that's the case, install a reverse osmosis filter at your kitchen sink, or use a gravity fed filter that you can pour from like a pitcher.\n\nPour that water into your own stainless steel bottle or BPA-free plastic bottle, and take it with you. And bring that bottle home and reuse it (hopefully for years).\n\nWhy? First your health. The plastic those disposable bottles are made from leach phthalates into the water they hold, you drink it, and so your walking around with foriegn chemicals in your body that act like estrogens. You don't want that.\n\nSecond, the health of the planet. Next to disposable diapers, discarded water bottles are some of the most prolific waste in our landfills. And the process of getting that water from the ground, into the bottles, onto the store shelves is hugely wasteful and energy intensive, and in some cases results in direct damage to the health and lives of people and wildlife who live in proximity to the bottling plant.\n\nChoose your brand; they all show you a nice picture on the bottles: snowcapped mountain, lovely flower, some pristine scene of purity, all designed to make you think of nothing but how pure, clean, and fresh that water is, the very liquid you can't live without. What they don't want you to see is the gigantic, diesel-driven drill that bores the hole into the aquifer, or the maze of pipes, valves, tanks and pumps that sucks that water out of the ground and moves it to the bottling operation. They don't want you to know about the trout stream that dried up because the plant is sucking 500,000 gallons an hour out of the water table, faster than it can naturally replenish, and the local ecosystem suffers. They don't want you to know about the residents whose wells dried up and have to be re-drilled deeper for the same reason. They don't want you to know that the plastic in that bottle comes from China, is shipped half way around the world to the bottling plant, and is made from petroleum. They don't show you images of the ships and trucks spewing smog to cart the heavy bottles to the four corners of the globe to sit on store shelves waiting for your money.\n\nThey don't come right out and tell you how expensive and energy intensive it is to get that water to you in a convenient yet damaging plastic bottle, but they do tell you indirectly by charging you a dollar or so for a 16 ounce bottle of the stuff, something you should be paying mere pennies for.\n\nSo, third, your wallet. There are millions of those plastic bottles added to our landfills every year. And (fortuneately) millions more that make it into recycling systems. That makes millions and millions of dollars that wouldn't need to be spent if we could only remember to fill our reusable bottles before we left home.\n\nCheck out this movie trailer for \"Tapped.\""

      "text": "Category Archives: Pool Maintenance\n\nYou've probably heard about salt water systems, as they are a popular choice when it comes to luxury pools. There are lots of questions and misinformation about salt water systems. The swimming pool contractors of Hop Cassidy Pools, Inc. are experts at installing them, so we'll answer a few commonly asked questions about them.\n\nWhat is a Salt Water System?\n\nA salt water system is a pool sanitization alternative to the traditional chlorine sanitization system. In the traditional chlorine sanitization system, you add liquid or dry chlorine to the water. In a salt water system, a salt-chlorine generator (also called a salt cell, salt generator or a salt chlorinator) uses electrolysis to break down salt and create chlorine, which is then automatically added to the pool water.\n\nIf a Salt Water System Adds Chlorine, How Is It Different?\n\nIn a traditional system, adding chlorine to the water results in chloramines, which are the chemicals that irritate eyes and skin and damage hair. With the salt water system, if the pool is properly maintained, there are no chloramines. Also, since the salt water system creates its own chlorine, you will no longer have to handle chlorine liquid or tablets.\n\nDoes a Salt Water System Make the Pool Water Taste And Smell Salty?\n\nNo, salt water systems result in 2,500 to 6,000 ppm salt content. To put that number in context, ocean water has about 35,000 ppm salt content. The water will not smell or taste anywhere near the saltiness of ocean water. Also, salt water systems won't have the same chlorine smell of traditional chlorine pools, due to the lack of chloramines.\n\nWill I Notice a Difference When I Swim In a Salt Water Pool?\n\nYes! The water feels smooth, similar to taking a shower in soft water. When you get out of the pool, your skin will feel soft. You will also notice the lack of red eyes, dry skin, damaged hair and chlorine smell that traditional chlorine pools give you.\n\nWhat Kind Of Maintenance Does a Salt Water Pool Need?\n\nSalt water pools are often referred to as maintenance-free. This is incorrect. Just like traditional chlorine pools, salt water pools need regular care and upkeep to prevent algae and bacteria growth. Maintenance varies for each brand of salt water system, so please consult your owner's manual for exact steps for your pool; however, these are the common maintenance tasks for most salt water pools:\n\nThe pH level needs to be between 7.4 and 7.8, so pH should be tested every few days and muriatic acid added to keep the pH at the right level\n\nAdd stabilizer to keep UV rays from breaking down the chlorine\n\nIn a salt water pool, chlorine is only added to the water when the filter is running, so run the filter in order to maintain the correct chlorine levels\n\nThe electrolysis method the salt-chlorine generator uses results in calcium build up, so the generator needs to be checked regularly. Clean the salt chlorinator cell when it has visible calcium build up, following the instructions in the owner's manual\n\nWith temperatures climbing in the Phoenix area, it's that time of year when families put their Arizona swimming pools back into use. Preparing your backyard swimming pool for the coming season isn't all that complicated, and it's well worth the trouble.\n\nAlthough pool owners in the Sonoran desert don't usually close down and winterize their pools the way that their counterparts in colder climates must, there are still some steps to take to make sure your pool is ready to provide trouble-free fun over the coming months.\n\nIf you used a pool cover in the off-season, remove it, clean it and dry it. Properly fold and store the cover away for use again in the winter. Add water to the pool to bring it up to the operating level. Check the skimmer and the skimmer basket to make sure they're in good shape with no cracks, and that the skimmer weir (the hinged one-way debris barrier) is moving freely.\n\nCheck around the pump and filter for leaks and inspect all plumbing and connections for cracks, damage or leaks. Inspect wiring for cracked or damaged insulation, loose connections or corrosion. Plumbing or wiring that needs repair or replacement is probably something that you'll want to call in a professional take care of.\n\nClean out the pump trap and make sure the basket is still in good shape. Also check the O-ring sealing the pump trap to make sure it's still in good shape. Replace an O-ring that's misshapen, hard or cracked. Likewise, inspect the O-rings in the backwash valve to see whether any of them need replacing.\n\nBackwash your pool filter, especially if you did not previously do so at season's end. If you have a diatomaceous earth (DE) filter, it will need to be reloaded with DE powder after backflushing. However, the fabric-covered plastic grids of a DE filter should be pulled and cleaned at least once a year, including a soaking in an overnight filter cleaning solution. The grids should be replaced if they're broken or damaged. In sand filters, the sand does not need replacement as frequently as DE filtering medium does, but it should be replaced every few years. With either type of filter, make sure that the pressure gauge is still working, and flush any trapped air out of the system.\n\nSkim, vacuum and brush the pool. Clean the tile line around your pool with a tile cleaner or scrub it with baking soda, but don't use harsh or abrasive household cleaners. They can be bad for your tile and for swimmers' health.\n\nSome pool owners like to give the water a good shock to start off the season, but many pool care professionals recommend a more subtle approach to getting your pool chemistry in initial balance. After physically cleaning the pool as above, allow 8-12 hours for the water to circulate and to mix with new water that you've added. Then check your water with a good test kit and follow the recommendations for the results you get, or take a water sample to a pool supply store for testing. Many such stores will check your water for free and make recommendations on which chemicals you need to add, and how much of each.\n\nOnce you get the pool, pool equipment and water in good shape, make sure to reset your pump timer to run longer. Longer pumping and filtration time is necessary as the water warms and creates a more favorable environment for the growth of algae and bacteria. Set the timer clock to run the pump one hour for every 10 degrees of maximum daytime temperature – for example, 9 hours for 90 degrees, 10 hours for 100 degrees, etc.\n\nIf you have questions or need advice on how to get your Phoenix pool into tip-top shape for the summer season, consult a competent pool technician at a reputable pool supply and equipment store. Of course, you can also save time by hiring a pool service company to prep your swimming pool for all the activity that the hot months will surely bring.\n\nIf you'd like to get in on the kind of great summer fun that comes with having a pool of your own, come to the experienced professionals at Hop Cassidy Pools.

      "text": "Whole House Reverse Osmosis System, Who Really Needs One?\n\nSince reverse osmosis technology was patented in the late 60′s and early 70′s by Minnesota based Osmonics and San Diego based Water Factory Systems, under sink ultrapure water systems are being used by millions of Americans and the consideration for whole house reverse osmosis systems is growing. The environmental impact of reverse osmosis systems may outweigh the benefits and should be considered by people interested in the technology.\n\nTwo types of water are produced from the reverse osmosis process of forcing water through a membrane, the \"permeate\" water, which is the water we consume and the \"concentrate\" which is the wastewater produced during the process. The \"permeate\" water by scientific definition is ultrapure water but it is low in total dissolved solids (TDS), has a low pH and is extremely corrosive. The \"permeate\" water while free of metals after the membrane such as iron, sodium, manganese, chloride and calcium, results in a 98% reduction in the solid levels when configured properly. The membrane discharges the \"permeate\" or treated water into a holding tank that is low pressure and the water level is controlled by either a float or level switch. The treated water is then delivered to the plumbing lines of the house by a secondary repressure pump (not part of the RO equipment). The repressure pump and the RO treatment pump both demand high amperage and voltage giving the reverse osmosis system the highest usage of kilowatt power in the market of whole house water treatment.\n\nThe high electrical usage is further increased by the need for a full pretreatment system needing to be installed ahead of an RO membrane, often involving a water softener, iron filter, carbon filter or in most cases all of them. The environmental issues and the need to own a full treatment system as a pretreatment leads responsible professionals to soft sell RO's. RO membranes are costly to replace and are easily damaged or scaled up if the pretreatment system is absent or fouled. Anyone who has owned a water softener knows this is not an occasional occurrence.\n\nThere is a focus on three issues that have put reverse osmosis systems under intense scrutiny in the US by both environmental organizations and state regulators: 1. The energy use of reverse osmosis systems being so high. 2. The high (25-75%) waste of water. 3. The salinity and chloride discharge from both the salt based pretreatment system and the RO concentrate water.\n\nAnother Twin Cities Minnesota manufacturer claims a non-salt pretreatment system for both whole house and commercial RO applications and has been installing them as a package since 1995. \"Since the mid 1990′s we have eliminated both the water softener and the iron filter in reverse osmosis applications. We have done so with a longer membrane life, fewer scaling issues at the membrane and a less corrosive final water,\" said Larry Couture, Chief Technology Officer for the Twin Cities manufacturer.\n\nThe chemical free technology eliminates the need for salt softening by basically converting the calcium to a bicarbonate or soluble form. The system filters the iron and manganese regardless of the pH of the source water and no there is no sodium for calcium ion exchange to occur. The need for an RO system is completely eliminated in most case by their system, states Couture. If the chloride or sodium levels exceed 1,700 ppm would be the only time he would recommend the use of a reverse osmosis system. Usually coastal or brine intruded from the ocean or natural gas and oil exploration, these waters are rare.\n\nCouture explained that he has recommended under sink reverse osmosis on rare occasions with their proprietary zero salt whole house systems, usually when treating lake water but their primary purpose has been to remove sodium from a water softener.\n\nFor those who require a whole house reverse osmosis system with high chloride levels in their source water it is essential to: 1. Buy an reverse osmosis system that is 95% or higher. 2. Buy equipment that produces at least three gallons of \"permeate\" usable water for every gallon of \"concentrate\" or waster water, 75% efficient equipment and upwards. 3. Purchase a non-salt pretreatment system. 4. Examine all equipment monthly and change out membranes annually. 5. Purchase a back up, second set of membranes or otherwise a complete second system.\n\nCouture tells people \"We can always add a reverse osmosis system later but if you're on the edge of horrible source water we recommend you try our non chemical, non salt pretreatment system as a stand alone system for a month or two, living with the water first."

      "text": "In the Great Outdoors, there are potentially four dangers of drinking water straight from a source\n(assuming it's freshwater): chemical pollutants, protozoa and larger parasites, bacteria, and viruses.\nThe oldest (and cheapest) method of purifying water is to boil it. Boiling for five minutes will kill\nany biological hazards you could expect to find. Most pathogens are actually long dead by the time\nthe water boils, but the five minute boil will get them all (remember to add to this time at higher\naltitudes). Boiling will not neutralize chemical pollutants.\n\nA carbon filter will remove chemical toxins. Chemicals in water could include inorganic\ncontaminants (arsenic and other heavy metals) or organic toxins (fertilizers and pesticides, for\nexample). In general, it is a bad idea to trust any purification system to remove these, as even small\nquantities could ruin your day in a hurry. The good news is that water sources in the backcountry are\nseldom contaminated with appreciable levels of toxic chemicals. Take a good look at the stream\nyou're about to get water from. Are there fish in it? Is there algae on the rocks? Crawdads on the\nbottom? Insects skimming the surface? Plants growing along the banks? If yes, the water is probably\nnon-toxic, chemically speaking. If you're hiking in the desert, though, and a trickle of water etching a\ngroove in the rock is bubbling sulfur from its barren depths, you should probably avoid it.\n\nThere are a number of parasites, both multicellular and unicellular, which live in water. The most\ncommon ones in North America are Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium. Boiling will kill them.\nIn third-world countries, the number of parasites in the water is staggering, hence the hackneyed\nadvice, \"Don't drink the water.\" Amoebae can cause dysentery (\"Montezuma's Revenge\"),\nwhipworm causes diarrhea and possible complications if not treated, and roundworms (Ascaris\nlumbricoides) can be unpleasant, to name a few. In some areas, such as the Philippines and Africa,\nyou should try to avoid any contact with river water, including swimming or washing in unpurified\nwater, as Schistosoma sp. is prevalent in these areas. These tiny parasites bore directly into the\nskin, entering the bloodstream and eventually setting up shop in either the intestine or the bladder. If\nleft untreated or incorrectly diagnosed (a common problem, as symptoms only become manifest\nweeks or months after contact), the complications can be severe. As with Giardia, though, all of\nthese parasites are killed by boiling.\n\nBacteria are the second smallest pathogens in water. One frequently hears about water being tested\nfor Escherichia coli. While strains of this bacterium can be pathogenic, the vast majority are not,\nand it is, in fact, one of the species required in the intestine for digestion to occur (without bacteria,\nwe would all die). Since it is present in large quantities in sewage, it is a good indicator strain to\nshow when water has been contaminated with sludge. There are plenty of other bacteria which are\nhappy in the intestine, to the detriment of the host. All are killed by boiling.\n\nThe smallest parasites are viruses. In true wilderness areas, pathogenic viruses are seldom found in\nwater, but the odds increase with population density and poor sanitation practices. Boiling is the\nmost reliable way to do away with viruses, though, and is strongly suggested in third-world\ncountries. The specific viruses you should worry about in water are Hepatitis A, Rotaviruses,\nPolioviruses, and Echoviruses. All of these will cause diarrhea, intestinal cramps, and discomfort\nabout 48-72 hours after contact, and complications could range from liver damage (for hepatitis) to\naseptic meningitis and encephalitis (for echoviruses), and paralysis or death (for polio).\n\nChemical purification involves the use of iodine or chlorine to kill the nasties in the water. This\nmethod is lightweight and relatively inexpensive, but will not neutralize chemical toxins. In addition,\nyou must make sure that water at 25 deg. C (75deg. F) sits for 20-30 minutes with iodine in it for\npurification to take place. If the water is colder (as it usually is), you will need to let it sit longer -\npossibly overnight for cold stream water. Warm the water against your body or even on your stove if\nyou want it to be purified faster. Once the appropriate time has elapsed, the \"band-aid\" taste of\niodine can be neutralized with a small amount of ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Used properly, iodine\nwill kill most protozoa and all bacteria and viruses in water. After prolonged use, some people\ndevelop thyroid problems, so be aware of this potential side effect.\n\nThe latest rage in water purification is the use of filters, and a large number of them are available\n(see the review later in this panel). There are a couple of things to bear in mind when shopping for\nfilters. First, only a system which includes an iodine matrix will kill viruses (see below). Second, a\nfilter with pores larger than 0.2 microns - note the location of the decimal point, as it is important -\nwill let bacteria through. The advantages of a filter are quick processing time (don't have to wait for\nthe pot to boil or the iodine to do its work) and clean- tasting water (no iodine or vitamin C flavor).\nSome systems also contain a carbon filter which will remove chemical toxins."

Peoples' hair would fall out, their skin would break out in rashes and their eyes would turn red after showers.\n\n\"That was how people were hurt on the outside,\" said Horacio Amezquita, manager of the San Jerardo Cooperative. \"On the inside, we don't know.\"\n\nAmezquita, a former farm worker, lives at the cooperative, which houses about 250 low-income people. Many of the residents work on nearby farms that use nitrogen-based fertilizers to help crops grow.\n\nBut the very fertilizers that keep these farms in business leach into the soil and into the drinking water.\n\nA report released last year by California Watch and The Center for Investigative Reporting revealed that the number of wells that exceeded health limits for nitrates increased from nine in 1980 to 648 in 2007. That includes the water supply of more than 2 million Californians.\n\nNitrate-contaminated water can lead to serious health problems, including methemoglobinemia, or \"Blue Baby Syndrome,\" a disease that develops when an infant's organs, cells and tissues do not receive enough oxygen.\n\nStudies have also linked nitrates with cancer, Crohn's disease, thyroid disruption and depression, among other illnesses. Regions with the highest nitrate pollution include major agricultural regions, such as the Imperial, Central, Salinas, and other coastal valleys in California. Regulators classify nitrates as acute contaminants, which means people can experience severe reactions with only one taste, or one glass.\n\nIn San Jerardo, officials replaced the contaminated well with a new well, which also became contaminated. They implemented new filtration systems. The water would get cleaned up, but eventually the nitrates would re-enter the aquifer. In December 2010 the community received a new well, and subsequently, safe drinking water, but residents now bear the brunt of the costs. Co-op members pay $100 to $150 per month for water.\n\nRoger Briggs, an executive officer with the Regional Water Quality Control Board of the Central California Region, describes the scope of the nitrate problem as unprecedented. \"Usually, if there's a discharge, it's at one point. It's usually just in one location, one relatively small location,\" Briggs said. \"But this is not the case with this issue.\"\n\nNine regional water quality control boards administer water quality regulations in the state. Four of those regions, including The Central Coast, Central Valley, Los Angeles and San Diego regions, have adopted \"conditional ag waivers,\" which require owners of irrigated farmland to control discharges, and require growers to implement Best Management Practices in an effort to prevent pollutants from entering the groundwater.\n\nLast year the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Board submitted a proposal that would involve more stringent regulations of businesses categorized as Tier 3 operations. Farmers and growers who use a certain amount of nitrogen-based fertilizers, or who own operations that are located on impaired bodies of water, will receive Tier 3 classifications.\n\nThe agricultural industry opposes the measure. A coalition of more than 50 farm groups and individual growers presented an alternative plan to the board when it was reviewed last year.\n\n\"The staff proposal that is out there will add significant costs to all growers, but particularly Tier 3, and it may be very difficult for some growers to continue,\" said Danny Merkley, director of water resources at the California Farm Bureau Federation.\n\n\"We are competing in a global market where you can ship fresh products anywhere in the world and have them here any time overnight,\" Merkley said. The Central Coast region includes many smaller growers who can't bear the economic challenge, he said.\n\nAbout 3,000 operations on the Central Coast will be classified as Tier 3 operations.\n\nUnder the proposed waiver, Tier 3 facilities will have to monitor runoff for toxicity, nitrates and the pesticides Diazinon and Chlorpyrifos. The waiver would also require farmers and growers to implement detailed nutrient and irrigation management plans.\n\n\"If the regional board passes the rules they've drafted, it will be the most rigorous regulations of discharges that exist,\" said Steve Shimek, program manager for Monterey Coastkeeper and executive director of The Otter Project.\n\nInstead of building new wells and filtrations systems after nitrates already enter aquifers, Amezquita said farmers should prevent harmful runoff from entering the water supply in the first place.\n\n\"Farmers need to be educated and we need to implement the best conservation measures,\" Amezquita said. Otherwise, the burden of contaminated water will simply shift over to future generations.\n\n2 Responses\n\nUnfortunately, this story does not provide much detail about the alternative plan proposed in good faith by local agricultural organizations. Farmers want to achieve water quality goals through flexibility and cooperation. The proposal includes thorough management practices to continually improve water quality and takes steps to protect water quality above and beyond any regulatory program in place today for agriculture. Highlighted in the proposal is an outline for Farm Water Quality Management Plans to be filled by all growers in the area, with the detailed information available to regional board members upon request. A preliminary draft of the farm groups' plan can be found at  This was presented to the board in late 2010, with an addendum provided in March 2011 to address follow-up questions from the board. We encourage readers to review the proposal for additional insight into this topic.\n–Megan Alpers with the California Farm Bureau Federation"

The filters have been shown to remove common pathogens including E-coli. Unlike other water filtering devices, they are simple and inexpensive to make.\n\n\"They are very simple to explain and demonstrate and can be made by anyone, anywhere.

Dry the pot in the sun, then surround them with straw, place in a mound of cow manure, light the straw and then top up the burning manure as required. In less than an hour the filters are finished.\n\n\"A potter's kiln is an expensive item and can could take up to four or five hours to heat.

A simple water filter really does have the capacity to save many lives in the developing world.\"\n\nThe filtration process is simple, but effective. The basic principle is that there are passages through the filter that are wide enough for water droplets to pass through, but too narrow for pathogens.\n\nOrganic materials which are combined with the clay burn away during the firing process, leaving cavities that help produce the structure in which pathogens will become trapped.\n\nThe invention was born out of a World Vision project involving the community of Manatuto in East Timor. The charity wanted to help set up a small industry manufacturing water filters, but initial research found the local clay to be too fine — a problem solved by the addition of organic material. Manure firing, with no requirement for a kiln, has made this zero technology approach available anywhere it is needed.\n\nTests with the deadly E-coli bacterium have seen the filters remove 96.4 to 99.8 per cent of the pathogen — well within safe levels. Using only one filter, a litre of clean water can be produced in just two hours.\n\n(Phys.org) —What climate component can be as thick and sticky as honey, peanut butter or even asphalt?

Bottled water companies try to scare people into believing they need bottle water.\n\nRecent studies have shown that the only useful application of fluoride is topical i.e. toothpaste. Fluoride is potential harmful. The fluoride companies are the only ones who benefit from fluoridating the water.\n\nCan you please cite these \"recent studies\"? There is over 50 years of data supporting fluoridated water in reducing dental caries. And who do you think benefits from saying fluoridated water is harmful? I think bottled water companies have a slightly bigger lobby power than fluoride companies.\n\n\"Research continues to show that water fluoridation is effective in reducing tooth decay by 20% to 40%.\"\nWater fluoridation in Canada: past and present. J Can Dent Assoc. 2009 Jul;75(6):451-4.\n\nThe Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) is who you can thank for your fluoride intake. One of the largest America industry company's since the early 1900's and initiators of the Fluoride campaign. They have lobbying power...I'm pretty sure.\n\nThe first time I heard that fluoride is a poison was in 1978 and there were no bottled water companies at that time. You would be very surprised, apparently, at the lobbying power of companies connected to fluoride poisoning of water systems, etc.\n\n\n\nI agree with several other posters. Fluoride is harmful, especially ingested! This article is poorly researched to have even listed the habit of ingesting fluoride as helpful. The exact opposite is true.\n\nIt is not *generally* true that vitamin A is toxic to a growing fetus. Actually there's pretty good evidence that pregnant women are *not getting enough* real vitamin A during the course of their pregnancies. The Mayo Clinic tells us that urinary tract defects are the most common class of birth defects in the United States today. The urinary tract is one of the last systems to develop in a fetus, and vitamin A mediates its development, especially of the kidneys and ureters.\nIt is true that there\n\nare many forms of retinol, including some synthetic forms used in pharmaceutical medicine (i.e., Retin-A for acne), and that *these* forms of vitamin A are harmful to a growing fetus, but it's because they're synthetic, not because they're vitamin A. The truth is that an infant or a fetus or an embryo is structurally incapable of converting beta carotene to natural vitamin A, and estimates are that around 45 percent of adults can't make the conversion either. Get a pregnant woman with an inability to make that conversion together with a fetus who can't make the conversion either and you've got a plausible explanation for all those urinary tract defects--plus all the nearsightedness and poor dental development we're seeing now. The cruel irony being that research has shown that embryos and fetuses are perfectly capable of controlling how much maternal vitamin A they absorb--so as long as it's the natural kind from animal foods, and the mother's getting enough vitamins D and K2 as well, everything should be fine.\nLadies, eat your liver. And your cheese. And your cold-water fish. Your babies will thank you.\n\nFlouride does a lot of harm in the human body, but has absolutely no benefit we know of. It doesn't reduce cavities...there's countries in Europe that add no flouride to their water and they have the same percentage of cavities.\nIodine, on the other hand, will feed the thyroid and act as a second immune system....it kills every germ, virus and bacteria known to man. You can get Lugols iodine on line.\n\nI've lived in 2 places in MI...they have both stopped adding fluoride to the water. With fluoride treatments available at the dentist, why should they just add it and have people over treating? My teeth have gone downhill since, but who's to say?\n\nTopical fluoride in toothpaste is pretty cheap. Putting toxic chemicals in the water, forcing everyone to drink it or spend big bucks on filtering systems, is absurd and offensive. More important for dental health: plenty of natural vitamins A and D as well as K2 from animal fats, and keeping sugar content of the diet low.\n\nSuggesting that being without shoes is (or 'may be') harmful is just down right stupid.\nThe human foot is an amazing piece of engineering, what goes wrong is the reliance on 'arch-support/motion control' technology which is effectively reducing the muscles in the foot and making them weak (so yes, Summer time freedom seekers will find discomfort comes due to over-straining muscles they've effectively casted). Let's not mention being over-weight, which obviously plays a huge part.\nWe've had over"

Bottled water is not only an environmental injustice, but also an economic and social injustice.\n\nBy Brittney Rooney Copy Editor\n\nImagine you walk into a store and lined up by the counter are small containers. You go to look at the container, and you see a beautiful depiction of white clouds in a clear blue sky.\n\nThe label says it is the cleanest, smoothest, and freshest oxygen available, and it only costs $2.50!\n\nLater you research it on the internet and find out that this company sucks the air you breathe everyday and sells it back to you. \"What a waste of a few dollars!\" you think.\n\nThen you read that the area in which the company takes all of its air is in major shortage. Because they don't have enough clean air to breathe, they are forced to buy it from the company that took it from them originally.\n\nThis seems absurd. It would never happen. Regarding oxygen, maybe not. However, it happens everyday with the privatization and sale of bottled water.\n\nOften the biggest argument against the sale of bottled water is the plastic. However, plastic water bottles are not just about the plastic.\n\nAlthough in itself, it is not great for the environment, but that is not the biggest problem. The biggest problem is the privatization of water.\n\nThe problem is that large companies are going into areas, taking the community tap water supply, and selling it back to them. They are making billions of dollars every year by taking what was already free to them.\n\nThe university chooses not to sell cigarettes on campus. This choice is not a restriction of rights of students but rather a decision in sales the university makes.\n\nLoyola's campus is not non-smoking. Just as no one forces smokers to put their cigarettes out, no one would chase anyone with a plastic water bottle off the campus.\n\nThe Student Environmental Alliance is currently encouraging Loyola to end its sale of bottled water on campus.\n\nSteve Polaskey, the SEA co-president said, \"Bottled water is an injustice. It is an economic, environmental, and social injustice.\"\n\n\"By supporting the bottled water industry, you are supporting a system that says it is okay to take what is not yours and make money off of it—a system that says you can make a mess and not worry about cleaning it up. And Loyola should not support that kind of system.\"\n\nBecause of Loyola's Jesuit foundation and commitment to justice, selling bottled water is hypocritical. An amendment to Loyola's contracts with Armark and Coca Cola needs to be made.\n\nAs Loyola strides to make big green steps toward sustainability, in a sort of competition with other universities, the biggest strike it has is its bottled water sale. Seattle University, Portland State, Macalester, Oberlin, and Washington University in St. Louis, to just name a few, have already successfully stopped the sale.\n\nThe entire student environmental alliance needs to convince the administration that they have the support of the university in order to successfully stop the campus sale of bottled water"

In addition, district officials told the Tribune that there is no evidence the water poses a threat to public safety.\n\n\"With additional treatment, you have to weigh how much water quality is actually being accomplished with more harm to the environment in another way,\" Louis Kollias, the director of the district's Monitoring and Research Department, told the Tribune.\n\nMeanwhile, those in favor of disinfecting the water continue to voice their opinions.

      "text": "Why is there a public information campaign about lead?\n\nLead is not found at elevated levels in New York City's reservoirs or distribution system. Sometimes elevated lead levels are found in tap water samples from corrosion of lead-containing plumbing. The City monitors a selection of homes that have lead service lines (homes built before 1961 may have lead service lines), or internal fixtures and plumbing that contain lead, or that have internal plumbing joined by lead solder (plumbing installed before 1987 may contain lead solder).\n\nThe EPA action level for lead in drinking water is 15 parts per billion (ppb). DEP is required to notify the public when test results show more than 10% of the homes tested have levels of lead above the 15 ppb action level.\n\nWhat is the City doing about the elevated lead levels in household tap water?\n\nDEP has an active program to reduce the amount of lead that dissolves into tap water, especially in homes with lead service lines or lead soldering in pipes. DEP carefully and continuously monitors and adjusts pH levels of water to a specific range that reduces the corrosiveness of the water. DEP also adds phosphoric acid—a common food preservative—to create a protective film on pipes that reduces the release of metals, such as lead, from household plumbing. Since these treatments were started, the levels of lead in tap water have been going down.\n\nHow does lead get into tap water?\n\nNew York City water is virtually lead-free when it is delivered from the city's upstate reservoir systems. Lead from solder, fixtures, and pipes found in the plumbing of some older buildings and homes can get into water. Lead levels can increase when water sits in pipes and faucets for several hours when no one is using water.\n\nDo City-owned buildings, like schools, have lead service lines?\n\nWhat can I do reduce the potential for exposure to lead from the tap?\n\nRun your faucet for at least 30 seconds, until the water gets noticeably colder, before using for drinking, cooking or making baby formula. Always use cold water for cooking, drinking, and making baby formula and baby cereal. Never use hot tap water for consumption because lead dissolves more easily in hot water.\n\nDoes boiling water remove lead?\n\nWill my filter remove lead?\n\nSome faucet and pitcher filters can remove lead from tap water. If you use a filter, be sure to get one that is tested and certified by an independent third party in accordance with the standards developed by the National Sanitation Foundation, also known as NSF International. Be sure to maintain and replace a filter device in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions to protect water quality. Remember, home information on performance standards for home treatment devices.\n\nWill running the tap increase my water bill?\n\nRunning tap water is a simple and inexpensive measure you can take to protect your family's health. It usually uses less than one or two gallons of water and costs approximately $1 per month. To help reduce these costs, you can also fill a couple of bottles for drinking water after running the tap the first time. Another way to conserve water is to use the first run of water for plants, household cleaning or for other purposes that do not involve cooking and drinking.\n\nCan I get my water tested for lead?\n\nMy neighbors got their water tested and found lead. Is my water safe/are my test results accurate?\n\nEach home should be tested separately for lead. Lead usually gets into tap water through contact with plumbing materials such as lead pipes or lead solder, or faucets, valves, and fixtures made of brass. (Brass contains some lead). Since each home has different plumbing pipes and materials, test results are likely to be different for each home.\n\nIs there anything else I can do about lead in water?\n\nIndividual property owners have the option to replace pipes and fixtures containing lead with lead-free pipes and fixtures. In addition, sometimes lead and sediment can build up on the individual screens at your faucets. To clean them, take off the faucet strainers from all taps and run the water for 3 to 5 minutes. Thereafter, periodically remove the strainers and flush out any debris that has accumulated.\n\nIf a product is labeled lead free, does that mean it is safe?\n\nEven new faucets, fittings, and valves, including those\nadvertised as \"lead-free,\" may contribute lead to drinking water. Under\nBill S. 3874 signed into law in January 2011, \"lead-free\" means having not more\nthan 0.2 percent lead in solder and flux and not more than a weighted average of 0.25 for wetted surfaces of pipes, fittings, fixtures. The law provides for a 36-month implementation period; after that manufacturers and importers will be required to comply with the new standards. Consumers should be aware of this when choosing fixtures and take appropriate precautions.\n\nWhat is lead poisoning?\n\nLead poisoning is a preventable health problem. Young children and pregnant women are at greatest risk. Lead poisoning can cause learning and behavior problems and delayed growth and development in children. In New York City, lead paint in homes, not lead in water, is the most common cause of lead poisoning in children. Children can swallow lead dust from peeling lead paint when they put their hands and toys in their mouths. Children can also be exposed to lead in household dust, soil, water and some imported consumer products like clay pottery, cosmetics, food, herbal remedies and toys. Reducing exposure to lead from all sources is the best way to protect children from lead poisoning. During the four-month sampling period (June – September 2010) when lead in water levels were slightly elevated, there was a 2.4% decline in the number of young children newly identified with elevated blood lead levels as compared with the same period in 2009. For more information on lead poisoning, visit \n\nHow can I protect my child from lead poisoning?\n\nRemind your doctor to test your child for lead\npoisoning at ages 1 and 2 as required by law.\n\nTalk to your doctor about testing older children and\npregnant women if they are at risk of lead exposure."

Throughout the developing world, 884 million people lack access to safe drinking water resulting in 3.5 million deaths due to water-related illness. According to the United Nations, access to safe drinking water will reduce poverty by promoting economic growth.\n\nEach day, women and children are forced to travel over a mile balancing 80 pound jugs on their heads to obtain water. Over a long time period, this chore of carrying heavy loads results in health problems such as pregnancy complications and spinal deformity. In addition, women and children spend their time collecting water for their families instead of working to earn an income or attending school.\n\nA Solução: Qual é a sua solução? Seja específico! are expensive and require extensive maintenance. Furthermore, current solutions manufacture their products from scratch, leaving a large carbon footprint. SafeSIPP utilizes recycled materials to reduce the effect on the environment.\n\nSafeSIPP derives revenue from business to business sales. The target market, composed of NPO's and social enterprises, purchases SafeSIPP's systems and then sells them to local residents in the developing world. The NPO's and social enterprises have established strong connections and relationships with rural communities that lack access to clean water. Through these relationships, they have gained the trust of the communities and have the capability to distribute to the local residents. By selling the systems to the local residents, an incentive for the local resident to work is created. Donations to developing countries do not provide incentive to work and produce a negative effect on the economy.\n\nIn the developing world, a micro-financing platform will be established to foster growth in the rural communities. Women in the communities will have the opportunity to engage in establishing their own businesses allowing them to become more independent and self-sufficient. The additional purified water that would not have been obtained without SafeSIPP's systems will be sold to surrounding communities and local businesses to generate revenue. The revenue will be used to purchase additional systems and replacement filters, leaving a monetary profit. On average this monetary profit will increase the annual family income by 25%.\n\nWello has developed a water transportation system that provides people with easier access to clean water. Wello's system, WaterWheel, transports 90 liters of water. SafeSIPP has a similar design and adds value to the design by integrating a purification system.\n\nLifeStraw provides portable, hand-held water filtration straws that can be carried by individuals to the water source. SafeSIPP provides a sustainable product which not only targets drinking water, but can provide water purification in mass quantities that can easily be stored for future use.\n\nChallenges these players pose to SafeSIPP's success or growth would be implementation of a similar design or idea. In order to reduce the likelihood, SafeSIPP is in the process of patenting the designNo other single intervention is more likely to have a significant impact on global poverty and world health than the provision of clean water. SafeSIPP will become the global leader in providing this intervention. Water provided by SafeSIPP systems will be used for cooking, drinking, cleaning, as well as sanitation needs. Any additional purified water can then be sold to surrounding communities, tourists, and local businesses to generate revenue. Through these sales, the owner has the ability to earn revenue which goes toward the purchase of replacement filters, additional systems, growth of fresh produce while still leaving a profit for the user. This allows the system to be sustainable and stimulate the economy of developing countries.\n\nThis October, SafeSIPP is travelling to South Africa to implement and launch the first 20 systems within the community as well as educate the community on the use of these systems. SafeSIPP will receive valuable feedback for any modifications.\n\nQual é a sua expectativa de impacto para os próximos 1 - 3 anos?\n\nOver the next few years, SafeSIPP aims to form 2 additional partnerships with Non-Profit organizations in South Africa to collaborate with the implementation of SafeSIPP systems within the community to empower women and children to improve their quality of life.\nWorking with the non-profit organization, My Arms Wide Open, SafeSIPP aims to establish a manufacturing facility in the rural community of Bergnek, providing employment for the production of theses systems within the community. SafeSIPP aims to produce enough systems to provide enough clean and safe drinking water for 12,000 people within this time frame.\n\nOne key barrier that may hinder the success of SafeSIPP would be the distance and communication with the community in South Africa. Because SafeSIPP founders will not be stationed directly in South Africa overseeing the development of the systems, this may result in poor construction or adaptations to design. In order to overcome this barrier, SafeSIPP is collaborating with Warren Te Brugge, President at CEO of My Arms Wide Open, a non-profit organization based in South Africa who has contacts and employees on site to oversee and relay key challenges and feedback on the implementation and success of SafeSIPP systems.\n\nThe idea originated with a conversation I had with my cousin who happened to recently travel to Africa. We were discussing her experience within the community and she mentioned the water crisis at hand and how women and children were responsible for retrieving water over long distances for the community. This really touched my heart and I felt empowered to share this story and do a bit of research. Three close friends and I began to research current solutions available and could not identify any on the market that both transported and purified contaminated water. Among us were three chemical engineers, so we decided to take the task on with brainstorming designs and collaborated together to develop our solution, SafeSIPP - Sustainable, Innovative, Portable, Purification.\n\nSUSTENTABILIDADE\n\nSafeSIPP is collaborating with My Arms Wide Open, a non profit organization that provides support for mothers, children, and youth in South Africa to build sustainable communities and responsible businesses.\nMy Arms Wide Open works directly with community members, who identify priorities for community development by helping them improve their skills and knowledge in areas such as entrepreneurship, leadership, mentoring, education and personal development."

      "text": "30,000 homes at risk of lead poisoning from water\n\nMore than 30,000 households across the country may be at risk of lead poisoning from drinking water supplied through lead pipes.\n\nFour county councils are under orders from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to replace the last known four kilometres of lead piping in public water mains.\n\nBut the EPA warned there may be other lead mains dating back to Victorian times that have not been identified because there are no surviving records of them.\n\nAnd the agency says there is a more pressing problem of private households that are served by modern public mains but have old lead pipes running through their property, connecting the mains to their taps.\n\nThe EPA's warning comes as the countdown to the implementation of new Europe-wide lead limits begins. From next December, a limit of 10 microgrammes of lead per litre of water will apply — down from the current level of 25 microgrammes — although ideally there would be no traces of the metal.\n\n\"There is not really any safe level of lead,\" explained Darragh Page, inspector with the EPA which warns that exposure to lead can damage the central nervous system.\n\n\"Babies and young children are particularly vulnerable because the amount of water they drink per body weight is proportionately higher and because their central nervous system is still developing.\"\n\nExactly how many households are at risk is hard to quantify but latest test results from the EPA show that close to 98% of drinking water sampled met with the new limits. That leaves just over 2% of supplies, which equates to at least 32,000 homes, exceeding the limits.\n\nMr Page said some householders may not be aware they still have lead pipes — which generally pre-date 1970 — while others know but don't address the problem. \"There is an issue with reluctance. People don't always want to dig up their garden or kitchen floor. Not everybody takes it on board.\"\n\nDr Anthony Breslin, specialist in public health with the HSE, said people should take the possibility of lead poisoning seriously.\n\n\"It doesn't present terribly frequently but it's a serious issue in that people, particularly children, could be exposed over a long time in their own homes.\"\n\nThe Green Party has called for a grant scheme to assist householders with the cost of replacing lead pipes which can run to thousands of euro, saying it could be funded from the property tax initially and subsequently from domestic water charges.\n\nThe Department of the Environment said it had no plans to provide any financial assistance to private householders to carry out such work."

      "text": "lung clears out foreign bodies by wrapping them up in immune cells, which can then be flushed out of the body. But straight fibres longer than about 20 micrometres cannot be removed in this way because the cells are too small to engulf them. As a result, the cells become inflamed and form unwanted lumps, called granulomas, that can go on to cause mesothelioma, a cancer of the mesothelium.\nThe researchers found that carbon nanotubes of this length led to the formation of granulomas in the mice. \"We have shown that if [carbon nanotubes] do find their way to the mesothelium they are pathogenic,\" says Donaldson. Source\n\nIf you drank nothing but distilled water for months, that might be a problem. In a pinch using evaporation distilling is the best way to get clean water from bad sources and is something humanity has done for millenia.\n\nGraphene is a sheet of tightly packed carbon atoms with varied possible uses. The big issue right now is construction. Most procedures require around 600 degrees C in order to produce the more sought after graphene structure, carbon nanotubes.\n\nReverse osmosis has no real debilitating effects, it's already in use to produce commercial drinking water, and it can easily be scaled down to devices with a pump that can filter more or less anything out of water, you can also use sugar to power it (if you put sugar on the dry side, the sugar will suck the water out of the salt water, giving you a drinkable solution with no energy input).\n\nThe issue with these devices are that you generally need very powerful pumps with large energy demands, because to get decent flow you need a high pressure, this graphene thing says they can reduce the power needed by the pump significantly (and then it goes onto claim that it wouldn't use energy, which is false, though it may be low enough to be a non-issue). Of course graphene is ridiculously expensive right now so it's not worth it (yet).\n\nNot sure about that. People have been predicting that water will be the next resource-in-demand for long enough that a no energy, fast desalination process might avert a lot of conflict. As its already been said, we will just have to wait and see if the price of graphene comes down.\n\nNeedless to say, this could be a game changer for impoverished countries around the world. Fresh water is a rare good, but salt water isn't. There is more than enough salt water to sate everyone on this planet many times over.\n\nAs for Graphene?\n\nThe obvious next sentence would be \"It's even less accessible in impoverished countries than fresh water.\" Oh boy, what a solution!\n\nActually, I read about a group of researchers (I think it might have been in Sweden?) who had come up with a new method of manufacturing graphene that is very productive (far better than current methods), so this might not be such a bad idea after all.\n\nThe problem isn't making it, it's distributing it to isolated villages. There are a lot of really neat products and solutions that already exist, but if you can't (a) get it to people, and (b) get them to use it - which can be harder than you might think - then they're useless.\n\nI think we'll see this one around for a while. The material needed to do this will wear out fairly quickly I would think. Which means there is high profit in it needing to be replaced all the time. Which of course means, it won't get washed into the background with everything else that could dramatically improve life for everyone.\n\nI think the article is \"layman-ated\" so that most people will understand it. Perhaps they were talking about the actual filtration of it? Ie you don't need to 'plug in' the screen and the material itself doesn't require energy to filter.\n\nBelieve it or not, there are economic forces at play that make pumping water up, only to let it fall in order to produce energy, actually economically feasible.\n\nThere is an electricity plant in Massachusetts that works this way. Water is pumped up a mountainside during the night, using electricity that is sold at cheaper rates. The water is then released during the day, and the resulting electricity is then sold for more than it cost to purchase it in the first place.\n\nLake Pleasant has a similar method. In the winter they pump water up from the Central Arizona Project canal and release in the summer to generate power and provide water downstream. Power in Arizona is really cheap in the winter.\n\nIt's not reversed; you expend energy during the night to store power, when it is cheap. Then during the day, when it is expensive, you produce power from your stored water and sell it at a higher price.\n\nThe bottom of a siphon has to be lower than the top (to be precise, the outlet has to be lower than the water line), otherwise nothing will flow. You can't raise water against gravity for free, it's simple physics.\n\nYou doubt the entire article because they glossed over the parts that you would obviously have to assume. You can't do anything without using energy, so isn't it obvious what they meant? That it doesn't take any more energy than what you would have to expend anyway, because \"plumbing\".\n\nOr is this what we do now, just complain about having to exert even the tiniest amount of critical thinking, while missing the point entirely?\n\nI'm all for accuracy, but what useful purpose does being that pedantic serve?\n\nThat's a actually a very significantly large inaccuracy. It's not just the pedant that would mind either. It's not something that makes me doubt the implications of such a technology—it just undermines the credibility of the author's grasp of physics.\n\nThis cannot be true, because one can extract energy by combining freshwater and saltwater. If graphene would be able to extract freshwater without energy expenditure, that would make an over-unity machine.\n\n\"Reverse osmosis like this has been demonstrated before...\" Yes. Every time I have a glass of water, since I have been living off RO water for years.\n\n\"And it is without any energy expenditure at all.\" False, obviously, since everything you do requires some energy, but you still have to overcome the surface tension of the water and the electrostatic forces between the molecules, making this simply a new type of toxic RO membrane.\n\n\"Graphene once again proves that it is quite possibly the most miraculous material known to man...\" How delightful that God has blessed us with this miracle without any need for hard work by scientists.\n\n\"Silicon has never felt like such an underachiever.\" Oh, puh-lease. Are you writing for Grade 4 students? Even if so, your cutesy anthropomorphism makes me want to barf.\n\n\"There is more than enough salt water to sate everyone on this planet many times over.\" Really? I never realized the ocean was that big. Thanks for that.\n\n\"...when you have an easily understandable and flexible tool, you can bend it to almost any task.\" No, you cannot. Idiot.\n\nI respect your opinion, but on the other hand, it is quite easy to get frustrated when you read something in popular media that is totally misleading and generally misinforming the public. The guy had an emotional response.\n\nTrue. But are you saying that graphene synthesis and use will some day be cheaper than distillation or the production of polymer RO membranes?\n\nThe funny thing about this is that I find the paper extremely cool. The idea of synthesizing a sieve with well defined pore shape and size is promising. But to say that this will ever be used to desalt water is silly.\n\nNeed drives innovation. I'm not a materials engineer, but I can say that in the past, expensive things which turned out to be really useful ( again, aluminum! ) became cheap.\n\nBecause it behooved engineers and chemists and the like to figure out how to produce them cheaply.\n\nWHo knows how this will turn out? But I'll wager there are labs all over the works eagerly investigating approaches to produce graphene inexpensively. They know that whoever figures it out will make a mint.\n\nAnd if someday they succeed, approaches like this may all of a sudden become economically feasible.\n\nI happen to be a materials chemist :) I'm not using that to \"one up\" you or anything. It's just that my background is in this sort of thing.\n\nI understand your aluminum analogy, but it's not totally valid. Aluminum is mined and refined. There's an almost limitless supply of it waiting to be found and processed. Aluminum is cheap not because it can be \"produced\" cheaply (it isn't produced, after all) but because we've revolutionized ways of shipping the stuff all over the world.That's why aluminum is cheap and commercial drugs are expensive. Commercial drugs need to be synthesized, and this is an energy intensive process.\n\n\"Reverse osmosis like this has been demonstrated before, but using significantly more bulky equipment and at an efficiency level an order of magnitude or three lower, which, as Gizmodo notes, means saltwater can be desalinated 1,000 times faster. And it is without any energy expenditure at all.\"\n\nAnything that brings up the purification efficiency as compared to reverse osmosis is a product that could save lots of water my well is at 2200 TDS. I am a heavy reverse osmosis user now. It is expensive, and also wasteful. If a product became available that reduced my reject ratio, even if it was expensive, I would sstrongly consider it."

      "text": "Decentralised Supply\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nCentralised drinking water systems serve millions of households around the world. However, these systems do often not reach the poorest or the most remote populations and quality and quantity of water provided are often unreliable due to poor operation and maintenance. Decentralised supply systems offer the possibility to provide safe drinking water where centralised supply systems are not feasible due to technical, economical or institutional reasons (e.g. in rural communities or informal settlements). Decentralised water supply refers to the small-scale purification and distribution of water. Decentralised treatment systems fall into three main categories: point-of-use systems (POU), point-of-entry systems (POE), and small-scale systems (SSS). POU and POE systems are designed for individual households while SSS can provide for community water supply, for emergency water supply in camps, or to purify water for sale in water kiosks. The choice of decentralised supply system depends on the local context and includes such factors as ease of use, maintenance needs, dependence on other utilities (e.g. electricity, fuel supply), and cost.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAn informal settlement in Kibera, Kenya, where centralised water supply is impossible due to population growth, lack of resources, and unsupportive legal framework. Source: UNHABITAT and GWA (n.y.).\n\nCentralised water supply is often considered the optimal water supply system, since it provides the most convenient service. However, in 2008, only 57% of the global population got its drinking water from a large-scale piped connection in the user's dwelling, plot, or yard. In developing regions, this percentage was only 49%, with a large disparity between urban (73% having access) and rural communities (31% having access) (UNICEFWHO 2011).\n\nMoreover, large distribution networks have high maintenance costs and are often prone to failures because of poor operation and maintenance. Failure of centralised systems to provide clean, adequate drinking water depends on a number of technical (see also intermittent supply and leakage control), economic, and legal factors. Because of the large amount of infrastructure (e.g. treatment plants, pipes, etc.) needed, there are many situations where it may not be possible to connect the whole population to the centralised supply system, such as in rural areas where populations are dispersed over large surface areas. Especially in developing or transition countries, high population growth in urban areas often leads to the establishment of informal settlements which remain disconnected from supply lines, as providing centralised supply is not technically or economically feasible. Moreover, as these settlements are frequently illegal, the government has no obligation to provide water and sanitation services. Furthermore, centralised water treatment and distribution facilities are often poorly maintained and fall into disrepair, so that even when users are connected to the centralised supply network, the quality and quantity of water may be unreliable (see also intermittent water distribution).\n\nWhere and when?\n\nThe suitability of a decentralised water supply and purification system depends on local needs and context. Before choosing a decentralised system, factors such as water quantity, water quality, and financial resources need to be closely regarded (see also decentralisation in water supply).\n\nPoint-of-use systems\n\nWhether used in a traditional way (e.g. boiling), introduced by NGOs or the market, point-of-use systems are currently widely applied by households with different financial resources in developing, transitional and sometimes even industrialised countries.\n\nPoint-of-entry systems\n\nPoint-of-entry systems are mostly used in industrialised countries as a supplementary treatment of tap or good quality well water, or in homes of wealthy people, hotels, childcare, and medical institutions of developing and transition countries.\n\nSmall-scale systems\n\nWomen queue to buy water from a water kiosk in Lilongwe, Malawi. Source: MALIANO (2012).\n\nSSS are also frequently employed to purify water for informal vendors selling water in water kiosks. This type of water supply can have the benefit of not only providing widespread clean water, but also for the kiosk attendants to earn commission from water sales. Learn more about water kiosks and informal vendors by reading about water vendors.\n\nHow to Optimise?\n\nAs previously mentioned, selection of an appropriate decentralised supply system depends on the local context. Generally, the following factors should be considered (see table below):\n\nPerformance\n\nEase of use\n\nMaintenance needs\n\nIndependence from utilities (e.g. electricity and fuel)\n\nCosts\n\nThere are also ways to combine decentralised technologies with centralised supply systems if water quality from the centralised system is unreliable. This type of combined system is called a dual system, of which there are two main types:\n\nDual central treatment: water of two different qualities is produced and distributed, one for drinking and one for general use (agriculture, washing, etc.).\n\nCost Considerations\n\nThe cost of decentralised supply depends on the technology chosen. While some can be prohibitively expensive, others are affordable even in poor communities. Smaller systems often require less operation and maintenance making them, in some contexts, more sustainable.\n\nSee the table below for more information about specific technologies.\n\nOperation & Maintenance\n\nCompared to centralised supply, decentralised supply requires time-consuming daily operation and maintenance for users. However, centralised water supply networks also require expensive, intensive maintenance, with the difference that it is out of the control of users. Therefore, decentralised supply has the benefit of putting users in control of their system maintenance. See the table below for more information about specific technologies.\n\nTable: Comparison of some different technologies for POU, POE, and SSS water treatment. For POU, costs are estimated for one family of four for one year ($USD), and SSS for 50 m3 of water per year. For performance, \"++\" means water is microbiologically safe under WHO standards, while \"+\" means water is safe only if the treatment is done correctly. For ease of use, \"++\" means daily operation is limited to filling in raw water and collecting treated water, while \"+\" means additional operations are necessary but may be done without training. Source: PETER-VARBANETS et al (2009).\n\nPOE is suitable as a supplementary treatment for centralised water supply to ensure safety, and is usually implemented in industrialised countries or in the homes of wealthy families, hospitals, or childcare facilities in developing or transition countries.\n\nSSS is suitable for community water supply in rural areas of industrialised, developing, or transition countries, and also to supply clean water for sale at water kiosks. SSS is the most common drinking water supply system in emergency situations to provide water in camps.\n\nThe specific technology that should be used depends on local contexts and should consider the water source, water quality, performance, ease of use, maintenance needs, dependence on utilities, and cost.\n\nAdvantages\n\nViable alternative where centralised systems are not feasible due to technical, economical or institutional reasons\n\nWide range of simple, relatively inexpensive and cost effective options are available so people can choose the technologies most appropriate for them\n\nIndependent from an institutional set-up or centralised systems\n\nHigh self-help compatibility\n\nCan be deployed faster than centralised drinking water treatment and supply systems\n\nReduced risk of recontamination or poor maintenance and operation in smaller networks\n\nIt is easier to include the informal market and small-scale businesses from the sector\n\nImproves microbial water quality and reduces contamination risk between treatment and use\n\nDisadvantages\n\nHigh self-responsibility required from the households/communities\n\nDifficult to monitor correct operation and maintenance (O&M) of technologies\n\nEach households should be provided with knowledge on O&M of the system\n\nThis review focuses on decentralised systems that treat the potable water (drinking and cooking) of a single household (point-of-use systems) or a community (small-scale systems). For application in developing and transition countries, important boundary conditions for decentralised systems include low costs, ease of use, sustainability, low maintenance and independence of utilities (energy sources). Although some low-cost systems are available, their application is limited by time-consuming daily operation and maintenance. Other systems are too expensive for the poor populations of developing and transition countries and in most cases do not fulfil the system requirements described above. Point-of-use systems based on membranes are commercially available and are designed to operate on tap pressure or gravity.\n\nThis book provides a general introduction to a wide range of technologies. Among the topics covered are: planning and management of small water supplies, community water supplies in Central and Eastern European countries, water quality and quantity, integrated water resources management, artificial recharge, rainwater harvesting, spring water tapping, groundwater withdrawal, water lifting, surface water intake, water treatment, aeration, coagulation and flocculation, sedimentation, multi-stage filtration, desalination technology, disinfection, household level water treatment, technologies for arsenic and iron removal from ground water, and emergency and disaster water supply. Chapter 21: Water Distribution\n\nThis paper presents an analysis of how often poor consumers in Dhaka, Bangladesh use four POU products and measure their product preferences after they have experience with each product. Along with a companion study, this is one of the first attempts to generate rigorous evidence of how urban households use POU products when multiple products are made available.\n\nSmall membrane-based systems stand as alternative solutions for rural areas and in developing and transition countries where a centralised treatment would not be affordable. Yet, in developing countries, membrane-based systems remain an expensive investment. Thus, simple, low-cost and long-term sustainable systems are required. In order to sustain a well-targeted development of small membrane-based systems, the current commercial offer of the international market should then be investigated. This is the concrete aim of this comprehensive survey.\n\nThis document is divided into three main parts. The first part contains an introduction to the topic and depicts some possible, simple techniques for treating water at the household level. The second part describes the possibility of collaborating to fight against waterborne diseases and the last part presents again some low-cost solutions.\n\nThis document describes the role of small-scale water supply in Europe. It provides a range of background information, case studies and lessons learned, and gives ideas for addressing issues relating to small-scale water supplies in national programmes. Additionally, information on further reading as well as current international networking activities with respect to small-scale water supplies is provided.\n\nDecentralised systems based on integrated urban water management (IUWM) and water sensitive urban design (WSUD) principles are being planned and implemented for urban developments, either as separate facilities or in combination with a centralised system. This report discusses identifying characteristics of decentralised systems in terms of technological options, features and scale. These characteristics were identified through analysis of cases studies in both SEQ and other regions of Australia.\n\nIn Switzerland, rural communities have developed and managed their own water supply networks for a long time – in some cases over 100 years. This publication seeks to recount some experiences from the Swiss decentralised water supply approach that may be helpful or relevant. Even if the Swiss approach cannot be exported as it is, there still may be some lessons to be learned from more than a century of experience.\n\nTypically, the large urban areas represent concentrated demands, both due to large populations and large per capita use and waste. Most urban areas have depleted, polluted or destroyed their local sources of water like rivers, lakes and tanks and in many cases even groundwater.

      "text": "Drinking bottled water is drinking oil\n\nScienceNOW reports a new paper by Peter Gleick and Heather Cooley in Environmental Research Letters that compares the energy use of bottled and tapwater:\n\n… From start to finish, bottled water consumes between 1100 and 2000 times more energy on average than does tap water.\n\nBottled water consumption has skyrocketed over the past several years. In 2007, some 200 billion liters of bottled water were sold worldwide, and Americans took the biggest gulp: 33 billion liters a year, an average of 110 liters per person. That amount has grown 70% since 2001, and bottled water has now surpassed milk and beer in sales. Many environmental groups have been concerned with this surge because they suspected that making and delivering a bottle of water used much more energy than did getting water from the tap. But until now, no one really knew bottled water's energy price tag.\n\nEnvironmental scientist Peter Gleick of the Pacific Institute, a nonprofit research organization in Oakland, California, and his colleague Heather Cooley have added up the energy used in each stage of bottled-water production and consumption. Their tally includes how much energy goes into making a plastic bottle; processing the water; labeling, filling, and sealing a bottle; transporting it for sale; and cooling the water prior to consumption.\n\nThe two most energy-intensive categories, the researchers reveal in the current issue of Environmental Research Letters, are manufacturing the bottle and transportation. The team estimates that the global demand for bottle production alone uses 50 million barrels of oil a year–that's 2 1/2 days of U.S. oil consumption. Determining the energy required to transport a bottle isn't as straightforward. Some bottles of water travel short distances, but others are imported from far-off countries, which increases their energy footprint. Gleick and Cooley found that drinking an imported bottle of water is about two-and-a-half to four times more energy intensive than getting it locally, often outweighing the energy required to make the bottle.\n\nAll told, Gleick estimates that U.S. bottled-water consumption in 2007 required an energy input equivalent to 32 million to 54 million barrels of oil. Global energy demand for bottled water is three times that amount. To put that energy use into perspective, Gleick says to imagine that each bottle is up to one-quarter full of oil.\n\n11 Responses to Drinking bottled water is drinking oil\n\nGreat information. Bottled water has invaded my north Florida home in the past few years. We've had four bottling plant proposals along a 10 miles stretch of the Santa Fe River in Columbia and Gilchrist counties. Fortunately, they've all been turned away … so far. I am a photographer using my work for conservation. You can see more of my work at: \n\nFantastic article. As an environmental consultant its great to see that bottled water has a greater cost to the environment and this is in monetary terms. We now have some evidence to encourage people to drink tap water or to make more use household water filters.\n\nCan anyone tell me how many barrels of oil are used in the manufacturing and transportation of for the global demand of single use plastic. That in my mind would include, bottled water, plastic bags, other drinks bottles, food containers, straws etc. I would like to know what % of our global demand for oil is used for this industry."

      "text": "Safe Water Supply\n\nPure Desalinated Seawater Distilled Water for Third World Villages\n\nA High-Performance Still System, but with NO flame or fire or any need for Diesel Fuel or nano-filters!\n\nFirst placed on the Internet in March 2008\n\nYou have noticed that when you have a glass of iced soda, that\noften droplets of water form on the OUTSIDE of the glass. There are\npeople who think that water is seeping through the glass, but that is\nnot true! What is actually happening is that the cold liquid INSIDE\nthe glass causes the glass itself to get cold (which you know).\nTHEN, when WARM room air happens to pass near that cool glass, the\nAIR cools down. IF it cools down enough, and if the humidity in the\nroom is high enough, the air cools to below the Dewpoint.\nWhat that means is that the cooler air cannot then contain as much water\nvapor as it normally had, and so droplets of water MUST form on the\ncool surface as some of the water condenses.\n\nThis is also\nwhy fog occurs (in that case, the water droplets condense around tiny\nspecks of dust in the air) or why basement walls are often damp or\nwhy some windows can have water or even ice form on them in winter.\n\nSometimes in the morning, you see a whole\nyard full of dewdrops on lawn grass. This occurs because the grass had\ncooled during the night and normally warm and humid air condenses on\nevery blade of cooled grass. This is actually sometimes gallons of\nvery pure (distilled) water as dew, which might seem collectible, but which\nwill simply naturally evaporate as the grass warms in the morning sun.\nThe system described here is just an organized way to permit that natural\ndew creation, underground where it is cool, and collection,\nmaximized with modern Engineering techniques.\n\nThese water droplets that form are PERFECTLY PURE water,\nalso called distilled water. All you would need to do would be\nto collect all those droplets! THAT is what this system does, but\non a far more organized basis and far more efficiently.\n\nIf seawater is run into a shallow pond, by natural tidal action,\nand that pond is covered by a plastic sheet covering, the enclosed air\nand water will heat up in sunlight and some will evaporate (leaving\nthe salt in the pond). This now very warm air will contain high humidity\nwhich is PURE water!\n\nBy sending that very warm, very humid air through a long, cool\nunderground tube that is deep enough and long enough, some of the humidity\nin the air can condense on the tube walls. By having the SEALED\nunderground pipe slightly slope downhill like a house rain gutter, that water is\nthen collected, and it is essentially distilled water, very pure!\n\nThis is a very simple and inexpensive system which virtually\ncannot ever break down!\n\nYou have certainly seen water dripping\nfrom window air conditioners. You probably never realized how extremely\nPURE that water is! (Although you should not drink it as some air conditioners\nhave lead solder inside them which is dangerous)\nYou may also know that central air conditioners condense as much\nas 12 quarts (3 gallons) of humidity from the air (per day) in the process\nof cooling it. Dehumidifiers do the same thing with the INTENTION\nof removing humidity from the air (by cooling the air briefly!)\nThe water flow through the drain hose of any air conditioner is easily\nconfirmed and is quite impressive!\n\nMaybe you think that only an irrelevantly small amount of water\nexists as humidity in the air. That is not the case! If the entire\nEarth's atmosphere is considered, we know that about\n4,000,000,000,000,000 gallons of water is always in it! There are\nover 7 billion people now living, but that means that there is enough\nhumidity in the total atmosphere where around 6,000,000 gallons of\nwater could theoretically be provided for every single one of us!\nAnd it gets replaced every day as warm ocean waters evaporate over\n3/4 of the Earth's surface area!\n\nIt is certainly true that over a desert, the humidity is lower, but it is\nnever zero! The water production of this simple system is much less\nin a desert than in a tropical rain forest, but it ALWAYS works!\n\nYou have certainly seen water dripping from window air conditioners.\nYou may also know that central air conditioners condense as much\nas 12 quarts (3 gallons) of humidity from the air in the process\nof cooling it. The water flow through the drain hose is easily\nconfirmed and is quite impressive!\n\nThis process of sending air through underground (cool) tubes\nhas long been the process of our \"free air conditioning\"\nsystem, but this case is different in that we intentionally\nsend HUMID outdoor air through the tubes rather than less humid house air.\n\nA consistent several gallons of water per day is usually produced by this\nBASIC system, but additional features can easily increase this to\nmany gallons per day.\n\nIn fact, we have Engineered a larger-scale Municipal system which might\nbe used in Port-au-Prince, Haiti to\nprovide 700 gallons or 3,000 gallons of perfectly pure distilled water\nthere every day, and all for a total cost of roughly $10,000, and it is\ninstallable in one or two days. If they chose to install\ntwenty such systems, they might be able to supply as much as 60,000 gallons\nof pure water to combat the many severe diseases that are spreading due\nto people having to use contaminated water. This Municipal\nsystem is a Desalinization\nvariant of this humidity condensation system, and of much larger\nscale than this presentation generally discusses. That system\nis also suitable for many other places where pure water supplies are\nlimited and ocean water is available, such as Indonesia, Bangladesh,\nIndia, Egypt or most islands.\n\nExisting methods of desalinizing seawater (commonly RO\nor Reverse Osmosis) are all incredibly\nexpensive (on the order of a million dollars per installation or more);\nthey require large and consistent supplies of diesel fuel, to power the\nhigh pressure pumps (as high as 1180 PSI) note 4\nwhich are needed to force the water\nthrough nano-filters which have incredibly small holes in them; those\nfilters clog up regularly and require Technicians to constantly\nbe cleaning and repairing them; and all those tons of equipment\ncan rarely be transported to remote locations to be installed;\nin addition, the water that is produced by RO or ED systems is barely safe\nto drink, generally having 500 ppm of contaminants still in it,\nwhere our low-expense system provides virtually PURE water!\n\nHere is a very simple, very inexpensive system to provide absolutely pure\nwater for remote Third World Villages near an ocean that otherwise do not\nhave easy sources for safe drinking water. It is essentially a\nnatural dehumidifier, which causes some of the moisture that\nis always in the air as humidity to be condensed out in a cool\nunderground pipe-tunnel.\nTwo hundred and fifty gallons (1,000 liters) of absolutely pure distilled\nwater per day is very realistic for most locations. The total\nexpenditure for installing this system is around $400US.\n\nWhere all current desalinization systems use massive amounts\nof fossil-fuels to power the equipment, this system uses NO fossil\nfuels whatever! It is absolutely GREEN!\n\nYou are probably familiar with the fact that during the summer,\nconcrete basement walls are often damp or even wet. That occurs\nbecause the warm outdoor humid air gets into the basement, and when\nit passes near the colder concrete wall or floor, it cools and\nloses some of its ability to hold moisture. If the air drops\nto a temperature low enough, then some of the moisture has to\ncondense into water droplets. That is essentially the concept\nused here, but this system uses an enclosed chamber to keep\nthe water purer.\n\nYou may be familiar with a survival procedure taught to travelers\nto remote areas, where they spread a small sheet of plastic\nsuspended above the ground. The relatively cool ground beneath it\ncauses the plastic to (often) be cooler than the hot daytime\nair, and some humidity (moisture) in the air can condense into droplets\non that cooler plastic, and then be collected to drink to survive.\nThat very crude method enables capturing a very small amount of the\nhumidity in the air. The system described here is a far more\nsophisticated and far more effective way of doing that same process.\n\nOK. You are skeptical! How can there be much water in the\natmosphere? And, in SOME climates, such as deserts,\nthat concern is valid.\nBut look at this graph of the outdoor relative humidity for a location\nnear Chicago, Illinois, USA. See that the outdoor relative\nhumidity is amazingly high in nearly all months! In the morning,\nit is nearly always at least 80% and in the afternoon when it is usually\nlowest, it is still generally over 60%. There is a LOT of water\nin the atmosphere as humidity!\n\nIn the Summer, it works impressively. In the winter, the moisture is\nstill in the air, but the ground is probably not cold enough to cause\nit to condense there. So, for a climate like Chicago, only about\nsix to eight months of substantial water production is possible with\nthe basic system. However, the (discussed) addition of a $200\naccessory, an HG 3a device can produce even larger quantities of water\nevery day of the year, and THAT is true in ANY climate, even a desert!\n\nRoughly two billion of the six billion people living on Earth\nnow do not have adequate supplies of safe drinking water and water\nfor adequate cleaning and bathing. Many people have to walk hours\nto obtain small amounts of borderline quality water on which to try\nto survive. This amazingly simple device\ncan provide PLENTY of water for MOST of those people!\n\nAll atmospheric air contains some moisture, water, which we call\nhumidity. If that air is COOLED, its \"RELATIVE\" humidity\nincreases, because cooler air cannot contain as much moisture\nin it. If it is possible to cool it enough, the air gets to\n100% relative humidity, and the saturated air starts having\ntiny droplets of water condense out on cooler surfaces.\nThat water is PERFECTLY PURE water that is called Distilled water.\n\nNOTICE: The system described here is SEALED. The air inside\nthe underground tube and any water in the soil CANNOT mix! This\nis EXTREMELY important! Otherwise, any sewage in the groundwater\nor pesticides or industrial contaminants in the soil or the\ngroundwater might be able to seep into the pure distilled water\nthat this system creates.\n\nThere are actually three separate components to this very efficient\ndesal system. Each is simple and inexpensive to create at the location.\n\nWe have found that for many environments, simply blowing hot daytime\nair through a COOL underground tube, is able to cool the air\nenough for the condensation to occur. In this case, we use the very\nhumid air near an ocean as the source of that air, which contains a lot\nof water vapor in it that had recently evaporated from the ocean.\n\nThe other two components\nof this system are to maximize the relative humidity in the air\ngoing into this tube and to heat that air to also increase its ability to\ncontain moisture. A Chart and also an automatic Calculator below provides\nthe necessary information to know how many gallons of perfectly\npure distilled water can be obtained in this way, directly from\nthe atmosphere! (Much of the operation of the combination of the\nthree devices is so effective that it is off the right hand side\nof that Chart!)\n\nIf you live in a cold climate, and ever wear glasses, you know that\nif you have been outdoors where the glass has gotten cold, that when\nyou enter a warm house, your glasses immediately fog up! What\nhappens is that the warm humid air of the house cools down when it\ngets near anything cold, such as the glass, and that cooler air cannot\ncontain as much moisture as when it was warmer. If the room is\nhumid enough and the glass is cool enough, the (local) relative\nhumidity gets up to 100% and tiny droplets of water condense\nout of the air onto the surface of the glasses. (A minute later,\nthe glasses warm up and this problem ends.) Similarly, if house\nwindows are single-pane, on cold winter days, room humidity condenses\non the cold window glass and droplets of water form, and can even\nfreeze into ice!\n\nThis new system operates in a way that is also somewhat similar to how a\nsolar still works, except that the Sun is not necessary, no sheets of glass\nare necessary, and seawater and some local dead vegetation are the\nonly necessary materials! The first two components HEAT the air and the\nwater to increase the amount of water vapor in the air that goes into the\nunderground tube. This concept uses the fact that deep underground, the\nsoil is naturally cooler than the daytime air temperature note 3.\n\nAll of these things occur because warm air can hold more water vapor in it\nthan cooler air can, and that the deep soil is cooler than the air\ntemperature during hot summer days, and usually during winter days as well.\nThe fact that it might not be cooler than the nighttime temperature\nis taken care of by the first device involved, the HG 3a unit.\n\nThis amazingly simple and inexpensive system can realistically supply\n250 gallons (1,000 liters) of perfectly pure water every day! There is\nessentially nothing which can break down, so it should reliably provide water\nfor many, many years.\n\nBasic setup, which can be modified in many ways for locally available\nmaterials and conditions:\n\nWe are showing the three devices from right to left. (1) The (green circle\nhere) HG 3a unit is normally designed as a heating system, but the exhaust\ncoming out of it is excellent for this system. The HG 3a unit\nactually PRODUCES around SIX POUNDS OF WATER PER HOUR from the very\nmaterial of the dead vegetable material put into it. This is due to the\nchemical reaction of the decomposition of cellulose and the other\norganic materials into carbon dioxide and water vapor, the opposite\nof what happened when the plant grew due to\nphotosynthesis note 1.\nThe plant material generally also contains some water as well, so the\ntotal amount of water coming out of the HG 3a unit is generally greater\nthan the 6 pounds per hour. (That alone is around 18 gallons (70 liters) of\nperfectly pure distilled water per 24 hours.)\n\nThe HG 3a also can send around 90,000 Btu/hr of heat out in those\nsame exhaust gases, all in the range of 130°F to 150°F (or 54°C to\n66°C). (2) This amount of heat is sent into the second component of this\nsystem, a relatively simple \"heat bag\" over a very shallow\npond of seawater. That rather hot air passing over the seawater causes\nsome of it to evaporate, which further increases the moisture contained\nin the air inside the chamber bag. Since it takes roughly 1000 Btu\nto evaporate one pound of water, the 90,000 Btus provided to the\nbag by the HG 3a device has the (maximum) capability of evaporating\nnearly 90 pounds of water (or about 12 gallons [50 liters]) per hour. This\namount is actually less because some of the heat is lost upward through the\nbag, except in the middle of very sunny days in Equatorial locations.\nAt such times, the evaporation is even greater than this, due to the\nadded heating due to the Sun's heat. At night the performance is less\ndue to greater heat losses through the top of the bag. A 30-foot-square\ntarp as a water tray, with one-inch deep of seawater, contains\naround 600 gallons (2,400 liters) of seawater. A thinner layer of water\nwould heat up better and faster, and therefore more would evaporate to\nprovide humidity in the air for the final\ndevice note 2.\n\n(3) After the air has been heated and humidified by the first two\ndevices, it goes into the third device, the underground tube, where the\ncoolness of the deep soil causes much of the moisture contained in that\nhot humid air to condense as tiny water droplets on the walls of the\nburied tube. Those water droplets go downhill and into the collection\npipe area and then the collection tank. A conventional hot water tank\ncan usually be considered to be clean of previous chemicals, while a\n55-gallon drum might not be. A simple hand-crank pump can raise\nwater for each family that brought a container for it.\n\nThe rightmost device, the HG 3a unit is fully described, with all\nthe engineering information included, in\nHeatGreen heating system.\nThat page also includes a Big Bag version that is very crude but very\nsimple and inexpensive\n\nIf the air sent into the underground tube is around 140°F (60°C)\ntemperature, and the relative humidity is around 60%, then every\npound of that air contains about 0.06 pound of water in it as water\nvapor. This is standard thermodynamics information, as indicated in\nthe Psychrometric Chart presented and discussed below. (This particular\nair is hotter and more humid than this standard Chart shows, so the\nlines of the Chart must be extended to the right and above to get\nthis approximate value).\n\nIf this air can be de-humidified so that it becomes around 20% relative\nhumidity, it would then only contain 0.014 pound of water in it. We would\ncapture the difference, around 0.046 pound of water, as actual water\ndroplets. This does not sound like much, but if we send just 1000 pounds of\nair through our underground tube, this is 46 pounds of water, or around six\ngallons (25 liters).\n\nThe same Psychrometric Chart shows that at that temperature and humidity,\none pound of air takes up around 16 cubic feet, so we are talking about\n16,000 cubic feet of air. If we hope to produce ten gallons (40 liters) of\nthis Distilled Water per hour, we then only need to send around 450 cubic\nfeet of air through the tube every minute ((16,000 * 10/6)/60), a relatively\nmoderate airflow. (Obviously, additional buried tubes or additional\nHG 3a devices or larger evaporation pond areas can be arranged for greater\nwater production per day.)\n\nThis is roughly 250 gallons (1,000 liters) of absolutely pure water\nto drink and for washing and bathing every day! All from a rather\nsimple arrangement of three simple and inexpensive devices!\n\nThe original ocean seawater is not drinkable due to the high salt content\nin it. Existing systems which try to desalinate saltwater are incredibly\nexpensive, complex and high-tech. Unfortunately, they generally do not\nwork on seawater because the high salt content quickly clogs\nup microscopic filters and accumulated salt deposits clog up nearly\neverything else. This simple system, of the underground tube\nin combination with the two rather simple accessories, can provide\nas much as ten gallons (40 liters) of perfectly pure Distilled water every\nhour, 24 hours each day, or around 250 gallons (1,000 liters) of water\nthat is desalinated to a purity even BETTER than when\nexpensive high-tech equipment is used!\n\nAll the water that is produced by this system COMES FROM THE AIR.\nThe seawater or other water is evaporated, which leaves all contaminants\nbehind. The water in that air is then condensed in the underground tube.\nThat means that it is absolutely pure water, called Distilled Water.\nThose accessories simply increase the relative humidity of the air\nentering the underground tube by evaporating the seawater\nwhich is available, since when that\nwater evaporates from its source, all the contaminants are left and\nonly the pure water evaporates.\n\nIt seems reasonable to consider assembling this system right at a\nseashore if possible. That would eliminate the need for transporting\nthe seawater any distance to this equipment. There seems another\npossible advantage in a really careful selection of location.\n\nSay that the normal tides cause a change of two vertical feet in\nthe level of the ocean, in a constant cycle of around every 13\nhours. So imagine arranging for the \"shallow water tray\"\nof the middle device in this system to be located around half a\nfoot above the average ocean level. That should cause the incoming\ntide to overflow the shallow tray with about six inches of water and\nalso the turbulence of many waves, which should have the effect\nof naturally cleaning all the salt deposits from the previous\n10 hours from that tray. After maybe two hours of this effect,\nthe tide goes back out, leaving an entirely new supply of seawater\nin the tray, ready for the system and sunlight to evaporate it.\n\nThis would seem to provide not only an automatic supply of new\nocean water in the tray, but also an automatic cleansing of the tray\nfrom previous salt deposits.\n\nHowever, some Third World communities may not want the ocean to be\nautomatically cleaning the evaporation tray! Some communities in\nIndia had developed a very profitable business by collecting and\nselling the sea salts that remain after the water has evaporated.\nEach Village would have a choice of the convenience of the automatic\ncleansing or the availability of a new source of a lot of sea salts.\n\nPossible Complications\n\nIf this system is used without either of the accessory components,\nwhere the air which enters the tube is directly from the local\natmospheric air, then it is possible that dust or even small sand\ngrains can be carried in that air, and therefore get inside the\nsloping underground tube. So, in certain climates, it is possible that\nthe resulting water might appear to be slightly cloudy rather than\nperfectly clear. These are materials which are NOT dissolved in\nthe water. They are generally absolutely safe in water, but they\ncan be removed either by letting the water remain in a container for\nsome time to let such things settle out, or the water could be poured\nthrough any of many simple filters to remove such materials.\n\nThe only other real complication is that the basic system described\nhere is dependent on the heat from sunlight to evaporate the water\ninto becoming humidity, so the basic system can (usually) only\noperate during daytime hours. The solution to a larger water production\nand also 24-hour water production is to include the HG 3a unit as\na heat (and water) source.\n\nTechnical Information\n\nThe following section is some technical info that shows how to determine\nhow much water might be captured from the air in any specific climate.\nIt is based on a standard Psychrometric Chart.\n\nWe will use an example of where the air temperature is 120°F (49°C) and\nthe relative humidity is 30%. (Any other local weather conditions can\nbe similarly analyzed). In the Psychrometric Chart below, this is\nalong the very right edge of this chart, at the bottom right end of the\nred line. We can see that the air contains about 0.022 pound of water in\nevery pound of air (which the chart also shows takes up a little\nover 15 cubic feet). THIS is the air that we will have enter the start of\nthe buried tube system. As this air is cooled down by contact with the\nmuch cooler (70°F or 21°C) walls of the tube, it first cools in a process\nthat is called reversible adiabatic. This means that the Enthalpy of the\ndry air, the energy content per pound, stays constant during the process.\nThis is represented by our red line toward the left and upward.\n\nWe can see that the Relative Humidity percentage keeps rising as the air\ngets cooled. This is because cool air cannot hold as much moisture\nas warm air does. This process can continue until the air becomes\nsaturated, or is at what is called the dew-point.\nOnce our air has cooled to around 88°F (31°C), it has\ngotten up to 100% Relative Humidity, meaning that it cannot hold\nany more water in it than that.\n\nAt this point, the process necessarily moves along the green line\nin our example, downward and to the left, as the air continues to\nbe cooled in the underground tube. This process is where moisture\ncan condense out of the air, in our case, on the walls of the cool\nunderground tube. By the time it has gotten to\nthe end of the tube and the air is then at around 70°F or 21°C, the\nPsychrometric Chart shows us that the air which had initially contained\n0.022 pound of water per pound of air at the very start of entering the\ntube, is now fully saturated air which now contains only 0.016 pound of water\nin it. The remainder of that initial humidity has necessarily\ncondensed into (absolutely pure, distilled) water droplets on the inside\nof the underground tube. For every pound of air that entered the tube,\n(0.022 - 0.016 or) 0.006 pound of water forms inside the tube.\nIf 100 cubic feet of air enters the tube every minute, that is about\n(100 / 15.3) 6.5 pounds of air every minute or 390 pounds of air\nevery hour. This then means that for this situation, (390 * 0.006)\n2.4 pounds of water would condense out every hour, around 0.3\ngallon per hour. A realistic two gallons of absolutely pure water\nevery day.\n\nEnd of technical information!\n\nI have come to realize that I may have been optimistic regarding\nwhether many people could find usefulness in the Psychrometric\nChart above! Therefore, I have created a simplified way of getting\nthe needed data, without having to understand the Thermodynamics\nor Engineering involved! You can use the following automatic\ncalculator to get the results you need, for any location and\nany circumstances.\n\nIf local wind (or a blower) is at 12.5 mph\n(6 m/s) and a single buried 4\" tube therefore has 100 cubic feet (2.8\ncubic meters) passing through it every minute, then there is around\ngallons per hour or\nliters per hour,\nof water in that air passing through the tube.\n\nWe now know the amount of water IN the air. We can also determine\nhow much water would be LEFT in the air after it has passed through\nthe underground tube. Use the same calculator above, but now put in\ndifferent data: the temperature will be the UNDERGROUND temperature;\nand the humidity will be 100%, because, in order for any water to\nhave condensed out, the air inside the tube must have risen to\n100% at that temperature.\n\nThe DIFFERENCE of these two numbers then gives a very accurate\nestimate of the amount of water that will be condensed out in\nANY location and under any circumstances!\n\nAn example:\n\nOn a sunny day in an African location, the mid-daytime air temperature\nmight be 130°F, and the relative humidity might be 25%. The calculator\nshows that the air passing through a tube would then contain\n1.14 gallons of water per hour. If the deep soil was at 70F, the\ncalculator shows that 0.83 gallons of water would remain in the\nair, NOT being condensed out, after it passed through the tube. The\nDIFFERENCE, 0.31 gallon of water per hour, would be what could be\ncollected. In the several hours of daytime sunlight, this could\nprovide an excellent two gallons of absolutely pure water every day!\n\nAnother example:\n\nOn a sunny summer day near Chicago, IL, USA, the mid-daytime air temperature\nmight be 100°F, and the relative humidity might be 40%. The calculator\nshows that the air passing through a tube would then contain\n0.82 gallon of water per hour. If the deep soil was at 52F, the\ncalculator shows that 0.45 gallons of water would remain in the\nair, NOT being condensed out, after it passed through the tube. The\nDIFFERENCE, 0.37 gallon of water per hour, would be what could be\ncollected. In the several hours of daytime sunlight, this could\nprovide an excellent two gallons of absolutely pure water every day!\n\nThese are not spectacular amounts of water, but the equipment can\neasily be installed, it is extremely cheap to obtain, and it can\noperate entirely automatically, allowing natural winds to blow\nthe air through the tube. It is obviously also possible to dig\nten trenches and install ten of these simple underground tubes,\nto obtain ten times as much water.\n\nNote also that, with this BASIC system, there can be situations\nwhen NO water condenses out! If you use the calculator for 80°F\nsoil temperature, the air LEAVING that tube would still contain\n(up to) 1.14 gallon of water per hour, so with the African example\njust given, that is GREATER than the amount of water entering the\ntube. Therefore NONE would condense out, and no pure water would\nthen be collected.\n\nFor such situations, it can be useful to build an HG 3a device as\nwell. The normal operation of the HG 3a can naturally produce a\nconsistent 6 pounds (or 0.73 gallon) of water every hour in its exiting air,\nat a temperature that is often around 150°F. The airflow rate is\nslower than the natural wind airflow in our examples above, around\n1/10 as fast a flow of air. If the soil temperature is 70°F, then\naround 0.08 gallon of water (due to the 1/10 airflow rate) will be left\nin that air (every hour) after it has passed through the underground\ntube. This leaves 0.65 gallon of pure water that would be\ncondensed and collected every hour. Better, it operates 24 hours\na day instead of just the few sunny hours that the BASIC setup\ncan do, so it will consistently provide around 16 gallons of pure\nwater every day (24 * 0.65). If we consider the situation where\nthe deep soil temperature is 80°F or let's examine an extreme 90°F deep\nsoil, it will still work fine at providing pure water! Deep soil at\n90°F will cause 0.15 gallon of water to remain in the air after\nit passes through the tube, so we would collect (0.73 - 0.15) or\n0.58 gallon of pure water per hour. That is still around 13 gallons\nof pure water EVERY DAY.\n\nA CONSISTENT 13 gallons to 16 gallons of absolutely pure water\nevery day, essentially anywhere on Earth! And all with a system which\ninvolves a total cost of around $300 to $400! The system is very\nsimple, very automatic, and virtually nothing in it can break down.\nAnd even if something ever did, local villagers should be able to\nfigure out how to repair the simple devices involved!\n\nThe automatic calculator can also be used in estimating the\nperformance of the \"pond\" variants of the system, whether\nwith or without an HG 3a device being involved. Below, we provide\nthe entire Engineering analysis for a large-scale installation\nin Port-au-Prince, Haiti, which fully shows the proper usage of the\nautomatic calculator.\n\nThe air temperature of the air inside the chamber over the pond needs\nto be measured (or estimated). If the pond is\nlarge enough and the sunlight intense enough, the relative humidity\ninside the chamber can be near 100%, depending on how fast the airflow\nis removing that air. If an HG 3a device is also used, the consistency of\nthat 100% humidity is better assured, and it is then true 24 hours\neach day rather than only when the sun was providing heat energy\nto evaporate the water.\n\nAn example in another rather hot climate:\n\nSay that we are able to have our 100 cfm airflow, but that our\npond and chamber are able to provide a consistent supply of 120°F\nair which is at 100% relative humidity. If we enter these numbers\nin the automated calculator above, we see that 0.588 gallon of humidity\nwater is in every thousand cubic feet. Since our 100 cfm is 6,000 cfh,\nthis means that we have 0.588 * 6 or 3.53 gallons of\nwater in the air entering the tube every hour. If the deep\nsoil temperature is at 80°F, we also see that the air LEAVING\nthe tube will still have 0.19 gallon of humidity water in it per\nthousand cubic feet or, for our entire 6,000 cfh, there would still be\n1.14 gallon of humidity in it. This means\nthat this configuration would cause (3.53 - 1.14) 2.39 gallons\nof perfectly pure water every hour to HAVE to condense out on the\ncool tube walls underground, or around 58 gallons in every\n24 hour day.\n\nThis calculation is in using some heat source to cause the shallow\npond of seawater to be evaporating all day and night. If that is not\ndone, where only six hours of sunlight evaporates the water,\nthe daily production would be closer to 6 * 2.39 or 15 gallons\nof absolutely pure water every sunny day.\n\nBy arranging a larger pond size or better using solar heat or additional\nHG 3a devices, this water production could be increased even more,\nto provide PLENTY of perfectly pure water for nearly any sized village!\n\nWith such a simple and inexpensive system, digging another trench\nand installing a duplicate system also seems a logical option if more\nwater is desired.\n\nIf 450 cubic feet of air pass through the tube in a minute (in the full\nactual system of the three devices) we already determined that around\n1.25 pound of water\nwould form inside the tube every minute. This is around 75 pounds of water\nin an hour, or around ten gallons (40 liters) of pure distilled water\nper hour. There is a slight reduction at night, but quite\na bit of water is collected then as well, due to the heat supplied\nby the HG 3a unit.\n\nAir needs to be passing through the system. It may NOT be\nnecessary to have to use any blower, because the entrance to\nthe HG 3a unit could be provided with a wind-vane type of tail to\nturn an intake funnel into the wind at all times.\n\nHowever, if the climate is such that a blower is sometimes necessary,\nthe 12-volt blower from a car heater system could be used, powered\nfrom a standard 12-volt battery which is charged by a simple windmill,\nsuch as a Savonius rotor made of an old 55-gallon drum.\n\nComparison with Existing Methods of Desalinization\n\nThere are several methods which are in use to desalinate water.\nMost of them are extremely complex, and they are therefore subject to\nregular breakdowns, unless nearly constant maintenance is done\nto them. They also tend to require very advanced components,\nsuch as filters that are called nano-filters because their holes\nare on the order of a few billionths of an inch. Such filters\ntend to clog very rapidly with very salty water, and\ntherefore the devices are dependent on suppliers of such nano-filters,\nand technicians who know how to correctly clean and replace\nthem. (The filters are so microscopic because those systems\nrely on the fact that some atoms and molecules are too large\n(including most minerals like sodium chloride)\nto fit through those holes while others (specifically water) can fit\nthrough. The principle works great, as long as the holes do not get\nclogged up, which is a constant problem in such equipment.)\n\nMany variants of such equipment exist, with most being versions\nof either Reverse Osmosis (RO) or Electrodialysis (ED).\nThe main reason they clog up so extremely often is because\n1,000 gallons (4,000 liters) of seawater contains about 300 pounds of\ndissolved\nsalt and other chemical ions. Both RO and ED systems work far\nbetter on what is called brackish water, which is far less\nsalty than seawater. ED is not even attempted on seawater\nany more, after attempts were essentially all failures, and RO\nis not particularly successful for seawater either.\n\nDistillation is the other common method used for desalinating\nwater. Traditional distillation was considered to be too\nslow and inefficient, and most recent installations\ninvolve variants, such as what is called flash distillation.\nDue to the large quantities of salts in the seawater, such\nequipment tends to quickly get encrusted with salt, because such\nactions increase with temperature and flash distillation\nuses rather high temperatures. Many modifications have been\nadded to the distillation process to try to deal with such\nproblems, which has made such installations very large and\ncomplex and expensive.\n\nThe system presented here is a variety of standard distillation,\nbut it does not have such problems. The two\ntarps (bottom as a tray and top as a heat and humidity cover)\nare simple to clean of accumulated salt deposits, and there\nare communities in India that collected such sea salt to be sold for\nsignificant profit (as mentioned above). The underground tube never\nhas any contamination or deposits form as the only thing that enters\nit is air with humidity in it. If the atmosphere in the area\nis heavily polluted, it is possible that some of that air\npollution could get into the tube and therefore into the\nresulting distilled water. A simple intake filter can be used to\nkeep most dust out of the pipe, and if desired, the resulting water\ncould be poured through a cloth or carbon filter to remove any slight\ncolor or taste. That is rarely a problem for Third World countries\nunless natural dust storms occur. It also is rarely a problem even for\nany remote location where Americans try to go off-grid.\n\nIn general, RO and ED systems are designed to filter out enough\nsalt to lower the seawater's normal concentration of 35,000 ppm\n(parts per million) of salt down to around 1,000 ppm, which\nis considered usable for some purposes. If the water is to be potable,\nit must be lowered even more down to below 500 ppm. In much of the US,\nthe requirement for potable water is to be less than 250 ppm.\nThis represents a reduction of salt content of seawater by a\nfactor of about 140, which is why desalinization of seawater\nhas not become broadly used, with previous approaches. Those methods\nare good when the source water is BRACKISH, that is, less salty\nthan ocean water is, where that brackish water can be filtered\nquite successfully.\n\nWith any Distillation method, including ours, there is ZERO\nsalt content in the resulting Distilled water! The reason is\nobvious, that the salt CANNOT be evaporated with the water,\nand therefore can never even get into the underground tube\nto get condensed. So Distillation methods result in far\npurer water than RO or ED can even hope to achieve.\n\nThere are many other methods which have been tried, such as\nfreezing seawater. The premise is that fresh water freezes\nat 32°F or 0°C, where seawater freezes at a temperature that\nis several degrees lower. So if seawater is cooled to around\n30°F, only the fresh water can actually freeze, which should\nresult in pure fresh water. Unfortunately, the reality is\nthat this process results in crystals of salt being trapped\nwithin the fresh water ice that results, and so there is\nstill significant salt in the resulting water or ice. It turns\nout that this process also involves massive usage of electricity\nfor refrigeration, and it has generally been ignored as being\ntoo expensive for practical use.\n\nCosts of Equipment and Operation\n\nThe cost of the equipment to desalinate water on a large scale\nis very significant, when using conventional existing technologies.\nThe usual industrial standard is one million gallons of water processed\nper day. For most RO or Distillation systems that process\nseawater, that is around $6 to $8 million (1995) US dollars.\nFor most RO or ED systems that process the far less salty brackish\nwater, the cost of equipment is around 1/4 of that, around $1.5 to\n$2 million.\n\nNote that the system we describe in this presentation has a\ntotal cost of around $60 for the underground tube part and $200 for the\nHG 3a device and $40 for the simple tarps or $300 total, and\nit can provide a consistent 250 gallons (1,000 liters) of pure distilled\nwater per day.\n\nThe larger-scale system Engineered for Haiti is estimated to have a\ncost of $10,000 in providing as much as 3,000 gallons of pure water\nper day. It is true that around 300 such installations would be\nneeded to provide a million gallons per day, and that would cost a\ntotal of around $3 million dollars to install. However the resulting\nwater would be far purer than any water from any RO or ED installation.\nThis is not only far less expensive\nthan the $6 to $8 million of current technologies, but it would\nprovide water at a far greater purity, approaching 0 ppm of dissolved\nmaterials rather than the 1000 ppm that is currently accepted.\n\nThe actual cost of providing water is higher still, because of the extensive\nneed for (externally provided, fossil fuel, usually diesel oil) power needed\nfor those various systems, as well as for getting supplies of such\nfuels to remote locations where desalination operations are needed.\nThe fact that highly trained technicians must always be on-site\nto maintain and repair the equipment adds to the cost of operation.\n\nWhen these factors are combined with the cost of the initial capital,\nthe interest on those funds, and depreciation of the equipment, the\nfollowing general guidelines result:\n(obtained from Handbook for Mechanical Engineers, 1995)\n\nCost per thousand gallons of water provided\n\nRO processing seawater, $6 to $8\n\nFlash Distillation processing seawater, $6 to $8\n\nEither of the above with Power Recovery provisions, $4 to $6\n\nED processing brackish water, $1 to $2\n\nRO processing brackish water, $1 to $2\n\nIn contrast, modern American Municipal water supplies averaged\naround $0.15 (in 1995), with an additional $0.20 to $0.40 for\ndistribution costs.\n\nThe new system presented here involves no distribution costs,\nas the water is produced locally for the users. In addition,\nmaintenance and repair are minimal and very simple, where\nlocal villagers should generally be able to correct anything\nthat could go wrong, and also clean any of the items that\nmight require such maintenance.\n\nIt also involves NO FOSSIL FUELS at all, as it is\nentirely self-powered by a combination of sunlight and the\ndecomposition of locally available organic materials such as\ngrasses and leaves. A very small amount of other power\nmight be needed for a blower if that is required due to\nlack of sufficient winds, but a small and crude windmill\nshould be able to provide those minimal requirements.\n\nIn contrast, all current desalinization systems which are\nbeing generally used require around half a million Btus\nof energy from fossil fuels to produce one thousand gallons\nof usable water.\n\nThis results in THIS system having essentially no costs for fuel or other\npower, beyond the hauling and loading of that vegetative matter into\nthe HG 3a device every few days (if the HG 3a is used as part of the\nsystem), and essentially no costs\nfor labor or maintenance or repair parts. This results in\nthe cost for the water being primarily in amortizing the\ncost of the initial materials. As these devices should last\nfor at least ten years without requiring replacement,\nthis suggests that 250 gallons of water per day times 3650 days\nor around 900,000 gallons of water should be provided by the\n$300 initial costs. This indicates that the operating costs\nof this new system (involving an HG 3a) would be around $0.33 per thousand\ngallons of pure distilled water provided. That is not quite as economical\nas American Municipal water supplies, but decently close.\n\nThe larger-scale system Engineered for Haiti has this amortization\ncost analysis. Lifetime of the underground iron pipe should be\nat least 40 years or 14,600 days, where 3,000 gallons of pure water\nshould be provided on each of those days, or a total of 44 million gallons\nof pure water. If the installed cost is $10,000, then the amortization\nwould be ($10,000 / 44,000) around $0.22 per thousand gallons of\ndelivered pure water.\n\nNo other method of desalinating seawater is remotely close!\n\n(It IS true that this system requires a lot of energy, which\nis required to evaporate the water, which is around 1,000 Btu/pound\nof water. However, in this system, all that energy is supplied\nby either or both of the HG 3a system [which captures energy\nas rotting organic materials naturally decompose] and sunlight. Since\nthat standard-sized HG 3a unit can easily contain 400 pounds of\norganic matter at a time, that represents around 3.6 million Btus\nof heat that can be provided into the water heating chamber.\nThe decomposition of the 400 pounds of material itself causes\naround 240 pounds or 35 gallons (140 liters) of water (vapor) to be added\nto the air, in addition to the heat being able to evaporate\nabout another 3,500 pounds or 500 gallons (2,000 liters) of water. This is\nall accomplished with NO fossil fuels at all!)\n\nNOTE: The water that is produced by this system CAN appear slightly cloudy!\nThis can occur if the AIR going through the tube has dust particles in\nit. For any location where the air might contain a lot of dust\nor even sand particles, it is a good idea to add a filter over the\nintake to the underground air tube, and/or pour the resulting water through\na cloth or better filter. Extremely tiny particles such as cigarette\nsmoke are so tiny that they are harder to filter out, so an even better\nfilter, such as charcoal, might be desirable.\n\nA Pure Water Supply System for Haiti or other Island\n\nI Have Engineered a version of this system to provide a great deal of\nPURE water, realistically 60,000 gallons per day,\nfor Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in its hour of need. It is relatively simple\nand relatively inexpensive (Realistically $200,000 total\ninstalled cost), and could be installed in a few days.\n\nIt is quite large!\n\nThis example is specifically Engineered for Haiti, but I will present\neach step of the Engineering such that any other village or\ntown anywhere on Earth could determine the performance they would\nobtain.\n\nThe underground tube is the primary bought component of the system.\nIt is a 24\" diameter iron pipe, welded or otherwise\njoined to a straight, watertight and airtight length of 200 feet (60\nmeters). The underground pipe can NOT be corrugated tubing, as that\nwould catch the water and keep it from draining to the collection\ntank. A backhoe needs to dig a straight trench of at least that 200-foot\nlength, eight feet deep NEAR the ocean, deepening to 10 feet deep\nat the opposite end. This ensures that the entire pipe will\nforever be beneath the level of the ocean water. In Haiti, that deep\nocean water is always at around 78°F or 25°C. The trench gets\ndeeper so that the 24\" pipe slopes downward in that direction.\nThe trench is filled back in after the pipe is laid down in its bottom.\nOnly the two ends are elbowed upward to receive and to discard the\nair which will be sent through it. A pump can be installed at the\nlowest point of that pipe to pump the new pure water up into a\nconventional raised water tank, for standard existing distribution\nto the community.\n\nThe walls of the iron underground pipe will therefore always be at\n78°F. Moderate NATURAL wind at 10 mph causes 47 cubic feet of natural\nair (15 f/s * 3.14 sf) to pass through the 24\" diameter pipe\nevery second or 2800 cubic feet per minute. With air that is passing\nthrough the 200 foot long pipe at 10 mph (15 f/s), we see that the\nhumid air is inside the cool pipe for around 15 seconds, sufficient\nso that most of the air will have a chance to pass near the cool walls\nand have some of its water condense out on the pipe walls.\n\nThe next step is to use the automatic calculator above THREE TIMES.\n\nClimate data shows that Port-au-Prince has an AVERAGE relative humidity\nof 49.2%, ranging from a monthly low of 43% in July to a monthly\nhigh of 56% in October. For our first calculation, let us use a\nsummer daytime air temperature of 110°F and humidity of 49.2%.\nThis is for the MINIMAL PERFORMANCE calculation. This is for\ndetermining the capability of the system to just condense out\nnatural atmospheric humidity, before we consider adding in water\nfrom the oceans. When these numbers\nare put in the calculator (English units) we find that 0.223 gallon\nof water is in each 1000 cubic feet of air. We just determined that\n2800 cfm of air will go through the tube, which is 168,000 cubic feet\nper hour. Multiplying these two numbers we find that 37 gallons of\nNATURAL atmospheric humidity will ENTER the tube every hour.\n\nNow we need to calculate how much humidity will remain in that air\nafter it has passed through the underground tube. At the end of that\npipe, the air will be at the deep ground temperature, 78°F, and at\n100% humidity. This data shows that 0.181 gallon of water is still\nin every thousand cubic feet of air. This shows that 30 gallons of\nhumidity will still remain as the air leaves the tube, each hour.\n\nThis would result in a DIFFERENCE of 7 gallons per hour, which is the\namount of water that would condense out of NATURAL HUMIDITY per hour.\n\nFor a municipal water source, this is not enough! Therefore, the\nACCESSORY of the \"heat bag\" or \"covered evaporation\npond\" will be seen as being extremely\nimportant for this application. A portion of a seashore is selected\nsuch that a shallow pond of ocean water will be left by each high\ntide (every 13 hours). The pond is shallow enough so that the\nwater in it can heat up quickly. It is COVERED by a cover as simple as a\nclear polyethylene sheet. The water and air UNDER that cover\nwould heat up much like a closed car does on a hot summer day. At the\nmoment, we do not yet know how LARGE that evaporation pond needs to be,\nwhich will be calculated shortly. If we\nmake a good enough cover to achieve the 140°F temperature of the inside\nof a (black) car interior, and our pond is shallow enough so that\nthe water heats enough to evaporate, we can then provide a source\nof air for the underground tube which is at 140°F and at least 90%\nrelative humidity. THIS is the third usage of the automatic\ncalculator. We now see that 0.877 gallon of water is in every\nthousand cubic feet of this air which is going INTO the underground\ntube, which is 147 gallons of water per hour.\n\nTHIS now gives us the actual performance which can be expected.\nWe know that 147 gallons of water is in the air which goes INTO\nthe underground pipe, and we know that 30 gallons of water per hour remains\nin the air which comes out of that pipe. Therefore, each hour, 117\ngallons of water will have to condense out on the walls of the\nunderground pipe.\n\nWe can now use this information to determine the smallest size the pond\nneeds to be. We know that the NATURAL air going into the pipe contains\n37 gallons of water as humidity each hour. And we have just learned\nthat the coolness of the underground pipe allows 117 gallons of water\nto condense out and that there is also another 30 gallons of water\nthat remains in the air that leaves the tube. Therefore, 117 + 30 - 37\nis 110 gallons of water that our evaporation pond must ADD to the\nnatural humidity, each hour. A gallon of water requires around 8,000 Btus\nto evaporate it from liquid to gas, and so our pond must ADD around\n900,000 Btus of heat to the pond water each hour. Full sunlight commonly\ncontains around 300 Btus/square foot/hour, but the process\nof absorbing sunlight into seawater is not very efficient. We will\nassume a VERY conservative 10% efficiency. In other words, every square\nfoot of our pond and cover will be counted on (during sunlight) to provide\nabout 30 Btus/hour. Dividing (900,000 / 30) tells us we should provide\na pond of about 30,000 square feet. A square area about 170 feet on\na side would provide this. This is about 2/3 acre. Yes, a less conservative\nestimate about the absorption efficiency of sunlight could allow this to be\nsmaller. For example, if we used BLACK materials either UNDER the pond water\nor as the covering plastic, maybe we could then assume 80% absorption of the\nsunlight. In that case, each square foot would absorb 240 Btus/hr\nand we would only need to have around (900,000 / 240) 4,000 square\nfeet of area, comparable to the size of some large U.S. houses. In any\ncase, it is important to make sure that enough water gets evaporated\nto provide maximum performance of this system.\n\nThis is still a relatively moderate performance, as it does not use any\nsource of heat energy than the few hours of the sun to evaporate any of the\nseawater. If six good hours of sunlight can be expected, that suggests\nthat this single pipe system should provide 6 * 117 or around 700 gallons\nof absolutely pure (distilled) water each sunny afternoon.\n\nIt is certainly possible to use an HG 3a or other heat source to\nevaporate seawater under the poly cover during the night, so that\nthe 117 gallons of pure water could then be obtained every hour,\nwhich is nearly 3,000 gallons of perfectly pure water every day,\nnearly all of which would come from seawater that was desalinated\nby this process.\n\nAs this process proceeds, the water in the shallow pond\nevaporates. If the depth of the pond left by each high tide is\nplanned well, nearly all the water will evaporate during each tidal\ncycle, which leaves salt deposits there. It is possible that\nsomeone might want to collect that sea salt to sell it, but if that\nis not desired, the next high tide would flood the shallow pond and\nwash away most of the salt. This system is greatly self-maintaining\nand self-cleaning.\n\nThe cost of buying 200 feet of 24\" diameter iron pipe (roughly 6\ntons of pipe) and digging the trench to install it should be roughly\n$5,000 for the pipe and $5,000 for digging the trench, for a total\nof around $10,000. Such a trench could be dug in a few hours and\nthen filled back in in another few hours, so the entire system\ncould be installed in a single long day! And then, every day after\nthat should have 700 to 3,000 gallons of absolutely pure water available\nfor the community.\n\nConsidering the paucity of water that Haiti has received since their\nearthquake, this seems like it would be welcomed, but this system is\nso simple and inexpensive that $200,000 could be spent to install\ntwenty such systems, so that 14,000 gallons to 60,000 gallons of\nperfectly pure water would be available every day.\n\nMany other places on earth which do not have sufficient safe\ndrinking water, are relatively near ocean water, and the same\nanalysis as presented above for Haiti can be done to learn\nwhat performance would be available there.\n\nFor ANY installation, there are several ways of increasing the\nperformance, such as by using an electric blower to force air through\nthe pipe faster. That certainly works, but I feel that the cost\nof the electricity and the new requirements for maintenance might\nsuggest that it might just be simpler, easier and cheaper to just\ndig another trench and install another pipe. However, it IS true\nthat in relying on NATURAL WIND, there are times when the wind stops,\nand then briefly, if this system does not have a blower, it might not\nsupply any additional water for a short time. However, traditional\nmethods of using raised water tanks to store water for a few days\ncould eliminate this problem.\n\nUsage in A Desert Climate like Egypt\n\nIt might be considered informative to show numbers that would\napply for Egypt, a desert climate. The air coming OUT of the large\nversion described above for Haiti, contains 0.149 g/tcf or 25 gallons\nper hour. If the poly cover over a shallow ocean pond creates\nair at 140°F and even 50% relative humidity, the air going down into\nthe underground pipe would contain 0.487 g/tcf or 82 gallons per hour.\nSuch a system would then provide (82 - 25) 57 gallons of pure water per\nhour, even in a desert country! (Note that the system without the\nshallow pond would NOT work very well in Egypt, as their average\n35% humidity would mean that atmospheric humidity alone would\nonly contain around 25 gallons of water going INTO the underground\npipe in the hour's airflow, which is comparable to the amount of\nwater remaining in the air which leaves that pipe. That means\nthat without the evaporating pond, a desert climate like Egypt's\nwould not likely condense out much at all of atmospheric humidity.)\nThe covered evaporating pond is a critical part of the desalinization\nsystem!\n\nIn words, this says that glucose combined with oxygen from the\nair can decompose into water (vapor) and carbon dioxide and a lot\nof energy, primarily due to the activities of certain types of\nbacteria which are in soil.\n\nMore complex organic molecules such as cellulose are first broken\ndown into glucose to permit this process, gaining some extra\nenergy in the process.\n\nThe numbers in parentheses are the number of those molecules\nwhich are involved in the reaction. They are important.\n\nIn Chemistry, we know that those numbers can be used to describe\nthe number of moles of each compound, so in this case, we have\none mole of glucose combines with six moles of oxygen from the\nair to decompose into six moles of water (vapor) and six moles\nof carbon dioxide. This tells us the quantities of each which\nare involved. We need to know the molecular weights of each of\nthe compounds, which are 180, 32 and 18 and 44, respectively.\nIt is then really easy to calculate the WEIGHT of each material\ninvolved. 1 * 180 + 6 * 32 gives 6 * 18 + 6 * 44. This is true\nfor any unit of weight/mass: grams, kilograms, ounces, pounds, etc.\n\nWe confirm that there is the same amount of mass on both sides,\n372 units, which confirms Conservation of Mass. If we use grams,\nthen we now know that 180 grams of glucose will combine with\n192 grams of oxygen from the air to create 108 grams of water\nand 264 grams of carbon dioxide. This natural decomposition\noccurs worldwide every day, every second.\n\nThe important point here is that for every 180 units of weight\nof glucose that decomposes, there are 108 units of water created.\nSo 180 pounds of glucose will give 108 pounds of water, about\n15 gallons (60 liters).\n\nThe HG 3a device always has rather high humidity inside it,\nso when additional water is created like this, it gets carried\nout and away through the exhaust connection, along with the\ncarbon dioxide (gas) that was also created. In this case, once that\nhot and humid air gets outside, it cools and most of the moisture\nin that air condenses into water droplets, which we choose to do inside\nthe cooled underground tube. So, without actually using the\nlarge amount of heat that the HG 3a unit produces, if just the\nexhaust gases are sent into the underground tube,\n15 gallons (60 liters) of water will be produced for each 180 pounds of\norganic material that is allowed to decompose. This is in\naddition to the moisture in the natural air itself, of the\nunderground tube alone.\n\nWhere the underground tube alone can only function during the day,\ndue to the energy of sunlight, when the HG 3a is added, the system\ncan then produce water 24 hours a day. Since the HG 3a can reasonably\nbe expected to decompose about 10 pounds per hour, or 240 pounds\nper day, this source therefore can provide an additional 20 gallons\n(80 liters) of absolutely pure distilled water every day. This is true even\nin an extreme desert climate where the atmospheric humidity is\nvery near zero.\n\nWater Evaporation Bag Functioning\n\nTarps could be used to enclose any source of water, of any level of\ncontamination by any chemicals. If this is done without using\nan HG 3a unit, then it will be dependent on sunlight to heat up and\nevaporate the water, which thereby becomes humidity in air that is\nsent into the underground tube to condense as pure water. A moderate\namount of extra water can be provided in this way, but the exact\namount is difficult to calculate since there are many variables that\ncan affect performance, especially regarding the sunlight.\n\nBut if this sort of evaporation chamber is combined with a HG 3a\ndevice, then the 90,000 Btus of heat that the HG 3a system\ncan generate can all be made to come out with the exhaust\ngases, and therefore into the evaporation chamber. The heat of\nvaporization of water is around 970 Btu per pound, with another\n70 Btu/pound or so used in heating the water up. This means that the\n90,000 Btu/hr heat output that the HG 3a unit can continuously\ncreate can evaporate roughly 90 pounds of water per hour.\nHowever, a simple poly tarp cover can allow considerable heat\nloss at night, so the water evaporation then will be less.\nDuring the daytime, the amount of heat lost outward through\nthe tarp may be greater or less than the amount of sunlight heating\nwhich comes in through the poly tarp, so the evaporation rate\nmay be less than or greater than the 90 pounds of water per hour.\nThis is roughly 13 gallons (50 liters) per hour or around 320 (1,300 liters)\ngallons of water evaporated from the chamber per day. Due to the night heat\nlosses and other reasons, a more practical expected amount\nis around 250 gallons (1,000 liters) of water per day. Included in this is\nthe 20 gallons (80 liters) of water the HG 3a system naturally creates in a\nfull day of operation, so a total of around 250 gallons (1,000 liters) of\nperfectly pure distilled water is realistic every day. This quantity\nis relatively independent of local humidity, since most of the\nheat used is produced by the HG 3a device, although in extremely\ncold climates, the water production will be less.\n\nSolar Still Operation\n\nThe operation of a solar still has many limitations. The tilted\nglass cover is usually faced to the south, so early in the morning\nor late in the afternoon, the sunlight cannot easily get in to heat\nthe water because of the angle of the sunlight. The water is not of a\ncolor that is particularly absorbent (technically, high emissivity)\nto solar energy. A critical part of a solar still is that the\nhigh humidity air that is produced by the evaporation of some of the\nwater needs to encounter a COOL or COLD surface, such that the\neffects described in this presentation can occur, where the (local)\nrelative humidity gets up to 100% and therefore water must condense\ninto droplets. Since the glass cover is the surface in a solar still\nwhich must also represent that cooler surface, it would be great\nif it were as cool as possible. However, as the sunlight passes\nthrough the glass on the way in, a little of the heat is absorbed.\nAlso, the location of the glass exposes it to the outdoor air,\nso the glass can never be cooler than the ambient air temperature.\nAnd finally, the glass cover is constantly exposed to the warm or\nhot air inside the chamber, so it generally becomes quite a bit\nHOTTER than the current ambient air temperature. Per the\nPsychrometric Chart, these effects all greatly reduce the amount of\nwater that can be produced in a solar still. A little water is better\nthan no water, true, but our approach of having the cool surface\nfairly deep UNDERGROUND, that factor alone keeps the condensation\nsurfaces 20°F or 30°F (10°C or 15°C) or COOLER than the\nglass cover of a solar still. The Chart shows the wonderful\nadvantages of this factor.\n\nReverse Osmosis Pumps\n\nIf the water is merely brackish, salty, the pumps can be in the\n250-400 PSI pressure range, still rather high and energy consuming.\nWhen the water is seawater, much more salty, the pumps must be\nmuch stronger to force the water molecules through the very tiny\nfilters, 800-1180 PSI.\n\nIn addition, such equipment can work reasonably reliably with\na supply of brackish water, where maintenance can be manageable, but\nfor seawater, RO equipment tends to have those filters clog up almost\nimmediately and constantly. Therefore, there are a number of\ninstallations where brackish water is desalinated reasonably successfully,\nbut virtually no successful attempts at desalinating seawater has\nyet been installed based on RO or the other high-tech micro-filter\ntechnologies, like ED. In general, they now know to not even\nTRY to desalinate seawater!"

      "text": "Solar water disinfection method promises clean water for everyone\n\nWashington, May 20 (ANI): A scientist has developed a simple and cheap way to make water safe to drink, even if it is muddy.\n\nNearly 80 percent of disease in developing countries is linked to bad water and sanitation.\n\nIt's easy enough to purify clear water. The solar water disinfection method, or SODIS, calls for leaving a transparent plastic bottle of clear water out in the sun for six hours.\n\nThat allows heat and ultraviolet radiation to wipe out most pathogens that cause diarrhea, a malady that kills 4,000 children a day in Africa.\n\nIt's a different story if the water is murky, as it often is where people must fetch water from rivers, streams and boreholes.\n\n\"In the developing world, many people don't have access to clear water, and it's very hard to get rid of the suspended clay particles,\" Joshua Pearce from Michigan Technological University, said.\n\n\"But if you don't, SODIS doesn't work. The microorganisms hide under the clay and avoid the UV,\" he said.\n\nThus, to purify water, you first have to get the clay to settle out, a process called flocculation.\n\nWorking with student Brittney Dawney of Queen's University in Ontario, Pearce discovered that one of the most abundant minerals on Earth does this job very well: sodium chloride, or simple table salt.\n\nSalt is inexpensive and available almost everywhere. And it doesn't take very much to make muddy water clear again.\n\n\"The water has a lower sodium concentration than Gatorade.\n\n\"I've drunk this water myself. If I were somewhere with no clean water and had kids with diarrhea, and this could save their lives, I'd use this, no question,\" Pearce said.\n\nSalt works best when the suspended particles are a type of clay called bentonite. The technique doesn't work as well with other kinds of clay. However, by adding a little bentonite with the salt to water containing these different clays, most of the particles glom together and settle out, creating water clear enough for SODIS treatment.\n\nThe paper has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene for Development.

      "text": "Annual Drinking Water Quality Report released Online\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Recent\n\nPortland has removed all known lead service connections from its distribution system. Exposure to lead through drinking water is possible if materials in a building's plumbing contain lead. The level of lead in water can increase when water stands in contact with lead-based solder and brass faucets containing lead.\n\nIf present, lead at elevated levels can cause serious health problems, especially for pregnant women and young children. Lead in drinking water is primarily from materials and components associated with service lines and home plumbing.\n\nThe Portland Water Bureau is responsible for providing high-quality drinking water, but cannot control the variety of materials used in plumbing components. When your water has been sitting for several hours, you can minimize the potential for lead exposure by flushing your tap for 30 seconds to two minutes before using water for drinking or cooking.\n\nIf you are concerned about lead in your drinking water, you can request a free lead-in-water test from the LeadLine. Information on lead in drinking water, testing methods and steps you can take to minimize exposure is available from the LeadLine, 503-988-4000,  or the Safe Drinking Water Hotline 800-426-4791, \n\nPeople are exposed to lead in many other ways. In the Portland area, dust from paint in homes built before 1978 is the most common source of exposure to lead. Other sources include soil, pottery, traditional folk medicines and cosmetics, some sports equipment such as fishing weights and ammunition, and some occupations and hobbies.\n\nPortland Water Bureau encourages customers to take necessary steps to avoid possible exposure to lead in drinking water:\n\nRun your water to flush out lead. If the water has not been used for several hours, run each tap for 30 seconds to 2 minutes or until it becomes colder before drinking or cooking. This flushes water which may contain lead from the pipes.\n\nUse cold, fresh water for cooking and preparing baby formula. Do not cook with or drink water from the hot water tap; lead dissolves more easily into hot water. Do not use water from the hot water tap to make baby formula.\n\nDo not boil water to remove lead. Boiling water will not reduce lead.\n\nConsider using a filter. Check whether it reduces lead – not all filters do. Be sure to maintain and replace a filter device in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions to protect water quality. Contact NSF International at 800-NSF-8010 or  for information on performance standards for water filters.\n\nTest your water for lead. Call the LeadLine at 503-988-4000 to find out how to get a FREE lead-in-water test.\n\nTest your child for lead. Ask your physician or call the LeadLine to find out how to have your child tested for lead. A blood lead level test is the only way to know whether your child is being exposed to lead.\n\nRegularly clean your faucet aerator. Particles containing lead from solder or household plumbing can become trapped in your faucet aerator. Regular cleaning every few months will remove these particles and reduce your exposure to lead.\n\nConsider buying low-lead fixtures. New brass faucets, fittings and valves, may contribute to lead in your drinking water. Federal law currently allows brass fixtures, such as faucets, to contain up to eight percent lead.

Las Vegas Valley Water District was also honored with the same award for participating in research that has benefitted the broader drinking water industry.\n\nAccording to the press release, WaterRF noted throughout a 25-year relationship, the Portland Water Bureau has proven to be a supportive and innovative Subscriber.\n\n\"Its staff [Portland Water Bureau] has been actively sharing their knowledge and expertise, most notably on climate change and infrastructure. WaterRF has benefited tremendously from its spirit of collaboration, with numerous members of its staff participating in research and administrative capacities on a volunteer basis for the Foundation,\" the press release stated.\n\nIn announcing the award and 2013 winners, WaterRF's Executive Director Rob Renner noted that this year's winners represent the \"Gold Standard\" when it comes to researchers and subscribing utilities.\n\n\"Quite simply,\" Renner said, \"we could not achieve our mission without their tireless support. The international water community and the public they serve, benefit from their contributions to advancing the science of water.\"\n\nWaterRF is the world's largest research organization dedicated to drinking water research. The research conducted provides practical solutions to challenges facing the drinking water community today and into the future and aids water utilities, public health agencies and other professional organizations in providing safe, reliable and affordable drinking water to the public.​\n\nOver the summer months, a contractor for the Portland Water Bureau will be conducting geotechnical survey work in Washington Park. This work is part of the project to make improvements and changes to the two water reservoirs, including installing a 15-million gallon buried reservoir with a reflecting pool on top, generally in the footprint of the existing upper Reservoir #3.\n\nThe geotechnical work will involve a crew using equipment to bore 12-inch diameter holes in the ground to install landslide monitoring devices that measure ground movement and groundwater depths. The survey work will also obtain sub-surface information necessary for the design of the new facilities.\n\nEach boring hole monitoring and sampling will take up to 3 days to complete and then be backfilled. Park users are encouraged to avoid these work areas.\n\nThe work is scheduled as follow:\n\nMonday, June 17:Road Closure - SW Sherwood Blvd, from SW Kingston Ave. to SW Sacajawea Blvd. The street will be restricted to local access only, from 7:00 AM to 12 Noon. The closure is necessary to bring in a crane to lower equipment into the reservoir.\n\nMonday, June 17 through Friday, June 21: With Reservoir #3 drained in advance, a crew will perform borings inside the open reservoir.\n\nOne day during the week of June 24: Road Closure - SW Sherwood Blvd, from SW Kingston Ave. to SW Sacajawea Blvd. The street will be restricted to local access only, for about 3 hours.\n\nJuly to August 2013: Crews will perform geotechnical boring throughout Washington Park, including the parking lots near the Japanese Gardens and tennis courts, a park service road, and sites around the perimeters of the two open reservoirs.\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact Tim Hall, Public Information, at 503-823-6926.

      "text": "About Fracking\n\nWhat is Fracking?\n\nHigh-volume high pressure slick water fracturing with horizontal drilling or \"fracking\" is the process of extracting natural gas or methane from shale and sandstone deposits found in rock formations laid down millions of years ago. Slick water or slurry refers to the chemical formula composed of water, sand and toxic chemicals injected at high pressure down the bore hole and through the horizontal cement casings to crack open the fractures in the shale and keep the fractures open to extract the natural gas.\n\nIn fracking, miles of pipes set in concrete casings are placed under the earth, first vertically down the bore hole, than in a horizontal direction extending for miles from the original well head. Thousands of explosives are set along the horizontal cement casings to create fractures in the rock formations. Cracks in the rock create veins that carry trapped gas along the horizontal pipes back up to the well. Fracking was first used in the 1940′s. It is only in the last five years that the new experimental combination is being used of high-volume drilling under high pressure with known carcinogens and toxic chemicals.\n\nDangers of Methane Leakage & Chemicals Contaminating Aquifers\n\nThe industry reports that 6.2 percent of wells leak upon installation by faulty cement casings that crack under the pressure of fracking. Leaks allow toxic chemicals in the slurry solution and radioactive elements released from the earth during drilling to flow upward where it can contaminate aquifers and ground water above. The Colorado Oil & Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) reports cases of thermogenic methane, the methane that resides at thousands of feet beneath the ground, having migrated to water wells at the earth's surface.\n\nMillions of Gallons of Fresh Water Poisoned Per Fracked Well\n\nThe slurry solution uses between five and nine million gallons of fresh water per well that becomes so poisoned that it can no longer be considered water after it has been used for fracking. This \"produced water\" is too toxic for agriculture or any other purpose and is permanently lost to the hydrologic cycle. The industry does not clean the water after they have contaminated our public water and operators do not have a safe solution for safely disposing of \"flow-back water\" after the fracking process. In the documentary Gasland, people living near fracked wells could not drink the water from their own wells. The oil & gas industry supplies bottled water to homeowners as a damage compensation for contaminating their water supply.\n\nHealth Risks from Toxic Chemicals\n\nIncreasing reports of accidents and spills are coming to the surface, including methane escaping at compressor stations and leaks various points along the production and delivery system. A 2012 study by NOAA found a 6 percent rate of methane leak into the atmosphere from oil and gas drilling. Accidents, spills and radioactive contamination exposes both workers and citizens to toxins and carcinogenic compounds for which the human body has zero tolerance. Numerous studies are now being published showing the enormous environmental damage and health risks of fracking, including this public health study. Endocrine researcher Dr. Theo Colborn has identified more than 600 toxic chemicals used in fracking solutions which damage the immune, respiratory, reproductive and neurological systems, and 25 percent of the chemicals she tested in a year-long air quality study were known carcinogens."

      "text": "Obviously, dental hygiene is a priority to conscientious parents. Yet, in spite of the advancements in dental care, more than one fourth of two to five year-olds and half of kids 12 to 15 have one or more cavities. To counteract this, many suggest that adding fluoride to public water will help. Others say it will do more harm than good.\n\nFluoride is the 13th most common element in the Earth's crust and exists naturally in water. Some water has sufficient natural fluoride. But what if it is not naturally present? Should fluoride be added to water systems? The debate about fluoride won't be settled here. Rather, the purpose of this article is to consider a few of these points, and to give you some options. You need to know whether you need a fluoride filter for your drinking water.\n\nOne side says, \"Today, water fluoridation is estimated to reduce tooth decay by 20-40%.\" \"It is well known that fluoride helps prevent and even reverse the early stages of tooth decay.\" These statements have the authority of a trained doctor. This one also: \"For over 60 years, water fluoridation has proved to be a safe and cost-effective way to reduce dental caries.\"\n\nThe pro side claims that fluoride combats tooth decay in two ways. First, it becomes part of the structure of developing teeth. Second, it also works when it comes in contact with the surface of the teeth. Fluoride prevents the acid produced by the bacteria in plaque from dissolving, or demineralizing, tooth enamel, the hard and shiny substance that protects the teeth. Fluoride also allows teeth damaged by acid to repair, or remineralize, themselves. Fluoride cannot repair cavities, but it can reverse low levels of tooth decay and thus prevent new cavities from forming.\n\nOn the other hand we have quotes like this: \". . . there is no difference in the tooth decay rates of the fluoridated and nonfluoridated areas surveyed.\" Indeed, some studies, they say, show that the more fluoride children ingest, the higher their risk of dental decay.\n\nFluorosis, a discoloration or mottling of the permanent teeth results when children 8 years of age or younger take in too much fluoride. During these years teeth are forming. To add fluoride to water along with what children get in toothpaste and dental treatments might well exceed this limit.\n\nAt times the studies have not considered the long range effects of fluoride. The con side says it has been directly linked to cancer, changes in bone structure and strength, has caused birth defects and perinatal deaths, has impaired the immune system, caused initial stages of skeletal fluorosis, caused osteoarthritis, inhibits key enzymes, suppresses thyroid function and several other adverse problems.\n\nHow do opponents answer to evidence mentioned above that fluoride is good for dental hygiene? They say the studies are flawed in several ways. First, the studies did not consider the fact that other minerals were in the water and they might have been the real factor in decreased instances of tooth decay. Second, they failed to differentiate between \"natural fluoride\" (like CaF) and added fluoride (like NaF). Third, the studies lacked statistical proof. Fourth, only dental fluorosis was included as safety experiments.\n\nIf your conclusion from these points is that fluoride should not be in your drinking water, what can you if it is? Some opt for bottled water but this gets expensive. A better alternative is to purchase a water filter that removes fluoride. Some expensive units do this. Other less expensive units have optional fluoride filters. The Berkey Water Filter, for example, has available an additional filter that can we attached below the regular charcoal filters and will remove fluoride from the water. If you don't want fluoride, you don't have to drink it.\n\nYou probably know that eating more vegetable helps you lose weight. What you may not know is how to get more vegetables into your diet. Here are some tips to sneaking in your veggie servings without a lot of effort.\n\n· Add a can or two of mixed vegetables to casseroles and soups. Usually you won't have to adjust the recipe to accommodate the extra veggies, and you boost the nutrition of the dish.\n\n· Buy precut vegetables. Most of us are too lazy to cut up veggies. If we don't want to cut them up, we probably won't eat them. So, avoid the extra work and buy them precut.\n\n· Keep a fresh vegetable tray, complete with low fat ranch dipping sauce, handy for snacks. Most stores carry veg trays that are personal sized as well as party sized.\n\n· When picking up sandwiches at a deli, make sure to ask for extra lettuce, tomatoes, and any other vegetable you can think of. Fast food places such as Subway offer a wide range of good-for-you choices.\n\n· When ordering pasta at your favorite restaurant, opt for tomato based red sauce instead of white. The chunkier the sauce the more real vegetables it has in it.\n\n· Make sure to eat salad as a side dish at least a couple of nights a week. Prewashed salad fixings from the grocery store can make making a salad a snap.\n\n· Drink a vegetable juice, like V8, with breakfast or for a snack.\n\n· Eat baked vegetable chips, such as Flat Earth. They give you half a serving of vegetables in each serving.\n\n· Eat a baked potatoes instead of bread with dinner. Make sure to eat the skin, though. That's where most of the nutrition lies.\n\nOf course, you don't have to implement all of these tips at once. Pick one tip a week and built up your vegetable tolerance little by little. Before you know it, your waist will be getting smaller and you won't be able to pass a vegetable by.\n\nThe author, Aaron Patterson, went from couch potato to kickboxer in less than a year! His favorite passion is helping people get off their butts and start leading healthier, more active lives through his Website, \n\nA lot of individuals eat on the run in today's fast-paced society. You're usually better off eating at home rather than dining in a restaurant. However, you can still make healthy choices when you're eating fast food. Keep these guidelines in mind as you choose your next fast food meal.\n\nA lot of fast food franchises are well aware of the poor reputation that fast food has for clogging up the arteries. To meet the challenge, they have introduced many food choices that are better for you. For instance, many fast food chains now have salads on the menu. All the same, look out for the saturated fat in the dressing. And if your salad comes complete with deep fried chicken on top, you can be sure it's not as heart healthy as the one featuring grilled chicken.\n\nFor your sandwich, opt for grilled chicken over fried. And you can't go wrong by requesting extra vegetables on your sandwich. Ketchup and mustard are better choices for a dressing because of their lower saturated fat content.\n\nChoose fruit or salad as a side dish rather than fries. This will fill your lunch with vitamins and fiber rather than saturated fat. Instead of soda, pick juice or milk to drink with your meal. This can aid in maintaining normal blood sugar and give you additional vitamins and minerals.\n\nWhen you're truly craving a hamburger and fries, it's ok to give in once in a while. However, watch out for the size of the serving. A number of fast food establishments give you portion sizes that are enough for a couple of meals. Choosing a kid's meal or a small burger with french fries will help to hold down the amount of saturated fat you consume.\n\nIf you're giving your kids fast food, don't forget that there are often healthy choices like apple slices and mandarin oranges available. You can also choose milk or juice rather than soda.\n\nIn a Mexican fast food place, you can eat surprisingly healthfully by choosing a simple taco or burrito. By loading it up with lots of veggies, you'll be able to raise the fiber content. Although a taco salad might seem healthy, it's often laden with saturated fat and calories.\n\nChoosing fast food for the majority of your meals can take its toll on your heart health when you don't make good choices. Your best option is to eat at home. However, if that's not feasible, why not try the \"better for you\" choices that are out there.\n\nAntioxidant is a broad term used to describe a group of minerals, vitamins, carotenoids and polyphenols. They protect the body from cell-damaging free radicals. Vitamins A, E, C and the mineral selenium are well known antioxidants. Lutein, lycopene and beta-carotene are carotenoids that have high antioxidant nutrition and give many vegetables and fruits their color. Beta-carotene is found in carrots and pumpkins and is what gives them their vibrant orange color. You can find lutein in leafy green vegetables. It is important in eyesight. Red fruits and vegetables, like tomatoes, contain lycopene. Eating a colorful diet gives you the variety and nutritional value you need.\n\nSo why are they called antioxidants? The name represents the mechanism by which they help prevent disease. In humans, a small but significant percentage of oxygen molecules in the body will become electrically charged due to natural cellular activity and/or exposure to environmental factors like tobacco smoke and radiation. The oxygen molecule becomes a \"free radical\" as it undergoes this process of oxidation. Free radicals are highly reactive as they try to steal electrons from other molecules, including DNA and cellular membranes. This chain reaction of free radicals can damage cells, which may play a role in the development of certain conditions like heart disease and cancer. Antioxidants, however, stop the chain-reaction by giving up electrons and neutralizing free radicals so that they cannot induce any more oxidative damage.\n\nMany studies have shown the link between free radicals and several degenerative diseases associated with aging. Thus, it is possible that antioxidant nutrition can be beneficial in reducing the incidence of cancer, cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, immune dysfunction, cataracts, stroke, and macular degeneration.\n\nThere is an abundance of Vitamin A in liver, dairy and fish. Vitamin C is found in bell peppers and citrus fruits while Vitamin E is plentiful in oils, fortified cereals, seeds and nuts. The mineral selenium can be found in Brazil nuts, meats, tuna and plant foods. You will find lutein in green vegetables like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, peas and kale. Tomatoes, watermelon, pink grapefruit and papaya are all good sources of lycopene. Beta-carotene is abundant in sweet potatoes, carrots and squash. If you are not getting enough in your diet, the next step you may want to consider is nutritional supplements.\n\nYou can find more information on antioxidant nutrition by doing a web search or doing some research at your local library. Finding the right combination of nutritional supplements for you may be as simple as arming yourself with the right data. The best source of information may come from a nutritionist. They can evaluate your diet and make suggestions regarding supplementation.\n\nYou've heard of antioxidants and how they neutralize harmful chemicals called free radicals in the body. You may not be aware of an antioxidant that occurs naturally inside every cell of the body and is found in some green vegetables, organ meats, rice bran and Brewer's yeast. Alpha lipoic acid (or ALA) is produced in small amounts by our bodies. Used in nutritional supplement form, it treats such ailments as diabetic neuropathy, coronary heart disease and other serious illnessesThough very few, a small number of side effects have been reported when using alpha lipoic acid as a nutritional supplement. They include muscle cramps, skin rash, tingling or a \"pins and needles\" sensation, or headache. Because ALA can improve blood sugar control, diabetics who take medication to lower their blood sugar should be monitored by their health care provider when taking ALA. People on thyroid medications should also be under the supervision of their healthcare provider if they take this supplement as it can alter thyroid hormone levels.\n\nLipoic acid or alpha lipoic acid (ALA) is a fatty acid found naturally inside every cell of the body. It is a powerful antioxidant; a substance that neutralizes potentially harmful chemicals called free radicals in the body. Our bodies produce it in very small amounts and it is also found in foods such as spinach, Brewer's yeast, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, peas, organ meats and rice bran. It converts glucose (or blood sugar) into energy. Let's take at look at this widely touted supplementUsed to treat a common complication of diabetes called peripheral neuropathy, Lipoic acid speeds the removal of glucose from the bloodstream. It enhances insulin function and reduces insulin resistance, which are the basis of most cases of obesity and coronary heart disease. ALA quickly and greatly reduces the severity and incidence of symptoms like burning and sharply cutting pain, numbness and prickling sensations felt in diabetic neuropathy as a nutritional supplement to treat a myriad of other illnesses and diseases like cataracts, hardening of the arteries, hepatitis, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, high cholesterol levels, and even human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n\nVery few side effects have been reported when taking lipoic acid. A small number of people reported a tingling or \"pins and needles\" sensation, muscle cramps, headache or skin rash. People with diabetes who are taking medication to lower their blood sugar should take ALA under the supervision of a qualified health professional and have their blood sugar levels monitored as ALA may improve blood sugar control. Some studies have shown that ALA used as a nutritional supplement may alter thyroid hormone levels, so those taking thyroid medications and ALA should be monitored by their healthcare provider.\n\nWhat neutralizes free radicals in both watery and fatty regions of cells? What produces energy by converting glucose for our body's normal function? Alpha lipoic acid or ALA. ALA is used to treat diabetic neuropathy, hepatitis and more. Our bodies produce this antioxidant nutrition in small amounts and it occurs naturally in organ meats, peas, rice bran, Brewer's yeast, Brussels sprouts and broccoli. Supplementation is a good way to get an added boost. What other ailments is it used to treat and how much should you take? Why don't we take a look?Alpha lipoic acid has very few side effects. Some that have been reported include headache, tingling or a \"pins and needles\" sensation, skin rash, or muscle cramps. Since ALA may improve blood sugar control, people with diabetes who are taking medication to lower blood sugar should only take ALA under the supervision of a qualified health professional and have their blood sugar levels carefully monitored. It may alter thyroid hormone levels, so people taking thyroid medications should be monitored by their healthcare provider.\n\nA lot of us eat without really thinking about the food that we are putting into our bodies. This is extremely unfortunate because diet is crucial to human health. A good diet depends on choosing what to eat and how much to eat, because otherwise food can actually harm someone. People's food choices in Japan have significantly changed in recent years, with the Japanese diet becoming more and more like the American and European diet, leading to an increase in various diseases that are associated with the Western diet increasing in Japan. This new Japanese diet is high in protein and fat and low in fiber, just the way the Western diet is.\n\nThese dietary changes have caused an increase in body fat, sticky blood, damaged blood vessel walls, and rise in dietary-related diseases like hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipemia, cancer, heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease. These diseases are abundant in Western countries, with the number one cause of death in the United States being heart disease. It has been found that the main cause of death in many advanced countries is related to diet.\n\nChlorella has the ability to prevent diseases that are caused by diet. Chlorella is a type of algae, the very origin of the food chain, and is a highly regarded health-food supplement for use in maintaining the human body. Introduced to the health-food marketplace about 40 years ago, chlorella was first established in Japan and today is produced by Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Indonesia.\n\nNot only is it used for health-food supplementation, but also in processed foods, food additives, medication additives, marine feeds, feed additives, and fertilizers. Chlorella is helpful in supplementing nutrients of high-quality, plant-based proteins, vitamins, minerals, chlorophyll, and antioxidants. It has been shown to help lower cholesterol, regulate the intestines, detoxify the body, lower blood pressure, and regulate the immune system, In short, chlorella helps the human body to maintain balance.\n\nIt is likely that Chlorella appeared on the Earth many thousands of years ago. It is a fresh-water, one-celled green algae that can be found widely in lakes and marshes throughout the world. This plant was discovered and named by M.W. Beyerinck of Holland in 1890. In size, chlorella is 2 to 10 microns, which is slightly smaller than a red blood cell. It is an ancestor of such vegetables as spinach and pumpkins. As compared to other plants, chlorella has a high concentration of chlorophyll, making its capability for photosynthesis many times higher than that of other plants. Because of its high-quality, plant-based protein, vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, and antioxidants, chlorella is able to maintain human health and prevent and treat disease.\n\nDiseases including hyperlipemia, hypertension, diabetes, arteriosclerosis, heart disease, stroke, and cancer are closely related to diet. Heredity, aging, and environmental factors including chemical substances and stress are also all liked to the above diseases. These diseases are on the rise in advanced countries, with a lot of them being the most prevalent causes of death in many countries. To prevent diet-related illnesses, the diet must be balanced and lowered immune function must be improved.\n\nThe body also needs to be protected from health-threatening chemical substances and stress. Scientists have found that Chlorella is effective for balancing the diet, improving lowered cell function and resistance, and detoxifying chemicals and alleviating stress. Many diet-related diseases can be prevented and treated by simply adding vitamin rich chlorella to ones diet.\n\nIt is undeniable that the industry of health nutrition products has grown significantly with a lot of career-driven individuals spending so much more time at work with no time to think about proper food and exercise. In the middle of the rush of the modern lifestyle, people have now realized the cost of having a busy life and have become more conscious with their health and fitness that once took a back seat.\n\nThe emergence of various health nutrition products supports the career-oriented men and women with their busy lifestyles by supplementing them with proper nutrition. Having little time to plan and eat a good nutritional meal is no longer an excuse to lack the vitamins and minerals needed to continue living healthily and actively. Additionally, health nutrition products have become easily available and relatively affordable, with more and more people finding these as convenient ways to keep ourselves fit and healthy.\n\nThe Increasing Number of Options In Health Nutrition Products\n\nFor individuals on the career fast track, it is certainly a welcome sight to see a such a wide variety of health nutrition products in the market. This means they are not restricted to buying something that they are not very fond of in the first place. Instead, they can now choose anything they want that tickles their taste buds and whatever suits their particular dietary needs. Unlike in the past when health nutrition products were limited to a few variants in specialty stores, the options have grown considerably with a specific product fit for a particular age, gender, deficiency or activity level.\n\nWhile ignorance of the harm that may be caused by the deficiency or excess in a certain vitamin or mineral posed a serious threat in the past, recent literature has already provided new knowledge on health nutrition products. These days, most people have the ability and tools they need to properly select the vitamins and minerals they need. They are now made aware of how proteins, amino acids and some vitamins may not do the body any good when taken incorrectly. Some vitamins need to be taken in moderation while amino acids and proteins must be complimented with exercise.\n\nWith the demand for health nutrition products going up, the supply has also adjusted. Along with specialty stores who had previously dominated the market, local drug stores have also been selling health nutrition products. Various forms and blends have also been introduced by different companies. Today, we have bars, powders, pills, suspensions and drinks. With the shift in supply and demand, prices have also gone down, thereby allowing common employees to afford health nutrition products.\n\nAlthough most branded health nutrition products still sell remarkably well despite the high price, many have accepted the value of buying the much cheaper generic products, which practically offer the same benefits.\n\nAre you wondering if you should buy a kitchen faucet filter? If you are concerned about protecting the health and safety of your family, buying one will give you the peace of mind you seek.\n\nIn case you're asking \"why\" you should buy one, let me tell you all about what's wrong with common tap water today.\n\nChlorine Tastes Bad\n\nChlorine is the main reason that most people decide to get a kitchen faucet filter. It tastes and smells like pool water. Many people are allergic to it and it's bad for your digestive system. It can even cause anemia in the very young.\n\nDry Is Not Good\n\nIf you have dry hair, dry itchy skin, sinus problems, allergies or asthma, you shouldn't be showering in chlorinated water. You'll be amazed at the difference showerhead filters make in just a couple of days. Your skin and hair will be softer. Your sinus problems and allergies will improve. You'll have fewer asthma attacks and just feel better in general.\n\nWhy Drink Chemicals?\n\nSome people decide to get a kitchen faucet with filter because they've read about the health risks associated with THM, a byproduct of chlorination. THM exposure increases the risk of bladder and colon cancer. It's toxic to the nervous system, as well.\n\nThe average kitchen faucet with filter will not remove THMs. You need a system that includes an adsorptive block to remove them.\n\nResearchers have shown that THM exposure also occurs in the shower. The chemical is absorbed through the skin and turns into vapor, along with the steam. So, you inhale it and it heads straight for the blood stream.\n\nChloroform gas is a THM and research has shown that there is some level of chloroform in the air of most homes, due primarily to showering in unfiltered water. You may recognize chloroform as an older anesthetic.\n\nIf you suffer from chronic fatigue, bouts of dizziness or nausea, it could be caused by chloroform gas in your home. So, that's another reason that you need a showerhead, as well as a kitchen faucet filter.\n\nIf you have chlorinated water, which most of us do, there is always a risk of lead contamination. Chlorine corrodes pipes and joints, causing lead to enter the water. The best kitchen faucet with filter includes an ion exchange step to remove traces of lead and other metals like copper.\n\nIt Tastes Better\n\nA kitchen faucet filter with ion exchange also improves the taste and healthfulness by balancing the mineral content and the pH levels. Copper is not particularly dangerous, but it does stain your fixtures, affect the color of your hair and the moisture levels in your skin; another reason to invest in showerhead filters.\n\nYou don't have to spend a fortune to get a kitchen faucet with filter. If you do a little shopping, you can find the best kitchen faucet filter and showerhead systems for less than $200 and believe me, they are well worth the cost.\n\nTyler Waterman is a health enthusiast and enjoys sharing his experience and research with others on the internet.

      "text": "I suppose I need to take a trip out to Southampton to confirm. In my house, we love Fiji water best, followed by Poland Springs. And we find the tap water in Newton is very close to the taste of Poland Springs. So what we'll do is splurge on a bottle of Poland Springs, then refill the bottle a few times with tap water before recycling the bottleThere are nearby towns that have some water issues. In Worthington center at the top of the hill the people's wells were all poisoned from years of dumping unused agricultural chemicals at the potato fields, and they had to bury pipe and run municipal water to all the houses in that area. That's just a couple towns over from Southampton and the next town after the big dam and reservoir in Huntington.\n\nI'm sure Southampton has good water but so do most of the towns here. The taste would vary with the temperature and the age/kind of pipes in your house, etc. I sincerely doubt anyone could tell the difference or apply objective grading standards. And, the \"nation's\" best water? Come on...how many towns in the nation, and could they really compare them all?Actually, I grew up in NYC, and NYC water has consistently won taste tests and has been known nationally for excellent quality. It's been cited as the reason why bagels, pizza, and other things taste better when made in NYC.\n\nIn contrast, MA water has always been less than quality and without flouride in most towns, all of which has led to a healthy bottled water business in the state. I lived in Leominster, and each year we received a warning from the EPD regarding the poor quality of the city drinking water. Maybe the MWRA water quality is better, but not from what I've readI feel the same way and also I remember during the '90s when Easthampton had good tasting water but it contained high levels of TCE. That was before they built the town water treatment plant. That was really scary.\n\nIf I remember correctly, private wells in Southampton had TCE problems too, water probably tasted just fine.\n\nNorthampton water tastes like chlorine and chlorine isn't very good for you either.\n\nThe best water I've ever had is out in Eastern MA--and it's usually clean"

In 2009 some 884 million people still did not have access to an improved water facility.\n\nExperience shows that access to \"improved\" water supply facilities is no guarantee for safe and reliable water. Especially in developing countries tap water can be unsafe, because of inadequate treatment, recontamination during transport or storage or at home. \"Point of use\" and small-scale treatment is a promising strategy to improve access to safe drinking water, in particular for the poor. Recent studies show that PoU reduces diarrhea morbidity for children under 5 by 29 % and is more effective than source water treatment, piped water on premises and improved public water supply. All the more reason to provide those who advise on systems for home water treatment in rural areas with current information on simple methods to improve drinking water for households.\n\nThis booklet, part of the Smart Water Solutions series, can help them decide which method is best for a specific situation and what effect can be expected with respect to reduction of harmful micro-organisms. It also gives some price indications and refers to specific websites for further information.\n\nThis publication is a co-production of NWP (Netherlands Water Partnership), Aqua for All and Witteveen+Bos."

      "text": "Questions and Answers about Monochloramine\n\nMonochloramine Basics\n\nWhat is monochloramine (chloramine)?\n\nMonochloramine is a chemical disinfectant used to treat drinking water. It is formed by mixing chlorine with ammonia. Although monochloramine is a weaker disinfectant than chlorine, it is more stable and extends disinfectant benefits throughout a water utility's distribution system (a system of tanks and pipes used to deliver water to homes). Monochloramine also creates fewer of the regulated harmful disinfection byproducts than chlorine.\n\nHow is monochloramine used?\n\nPublic drinking water utilities are required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to use a primary disinfectant (at the water treatment plant) to inactivate pathogenic organisms remaining after filtration. Drinking water treatment facilities generally choose between chlorine, chlorine dioxide, ozone, chloramines or combination systems (UV light) dependant on their size and initial water quality.\n\nSome water systems use monochloramine instead of chlorine for secondary or residual disinfection (disinfection of the water after it leaves the treatment plant and as it travels through the distribution system to the customer's tap). Monochloramine use is closely regulated by EPA.\n\nIs monochloraminated water safe to use and to drink?\n\nMonochloramine (and chlorine) is quickly broken down by the digestive system, and it is not stored up in the body. Water treated with monochloramine at levels below the EPA standard (4.0 mg/L) is considered safe for drinking and all other general household uses — such as bathing, cooking, laundry and cleaning. The water is considered safe for everyone, including babies, children, pregnant women, the elderly and the ill. TheLike chlorine, water containing high concentrations of monochloramine can be toxic, especially to sensitive individuals. Some people who use water containing monochloramine above the 4.0 mg/L may experience irritation to their eyes and nose. Some people who drink water containing monochloramine above the 4.0 mg/L could experience stomach discomfort or anemia. See Health Questions.\n\nWhat effect does monochloramine have on kidney dialysis?\n\nLike chlorine, monochloramine must be completely removed from water before it is used in kidney dialysis machines. If monochloramine or chlorine enters the bloodstream directly, without being broken down by the digestive system, it will harm the patient's health. Patients who require kidney dialysis can safely drink, cook with, bathe or shower in water treated with monochloramine.\n\nIs monochloramine new?\n\nNo. Monochloramine has been used to disinfect drinking water in the United State since the early 1900s.\n\nHow many people are using drinking water that has been treated with monochloramine?\n\nEPA estimates the number exceeds the 68 million people who were identified in a 1998 survey.\n\nHow widespread is the use of monochloramine?\n\nMany cities in the U.S. and Canada have used monochloramine as a drinking water disinfectant for decades. Monochloramine is currently used in San Francisco, Houston, Dallas, Denver, Tampa and Boston. Most major water utilities in California use monochloramine. In 1996, approximately 6.9 million Canadians were served by monochloraminated drinking water.\n\nMonochloramine is also used in Australia, England, and Finland. In New England, more than 3 million people in 135 communities are served by water treated by monochloramine.\n\nThe EPA estimates that nationally, approximately 60 percent of surface water utilities will use monochloramine for secondary disinfection to comply with more stringent regulatory requirements by 2012.\n\nHave any water utilities stopped the use of monochloramine?\n\nHundreds of utilities have switched to monochloramine for secondary disinfection, but the Vermont Department of Health is not aware of any municipalities that have switched back from monochloramine for secondary disinfection to a strictly chlorine-based system. Some utilities in warmer climates, as part of their normal operating procedure, will perform a temporary super-chlorination (or shock) of their water systems to wash out any residue or biofilm, before going back to monochlorimination for secondary disinfection.\n\nDrinking Water Disinfection\n\nWhy are public water supplies disinfected?\n\nWater drawn from surface water sources (lakes or ponds) must be disinfected to kill bacteria, viruses and other organisms that can cause serious illness and death. Primary disinfection at the treatment plant is required by law under the EPA Surface Water Treatment Rule. In Vermont all systems use chlorine primary disinfection. A secondary disinfectant (chlorine, monochloramine or chlorine dioxide) is also required to treat any type of contamination that could occur after the water leaves the treatment plant.\n\nDue to drinking water disinfection, there are no outbreaks of cholera, typhus, or other waterborne diseases that kill over 10 million people each year in places where drinking water supplies are not disinfected.\n\nWhat disinfectants are there?\n\nThere are a number of disinfectants that are effective at killing disease-causing microorganisms, including chlorine, chloramine, ozone, chlorine dioxide and ultraviolet (UV) light. A residual amount of disinfection has to be maintained throughout the distribution system to keep water safe as it moves to the consumer's tap. Ozone, chlorine dioxide and UV light, which are alternatives to chlorine, are very effective treatment facility disinfectants to ensure public health protection. However, ozone or UV light cannot provide a continuous residual in the distribution system. Chlorine dioxide, while it can maintain a residual, presents operational difficulties. Therefore, water utilities typically use either chlorine or monochloramine as residual (secondary) disinfectant for the distribution system.\n\nDoes EPA require systems to use monochloramine?\n\nThe EPA has no requirements that any system use monochloramine for water treatment. However, it has been used by water systems for about 90 years and its use is closely regulated. It is almost always used as a secondary disinfectant, and not as a primary disinfectant.\n\nWhat is EPA's standard for monochloramine in drinking water?\n\nThe EPA has a regulatory standard and a health goal for disinfectants. The enforceable standard is the highest level of a disinfectant that is allowed in drinking water. The health goal is the level of a drinking water disinfectant, below which there is no known or expected risk to health. The EPA sets the standard as close to the health goal as feasible.\n\nIn the case of monochloramine, the standard and the health goal are the same (4.0 milligrams per liter (mg/L) or 4.0 parts per million (ppm) measured as chlorine as an annual average). This is the standard set for a drinking water disinfectant with no known or expected risk to health. This is the maximum allowed. In practice, most systems use half this amount.\n\nWhat are the advantages of using monochloramine?\n\nMonochloramine is not as reactive as chlorine, so it forms fewer regulated disinfection byproducts. Some disinfection byproducts, such as the trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs), may have adverse health effects.\n\nMonochloramine is more stable and longer lasting than chlorine, so it provides better protection against bacterial re-growth in systems with large storage tanks and dead-end water mains.\n\nMonochloramine, like chlorine, is effective in controlling biofilm (a coating in the pipe caused by bacteria). Controlling biofilm also tends to reduce coliform bacteria concentrations and biofilm-induced corrosion of pipes.\n\nMonochloramine tends not to react with organic compounds, so many systems will experience fewer taste and odor complaints when using chloramine.\n\nDoes the use of monochloramine affect lead and copper corrosion?\n\nUse of chloramine can indirectly affect corrosion of lead and copper in two ways:\n\nWhen chloramine is used in water treatment as a residual disinfectant, it can change the chemical properties of the water, and can then, if not adjusted for, leach lead and copper from household plumbing. Certain conditions related to pH, alkalinity, and dissolved inorganic carbonate levels in the water can cause this situation.\n\nMonochloramination, if not properly optimized, can result in nitrification (conversion of ammonia into nitrite and then nitrate) in the presence of bacteria. Nitrification can lower the pH of the water, which can increase corrosion of lead and copper.\n\nMonochloramine Use in Vermont\n\nWhere is monochloramine used in Vermont?\n\nThe only public water system in Vermont that uses monochloramine at this time is the Champlain Water District (CWD). CWD switched from chlorine to monochloramine for secondary disinfection of its water supply in April 2006. CWD serves nearly 68,000 people in 12 Chittenden County municipalities.\n\nMunicipalities served by the Champlain Water District:\n\nColchester Town\n\nColchester Fire District No. 1\n\nColchester Fire District No. 3\n\nEssex\n\nEssex Junction\n\nJericho Village\n\nMallets Bay Water Company\n\nMilton\n\nShelburne\n\nSouth Burlington\n\nWilliston\n\nWinooski\n\nBurlington is not part of the CWD system and does not use monochloramine.\n\nWhy did the Champlain Water District switch to monochloramine?\n\nThe Champlain Water District switched to monochloramine to reduce regulated disinfection products and maintain a disinfectant residual within the distribution system. Monochloramine disinfection is one way to comply with new and stricter standards under the EPA's Safe Drinking Water Act. Use of monochloramine reduces the production of harmful disinfection byproducts such as trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs), which result from the combination of free chlorine with organic material found in surface water.\n\nHealth Questions\n\nIs monochloraminated water safe to use?\n\nWater treated with monochloramine that meets the EPA standard (4.0 mg/L) is considered safe for drinking and all other general household uses such as bathing, cooking, laundry and cleaning. The water is safe for everyone, including babies, children, pregnant women, the elderly and the ill. Monochloramine (and chlorine) is quickly broken down by the digestive system, and it is not stored up in the body.\n\nTheHigh Concentrations - Like chlorine, water containing high concentrations of monochloramine can be toxic, especially to sensitive individuals. Some people who use water containing monochloramine above 4.0 mg/L may experience irritation to their eyes and nose. Some people who drink water containing monochloramine above 4.0 mg/L could experience stomach discomfort or anemia. However, monochloramine is quickly broken down by the digestive system and it is not stored up in the body.\n\nKidney Dialysis - Like chlorine, monochloramine must be completely removed from water before it is used in kidney dialysis machines because if it enters the bloodstream it will harm the patient's health. Patients who require kidney dialysis can safely drink, cook with, bathe or shower in water treated with monochloramine.\n\nAre there symptoms of adverse health effects associated with monochloraminated water?\n\nThere are no symptoms that have been associated with monochloramine at levels used to treat water. The Vermont Department of Health has searched for and reviewed all available research, and consulted with CDC and EPA. To date, the Health Department has found no credible evidence to show that the use of monochloramine to disinfect public drinking water is a threat to public health, or has been associated with adverse health effects.\n\nHowever, it is possible that sensitive individuals have symptoms that have not been diagnosed or treated, and it is possible that these are related to monochloramine. If you have a medical or health problem, it is always important that you check with your health care provider for appropriate diagnosis and treatment.\n\nIf I am experiencing respiratory, skin or digestive problems. Could it be related to monochloramine?\n\nAll available studies do not link these conditions to monochloramine or chlorine at the level the public is exposed to in drinking water. EPA has set what it believes is a safe limit to exposure to monochloramine in the drinking water, and this limit is closely monitored by the water system. There are many different causes of irritation, and the source is difficult to identify and varies with each person. If you have a health or medical concern, consult your health care provider.\n\nIs monochloraminated water safe to drink?\n\nYes. Monochloraminated water is considered safe for everyday household uses, including drinking. Monochloramine (and chlorine) is quickly broken down and neutralized by the digestive system. It is not stored up in the body. Anyone can drink water that contains monochloramine at levels regulated by the EPA. This includes babies, children, pregnant women, the elderly, kidney dialysis patients and people with chronic illness.\n\nDoes monochloramine cause asthma?\n\nHas monochloraminated water been linked to any common health conditions — such as hair loss, weight loss, depression or oral lesions?\n\nNo. After nearly 90 years of use as a secondary disinfectant, there is no evidence in medical literature reviewed by the Department of Health that links monochloraminated drinking or bathing water to any of these conditions.\n\nCan you safely wash an open wound with monochloraminated water?\n\nYes. It is safe to use monochloraminated water in cleaning an open wound because virtually no water enters the bloodstream in this way.\n\nWhy is monochloraminated water a concern for kidney dialysis patients?\n\nMonochloramine must be removed from the water used in kidney dialysis machines. Dialysis systems already pre-treat their source water to remove chlorine. Some modifications are necessary to remove the monochloramine. Home dialysis service companies can usually make the needed modifications.\n\nMedical facilities in Vermont that perform kidney dialysis were notified by CWD of this change to monochloraminated water treatment before its switchover in 2004.\n\nWhy does the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that people with compromised immune systems boil their drinking water?\n\nNeither chlorine, nor monochloramine, can destroy certain protozoans like Cryptosporidium if filtration is unable to remove them. Some people who have compromised immune systems may wish to use bottled water or to boil their water to make sure they are not exposed to pathogens that may be present in the water despite the use of disinfectants.\n\nFish, Pets, Pools\n\nIs monochloraminated water harmful to fish? reptiles? turtles? amphibians?\n\nMonochloramine (and chlorine) is toxic to fish, reptiles that live in water, turtles and amphibians at levels used for drinking water. Unlike chlorine, monochloramine does not quickly evaporate on standing or by boiling. Therefore, fish owners must neutralize or remove monochloramine from water used in aquariums or ponds. Treatment products are readily available at stores where you buy aquarium supplies.\n\nCan pets, birds or wildlife safely drink or bathe in the water?\n\nThere is no reason to believe that monochloramine at levels used for drinking water is unsafe for other pets, birds or wildlife.\n\nCan you safely water grass, plants, vegetables or fruit?\n\nYes. The small amount of monochloramine in the water supply will have no effect on plants of any type. You can use the water for gardening, washing food and watering lawns.\n\nWill monochloramine affect your swimming pool or hot tub?\n\nNo. You will still need a free chlorine residual to retard algae and bacteria growth. Contact your local pool supply stores for specific information.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) has warned about health effects from high levels of trichloramine in swimming pools. Trichloramine is formed when the chlorine in a swimming pool reacts with nitrogen from sweat and urine. Trichloramine is not the same as monochloramine, it has a different chemical composition. The CDC warning does NOT apply to monochloramine at levels found in the water supply.\n\nHome Water Treatment Devices\n\nWill monochloramine dissipate or evaporate out of the water?\n\nAre there home devices that can be used to remove monochloramine?\n\nBoiling the water or letting it sit out in an open container at room temperature will not get rid of monochloramine.\nThere are \"Point of Entry\" and \"Point of Use\" (POE/POU) devices that can be used to remove monochloramine from household water.\n\nNSF International (National Sanitation Foundation) is a not-for-profit / non-governmental organization that provides independent third-party verification testing of home water treatment devices for the removal of monochloramine. Neither the State of Vermont nor the EPA tests or approves home treatment devices.\n\nDrinking water treatment devices are certified to improve water for aesthetic (taste or odor) reasons, and certified devices must demonstrate at least an 83% monochloramine reduction (at 3 ppm) over the entire service cycle of the filter media. All of the devices certified for monochloramine reduction treat the water using adsorption methods (i.e. granular activated carbon).\n\nThe majority of the certified products are point-of-use devices. Point-of-use devices are primarily used for treating drinking water and may be plumbed in to an existing tap, plumbed into a new tap, or placed on a counter top and connected to an existing faucet. These devices are typically intended for cold water use only. There are over 100 certified point-of-use devices for monochloramine, and prices range from less than $100 to $700+. Generally, the flow rates of the devices are too small for whole-house treatment or shower use.\n\nNSF International's web site lists two point-of-entry products certified for monochloramine removal. Point-of-entry devices may treat all incoming water to a house and are typically intended for cold water use only. The two products listed on NSF International's web site are in the price range of $1,300, and are rated for 5 gallons-per-minute flow. This flow rate should be adequate for typical household water use.\n\nProper installation and maintenance is\nessential. The homeowner is responsible for servicing water treatment devices in their home at regular intervals as specified by the manufacturer. For the monochloramine-certified devices, this typically involves replacing the absorption media (the filter) at the end of the service cycle. Improper maintenance will reduce the removal effectiveness of the device and may create a health risk by allowing bacteria to grow in the filter. The cost of regular service and replacement filter media should be considered when deciding on a home treatment device.\n\nThe length of the service cycle varies by product. For the point-of-use devices, the range varies widely, from 300 to 60,000 gallons. The two point-of-entry devices have a service cycle of 21,000 gallons and 84,000 gallons, which corresponds to approximately 2.5 months or 9.5 months for the typical water use of a family of four.\n\nNSF does not certify shower head devices for monochloramine reduction.\nSome devices are available that claim to reduce monochloramines in shower water. Shower head devices that add ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) to the water claim to reduce monochloramine concentrations. The use of ascorbic acid to reduce chlorine and monochloramine concentrations is an established practice in the water industry when necessary to dechlorinate wastewater that will be discharged to surface water. Ascorbic acid works by chemically reducing monochloramine in water to chloride, ammonium, and dehydroascorbic acid. To EPA's knowledge, the performance of these shower head devices has not been tested through third party verification.\n\nSource: US Environmental Protection Agency\n\nHome filters not NSF certified that are charcoal filters can be checked to demonstrate their ability to remove monochloramines. One would need a home test kit to measure total chlorine. Test kits are available from HACH Company, which manufactures and distributes analytical instruments and reagents used to test the quality of water."

Did you know that half of all the fluoride you drink or half of all the fluoride you ingest stays in your bones, stays in your body for the rest of your life? It has been found that populations, who have fluoridated drinking water, have more hip fractures and bone fractures in the elderly population? These are people that can't recover from that and their bones are poisoned because they've been drinking the fluoride for so long. Half of what you're drinking stays in your body.\n\nAs a Natural Dentist I have found that fluoride in the drinking water does not reduce tooth decay. That's a myth. It's a strange situation we're living under when our water is fluoridated, yet clearly dangerous. It is also a big problem for people with kidney problems, where there's dialysis that uses the water that poisons. It's very toxic. Some people drink a lot more water than other people. Compare the dosage of fluoride that an athlete drinks (who may drink twice as much water) or that of a child (who drinks a lot of water with a small body mass) to that of an average adult?\n\nThe whole idea of putting toxic fluoride in public drinking water is totally wrong and contrary to all pharmacology and the way medicine should work.\n\nWe have warnings that children's formula should not be made with fluoride in a drinking water. Well, what are we going to do if our community water is fluoridated? It's just poison. It's a strange question. But if we're going to put fluoride in the drinking water, why don't we put arsenic? They're both toxic"

      "text": "PUTTING WATER ON A SALT-FREE DIET Is Desalination the Solution to Our Increasing Freshwater Shortages?\n\nWhoever designed the human body seems to have messed up! We must drink fresh water, but fresh water makes up less than 3% of the H2O on the planet—and much of that is tied up in glaciers and ice caps.\nThe salty water in the oceans and seas makes up the rest of the planet's water. Waiting for global warming to melt the polar ice caps definitely isn't a sensible way to solve the planet's ever-increasing freshwater shortages, so some areas are turning to desalination, which generates fresh water from salt water.\n\nThere is a nearly inexhaustible supply of salt water on the planet, but turning it into fresh water is still an expensive proposition. But as demand for fresh water rises and outstrips supply, the cost of getting fresh water from traditional sources—rivers, lakes, groundwater—goes up. Getting water from desalination plants is becoming more economically competitive. The municipal water supply for many Caribbean islands and Arabian Gulf states already comes mainly from desalination.\n\nSo, is desalination the magic bullet for water shortages? Not really. In addition to the cost of removing the salt from the water—it's still roughly three times more expensive than supplying natural fresh water—consider the following drawbacks:\n\nSalinity rise: The leftover concentrated salt water is injected back into the ocean, causing the local salinity to rise, which can create problems for some ocean creatures.\n\nChemical pollution: Chemicals must still be used to pre-treat the source water, and de-fouling chemicals must be used to clean and remove organisms from the reverse-osmosis system.\n\nEnergy use: Desalination is energy-intensive—much more so than pumping available fresh water—so more electricity is needed, causing more pollution from electric power plants.\n\nLogistics: Desalinated water is currently only practical and affordable for municipalities relatively near a source of salt water.\n\nThe global demand for fresh water makes increased use of desalination plants seem almost inevitable. There are, however, other measures that can help us make the most of our natural freshwater supplies and minimize the future economic and environmental costs of desalination:\n\nWater conservation: Using water wisely on an individual basis and at the community level reduces the overall demand for water and more closely aligns water needs with natural freshwater supplies.\n\nPollution avoidance: As pollution contaminates more and more freshwater sources, we bear higher treatment costs for partially contaminated sources and lose some badly contaminated sources altogether. Some of the most common sources of contamination are aging sewage-treatment plants or failing septic systems; pesticide and fertilizer runoff from farm fields and homeowners' lawns; and polluted runoff from highways, streets, and parking lots.\n\nNow, relax and imagine you're drinking a delicious margarita... but without the lime juice, triple sec or tequila. Mmm... briny. Of course, shortages of fresh water will never quite come to that, but being nice to our freshwater supplies will help us avoid future water shortages and reduce the need for desalination.\n\nPublish date: 17-FEB-2004\n\nOIL & WATER & SALT DON'T MIX\n\nAfter the First Gulf War, the ground in Kuwait was left scarred by pools of oil from destroyed oil wells and by particulate matter that settled out of the smoke-filled air. Also contributing to the long-term environmental problems: the salt that remained on the ground from the seawater used to extinguish the well fires.\n\nAre population growth, higher living standards, and increasing demand from industry and agriculture doomed to outpace the supply of fresh water? Get a primer on desalination and its environmental impact. (by Sabine Lattemann and Thomas Hopner, Apr-2003)\n\nWill easy access to fresh water become a luxury? This overview of the future of freshwater resources predicts that water will become a commodity controlled multinational corporations, population growth will far outpace water supplies, and water will be the fulcrum on which 21st century global politics balances.

They say British tap water is already among the world's best, so why not improve it, brand it, and sell it? \"What better image than water bottles branded with your own venue?\" asks Vivreau. The Vivreau process involves mains-fed water-bottling systems, which\n\noffers a saving in terms of environmental impact and carbon footprint. \"Our systems link into a pub's normal water supply before fi ltering,\n\npurifying and chilling of the water takes place,\" says Stephen Charles, Vivreau's managing director. \"The water is then dispensed through a tap in the same way you would with beer. The only difference is that you may dispense into branded bottles for service to a customer at table. Your branded bottles simply go in a dishwasher and get used again.\" A user of the system is Russell Jeffery of the\n\nwater throughout dinner as a matter of course. I was intrigued by the idea of profi t potential on this water, but I was concerned about how a change would be received. \"I ran my own two-month trial, offering un-\n\nlimited mineral water for a one-off charge of £3.00 per table.

      "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nNo. Hot water may contain impurities that come from the hot water heater and plumbing in your house. To avoid this, use cold water and let the water run for a couple of minutes before you use it if that tap has not been used for a while, overnight, or all day. You can then heat this water in the microwave or on the stove. Catching the water you flush out of the tap in a container and saving it for plant watering is a good conservation measure.\n\nHot water generally comes from a hot water heater that may contain impurities that should not be ingested. Some of these impurities might be metals from household plumbing that are concentrated in the heating process. Additionally, these impurities from the household plumbing dissolve more rapidly in hot water than cold water causing the amount of impurities to be higher in hot water. Therefore, cold water should be used for all drinking and cooking uses, as well as for baby formula. See similar questions...\n\nHot water is more likely to contain iron, copper and lead from your household plumbing and water heater because these contaminants generally dissolve faster into hot water than cold water. Therefore you should only use cold water for cooking. See similar questions...\n\nHousehold water heaters heat water for washing, not for drinking. Water out of the hot tap generally has health-threatening levels of heavy metals (such as lead), as well as an off taste. You should consider this water unfit for human consumption. Incidentally, if you live in the United States in a house whose plumbing system was constructed between the 1930s and the late 1970s, it's a good idea to let the cold tap run at full for about a minute before using it. See similar questions...\n\nWater can contain fluoride in varying amounts. Consult with your family physician or pediatrician to see if this is the most appropriate water to use. After their first birthday, children can drink infant formula mixed with water that contains fluoride because they weigh more and formula is no longer a primary part of their diet. See similar questions...\n\nRelatively inexpensive conductivity meters are available. They will give you an approximation of your TDS in your water and fertilizer mix. The short answer is yes, unless you have a sodium-based water softener. See similar questions...\n\nThere are a number of different types of hot water/boiler systems in wide-scale use in the UK. Please contact us and we will be able to establish which type of hot water/boiler system you have and therefore the suitability, or otherwise, of a particular component of your kitchen. See similar questions... See similar questions...\n\nNo. Charleston Water System uses chloramines (a mixture of chlorine and ammonia) to disinfect drinking water, which are harmful to fish and other aquatic life. There are a number of products available at pet stores to remove chloramines from your fish tank. Charleston Water System tap water is safe for dog, cats, and other non-aquatic pets. See similar questions...\n\nThis is not recommended. The cloudiness that occurs is because of the silver reacting with the chlorine in the water creating silver chloride. The salt method also produces a gray cloud. The boiling method produces a clear or light golden colloidal silver. Heat 16 ounces (500 ml) of distilled water to the boil-preferably in a non-metal container. Do not use a glass measuring cup on the stove top as it may explode. See similar questions...\n\nIt depends on the iron. It is not recommended in models that do not have a self-cleaning or automatic cleaning feature. These features ensure that all calcium and lint deposits are removed. See similar questions...\n\nShort answer--No! There are a number of \"nasty\" micro-organisms, especially acanthomeba (sp) which likes feeding on corneal tissue. Storing lenses in water also defeats the purpose of using a disinfecting solution as there is no disinfection occurring. If anything you are exposing your lenses to more potentially dangerous microorganisms. See similar questions...\n\nYes. It would be extremely difficult for a bioterrorist to contaminate our drinking water supplies to cause widespread illness. Huge amounts of water are pumped daily from our reservoirs, most of which is used for industrial and other purposes. Anything deliberately put into the water supply would be greatly diluted. Poisoning water supplies would require truckloads of biological or chemical agents that are difficult to produce and relatively easy to detect. See similar questions...\n\nTap water is not automatically safe. It may be contaminated with chemicals, bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and dirt. Have your tap water tested by a laboratory. Then ask a water company to design a filtration and purification system based on the lab results. If your water comes from a well, it may be necessary to have it softened, which means eliminating hard elements like calcium, iron, and magnesium. See similar questions...\n\nWATER FILTERS: One way to avoid fluoride from the tap is to purchase a water filter. However, most water filters will not effectively remove fluoride. For instance, Brita filters will NOT remove fluoride. The two types of filters which will reliably remove more than 90% of the fluoride are reverse-osmosis filters and activated alumina filters. Thus, if you are looking for a filter to remove fluoride, make sure it uses \"reverse-osmosis\" or \"activated alumina\" technology. See similar questions..."

      "text": "The Authoritative Resource for Water Quality & Water Treatment including Water Filtration, Purification, & Disinfection\n\nWhat is hard water?\n\nby on June 15, 2012\n\nHard water has a high concentration of the minerals calcium and magnesium dissolved in it. The degree of hardness becomes greater as the calcium and magnesium content increases. Hard water is not generally regarded to be a health risk, but it can be a nuisance. Mineral deposits can build up on plumbing and fixtures in the bathroom and kitchen. Hard water also makes bathing, as well as washing your clothes and dishes, more problematic—because it causes soaps and detergents to perform poorly.\n\nAs we have discussed in this blog before, water is a highly effective solvent. Because of its unique chemical composition and structure, water picks up impurities easily. In fact, pure water—tasteless, colorless and odorless—is often called the universal solvent. When water combines with carbon dioxide to form very weak carbonic acid, an even better solvent is formed. Even the cleanest rainwater is slightly acidic, because some carbon dioxide gas dissolves in it as water droplets moves through the atmosphere.\n\nThen, as water moves through soil and rock formations, it dissolves very small amounts of minerals and holds them in solution. People whose groundwater supply comes in contact with large deposits of limestone or chalk have hard water. Both limestone and chalk are made up mainly from calcium carbonate. Acidic water (in the form of carbonic acid) dissolves the calcium carbonate. Sometimes water flows over gypsum rock, which contains calcium sulfate. In either case, calcium ions get into the water. A similar chemical process can also put magnesium ions in the water. These metallic ions are what cause the hardness in water.\n\nWhat problems are caused by hard water?\n\nMore than 85% of American homes have hard water, leading to various problems throughout the house. One effect of hard water is that soaps and detergents lose some effectiveness. Instead of dissolving completely, soap combines with the minerals to form a thick, gel-like soap curd. We commonly call this \"soap scum.\" Soap scum is sticky and insoluble. It hangs around the tub, sink and washing machine. It clings to the skin and may actually get in the way of cleansing. Washed hair and skin seems dull and lifeless. Plus, because less soap is dissolved, more is required to accomplish the job. In the laundry, things aren't much better. Soap scum can work its way into your clothes as they're being washed. Dirt, debris and stains can remain trapped in the fibers. Hard water can also stiffen and roughen the fabric.\n\nIn addition to affecting the actual washing process, insoluble soap deposits leave spots on everything you clean—from your dishes to the family car—and a soap film will build up in your bath and shower. Yet another reason to be concerned about hard water is its negative effect on your plumbing system. Calcium and magnesium deposits can build up in pipes, reducing flow to taps and appliances. In water heaters, these minerals generate a scale buildup that reduces the efficiency and life of the heater.\n\nAlthough the health risks of hard water are minimal, some studies have shown a possible link between cardiovascular health and water hardness. Other research has indicated a connection between hard water usage at home and increased eczema in children.\n\nHow do I treat my hard water problems?\n\nThe solution to hard water is installing a water softener. In the long run, it will save you hassle, time and money. A water softener is a mechanical appliance that's plumbed into your house's water supply. All water softeners use the same operating principle. They trade the minerals for something else, usually sodium. The process is called ion exchange. This happens in a mineral tank filled with small polystyrene beads, also known as resin. The resin beads carry a negative charge. Calcium and magnesium in water both carry positive charges. This means that these mineral ions will cling to the beads as the hard water passes through the mineral tank. Sodium ions also have a positive charge—just not as strong as the charge on the calcium and magnesium ions. When a very strong brine solution (salt water) is flushed through a tank that has beads already saturated with calcium and magnesium, the large volume of sodium ions is enough to drive the calcium and magnesium ions off the beads. Water softeners have a separate brine tank that uses common salt (sodium chloride) to create this brine solution.\n\nIn normal operation, hard water moves into the mineral tank. Then the calcium and magnesium ions move to the beads, replacing sodium ions. The sodium ions go into the water. Once the beads are saturated with calcium and magnesium, the unit enters a 3-phase regenerating cycle. First, the backwash phase reverses water flow to flush dirt out of the tank. In the recharge phase, the concentrated sodium-rich salt water solution is carried from the brine tank through the mineral tank. The sodium collects on the beads, replacing the calcium and magnesium—which go down the drain. Once this phase is over, the mineral tank is flushed of excess brine and the brine tank is refilled.\n\nMost popular water softeners have an automatic regenerating system. The most basic type has an electric timer that flushes and recharges the system on a regular schedule. During recharging, soft water is not available. A second type of control uses a computerized water meter to determine how much water is used. When enough water has passed through the mineral tank to have depleted the beads of sodium, the computer initiates regeneration. These softeners often have reserve resin capacity, so that some soft water will be available during recharging. A third type of control uses a mechanical water meter to monitor water usage and trigger recharging. Unlike the electric timer and computer metering system, no electrical components are required. Like the computerized meter, the mineral tank is only recharged when necessary. When equipped with two mineral tanks, softened water remains constantly available—even when the unit is recharging.\n\nWaterFilters.NET has a number of water softening units available for you to consider. Eliminating hard water has several advantages, from healthier hair to cleaner clothes. Now is the right time to select a water softener for your household, so you can clear away that nasty soap scum once and for all!"

      "text": "Green Living QA: Is Tap, Filtered, Or Bottled Water The Safest?\n\nQ:\n\nWhich type of water is the safest and healthiest to drink? Tap, filtered, or bottled?\n\nA:\n\nI believe that filtered tap water is the safest and most economical way to go. I say 'filtered' because a massive 2008 investigation by the Associated Press showed that America's tap water, coast to coast, is contaminated with a vast array of prescription and over-the-counter drugs, including antibiotics, pain medications, antidepressants and sex hormones...in \"significant concentrations.\" This is happening because when people take pills, their bodies absorb some of the medication, but the rest is flushed down the toilet and water treatment plants don't remove pharmaceutical residues. They remain in the water that eventually lands back in our drinking water supplies.\n\nScientists are concerned that even in small concentrations these drugs could harm us over time because water is consumed in such large amounts every day. Our bodies may be able to deal with a big one-time dose of a chemical, but if a small amount is consumed continuously over years…no one really knows what can happen to our health.\n\nUse bottled water in a pinch -- it's important to stay hydrated!, but know that 8 out of 10 plastic water bottles used in the U. S. become garbage or end up in a landfill, contributing to global warming. They're also found in our oceans as small bits of plastic that fish and birds mistakenly eat because they look like krill. It has been estimated that over a million sea-birds and one hundred thousand marine mammals and sea turtles are killed each year by ingestion of plastics in our oceans.\n\nBottled water may also not be as safe as you think. In a major study comparing 1,000 bottles of different water brands by the NRDC, several of the brands tested contained dangerous chemicals. Also, the longer a bottle of water sits on a shelf, whether in a grocery store or your refrigerator, the higher the risk you'll consume a greater dose of a chemical called antimony, a potential carcinogen.\n\nIt is estimated that about 25 to 30 percent of the bottled water sold in America comes from a city or town's tap water – sometimes further treated, sometimes not. To find out if your bottled water comes from city tap water, check the bottle label or the cap – if it says \"from a municipal source\" or \"from a community water system\", this means it's derived from tap water.\n\nTo check your local water quality: go to the Natural Resources Defense Council's site at  and then go to \"What's on Tap\"? You should be able to access your community's Annual Quality Report, or you can ask your water utility company for a copy of its annual water quality report. You can also call the EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline at 800-426-4791. Your own water could further be contaminated due to old pipes leading to your faucets."

      "text": "The yoga nasal irrigation technique, called Jala Neti in Sanskrit, is a Shatkarma (purification practice) used to cleanse the nasal passages of mucus and particulates. Modern users typically employ a teapot-looking device to pour salt water solution into one nostril and allow it to run out the other while the mouth is kept open to breathe. This practice has been shown effective for ease of symptoms related to hay fever, sinusitis, and other nasal conditions.\n\nInfections from Naegleria fowleri are rare, and almost always fatal. Infection typically occurs while swimming or bathing in warm freshwater lakes or rivers, particularly when the water is low and in muddy areas. Infections have also been reported from bathing in inadequately chlorinated swimming pools and nasal irrigation with inadequately treated drinking water.\n\nThe amoeba enters through the nostrils and then bores through the skull, where it emits two enzymes to dissolve protein-rich brain tissue for consumption. Initial stages may appear similar to bacterial meningitis which includes headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, and stiff neck. Later symptoms progress to confusion, loss of balance, seizures, and hallucinations. Initial onset of symptoms occurs 1-7 days following infection, after which death usually occurs within 1-12 days.\n\nNaegleria fowleri cannot survive in salt water, which has led some to speculate that the usage of tap water for neti is safe if adequate salt is added. This is based on the assumption that salt will hypothetically \"kill\" the amoeba. Given that failure to use salt in one's neti pot results in burning and stinging, it is unlikely the deceased didn't use it. However, no sources comment on whether salt was used.\n\nHealth authorities now recommend that boiled, distilled, or purified water always be used for nasal irrigation, echoing longstanding recommendations by neti pot manufacturers.\n\nAre you a neti pot user? Have you used tap water in your neti pot before?\n\n7 Comments\n\nlukedidit: ...\n\nI actually just wrote about this yesterday too. My biggest concern is that they have such an amoeba in a public water supply in the first place - that is the big issue here. But unfortunately its being gleamed over with press induced hysteria on brain munching amoebas.\n\n1\n\nDecember 23, 2011\n\nkelgan: ...\n\nWe have a filter system in place for our tap water. However, my Dad uses a Neti pot on a regular basis due to chronic congestion. He also boils his water first.\n\n2\n\nDecember 23, 2011\n\npossum1969: ...\n\nlife is a crap shoot\n\n3\n\nDecember 25, 2011\n\nLucyClark: ...\n\nI do use tap water in my neti pot, but I am thinking from now on I'll use distilled water just to be safe. It certainly is much more complicated to boil it and then let it cool to a usable temperature. But does boiling tap water kill the bacteria? or must you use distilled or other purified water?\n\n4\n\nJanuary 06, 2012\n\nfreehand: ...\n\nLucyClark - Boiling water will kill any known infectious bacteria and amoebas. If you are worried about chemical contamination, however, such as industrial waste or fracking by-products, you will need to obtain distilled water.\n\n5\n\nJanuary 07, 2012\n\nSaxmac: ...\n\nI am sad to hear of these terribly unfortunate stories. On my first use I used a \"smart water\" water bottle that had been on my counter. I had never seen a nasal irrigation aside from YouTube videos. I unfortunately used tap water t perform this task and now I am scared as ever. I live in Orange County, California. Is this brain eating amoeba something I should be worried about, now that I have already squirted tap water in to my nasal cavity? I hope I am not to late n this discussion.\n\n6\n\nFebruary 27, 2012\n\nTimothy: ...\n\nSaxmac - Please don't worry about using tap water, I've been doing it for years and I'm still alive! These are very rare reports, so the chances of Naegleria fowleri being in your water supply is unlikely.

This precaution will last at least two full days and water system officials will be immediately notified when the boil water alert is lifted.\n\nColiforms were found in more samples than allowed and this was a warning of potential problems with the treatment process or pipes which distribute the water.\n\nMSDH Checklist for Safe Water Use: DO NOT Do not drink tap water while the water system is under a boil water advisory. Do not drink from water fountains in parks, public or private buildings that receive water from the affected system. Do not use ice unless it has been made with boiled water. Freezing will not necessarily kill harmful bacteria. Do not use tap water to make drinks, juices, or fountain soft drinks. DO Wash your dishes in boiled water, or use paper plates for the next few days. Wash your fruits and vegetables with boiled or bottled water since they may have been exposed to affected water from grocery store sprayers. Wash your hands and bathe as usual. Bathing is safe as long as no water is swallowed. Brush your teeth with boiled or bottled water. Cook with tap water if the food will be boiled for at least one minute. AND REMEMBER: Properly chlorinated water in swimming pools is safe. Fish in aquariums are not affected. Bringing water to a rolling boil for one minute will inactivate all major types of harmful bacteria. When your boil-water notice is lifted: Flush faucets for a total of 10 minutes to introduce system water throughout house plumbing. Example: o 1 faucet — run for 10 minutes o 2 faucets — run both for 5 minutes o 3 faucets — run each for 3-4 minutes Flush any faucet a minimum of 2 minutes to ensure clearing of the line serving the faucet. Discard any drinks, ice, food, etc, made during the boil water notice. Rewash any food or drink contact items (knifes, forks, plates, etc.) with \"cleared\" system water. Check water filters (in faucets, refrigerators and elsewhere) and replace if necessary. Do not use water from your hot water heater for drinking until several exchanges of the tank have occurred.

      "text": "Community Report\n\nWhen students start school in the Salinas Valley town of Bradley, they bring with them with pens, paper and notebooks. The school district provides their water bottles.\n\nThat is because tap water in this south Monterey County school is undrinkable. It's contaminated with dangerously high levels nitrates.\n\nBradley's approximately 49 students, kindergarten through 8th grade, aren't alone in their lack of tap water.\n\nOfficials at schools in San Lucas, a little less than a half hour north of Bradley, discovered about two years ago that the water from their taps isn't safe. Filling the gap, first with county emergency funds and now with water provided by a bottled water company, was a juggling act at first.\n\n\"It was a bit of surprise and sudden scramble to think that 'uh oh, we have to do something,'\" said Principal Nicole Hester.\n\nThe Washington Union School District, off Highway 68 between Salinas and Monterey, is also without potable water.\n\nIn fact, more than 75 applications to the California Department of Public Health's fund for drinking water projects last year involved schools. Projects included digging second wells to ensure continued access to drinking water, replacing a 50-year-old redwood water storage tank and dealing with nitrates in Riverside and Monterey counties.\n\nThe danger from water with nitrates or naturally occurring arsenic, as is the case for the Washington school district, is serious. Schools must provide bottled water rather than boiled tap water because boiling would only concentrate the minerals, said Cheryl Sandoval, Monterey County Environmental Health Supervisor.\n\nNitrates are most dangerous to babies under 6 months, in whom it can cause blue baby syndrome, and pregnant women, Sandoval said. In others, nitrates are expected carcinogens. Exposure to arsenic can cause skin damage, circulatory problems, increased cancer risk and more.\n\n\"There's a whole slew of concerns,\" she said.\n\nPoor water quality in schools is largely, but not entirely, a rural issue. In rural communities the problem is frequently nitrates, likely from neighboring farms where nitration-based fertilizers are used.\n\nThe well that provided water to San Lucas was flagged in a 2001 safety assessment as being \"vulnerable to synthetic and organic compounds and nitrates\" because of its location in an agricultural area.\n\nBut where else is a rural community to get water if not from an agricultural area? It's a complicated situation.\n\n\"My community is involved in ag,\" San Lucas principal Hester said. \"We don't point fingers. We don't blame. We understand this is how things work. When you live in an ag area this is how things happen. We get it.\"\n\nIt's an issue the state has tried to solve with emergency grants designed to help find temporary water supplies for disadvantaged communities.\n\n\"Access to clean drinking water in our rural school districts is clearly a problem in California,\" said state Assemblyman Luis Alejo (D-Watsonville) in a statement. \"I will continue to focus on providing clean drinking water to those that have been consistently over-looked, including disadvantaged communities and our schools.\"\n\nAlejo, who represents most of the Salinas Valley, joined forces with Assemblyman Henry Perea (D-Fresno) this winter to push a series of bills focusing on rural water issues, including one designed to speed the approval process for water projects.\n\nIn a state where water leads to political battles, questions about unsafe drinking water aren't always simply answered with agricultural runoff. The water at Washington district schools, for example, is contaminated with arsenic, which is common throughout groundwater in the region.\n\nFour Monterey County public schools – Captain Cooper, Central Bay High School, and Echo Valley – use water that tested for high levels of lead and copper.\n\nLeaders in schools without access to tap water find ways to make it work.\n\nFor Hester, it meant creating new rules in San Lucas schools. To avoid spills and conflicts, water bottles aren't allowed on desks.\n\nShe said that providing ongoing emergency water \"likely isn't in anyone's budget\" and has worked with a bottled water company and the San Lucas Water District to find temporary solutions.\n\nFor the kids at Bradley schools, many have used bottle water the entire time they've been in school, said principal Ian M. Trejo.\n\nThe school started using bottled water because of a strong metallic smell seven years ago. It wasn't until recently that tests came up positive and the bottled water became mandatory.\n\nThe school provides individual bottles for students to fill at water stations around campus and washes the bottles in the cafeteria.\n\n\"It probably sounds like a big deal to folks in an urban area,\" he said. \"But these kids start as kindergartners using bottled water. Anything else would seem unusual to them.\"\n\nBecause the school operates the well, Trejo doesn't receive extra cash for clean drinking water. To him, it's a school program like any other designed to keep students safe and healthy in class and is funded by school.\n\nVeronica Mayes Jackson cooking a pot of beans and red peppers at a North Long Beach community center.\n\nBy Jessica Portner\nCalifornia Health Report\n\nSoul food was on the menu one recent Saturday evening where more than a hundred people packed into a North Long Beach community center. They weren't coming for dinner, but to watch a screening of a new documentary film \"Soul Food Junkies\" put on by the Coalition for a Healthy North Long Beach.\n\nThe movie starts with filmmaker Byron Hurt narrating the autobiographic journey as an image of his father appears on the screen: \"Sweet potato pie. Mac and cheese, black-eyed peas. You name it, he loved it…like most boys, I wanted to be like my pops so I ate what he ate. I'd stack my plate with grits eggs, salt pork, on toast, typical Sunday breakfast…I never questioned what we were eating or how much. Back then, I just enjoyed my mother's delicious food.\"\n\nHurt's father went from being young and fit, he said, to being nearly twice his size. He died at age 63 of pancreatic cancer.\n\nThe film investigates the upsides and downsides of the quintessential American cuisine, the history and social significance of soul food to black cultural identity, and its effect on African American health, good and bad. The movie recalled how slaves were given bare minimum to survive and so they often grew their own food and used the same hunting and fishing techniques as they had in Africa.\n\nThroughout the decades, that survival food turned into a delicacy. Plenty of carbohydrates, oily, and sugary foods became a staple part of the African American diet. However, the movie shows that, eaten in moderation with a few healthy modifications, \"soul food can be good to us and good for us.\"\n\nAfter the film, Laura Marin, who was in the audience, noted that Latino culture had a tradition of unhealthy cuisine as well. \"I grew up in Tijuana and I remember my grandmother cooking pancakes with lard,\" said Marin. \"Growing up, we didn't make the healthiest dishes, like enchiladas, where you put the tortillas in oil before you bake them.\"\n\nMarin said many of her friends in Long Beach are vegetarian and she pescatarian. \"As you become more aware, you make healthier choices.\"\n\nThe Long Beach Health Department says that African Americans have higher rates of type 2 diabetes compared to Asians and Whites, and are more obese. Michelle Fino, a dietician with the Long Beach Health Department, who answered the audience's questions, along with Hurt, said the obesity epidemic more broadly is tied to environmental changes in society's relation to food. The obesity epidemic began in the 1980s she said, when sugary beverages, frappacinos, and energy drinks began to trickle into the marketplace.\n\n\"It is very difficult to eat healthy when we have so much access,\" she said. \"What we know about people is when there is a lot of variety — like a buffet — they eat more. It's very difficult for people to change their eating habits.\"\n\nKathryn P. Sucher, a professor at San Jose State University in the Department of Food and Nutrition and the co-author of the best-selling book, Food and Culture, agrees.\n\nSucher, a recognized authority on how diet, health, and disease are affected by culture, said traditional diets of most cultures were generally healthier. For example, she said the diets of African American factory workers who migrated north before World War II ate, for the most part, traditional and healthy diets of boiled greens with ham hocks, beans, and cornbread. They were growing their own vegetables. Latino immigrants in the U.S. ate less meat, more starch and fruit, but consumed smaller portions than they do today, she said. Asian Americans had generally had healthy portions of vegetables and meats, but often used too much sodium.\n\n\"Every culture has good and bad things about the diet. Some have more good than bad,\" said Sucher. \"One message would be to try to stay with traditional with the food. Switching over to fast food culture is not a way to go.\"\n\nThere are 5.8 times as many fast-food restaurants and convenience stores in Long Beach as there are supermarkets and produce vendors, according to the Long Beach health department.\n\nSithary Ly, a community health advocate at Families in Good Health at St. Mary Medical Center in Long Beach, said that fast food consumption isn't as pervasive in the Cambodian population there. Though they suffer from hypertension and other ailments, obesity isn't one of them, she said. Cambodian families in Long Beach are often low income and the family tends to cook at home the staple Cambodian diet of rice, grilled meat, and vegetables, like stir fry broccoli.\n\n\"You spend less and can feed more in the family instead of going to restaurant… You eat with them and make it a fun family thing and it becomes a habit.'' Though Ly does say that she is seeing more obesity in children as they also move into consuming an American fast food diet, including hamburgers, hot dogs and soda. \"But they don't get huge because they eat the Cambodian food.\"\n\nSucher said that of course, genetics plays a huge role in disease in cultures regardless of cuisine. African-American, Cambodian-Americans and Mexican-Americans are all susceptible to type 2 diabetes, and the cuisines of those communities are mostly 50 percent carbohydrates (corn, rice, etc.), which make treating the disease hard to treat.\n\nIn a population the size of Long Beach, the total costs of medical care and lost productivity associated with overweight and obesity alone is about $287 million per year.\n\nThat is a trend a tight knit group of government and community groups are trying to reverse.\n\nAnd their message seems to be taking hold, at least among some audience members at the screening. Long after the film was over at a North Long Beach community center, the audience lingered around tables in the back of the room, sampling a stew of freshly cooked green beans and red peppers and picking up recipes to make healthy soul food dishes at home.\n\nSandra Hinojosa standing outside of the California Rural Legal Assistance office in Salinas.

Through word of mouth, many in the transgender community in Monterey and surrounding counties hear about her and find their way to Santa Cruz. Those who don't have a car or the means to travel are often out of luck.\n\nIn many ways, Hastings said, transgender people are the least understood group in a society that sees gender in a strictly binary way. But she sounds a hopeful note that – while there's a lot of work to be done – the medical profession is making progress in treating transgender people.\n\n\"My sense is that we will have more training in medical schools,\" she said. \"It will get better.\"\n\nTransgender people face discrimination from the medical profession. It's even worse for transgender Latinos, according to a 2011 study. The National Transgender Discrimination Survey found that 23 percent of Latino transgender people reported being refused medical care because of bias, and 36 percent said they had put off going to the doctor when they were sick because they were afraid of discrimination.\n\n\"The stress of visiting a health care provider who is not aware of transgender issues can keep transgender people from seeking any heathcare needs for fear of being outed, or mistreated at health facilities, or simply not having enough information to educate the heath care provider on what they need as a transgender person,\" said Axil Cricchio, a social science professor at California State University – Monterey Bay and a transman, in an email.\n\nThere is an acute need for better access to health care for transgender people. Respondents to the discrimination study reported more than four times the national average for HIV infection. Nearly half reported that they had attempted suicide.\n\nTransgender people in Monterey County who want to see a doctor who is specifically trained to work with transgender patients must travel outside the county – whether to Santa Cruz, San Francisco, or San Luis Obispo. People who want a prescription for hormones and who don't have a car or a ride out of the county, then, may turn to the black market.\n\n\"A problem we have in this county is ignorance and an unwillingness to learn by health care providers,\" said Stephen Braveman, a gender specialist and sex therapist in Monterey.\n\nOne young doctor in Salinas, with Hastings' help, is hoping to chip away at that problem.\n\nJennerfer Tiscareno, a second-year resident at Natividad Hospital in Salinas, plans to start a weekly clinic for transgender patients as part of her community medicine rotation.\n\nShe realized there was a need for such a clinic during her intern year, when she saw or heard about multiple patients who had come into the emergency room with stab wounds. They were all transgender women who worked as prostitutes and were attacked by clients, she said.\n\nOne of the main areas where Tiscareno sees a need is training for hospital staff. Some nurses, for example, were unsure of whether to call transgender women by their birth names, or by the names they have adopted as women.\n\n\"I always said there's no question, call them by their name of which they would like to be called,\" she said. \"As a physician, maybe you have that impact of saying this is what you need to do. You don't need to be specialized to deal with transgender medicine. It's really just comfortability.\"\n\nRoselyn Macias, a transgender woman in Salinas, can relate to the problem of hospital staff being untrained – she's been treated poorly by front desk staff in the past. Now she is considering getting a degree as a medical assistant; more transgender people should be trained to enter health care fields, she said.\n\n\"That helps transgender people – they're not going to be afraid\" to go to the doctor themselves, she added, if they see more people like themselves providing care at clinics and hospitals.\n\nBraveman said some Monterey County hospitals refuse to place transgender patients in rooms that match their gender identities. Some providers in the county don't understand the basics of transgender care and refuse to learn, Braveman said; some are rude to transgender people who come in, some refuse to give them care, and every now and then a provider will find it so bizarre that someone is transgender, he said, that they will call the police.\n\nMcDaniel, now a therapist, recalled seeing a specialist for a sinus condition; when the doctor inquired about his previous surgeries, and McDaniel told him about his gender reassignment surgery, the doctor made a point of crossing off \"male\" on McDaniel's chart and writing in \"female.\"\n\nHe now travels to Santa Cruz to see Hastings for his medical care. \"I got tired of going in and having to teach medical professionals,\" he said.\n\nAside from genital surgery – which not all transgender people seek out – there is nothing particularly special that transgender people need from doctors. Hormone therapy replacement – which not all transgender people seek out – is common among all genders. All other health needs simply relate to the human body, Cricchio said, regardless of a person's gender identity.\n\nAnd not all doctors in Monterey County, of course, are dropping the ball on care for transgender patients. \"What I've seen are doctors are pretty well-trained,\" said Sandra Hinojosa, a transgender woman and leader, along with Macias, in an LGBT support group in Salinas run by California Rural Legal Assistance.\n\n\"Whoever you are – whether transgender or not – they give you good care,\" she said in Spanish through an interpreter.\n\nThe only difference she experiences when she goes to the doctor, she said, is that medical staff, not knowing initially that she is transgender, will ask her if she's had any children, and when her last period was. When she tells them she's transgender, she said, they reassure her: \"Relax, you're not going to have a problem here. You're OK.\"\n\nThere are larger systemic problems – health insurance companies, for example, because the system is set up so that tests are linked with gender, routinely deny coverage for preventative care screenings such as prostate exams for transgender women or pap smears for transgender men.\n\nPaying for health care is also a problem. The Latino transgender population faces a debilitating 18 percent unemployment rate, according to the 2011 discrimination study.\n\nMacias said she's had health insurance in brief spurts while working picking raspberries in the fields around Salinas and Watsonville. Without health insurance, hormones cost her $100 a month. She's paid $20 a month for them when she's had health insurance through work.\n\nAnd it's tough finding employment; Macias is trying to stay upbeat about her job search, but it's frustrating. She always gets an interview if she applies online, but after the interview, employers typically say they'll let her know. She repeatedly gets told that she's overqualified, but she said she'll take any job.\n\nLacking health insurance because of its expense, many transgender people – like many people in general – get their primary care at emergency rooms or clinics only when they absolutely need it. Getting to Santa Cruz, to San Francisco or south to San Luis Obispo for care from doctors who are trained to work with transgender patients is only a dream for many people in Monterey County.\n\n\"Traveling these distances are simply not an option for those who do not have the means for such travel, nor the money to finance their own health care,\" Cricchio said.\n\nMonterey County wants to revolutionize health care for one of the most difficult to reach groups, the mentally ill.\n\nIts new program will create one-stop health care shopping for people whose main interaction with doctors is through the county's behavioral health centers.\n\nThat means primary care, like regular doctor's visits, flu shots or diabetes management, will be housed in the same building patients already visit for therapy or drug rehabilitation. And, all patient care will be coordinated on site.\n\n\"We think we can provide a wrap-around to help people really succeed,\" said Amie Miller, Monterey County Department of Behavioral Health's project manager for the plan.\n\nThe planned three facilities won't just provide mental and physical health care, Miller said. Patients there will also be able to tap into healthy life skills courses focused on cooking, exercise and more. The plan brings together the county's public health nurses, clinics and other services to fill an important gap.\n\n\"Last year we looked at our severely mentally ill population and 39 percent didn't see a physician at all,\" she said.\n\nOn top that, studies show that the lifespan of a mentally ill person in the United States is 25 years shorter than that of the general population.\n\nThe deaths aren't be caused directly by the mental illness either, said Trina Dutta, public health advisor with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\n\"These aren't suicides,\" Dutta said. Rather the mentally ill may suffer from related physical ailments like obesity or diabetes. Most often, she said, it is simply more difficult for them to get the health care they need.\n\nShort visits that may not allow a patient to express their concerns or understand instructions can keep the mentally ill away from health clinics. Other barriers include the difficulty of making and keeping appointments while battling mental illness, a lack of insurance or transportation and stigma or fear of it.\n\nDutta's agency, part of the US Department of Health and Human Services, is kicking in $400,000 a year for the next four years in grant money to support Monterey County's program.\n\nIn the past, national and Monterey County efforts focused on bringing mental health care services to primary care facilities. So that a family doctor may ask if a patient is feeling depressed and then be able to refer them to a therapist down the hall.\n\nIt's one way to create a health care home for patients, a place where all of their needs are met.\n\n\"Other populations don't have an existing chronic illness,\" Clark said. \"We have special clinics throughout the county that are the place they go to for health care. We need to allow them to have other health issues addressed there, too.\"\n\nIntegrating all of the services in one location is part of what makes Monterey County's plan so innovative, Dutta said. Of the 90 grants her agency awarded to bring primary care to mental health care settings, the one to Monterey County is one of the only to include complete health care coordination.\n\nThat also means a lot of work.\n\nProject manager Miller is meeting the public health nurses and officials from the county's health clinics to figure out how they will share patient documents and gauge outcomes.\n\nBut she believes that the plan will drop barriers to care while increasing the efficiency of behavioral and physical health care for the 1,800 patients expected to access the centers each year.\n\nThe first integrated behavioral health care center in Monterey County is scheduled to open in April. For now, locations are planned on the grounds of the former Fort Ord, at Natividad Medical Center and in King City.\n\nThe Rev. Cecil L. \"Chip\" Murray sits in the small conference room of the center that bears his name. He is both humbled and amazed by the fact of the eponymous Cecil Murray Center for Community Engagement, part of the University of Southern California's Center for Religion & Civic Culture.\n\nThe Murray Center uses resources at USC, including the schools of law, business, social work and public policy, to bring in speakers from across the country. The center promotes civic engagement and economic development, and has launched a Faith Leaders Institute that addresses organizing, leadership, community development, civic engagement and more.\n\n\"The genuine essence of religion is not God wants you to have it, but God wants you to share it,\" Murray says in his slow, steady baritone. \"You would take a portion of what you have and share it with those who don't have to lift them. The same way you came from blue collar to white collar, they can come from blue collar to white collar. The same way you came from zero to hero, they can come.\"\n\nMurray's energy masks his 83 years and belies the gray in his hair. His eyes still possess a youthful hopefulness for what's good and what's right. His commitment to social justice is also reflected in decades of service, first in the U.S. Air Force, then in the ministry, and more recently as chairman of this center dedicated to positive civic engagement, tucked against the 110 Freeway just a few blocks north of USC's campus in Los Angeles.\n\nMurray is perhaps best known for his role in the civil unrest in 1992 that followed the incendiary Rodney King case. As pastor of the First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles, a role he held for 27 years, Murray struggled to keep the peace. Church members went out into the immediate community in an attempt to stop the violence, and when that didn't work, they welcomed those displaced by fire into their house of worship. Murray went on television with talk show host Arsenio Hall to plead for people to \"be constructive in your anger, not destructive, not self-destructive.\"\n\nThe First AME Church has a storied history in South Los Angeles. Its membership peaked at 18,000 in the 1990s; today it stands at 19,000. Outreach efforts flourished under Murray's long tenure, and church programs ranged from homeless assistance to a \"lock in\" program that steered young people away from drugs and gangs. \"The black church,\" Murray told the Los Angeles Times in 1990, \"must be the salvation of black men and black boys.\"\n\nWhen asked about the 1992 riots, Murray looks off to the side and responds with a quote from author Langston Hughes about a dream deferred. The Murray Center's mission, as well as that of its namesake, is organizing the nonprofit and faith-based community to try to ensure that some day no more dreams are deferred.\n\nThe center has added 500 organizations into its database since it opened in late 2011, Murray says, with an emphasis on South Los Angeles specifically and Southern California at large. Its focus is on issues such as education, housing, reentry, substance abuse and legal counseling.\n\n\"If people have access and if they have motivation, then the two will go together for success,\" Murray says.\n\nMajor challenges face underserved and minority populations in modern America, Murray says. He draws upon Martin Luther King Jr.'s assertion that the three major threats to mankind are racism, war and poverty. In Murray's opinion, poverty is society's biggest threat, and he breaks it down into what he calls the Four P's: poverty of family, poverty of pocket, poverty of education and poverty of image.\n\nMurray sees poverty as more than empty pockets. He wants to get beyond discussions of poverty that use the old adage about being given a fish instead of being taught how to fish. He wants to go a step further—he wants to see more people owning the pond.\n\n\"You won't last or linger without that component,\" Murray says. \"Teach them how to fish, yes, that's fine. But it won't work much for the next generation.\"\n\nMurray sums up poverty of family as too many missing fathers. For that he blames the disproportionate number of African American men in the U.S. prison system, for which he cites unfair sentencing practices relating to drug charges. Establishing reentry programs for prisoners coming out of the system is one of his priorities.\n\nMurray sees the poverty of education as stemming from high dropout rates in poorer communities. Lack of an education leads to lower earning potential, which leads back to poverty of pocket. Too many young African Americans aren't aware of or don't take pride in accomplishments made by those who came before them—the cause of poverty of image.\n\nWhen considering health care, Murray ties his Four P's together. \"When you're poor in pocket, family, image and education, you're going to be poor in health,\" he says.\n\nMurray's current work reflects what he started as the pastor at First AME Church, where he stressed community engagement.\n\nThe Rev. Mark Whitlock met Murray in 1982, when his future wife took him to the First AME Church. Whitlock is now a pastor at Christ Our Redeemer AME Church in Irvine and executive director of the Murray Center.\n\n\"I think the Rev. Murray has a deep passion and compassion for people,\" Whitlock says.\n\nMurray sees more recent examples of dreams deferred, from Occupy Wall Street to the Arab Spring.\n\n\"The 99 percent are rebelling against the 1 percent,\" he says. \"It's a difficult lesson to learn, because as Lord Acton says, power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\"\n\nMurray recently sat on a blue-ribbon commission investigating jail violence at the Los Angeles County Jail. The commission found a \"persistent pattern of unreasonable force.\"\n\n\"There has to be monitoring of power,\" Murray says during the interview at his center. \"You have to have surveillance, monitoring, disciplinary rules, and you have to insist on the execution of these rules.\"\n\nMurray has been training for a job like this all his life. He grew up in Florida and has been married to his wife, Bernadine, for 54 years. The couple has one child, Drew, also a reverend. Murray's mother died at a young age, and his father worked as a school principal. People said that the young Cecil, who had the same leadership qualities as his father, was a regular chip off the old block, hence the nickname.\n\nEarly on, Murray understood the importance of education and attended Florida A&M College (now university) in Tallahassee, where he majored in history. He repaid his $1,600 scholarship by enlisting in the Air Force.\n\nIt took a harrowing personal experience to turn him to the ministry. Though he had an interest in the ministry at an early age, an episode in the Air Force called Murray to service. As he tells the story in his memoir \"Twice Tested by Fire,\" during a failed takeoff attempt, the cockpit filled with flames, and he heard a voice telling him to use the escape hatch in the rear of the plane. Murray survived, eventually retired from the Air Force and entered the seminary.\n\nMurray enrolled in the Claremont School of Theology. After he completed his education, his first pastoral assignment from the African Methodist Episcopal Church landed him in Pomona. That was followed by stints in Kansas City, Kan.; Seattle; and finally Los Angeles in 1977.\n\n\"I looked at pastors who were primarily for themselves instead of for the people, and I thought that they should be working to lift their communities and their people and not themselves,\" Murray says. \"So I shifted from being the critic to being the participant.\"\n\nHe works from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the center, followed by additional duties such as prison or hospital visits. Though he is at an age when most would retire, Murray continues his mission. He exercises five days a week and ends his days by reading and watching the occasional basketball or football game.\n\n\"We're going to keep growing and keep the dream going,\" Murray says, \"and the rest is up to the boss.\"\n\nThis story originally appeared in the California Health Report magazine's Winter 2012/2013 issue. Read the rest of the magazine here.\n\nCamila de La Llata is in need of a marrow transplant to cure acute leukemia.\n\nBy Melissa Flores\nCalifornia Health Report\n\nThere are 10 million potential donors registered in the United States for the 10,000 patients who annually are in need of a marrow transplant, but some patients have a harder time than others finding a donor.\n\nCamila de la Llata, of Monterey, is one of 820 patients in need of marrow transplants in California. She's Hispanic and White, and because of her mixed ethnic background, she may have a difficult time finding a donor.\n\nHer doctors have said chemotherapy will not cure her or keep her leukemia in remission so they are rushing to find a match.\n\nSeventy percent of patients with leukemia, blood cancers or other blood disorders for which a marrow transplant is the only treatment, like de la Llata, do not have a match in their own family.\n\n\"Tissue type is inherited,\" said Kimberly Nall, an account executive with Be The Match in Northern California, a nationwide registry for marrow donors. \"We are more likely to find a match in one's own ethnic or racial heritage.\"\n\nNationwide, only 10 percent of potential donors are of Hispanic or Latino heritage. Only 4 percent are of multiple race. The vast majority of registered donors are white, making up 71 percent of registered donors.\n\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Natives make up 1 percent of the registry; African American or Black 7 percent; Asian 7 percent; and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander .2 percent.\n\nIn December, community members organized a marrow registry drive at Salinas Valley Memorial Hospital in hopes of finding a match for de la Llata.\n\nNall said the biggest challenge for Be the Match in increasing minority donors on the registry is dispelling myths about what is entailed in being a donor.\n\n\"Some people have a misunderstanding about the process and some are hesitant to give out personal information,\" she said. \"We ask for contact information and personal identifying information, such as a social security number or driver license.\"\n\nShe said that those who register to be a donor do not have to provide the social security number and driver license, but it helps to locate donors if they do come up as a match with a patient. There is one registry for marrow donors in the United States and people remain on the registry until they are 61.\n\n\"What it was to donate marrow is very different,\" Nall said, than donating 20 years ago.\n\nShe said 76 percent of the time, a patient's doctor requests a non-surgical, outpatient procedure that is similar to donating platelets or plasma, which requires an IV. In the other 24 percent of cases, donors undergo a surgical, outpatient procedure that requires general or local anesthesia.\n\nThe nonprofit has been making efforts to increase the number of minority donors that are registered, including outreach to Hispanic and African American communities. Some has been done on a national level, such as working with celebrities such as Robin Roberts and Shaquille O'Neal.\n\nBut more often they work on a local level by conducting donor drives such as the one for de la Llata, with churches, community groups or minority student groups.\n\n\"We've found really me as a staff person showing up in the community does nothing,\" Nall said. \"Every drive we do has to have someone in the community tied to the cause.\"\n\nThe December drive in Salinas focused on de la Llata. She was enrolled at California State University, Fullerton, where she was majoring in theater education and directing when she was diagnosed with acute leukemia. She is an exhibition Latin and ballroom dancer and choreographer.\n\nA webpage in honor of de la Llata has raised more than $8,000.\n\nBe the Match will host its second annual Be the Match Walk/Run in San Jose in April 6 as a fundraiser and to raise awareness.\n\nFormer president Bill Clinton speaks at the Health Matters Conference in La Quinta.\n\nBy Suzanne Potter\nCalifornia Health Report\n\nGary Mendell choked back the emotion as he stood before the crowd at the Clinton Health Matters Conference, held recently in La Quinta, California. He told the story of his 25-year-old son, Brian, who hung himself after years of battling ADD and drug addiction. \"I wish I could tell you that the anguish dulls with time. But it doesn't. Knowing that my son died of a disease that is preventable but we don't prevent it. It's treatable but we don't treat.\"\n\nMendell is now fighting in Brian's honor – and announced the formation of a new national nonprofit to improve prevention and treatment of addiction. His commitment was one of 31 pledges made at the conference – aimed at getting individuals and communities to take action to improve health and bring down costs.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Former President Bill Clinton said his foundation has worked with dozens of companies and non-profits to make best-practices a reality. \"Today there will be pledges that amount to 100 million dollars that will help more than 25 million people across America.\"\n\nActress and singer Barbra Streisand announced a two million dollar donation to the Barbra Streisand Women's Heart Center at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Walmart is rolling out a program to put a \"healthier choice\" icon on certain foods and they are working with suppliers to eliminate trans fats and cut excess sugar and sodium in packaged foods.\n\nHealth insurance giant Humana is launching a program called Humana Vitality that rewards people for losing weight, getting active and eating better.\n\nGeneral Electric is putting six million dollars into a \"Healthymagination\" private/public health program that gives people online tools to improve their health. GE has also pledged to take nationwide a program that they started in Cincinnati, Ohio. There, GE worked with hospitals, nonprofits and government to improve coordination in patient care and encourage hospitals to publish what they charge for various procedures. GE says the program has already saved the region 200 million in emergency room costs over the past two years.\n\nTenet Healthcare, which owns Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs and JFK Hospital in Indio, is hiring more case workers to follow-up with patients after they are discharged, in an effort to keep them from being readmitted.\n\nOne overarching theme emerged again and again: regular people have the power to fix most of what ails the health-care system – and the economy – just by embracing a healthier lifestyle.\n\nFormer President Clinton opened the conference with a warning about obesity, heart disease and diabetes, \"About 70 percent of adults have already developed a preventable chronic disease which contributes to rising health care costs and reduces workplace productivity and (leads to) premature death. He cited a Columbia University study that found the cost of treating preventable diseases will rise by $48-66 billion a year if current trends continue.\n\nDr. Donald Berwick, former Administrator for Medicare and Medicaid, said genetics determine 50 percent of a person's overall health. Health care (or lack thereof) is only 10 percent, and a person's lifestyle makes up the rest.\n\n\"Forty percent of our health depends on our choices: What we eat, how much we walk, the risks we take, the substance abuse, the unprotected sex, the guns and violence in our streets, the pollutants in our air, the seatbelts and and bike helmets that we use or don't use,\" Berwick said. \"That is very good news. That means that we can do wrong and what we do well largely into our own hands.\"\n\nRenowned heart health expert Dr. Dean Ornish said three-quarters of U.S. health-care costs are related to chronic disease. Ornish said he's pleased that Medicare now covers his nutrition program and emphasized the benefits of a better diet and more exercise. \"These approaches can not only help combat most chronic diseases but it can actually reverse them,\" Ornish said. \"They can even turn on good genes that protect us, and turn off harmful genes.\"\n\nOrnish added, \"We need to address the more fundamental causes of why people get sick. We will find that we can have better healthcare available for more people for lower costs.\"\n\nPresident Clinton said that we need to give people incentives to make healthier choices rather than continuing to pound home the message that overeating, a sedentary lifestyle, drugs and smoking can kill. \"We have to create positive incentives,\" Clinton said, \"not just threats about death or injury.\"\n\nThe discussion also centered on improving transparency in medical care while protecting privacy. President Clinton lauded a unique law in Pennsylvania that requires hospitals to make public the prices they charge for various procedures and their success rates. Dr. Berwick called for a similar, national database and said that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) gives the government the authority to set it up, but Congress needs to mandate that Medicaid participate.\n\nThe experts also lamented the massive shortage of primary care doctors. They suggested that the health care system be overhauled to make careers in family practice more attractive to medical students.\n\nDr. Ornish suggested a new approach, where multiple specialists treat patients as a team. \"The managed care approach … is forcing doctors to see more patients, in less time for less income, driving the best doctors out of medicine. We can create a new paradigm which is based on the quality of care and not just more care.\"\n\nDr. Berwick agreed that the current system encourages hospitals to over-treat patients. \"They've been conditioned by decades by a broken volume-based healthcare payment system to maintain business plans that depend on doing more, not less.\" He says the ACA is a step in the right direction. \"There are new emphases on payment for chronic care, coordination and outcomes.\"\n\nTechnology also figured in plans to improve health care outcomes.\n\nDr. Peter Tippett, chief medical officer and vice president of Verizon's Innovation Incubator vowed to facilitate health care transformation with technology and mobile apps. For example, Verizon now makes a watch that works like On-Star – you push a button and it makes a call to a relative or to emergency services. The watch also has a GPS tracking device that helps find wandering Alzheimer's patients. And it can measure an elderly person's movements and send a message to family if he or she doesn't move for an extended period of time and may have fallen.\n\nABC News Medical Director Dr. Nancy Snyderman challenged the group to help more seniors age in place – and be monitored in their homes so they spend less time in expensive hospitals and nursing homes. GE announced a joint venture with Intel to offer remote patient monitoring, so doctors can check on a patient without an office visit. GE is also working on a refrigerator that can dispense medicine in the correct amounts.\n\nMany experts also called for hospitals, insurance companies and government agencies to make databases compatible. Tippett lamented, \"Almost no sharing actually happens. If we could get health information technology in healthcare to be similar to what they use in banking, everybody would be dramatically healthier…700 billion dollars in savings are available if we could only leverage the kind of information that we already have in meaningful ways.\"\n\nBerwick noted that seniors in private Medicare programs get information every month on what drugs they take and what it costs. \"When they know that, they are incredible buyers and seekers of value.\nThe broader we get that idea (of transparency) in the system the more powerful it's going to be. \"\n\nThe first Health Matters conference led to the creation of the Clinton Health Matters Initiative, which is a seven year effort to improve health in two regions: Little Rock, Arkansas and the Coachella Valley.\nThe Coachella Valley, which became a part of the Health Matters Initiative late last year, is already implementing plans to improve health.\n\nCarolyn Caldwell, CEO of Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs said the hospital is revamping their cafeteria food to offer more healthy choices. The medical center is also partnering with the city of Palm Springs on a $25,000 fundraiser for the Clinton Health Matters Initiative, Caldwell said.\n\nThe Desert Healthcare Foundation (DHF) has funded a new manager to work with all three local school districts to combat childhood obesity. DHF Vice President Kay Hazen said, \"The realization that we were raising a generation of XL children and our kids were becoming the first generation who might not live as long as their parents spurred us into action.\"\n\nA panel of local leaders also discussed ways to optimize the environment to encourage people to exercise more and develop stronger social ties. That involves cleaning up graffiti, building more sidewalks and parks, and helping people form walking groups and neighborhood watch programs with social networks. The City of Coachella has incorporated health concerns into its general plan, so any future development will include more space for recreation.\n\nIn December the CHMI gathered local leaders to write a blueprint for further action in the Coachella Valley. The plan will be released in early February.\nNote.

The preschool is participating in the Virtual Dental Home Demonstration Project.\n\nBy Lynn Graebner\nCalifornia Health Report\n\nThree-year old Christopher Chacon got his teeth cleaned, treated with fluoride and x-rayed in a corner of the administrative office at Magnolia Head Start Pre-School in Palo Alto.\n\nMany children at the preschool may have a dentist, but they don't go regularly. They show up when they have pain, said registered dental hygienist Ushma Patel. So she and dental assistant Leslie Estrada go to them to offer and encourage preventative care.\n\nThey visit six sites in the county and sometimes treat more than half the class.\n\nPatel works for Ravenswood Family Dentistry, which serves low-income and uninsured residents in San Mateo County, and is one of 11 organizations taking part in a telehealth initiative called the Virtual Dental Home Demonstration Project.\n\nThe project provides dental care to more than 2,000 people in California, including low-income children at school, people with disabilities and elderly people at residential care facilities.\n\nThe Pacific Center for Special Care, part of the University of the Pacific's school of dentistry in San Francisco, operates the project. They hope to eventually improve oral health for underserved people nationally.\n\nThe project is giving dental care their clients would not otherwise get, said Dr. Paul Glassman, director of the Pacific Center for Special Care and a professor of dental practice at UOP.\n\nRegistered dental hygienists and registered dental assistants go into schools, nursing homes and residential facilities for people with disabilities. They bring portable imaging equipment for x-rays and photographs, supplies to do temporary fillings and an internet-based dental record system. They upload images and dental and medical histories to a website where a dentist reviews them and creates a treatment plan or refers patients requiring more complex treatment to a dentist.\n\nYogita Thakur, Dental Director at Ravenswood, sees education as one of the major goals of the project.\n\n\"Perceived need is the number one reason people seek care or don't seek care,\" she said. If people believe dental caries is preventable, they will seek preventative care, if they think they'll get cavities no matter what, they won't seek care, she said. \"It's about educating the parents.\"\n\nCarmella Gutierrez, President of Californians for Patient Care, noted that more than a quarter of children ages two through five and half of children ages 12 to15 have had tooth decay, which can be linked to poor digestion and heart and respiratory disease.\n\n\"Having dental care is linked to overall health,\" she said.\n\nThe CDC reports that tooth decay affects children in the U.S. more than any other chronic infectious disease. Yet in 2011, only 27 percent of children eligible for Medi-Cal received dental care, down from 34 percent in 2009. Those figures come from California Medicaid Management Information Services and are cited by Glassman and others in the July 2012 issue of the California Dental Association Journal.\n\nThe goal of the project is to show that hygienists and their assistants can keep many people healthy by providing education, assessments of dental disease risk, cleanings, fluoride varnishes and dental sealants.\n\nResults from the project sites so far show that about 50 percent of participating patients can be kept healthy by a dental hygienist. The other half are being referred to dentists for more complex treatment, Glassman said.\n\n\"I think it's a tremendous advance,\" Glassman said. \"You're talking about a population that doesn't get dental care.\"\n\nEven if all the research points to the prudency of moving virtual dental homes into mainstream dentistry, many challenges remain, Glassman said. The way we pay for dental care and the laws governing telehealth are designed for our current system, which pays for procedures and dental visits.\n\n\"Making the population healthier is not what our current compensation systems are based on,\" he said.\n\nThat's the next phase of the Virtual Dental Home Demonstration Project. In the next couple of months Glassman anticipates potential funding for designing a health outcomes-based payment system that the Medicaid program could use. Dental providers would be compensated based on the health of their patients, not the number of procedures they perform.\n\nGlassman said the main goal of the project is the same as the overall healthcare reform movement in the U.S.: better patient experiences, better health and lower costs."

      "text": "desalination of\n\nwater, desalination of, process of removing soluble salts from water to render it suitable for drinking, irrigation, or industrial uses. The principal methods used for desalination include distillation (or evaporation), electrodialysis, freezing, ion exchange, and reverse osmosis.\n\nIn distillation saltwater is heated in one container to make the water evaporate, leaving the salt behind. The desalinated vapor is then condensed to form water in a separate container. Although long known, distillation has found limited application in water supply because of the fuel costs involved in converting saltwater to vapor. Representative of the early attempts in this direction were the solar distillation methods employed (c.49 B.C.) by the legions of Julius Caesar for using water from the Mediterranean. Modern technological advances led to the development of more efficient distillation units using solar energy; however, since these units have small capacities, their utility is restricted.\n\nDistillation plants having high capacities and using combustible fuels employ various devices to conserve heat. In the most common system a vacuum is applied to reduce the boiling point of the water, or a spray or thin film of water is exposed to high heat, causing flash evaporation; the water is flashed repeatedly, yielding fresh distilled water. This multistage flash distillation method is used in more than 2,000 desalination plants, including one in Saudi Arabia that produces 250 million gallons of freshwater per day.\n\nAnother method of desalination is by electrodialysis. When salt dissolves in water, it splits up into charged particles called ions. Placed in a container with a negative electrode at one end and a positive electrode at the other, the ions are filtered by the membranes as they are attracted toward the electrodes; they become trapped between semipermeable membranes, leaving outside the membranes a supply of desalinated water that can be tapped. The first large installation using this process began operating in South Africa in 1958, but its electrical demands make it impractical except where such energy is abundant.\n\nBy far the most promising approach is the reverse osmosis process, in which pressure is applied to saltwater to force it through a special membrane. Only pure water passes, leaving concentrated seawater behind. Where multistage flash distillation costs about $4 per 1,000 gallons, reverse osmosis costs about half that amount. This process is used by a plant in the Tampa Bay area, Florida, that produces 25 million gallons of drinking water a day. Another type uses an empty hollow sphere of semipermeable material that is lowered into the sea. The water flowing into the sphere is fresh, since the salt is excluded by the membrane that covers the entire sphere and is its guard.\n\nOne final approach is under development in Hawaii, where different layers of seawater display a large temperature differential. Here an Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion plant is being built which will use steam produced by the flash method to produce energy, then condense the steam into freshwater. Three such plants could produce a hundred megawatts of power, as well as supply 30% of Hawaii's water needs.\n\nFor emergency use, i.e., in lifeboats, various systems are available in addition to solar or fuel-heated distillation devices. One device made of flexible plastic is worn around the waist of the user to employ body heat for evaporation.\n\nQatar is a peninsula in the east of Arabia, bordering the Persian Gulf and Saudi Arabia, in a strategic location near major petroleum deposits. Qatar occupies 11,437 square kilometers on a peninsula that extends approximately 160 kilometers north into the Persian Gulf from the Arabian Peninsula. Varying in width between fifty-five and ninety kilometers, the land is mainly flat (the highest point is 103 meters) and rocky. Notable features include coastal salt pans, elevated limestone formations (the Dukhan anticline) along the west coast under which lies the Dukhan oil field, and massive sand dunes surrounding Khawr al Udayd, an inlet of the gulf in the southeast known to local English speakers as the Inland Sea. Of the islands belonging to Qatar, Halul is the most important. Lying about ninety kilometers east of Doha, it serves as a storage area and loading terminal for oil from the surrounding offshore fields. Hawar and the adjacent islands immediately off the west coast are the subject of a territorial dispute between Qatar and Bahrain.\n\nThe capital, Doha, is located on the central east coast on a sweeping (if shallow) harbor. Other ports include Umm Said, Al Khawr, and Al Wakrah. Only Doha and Umm Said are capable of handling commercial shipping, although a large port and a terminal for loading natural gas are planned at Ras Laffan, north of Al Khawr. Coral reefs and shallow coastal waters make navigation difficult in areas where channels have not been dredged.\n\nQatar shares its land border with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), with which in 1993 it continued to have a dispute in the Khawr al Udayd area. The boundary with Saudi Arabia was settled in 1965 but never demarcated. Qatar's northwest coast is fewer than thirty kilometers from Bahrain.\n\nDoha is the capital of the country and the major administrative, commercial, and population center. In 1993 it was linked to other towns and development sites by a system of about 1,000 kilometers of paved roads. Doha's international airport has an approximately 4,500-meter main runway, capable of receiving all kinds of aircraft.\n\nClimate\n\nThe long summer (May through September) is characterized by intense heat and alternating dryness and humidity, with temperatures exceeding 55° C. Temperatures are moderate from November through May, although winter temperatures may fall to 17° C, which is relatively cool for the latitude. Rainfall is negligible, averaging 100 millimeters per year, confined to the winter months, and falling in brief, sometimes heavy storms that often flood the small ravines and the usually dry wadis. Sudden, violent dust storms occasionally descend on the peninsula, blotting out the sun, causing wind damage, and momentarily disrupting transport and other services.\n\nThe scarcity of rainfall and the limited underground water, most of which has such a high mineral content that it is unsuitable for drinking or irrigation, restricted the population and the extent of agricultural and industrial development the country could support until desalination projects began. Although water continues to be provided from underground sources, most is obtained by desalination of seawater.\n\nVegetation zones\n\nAlthough most of the country consists of sanddeserts, a small part of the country houses different vegetation zones, where trees, reeds and shrubs like tamarind, phragmites, and mace can grow. These regions are mostly to the east, near the coast."

Canada abstained from the vote, unlike voting against it in 2002.\n\"We've eliminated them from four of our major cafeterias and we're well into the process of eliminating them from all vending machines,\" said UTM principal Deep Saini, noting that when students were polled back in March, 85 per cent of respondents supported the ban.\n\"Our tap water is as good or better than what is served in bottles,\" said Saini, adding water is like air, a free commodity that should be available to all Canadians, not just those who can afford bottles.\nRasmussen said her group started with just eight students, and then partnered with the University of Toronto Students' Union, including the UTM Students' Union, to mount enough pressure and get their way.\nThe University of Toronto Students' Union represents 45,000 full-time undergraduate students at all three campuses.\n\"All that pressure on the administration has been really successful,\" said Clara Ho, university affairs vice president of the umbrella group.\nHo said it will take three years for a complete ban because the phase-out plan allows contracts for bottled water to end without renewal and alternative water fountains to be put in place.\n\"Tap water has been tested.

As a result, drinking water is a potentially significant route of exposure to hazardous substances. The presence of contaminants in water can lead to adverse health effects, including gastrointestinal illness, reproductive problems and neurological disorders.\n\nIn Oregon, about 88% percent of the population (3,151,979 of 3,583,027 residents) obtains their primary drinking water from a community water system. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) sets regulations for treating and monitoring drinking water delivered by community water systems for over 90 contaminants under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Typically, EPA establishes Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) standards that will protect the public's health. The primary means of preventing health problems due to contaminants in drinking water is to ensure that drinking water meets or exceeds these standards.\n\nState agencies, water suppliers, and water engineers work together to help to ensure that drinking water contamination levels are as low as possible by protecting water sources, treating drinking water to remove contaminants, and monitoring water quality to identify problems as quickly as possible. Ultimately, maintaining the highest quality drinking water depends on protecting our lakes, rivers and aquifers from contamination.\n\nAlthough community water systems in the U.S. provide among the highest quality drinking water in the world, some contaminants are present at low levels, and it is still possible that drinking water can become contaminated at higher levels. Contamination can come from both natural and man-made sources.\n\nThe Oregon EPHT program collects information about the levels of three contaminants in drinking water: nitrate, arsenic, and disinfection byproducts. These contaminants were selected because they have occurred more frequently in drinking water at levels which may be of public health significance.\n\nPrevious indicator initiatives have focused on public water system compliance at the national level, but few have examined using state-specific contaminant data to track trends and to integrate environmental information with health effect data for potential relationships between drinking water quality and human health. EPHT surveillance of drinking water aims to improve the availability of quality data, identify priority issues and contaminants, and develop surveillance measures that are consistent with national goals. Ultimately, tracking drinking water contaminants will help practitioners improve decisions that protect public health."

It contains a solid carbon block as well as activated carbon media.\n\nAre your machines the same as Kangen water?\n\nKangen is a brand name, it is not a type of water.\n\nIt is a myth to say that Kangen water is better than alkaline, ionized water, when in fact they are the very same thing.\n\nFact: The word \"Kangen\" in Japanese means \"return to origin\" and is\nsimply a marketing term. Our water ionizers contains a filter and\nionizing chamber just like all other alkaline water ionizers. Also our ionizers create the same type of alkaline and acidic water as\ncreated by all other water ionizers.\n\nWhat is the lifespan of the filter cartridges for the Water Ionizer?\n\n6000 liters or about 1 year of use. If you use a pre-filter, you can extend the life of the built in filter.\n\nHow does it connect to the water supply?\n\nIt is connected via a divertor valve, which is installed on the end of\nyour faucet aerator. This valve which has a lever allows you to use\nyour sink as usual when needed. When you would like to produce Alkaline\nor Acidic Water, simply turn on your faucet and turn the lever to\ndivert the water flow to the unit.\n\nYou can also connect using an under counter filter system or other connections if available.\n\nDoes it remove minerals from my water?\n\nNO. It keeps the valuable minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and\npotassium in the water. When the filtered water enters the electrolysis\nchamber, the negative electrodes attract the positive alkaline minerals\nto their compartment; while the positive electrodes attract the\nnegative acid minerals to theirs. So one stream has only alkaline\nminerals and the other only acid, at which point alkaline water flows\nout from the Ionizer's top outlet, and acid water from the drainage\noutlet.\n\nWhat are the size of the units?\n\napprox. 8.5 \" W X 13.5 \" H X 5.5 \" D\n\nWhat is the weight of the units?\n\n4.5 Kg empty 5Kg with water. approx. 11lbs.\n\nHow many pH setting does the unit have?\n\nNC-10 total 5, 2 acidic (3.5, 5.5) and 3 alkaline (7.5, 9.0, 10)\n\n#719 total 6 2acidic and 4 alkaline (has micro adjustments)\n\nnote: PH varies with water pressure and the PH of the tap water. Also you can adjust the PH to any value between 7.5 an 10\n\nHow many stages of filtration does the unit have?\n\n2 stages - Silver Activated Carbon Filter with a 6000 liter capacity\n\n#719 had 4 stages. 3 in pre-filter and 1 inside the machine.\n\nCan I run hot water through the unit?\n\nNot recommended. The recommended operating temperature of the unit is 41F- 95F\n\nHow much water does it produce?\n\nBetween 1.5L/min to 2.5L/min. This depends on the Flux or the volume of the water to the NC-10 and the desired PH of the water on the highest setting.\n\nHow long does it take to produce alkaline water?\n\nYou can produce alkaline water instantly and continuously. We\nrecommend using a slower flow rate because the longer the contact time\nin the filtration and electrolysis stage, the better.The flow rate is adjustable with the built in programing via the front panel.\n\nHow long does the alkaline ionized properties of the water last?\n\nIt can last up to 48 hours. You may also refrigerate the water.\n\nShould I use a special container?\n\nWe recommend a glass or low dense plastic container with a sealed lid.\n\nCan I leave it on all the time?\n\nYour Water Ionizer automatically turns on when water is run through it\nand automatically turns off when water stops running. If you are leaving home for an extended time, it is recommended to unplug the NC-10 to protect from surges or lightning.\n\nHow do I install Water Ionizer?\n\nInstallation is easy and takes only minutes. You need only a screwdriver -- comes with all the connections you will need.\n\nHow do I know when the filter needs replacing?\n\nThe NC-10 Water Ionizer utilizes two cartridges. The unit has a\ndigital LCD display which constantly shows both readings for each\nfilter cartridge. When the front panel indicator shows the filter time at 0, the cartridge needs replaced.\n\nWhat is Ionized water and how is it different from regular water?\n\nIonized water is split into two streams through a process called\nelectrolysis. One stream is alkaline water with a pH above 7.0 and the\nother stream is acidic water with a pH below 7.0. The alkaline water is\nmainly used for drinking. The acidic water is used for sanitizing and\ndisinfection, and has other uses such as an astringent for the skin.\n\nWhat benefits does Ionized water have in household uses?\n\nUse it for watering plants for optimum hydration and for more\nabsorption of nutrients (acidic vegetables such as tomatoes and\ntropical plants may prefer the acid water, while alkaline vegetables\nsuch as leafy greens may prefer the alkaline water - consult a garden\nspecialist for more information). The acidic water is anti-bacterial\nwhich makes it ideal for cleaning sensitive or acne skin. You can also\nuse the acidic water for disinfecting vegetables and surfaces\nparticularly where food is prepared and consumed. Give vegetables a\nquick rinse in alkaline water before cooking to enhance flavor.\n\nWhen I store alkaline ionized water in a bottle, it goes cloudy and deposits form. Why is this?\n\nThis is because the alkaline ionized water is rich in calcium minerals.\nIf there is a lot of CO 3 available in the water, it combines with\ncalcium to form CaCO 3 (calcium carbonate). This implies that the\nreducing (alkalizing) process has occurred. There is nothing wrong with\ndrinking the contents; however, you are advised to wash the container\nin citric acid with 1L of water to clean the container.\n\nWhat is the ORP (oxidative reduction potential) of the NC-10 Water Ionizer?\n\nThe NC-10 Water Ionizer succeeds in achieving a high electrolytic\nreduction power, also known as oxidative-reduction potential, or ORP.\nElectrolytic reduction is a measure of the ability to eliminate\nreactive oxygen - which is its anti-oxidant ability.\n\nWhy shouldn`t you use the alkaline water when taking medications.\n\nThe\nstomach has an acidic environment of 1.8 and medication is designed to\nwork at that pH. Therefore, the medication may be ineffective or cause\ncomplications if mixed with alkaline water. You can still use the\npurify selection on the machine.\n\nHow do I adjust the PH and ORP of the NC-10\n\nIn the user manual on page 17 are the instructions to change the PH and ORP of the NC-10. When you change the PH you also change the ORP, the 2 go together.\n\nStep by step instructions to raise 3 button to raise the PH. Each time you press the Alkaline 3 button, the PH will increase by aprox .1 PH. Press the Alkaline 3 button several times until you reach the PH you want for Alkaline 3.\n\nStep by step instructions to lower 2 button to lower the PH. Each time you press\nthe Alkaline 2 button, the PH will decrease by aprox .1 PH. Press the\nAlkaline 2 button several times until you reach the PH you want for\nAlkaline 3.\n\nWhat is the TDS range?\n\nThe TDS is Total Dissolved Solids. The factory default setting should be fine if you do not know the TDS of your tap water.\n\nThe FDA mandates the following disclaimer for all herbal remedies and alternative health information.\n\nAccording to the FDA, only approved drugs can carry the label \"cure\". Traditional or natural remedies\nand herbs are not considered by the FDA as being able to \"cure\" and are usually not evaluated by the FDA."

      "text": "Private Water Supplies\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn general terms, a private water supply is any water supply which is not provided by a water company. It is not a \"mains\" supply. About 1% of the population of England and Wales have private water supplies to their homes. Most private supplies are situated in the more remote, rural parts of the country. The source of the supply may be a well, borehole, spring, stream, river, lake or pond. The supply may serve just one property or several properties through a network of pipes.\n\nProblems associated with private supplies\n\nAll private water supplies can pose a threat to health unless they are properly protected and treated. They may become contaminated with bacteria, protozoa, parasites and viruses (micro-organisms) or other substances. Many of these are harmless, but, in the absence of appropriate treatment, some may cause serious illness or even death in vulnerable people. You may not be able to tell whether your water is safe as any contamination may not show by colour, taste or smell.\n\nWho could be affected\n\nYou, your family and visitors to your home or business all have a right to expect clean, safe drinking water. Many private water supplies meet the regulatory requirements in England, however, there a number of groups who may be at risk from microbiological contamination in a private water supply, including children, elderly people and people with a weakened immune system.\n\nProtecting your supply\n\nMake sure your supply is regularly checked, including the catchment area, and is not damaged to allow contamination. Defects should be corrected as soon as practical.\n\nSupplies from springs, wells or boreholes\n\nCheck that adequate protection is provided to stop surface water getting into your supply.\n\nSupplies from streams, rivers, lakes or ponds\n\nThe collection arrangement should include a settlement chamber to allow particles to settle out before the water flows into the supply. It is also advisable to include a sand or gravel filter after the settlement chamber to remove organic material and small animals. These filters may not remove all micro-organisms and will not remove chemical contamination. The collection chamber should be constructed to prevent the entry of any discharges from septic tanks or agricultural runoff.\n\nSupplies from farmland where animals graze or manure\n\nCheck that the farmer is aware of the drinking water supply and the need to avoid contaminating it by farming activity. Divert rain water run-off so it does not flow into your supply, this can be achieved by a small ditch allowing water to run away from the supply. Fencing should be used to stop animals from gaining access to collection point of the supply.\n\nSupply stored in a collection chamber or storage tank\n\nThese should have watertight and vermin proof walls and lids. Tops of chambers or tanks should be above ground level to prevent water from surrounding land flowing into them. Any overflow pipes or vents in chambers and tanks should be designed to stop animals and debris from entering them. The collection chamber should not be close to any soakaway or drain.\n\nIf you supply water to others\n\nIf you supply water to other people in the course of a business, you have a duty of care towards customers for the safety of water you supply. If you think the water is unsafe, you may have to: -\n\nAdvise the boiling of all water for drinking or food production.\n\nUse or suggest the use of bottled water.\n\nDo you need to have your supply checked?\n\nForest of Dean District Council monitors private water supplies; the frequency of the testing of supplies is dependent on the number of people using the supply. You should contact the Council if: -\n\nYou would like to have an additional test done.\n\nYou are the sole user of the supply, and would like your water tested.\n\nThe Council is likely to charge you for this service. Remember that the water test can only tell you about the quality of the water at the time of the test.\n\nShould your water fail the test\n\nIf your supply is, or may become, contaminated you should install treatment to the supply to ensure clean wholesome water. If your supply is contaminated with micro-organisms you should boil all water to be used for drinking and culinary purposes. Many forms of treatment are available; for information contact the Environmental Health department on 01594 810000 or email: environmental.health@fdean.gov.uk\n\nPrivate water supplies in the Forest of Dean\n\nAs from 1 January 2010, the Private Water Supplies Regulations 1991 have been revoked and replaced by the Private Water Supplies Regulations 2009. The major change is the requirement for a risk assessment to be undertaken for all commercial businesses supplied from a private water supply. To comply with the Private Water Supplies Regulations 2009, the Local Authority is required to carry out a risk assessment of each supply that supplies water to any premises (other than a supply to a single dwelling not used for any commercial activity) once every 5 years. This includes taking a sample from the tap normally used to supply water for human consumption. The risk assessment is to establish whether there is significant risk of supplying water that would constitute a potential danger to human health. Future sampling and parameters would then be based on the outcome of the risk assessment (low risk - less frequent sampling, high risk - more frequent sampling). The Local Authority is required to recover the costs of undertaking the risk assessment, sampling and analysis from the relevant person. This may result in an increased charge to your business. If you already have a written risk assessment covering the extraction of the supply to the final point, a copy can be sent to the Environmental Health team at the Council offices for our records. This may result in a reduction of the fees the Council may have to recover in the future.\n\nIf you are thinking of purchasing a property in the Forest of Dean, please be aware that properties within the following areas maybe on a private water supply: Areas potentially on a private water supply. Please contact the team for further information.\n\nResult analysis\n\nIt is useful to note that the continued use of a bacteriological contaminated supply by residents of a property can lead to a build-up of a natural resistance to infection and thus it would be unlikely for an incident of illness to be noticed as caused by a water supply. There is, however, a higher risk to any visitor or any member of the public who's immunology is suppressed.\n\nMains water in the Forest of Dean is supplied by Severn Trent Water and Welsh Water (Dwr Cymru) depending on your address. The public water companies are monitored by the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) which is part of DEFRA. For information, visit the relevant websites by going to the external link box below.\n\nFor more information about water supplies download the relevant document from the resource box below."

Can you advice on a tertiary treatment that will achieve these low levels? The current treatment plant is achieving BOD = 20 mg/l and TP = 2 mg/l. I thank you in advance.\n\nConsider filtration to remove BOD *if it is associated with particulate matter* You need to do a BOD test on the filtered effluent. If a lot of the BOD is soluble you will need to upgrade the biological treatment system.\n\nFor P you are going to need to look at chemical addition. Best place to dose that will depend upon your treatment system; best chemical depends upon local prices.\n\nOffhand, this requirement sounds suspiciously like reverse osmosis. BOD results in that range are relatively unreliable and the phosphorus results would probably require not only chemical additions, but solids separations and pH adjustments. Activated carbon might reduce the BOD concentration to your required limit but I would still bet on the RO.\n\nMy guess is that the municipality is planning to recycle the treated wastewater."

It may not be as clean at you think, and chances are, it's just as dirty as that community swimming pool you've been avoiding. On average, 35 million people get sick from dirty beach water every year!\n\nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, some 10 trillion gallons of untreated wastewater end up in public swimming areas every year. Where is all this waste coming from? According to a new report from the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC), untreated sewage and spillage from wastewater treatment plants, along with oil, trash, and fertilizers from yards and farm fields, and numerous other unknown sources are responsible for raising levels of illness-causing bacteria in beach water to unsafe levels.\n\nAccording to Rodale, the most common side effect of swimming dirty water is diarrhea, but dysentery, pinkeye, and a host of other illnesses are other possible symptoms.\n\nEvery year, NRDC rates 200 of the most popular U.S. beaches based on bacteria levels and local public agencies' responses to excessive levels (states receiving federal funds to maintain their beaches must test bacteria levels). They say the most polluted beaches in the U.S. are in the Great Lakes region, where more than 70 percent of all combined sewers in the United States are lurking. Find out how safe your beach is in NRDC's new searchable database of all 3,000 beaches the group analyzed.\n\nBe safe and smart on your beach vacations by following these recommendations NRDC:\n\n• Clean up after yourself and your pets to prevent garbage and dog waste from getting into the water.\n• If you're a boater, dispose of your sewage properly onshore.\n• Choose beaches that are next to open waters or away from urban areas. They typically pose less of a health risk than beaches in developed areas or in enclosed bays and harbors with little water circulation.\n• Look for pipes along the beach that drain stormwater runoff from the streets, and don't swim near them.\n• Avoid swimming in beach water that is cloudy or smells bad.\n• Avoid swimming for at least 24 hours after heavy rains, which can wash pollution into the water)."

We have been working to create a custom list of contaminants to test for based on our source, rainwater, and our goal of providing results to TDEC that may lead to revised regulations concerning the potability of rainwater in Tennessee. On December 6 we met with Tony Wilkerson from the Norris Water Commission, and he guided us on the proper methods for collecting the samples. We were instructed to wear gloves when collecting the samples that will be used to test for bacteria. Furthermore, Tony showed us how to remove the fixtures from the faucets we were collecting water from. Bacteria and other contaminants may collect inside fixtures like faucet aerators and the vacuum breakers found on hose bibs. These fixtures must be removed and the water must be allowed to run for several minutes before the sample can be taken.\n\nWe are testing water from 4 locations. The first location is untreated rainwater from the roof. Fortunately our first day of collecting coincided with a rain event, and we were able to collect roof water as it streamed out of the downspout.\n\nThe second location is the untreated rainwater that is stored in the cistern. We installed a valve to sample the water from this location.\n\nThe third location we sampled is the treated rainwater from the hose bib. Finally, we sampled the municipal water supply from the bathroom sink.\n\nThe samples were taken to the UT lab for this first round of monthly testing. However, we will also have analysis performed by a state certified drinking water lab on a seasonal basis. By the end of 2012 we will have a detailed report to submit to TDEC on our pre- and post-treatment rainwater quality findings. Hopefully this could lead to a new, sustainable water source for Tennesseans."

Although electronic magnets are produced, which used electricity, a natural magnate (made of an electromagnetic force produced due to the natural alignment of magnets)?\n\nWater hardness for instance, is when water accumulates some amount of minerals like calcium, sulphates and magnesium. When they dissolve in water, they cause hardness. Hardness is undesirable in water because it causes scales, which are the solid form of these minerals. Scale formations can cause problems in hot water conduits, and appliances using the hard water. Although hardness can be reduced using salt, the major drawback of using these salts is its cost and the need to always recharge the ion beads through which there is the exchange of ions between hardness minerals and salt minerals. Using magnetic force to reduce the hardness of water involves using an apparatus with a coil wrapped around a pipe through which the water passes. An electrical current is then passed through the coil which reduces the formation of scales and enables the provision of 'soft' water that is healthier than water that is softened using salts."

      "text": "Water Utility\n\nThe valves that isolate the water meter are considered part of the customer's plumbing. Per the Wauwatosa Code Chapter 13.04.370, all piping within the building must be supplied by the owner. If while operating these valves to replace or repair a water meter the valve is damaged (or more typically a small leak develops), it is the customer's responsibility to have the valve repaired or replaced. A valve that has not been exercised over a long period of time may develop a dripping type leak. In this situation, the customer should seek the help of a licensed plumber to make the repairs. If you have any questions related to the water piping and valve ownership or areas of responsibility, please contact the City of Wauwatosa's Water Superintendent at 414-479-8965, or you may visit the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin's website at \n\nYes. The Wauwatosa Water Utility is a wholesale customer of the Milwaukee Water Works. Milwaukee treats Lake Michigan water by passing it through multiple treatment process barriers that remove illness causing microorganisms and contaminants. The water is initially disinfected with ozone gas, a highly reactive gas that destroys microorganisms, controls taste and odor, and reduces byproducts from chlorine disinfection. Coagulation, settling, and filtration remove additional particles. A final disinfection ensures safe, high quality drinking water throughout the distribution system and at your faucets. In 2012 the Wauwatosa Water Utility submitted 673 water samples to the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene for bacterial analysis.\n\nThe best and most cost effective way to ensure safe water at the tap is to keep our source waters clean. You can help by refraining from flushing unused medications down the toilet or sink. Take advantage of household hazardous waste collection programs that accept pharmaceuticals. Contact the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District at (414) 225-2066 for information regarding their Medication Collection Dates.\n\nA water meter measures the amount of water used. In Wauwatosa, the Meter Reader from the Water Utility reads the meter on a quarterly schedule. The previous reading is subtracted from the current reading to determine the amount of water actually used. Consumption is measured in hundreds of cubic feet. For example, if a customer is billed a consumption of 25, this means the customer used 25 hundred cubic feet. To convert cubic feet to gallons, multiply the consumption by 748. In the above example, 25 hundred cubic feet equals 18,700 gallons.\n\nWe have a program to routinely test water meters on a rotating basis to make sure the meters are accurate. Of course, if your recorded water use changes suddenly for no obvious reason (more people in the home, away for a long trip, or heavy lawn watering), report this to your water supplier so it can be investigated. In most instances, when a water meter is wrong, it reads low.\n\nWisconsin Administrative Code PSC 185.34 provides the procedures for determining backbills, or refunds, for customers when there is a discrepancy between the base meter and ROM.\n\n(1) STOPPED ROM. A stopped ROM is defined as one that has recorded zero consumption during the last meter reading period. The consumption that was measured by the base meter and not recorded by the remote register shall be backbilled as current consumption. The usage backbilled as current consumption shall not exceed the customer's average usage per billing period based on the latest 12 months usage. Any amount greater than this usage shall be backbilled pursuant to sub paragraph (2).\n\n(2) STOPPED AND UNDER REGISTERING ROM. Unrecorded ROM consumption (base meter reading less ROM reading) resulting from sub paragraph (1) or an under registering ROM shall be prorated from the date of the last base meter reading. Pursuant to s. 196.635, Stats., the utility may backbill for prorated amounts associated with the last 24 months.\n\n(3) OVER REGISTERING ROM. A ROM over registration (ROM reading less base meter reading) shall be prorated from the date of the last base meter reading. The utility shall refund prorated amounts associated with the period since the meter was installed or last tested, not to exceed the last six years.\n\nThe PFP charge (also known as the hydrant rental charge) recovers the costs related to the capacity of the system available to fight fires within the municipality's water service area. These costs include a portion of the pumps, storage facilities, water mains, hydrants, and an estimated quantity of water used for this purpose.\n\nPrior to 1988, municipalities recovered the PFP charge through the tax levy. In 1988, legislation was enacted which gave the governing body of any city, village, or town the option of collecting the PFP charge through the tax levy, as a direct charge on general service water customers' bills, or as a combination of the two.\n\nThere are approximately 584 water systems in Wisconsin. About 60% of these utilities recover the PFP charge through the tax levy while the remaining water utilities recover at least some or all of this cost through direct charges placed on water utility bills.\n\nNot all drinking water contains lead. Where lead is present in pipes and in soldered connections, the lead may dissolve into the water while the water is not moving, generally overnight or at other thimes when the water supply is not used for several hours. The first water that comes from the faucet after long periods of nonuse may have lead in it.\n\nWhenever water has not been used for a long period of time, overnight or during the day if no one is home, let the cold water run from the faucet for two minutes before using any water for drinking or cooking (see NOTE below). Letting the water run for two minutes will not flush out all the lead that got into the water while it was sitting is your plumbing, but it will improve the situation greatly.\n\nNOTE: It is difficult to know how long it takes the fresh water from the street pipes to arrive at the faucet. The time needed varies depending on your specific location, water pressure, whether you live in a single-family home or an apartment, and so forth.\n\nThe reddish brown color is nontoxic, but it may stain clothing in the wash. The possible cause could be your home water pipes.\n\nDrinking water pipes, in the street, leading to your home, or in your home, may be rusting. Water causing this type of problem is called corrosive. If you are having trouble and your neighbors are not, then your own pipes or water heater probably are rusting. Letting the cold water faucet in your basement run a while will often clear the water. Save the water for plants. If your clothing is stained local grocery or hardware stores have a product called Iron Out which will help in removing the stain.\n\nWater you lawn for long periods a couple of times each week, rather than every day. This allows deep penetration of the water. An inch a week is a good rule of thumb.\n\nWater early in the morning to avoid excessive evaporation; it is usually less windy then and the water pressure is usually higher. Night watering may promote lawn disease. Use a sprinkler that makes large drops, because small drops evaporate faster. Watering your lawn with a hand-held hose is a waste of both your time and your water, although it might be okay for a small garden.\n\nA loss in pressure that can be detected by our customers or the Water Utility.\n\nVisual detection (water on the ground) by Water Utility employees who work in the field.\n\nThe Water Utility's Leak Survey Program.\n\nOnce a leak is suspected, its precise location is determined by Water Utility personnel who use sensitive acoustic listening devices to detect the sound of the water leaking underground. Repairing leaking pipes are important to a water supplier because of the potential of damages to other underground utilities and the potential of property damage. Leaking infrastructure wastes water and money.\n\nThe cloudy water could be caused by tiny air bubbles in the water similar to the gas bubbles in beer and carbonated soft drinks. After a while, the bubbles rise to the top and are gone. This type of cloudiness occurs more often in the winter, when the drinking water is cold.\n\nPayments for water bills must be received in the office of the City Treasurer on or before the due date of the bill. Utility customers may mail their payment using the return envelope included with the bill or pay in person with cash or check at the Treasurer's office located in City Hall. Their hours are 8:00 am to 4:30 pm, Monday through Friday. The City of Wauwatosa has a night depository that can be used for all payments when the Treasurer's office is closed. It is located at the south-west end of City Hall by the employee entrance. If payments are taken out of your account directly by your bank, please allow enough time for processing the payment by your bank to avoid any late payment charges. The City of Wauwatosa Water Utility is pleased to be able to offer you the convenience of making secured online payments. The Water Utility Online Payment Center is administered by FIS PayDirect. To use this service, a convenience fee will be assessed by FIS PayDirect at the time of payment based on the method of payment utilized. For E-checks, the convenience fee is a flat charge of $1.95.

Backflow happens when the flow of water into your home is reversed by a sudden drop in pressure or a pump causing backpressure.\n\nThe result of cross connection contamination is that chemicals, poisons and bacteria might find their way into the water you drink.\n\nHelp yourself, your family and your community by eliminating unprotected cross connections. Help the Lincoln Water System and your neighbors by filling out a Residential Plumbing Cross Connection Survey (142 K) form and returning it to LWS.\n\nWhat Goes Wrong?\n\nWater pressure can suddenly drop because of heavy usage, a fire in the area or a broken water main. When that happens, contaminated water could be siphoned back into your plumbing system from unprotected cross connections within your home. Even though Lincoln has a very reliable water distribution system, these pressure drops do occur somewhere in the city almost every day.\n\nWhat Is A Plumbing Cross Connection Control Program?\n\nThe Lincoln Water System is required by the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a cross connection control program using the specific components list below:\n\nA survey and inspection every five (5) years of each home and building connected to the public water supply. Inspections of the plumbing system by the property owner or tenant are required to determine if backflow hazards or cross connections exist.\n\nA public education program to inform water customers of the potential harm that plumbing cross connections can cause to the public water supply. Visit our website at lincoln.ne.gov (keyword: water).\n\nInstallation of backflow protection devices. Installing backflow protection on cross connections safeguards the public water supply.\n\nAnnual testing of backflow preventers. Testing backflow devices by a certified tester ensures proper operating and is required once each year.\n\nResidential Cross Connection Types\n\n1. Private Wells and Secondary Water Sources\n\nA well or secondary source of water on a property is a potential cross connection. Wells or secondary water sources are prohibited from being connected to the Lincoln Water System. A backflow preventer on the public water supply is always required when secondary sources of water are present on a customer's property.\n\n2. Lawn Irrigation Systems\n\nUnderground irrigation systems are a direct cross connection, and the public water supply must be protected with a suitable backflow device. Surface water can be siphoned back into your plumbing system through an automated lawn irrigation system unless a proper backflow device is attached. If the system uses a pump or has fertilizer or chemical injection, additional backflow protection and backflow testing is required.\n\n3. Swimming Pools or Hot Tubs\n\nPools and hot tubs that are permanently connected to the home plumbing system are direct cross connections and must be protected with a suitable backflow device. An unprotected cross connection could draw pool water and chemicals back into your household plumbing system and public water supply. When filling a pool or hot tub with a hose, never submerge the end as this is another cross connection. Always leave an air gap when filling pools, tubs, sinks or containers.\n\n4. Photo, Chemical, Biological, Veterinarian or Other Lab Facilities\n\nHome use of photographic chemicals, process chemicals, biological laboratory supplies, veterinarian supplies or other laboratory chemicals can cause contamination due to an unprotected cross connection. A suitable backflow device is necessary to protect the home plumbing system and public water supply.\n\n5. Boiler Systems for Heating\n\nThese systems are not common but do exist in some homes. Normally these systems are in larger homes. Water is used to replenish the boiler which also may have chemicals. This cross connection must be protected with a suitable backflow device to prevent contamination of the home plumbing system and public water supply.\n\n6. Home Medical, Dental or Dialysis Equipment\n\nSimilar to equipment found in medical offices, these devices are sometimes used in the home. When connected to the water supply, these cross connections must be protected with a suitable backflow device to prevent contamination of the home plumbing system and public water supply.\n\n7. Other Potential Cross Connections\n\nA garden hose submerged in a sink or connected to a container containing chemicals or fertilizer is a serious cross connection. A sudden drop in water pressure from a water main break or from water being used to fight a fire can siphon water back into your home plumbing system or the public water supply. A vacuum breaker is a simple inexpensive device that can be installed on the faucet or hose to prevent contamination. Vacuum breakers are provided on outside faucets on homes built since 1992.\n\nMost bathtubs and sinks have an air gap. This space between the highest water level in the fixture and the outlet of the water is the best form of backflow protection. Never leave the end of hose submerged in a tub, pool or container.\n\nBe Water-Wise About Plumbing Cross Connections\n\nThe Lincoln Water System delivers safe, high quality water to your home. The goal is to keep it that way.\n\nThat's why the Lincoln Water System has adopted a Plumbing Cross Connection Control Program. Its goal is to protect the public health -- yours and that of families throughout the city. That is also why the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services requires each water system to have a program. Lincoln Water System has conducted a plumbing cross connection control program with business and industry for over 30 years.\n\nIn addition, Lincoln's plumbing inspectors in the Building and Safety Department check all new building construction for proper protection. And Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department inspectors check restaurants and food preparation areas for cross connections.\n\nHelp Is Available\n\nOur Plumbing Cross Connection Control Program technicians or your plumber can tell you what type of backflow prevention devices you may need.\n\nHelp is as close as your telephone. Call 441-5912 during regular business hours, Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. or visit lincoln.ne.gov (keyword: backflow).\n\nEvery five (5) years, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services requires water utilities in Nebraska to survey customers to identify backflow hazards and plumbing cross connections that may exist in their homes. Water customers should report any of the cross connections listed in this brochure to the Lincoln Water System by completing a Residential Plumbing Cross Connection Survey (142 K) form."

There are many different forms of possible contamination, but among the most well-studied and problematic inorganic contaminants is arsenic. Arsenic is one of the oldest known carcinogens. In 1999, the US National Academy of Sciences reported that arsenic can cause bladder, lung and skin cancer, and possibly cause liver and kidney cancer. The physical symptoms of arsenic poisoning include: extreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting, partial paralysis, and reproductive damage.1 Arsenic is naturally occurring in water due to its abundance in certain types of rocks, but it can have anthropogenic origins as well.\n\nArsenic can be found all over the world, but is currently a particular problem in Third World countries due to the costly nature of water purification. It is especially abundant in Bangladesh, but arsenic has also been found in the ground water of Argentina, Chile, India, Mexico, Taiwan and Thailand. Additionally, closer to home, most states in the western US have levels of arsenic concentrations of greater than 10 parts per billion (10 ppb). This was not a cause for concern until the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2006 lowered the maximum allowable level of arsenic from 50 ppb to 10 ppb. In 2001, approximately 13 million Americans were drinking water that had elevated levels of arsenic in the water.2\n\nPrevious methods for arsenic removal have included: manganese greensand columns that have been pretreated with dilute acid, coagulation/microfiltration, iron oxide based filtration, and activated alumina. The \"Arsenic Removal Using Bottom Ash\" or \"ARUBA\" method, invented by Ashok Gadgil of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, involves coating the surface of the contaminants with bottom ash and ferric hydroxide. Bottom ash is sterile waste material from coal-fired power plants which would make the cost of remediation about 0.5 cents per kg ARUBA of which generally 4-5 grams of ARUBA is needed for 1 liter of water, initially containing 400 ppb arsenic.\n\nNanomagnetite synthesis for arsenic removal has been hailed as Forbes: 'Top 5 Nanotech Breakthroughs of 2006' and Esquire listed it as 'Six Ideas That Will Change the World' in 2007. Basically, the technique entails forming iron oxide nanocrystals that possess very unique and size-dependent characteristics for environmental remediation of arsenic contaminated water.\n\nIntroduction\n\nFigure 2\n\nBoth iron oxide nanocrystals: Fe3O4 (magnetite) and Fe2O3 (maghemite, as it is a cross between MAGnetite and HEMatite) are ferrimagnetic materials which means they can behave as permanent magnets. Additionally, those oxides below 10 nanometers in diameter, exhibit superparamagnetic properties and are used as MRI contrast agents.\n\nRemember that last semester, you prepared a solution of magnetite ferrofluid by mixing iron(II) chloride and iron(III) chloride in the presence of tetramethylammonium hydroxide.\n\nMagnetite is the most magnetic of all the naturally occurring minerals on Earth and has shown a lot of promise in environmental remediation as it efficiently removes As(III) and As(V) from water, this efficiency of the removal increases ~200 times when the magnetite particle size decreases from 300 to 12 nm. Since arsenic contaminated drinking water is a major problem around the world, using magnetite as a sorbent shows a great deal of promise.\n\nAdditionally, Fe(II) compounds have been used to oxidize organic contaminants such as trichloroethylene (TCE), while inorganic contaminants such as arsenic, lead and uranium are separated out of solution. Between 10 and 20 nanometers, the contaminants can be removed from water via handheld magnets, which is an important consideration in purifying water in the Third World, where power is not a standard commodity.\n\nWe will produce nanocrystalline and functional iron oxides following a green approach by using everyday items and equipment found in kitchens worldwide. The nanocrystalline and functional oxides are produced by thermal decomposition of the iron-precursors in order to form highly uniform, isolatable nanocrystals of tunable size. The iron precursors will decompose into iron oxides in organic solvents (thermally stable non-polar solvents, aka fatty acids such as oleic acid) at temperatures in excess of 200ºC; the presence of amphiphilic stabilizers, in this case fatty acids derived from soap, limits the growth of crystalline products which are either magnetite, maghemite, or mixtures of both phases.\n\nThe beauty of this method lies in the ability to use inexpensive iron sources, such as rust, to form iron carboxylate intermediates, that when scaled to the gram level effectively produces a relatively low cost method for removal of arsenic from contaminated water (see Table 1).\n\nRust is a mixture of iron hydroxides, oxides, and in some cases even zero-valent iron, but is as effective as FeOOH used in any laboratory method. The fatty acid used in conventional methods is oleic acid, an unsaturated 18 carbon fatty acid. It can be replaced by many cooking oils that can be processed to create a homemade soap through saponification, by the addition of a base such as lye. The soap is allowed to cure for a few days and then dissolved in a weak acid, such as vinegar. The organic layer of the liquid can be collected and used without further processing. The \"fatty acid mixture\" or FAM is an impure fatty acid whose exact composition depends on the starting edible oil. Olive oil contains the most oleic acid; coconut oils contain more lineolic acid. For this lab, the FAM is derived from vegetable oil, a standard starting reactant.\n\nTable 1\n\nPure lab chemicals\n\nEveryday chemicals\n\nChemical\n\nPrice per kg\n\nChemical\n\nPrice per kg\n\nFeOOH\n\n$ 778.00\n\nRust\n\n$ 0.20*\n\nOleic acid\n\n$ 20.60\n\nEdible oil (coconut oil)\n\n$ 0.25\n\n1-octadecene\n\n$ 24.75\n\nCrystal drain opener (NaOH)\n\n$ 1.24\n\nVinegar\n\n$ 0.65\n\nMagnetite Nanocrystals\n\n$ 2,624.00\n\nMagnetite Nanocrystals\n\n$ 21.7\n\nTable 1.

While still warm pour it into the liquid oil.\n\nStir with a spoon (or a magnetic stir bar) for about 15 minutes (or until tracing occurs – tracing is the visible tracks of stirring).\n\nLet it sit open to air in a hood (or ventilated area) to dry and cure for a few weeks. If a shorter time span is allotted, the soap can be dried in an oven. To help the drying process, the excess oil can be decanted after 48 hours. Use caution when decanting the soap as there may be excess unreacted NaOH present.\n\nPart 2: Oleic acid from soap with commercial vinegar\n\nGrate the soap given to you and weigh it. You should have approximately 30 grams. If you have extra soap, do not discard it; give it back to your TA.\n\nCheck the vinegar's acidity (i.e. 5%).\n\nUse 1 mL of acid for every gram of soap (i.e. 30 mL of acid, 600 mL of commercial vinegar with 5% acidity).\n\nCombine the vinegar and soap in a cooking pot.\n\nHeat on med-high and stir with a wooden spoon until all of the chunks are dissolved (light boiling is preferred). – This takes 15 to 30 minutes.\n\nCaution!! This must be done a hood or other well-ventilated area!!\n\nTurn off the heating and cool the solution down.\n\nPour your solution into the 1L beaker provided. You should see two layers separating from each other.\n\nSeparate the top yellowish layer using a turkey baster or plastic pipette into a 50 mL beaker. Make sure you get as much of the organic layer that as you can out of the vinegar/acid mixture.\n\nSeparate the organic layer off again into another 50 mL beaker so that you are left with only the organic layer. This is your fatty acid mixture (FAM)\n\nThoroughly clean your cooking pot in the sink with soap and water.\n\nPart 3: Magnetite nanocrystals from rust and fatty acids\n\nCarefully measure 0.5 grams of rust. Do not discard excess rust; put it back in the stock container.\n\nMix the rust with the fatty acid mixture in the cooking pot.\n\nCover the top of the container with a loose cap for proper ventilation. The reaction smokes and steams. This method produces 50-90 nm nanocrystals.\n\nStart heating and timing. The rust should be heated for roughly 1 hour, until the solution is dark black with little or no smoking. Remember to continue stirring at regular intervals. Do not heat the oil to the point of popping and spattering. Adjust the heat as necessary so that the solution only steams and smokes.\n\nCaution!! This must be done a hood or other well-ventilated area!!\n\nIf your rust solution looks like it might dry out, notify your TA immediately and they will provide you with extra oleic acid to complete your reaction. DO NOT LET YOUR RUST DRY ONTO THE FRYING PAN!!!!!!!\n\nOnce the rust solution appears dark black and little to no smoke is being produced, pour the nanorust solution into a 50 mL beaker.\n\nHold a magnet to the side of the beaker and observe what happens. Hold the magnet to the beaker for several minutes.\n\nClean the cooking pot thoroughly again with soap and water. If there is any black or burnt crusting, this needs to be scrubbed away.\n\nFootnotes\n\nNational Research Council.Arsenic in drinking water. Washington, DC, National Academy Press, 1999"

      "text": "Friday, January 18, 2008\n\nIf you are pregnant, nursing, or thinking about becoming pregnant, then you really might want to consider getting a bottled water home cooler installed in your home.\n\nWhile local drinking water is regulated, outbreaks of contamination do still occur. And there are many people that claim that some of the chemicals that are added to our drinking water in order to lower bacteria levels are not safe for pregnant and nursing women.\n\nBut what is really frightening is the possibility of arsenic in your tap water.\n\nHealth officials across the country are increasingly warning pregnant women to avoid drinking tap water in order to reduce the risk of miscarriage. That's because toxins are increasingly being reported both in municipally monitored supplies and unregulated private wells.\n\nThe fact that chemical warnings for tap water have never been issued nationwide by federal agencies is rather disturbing.\n\nArsenic is quite toxic, and is deadly to all humans when consumed in high quantities. But it is particularly dangerous for pregnant women to ingest it because it can actually alter the genes of a fetus. This alteration can result in an increased risk of disease, like cancer, for the infant later in life.\n\nIf you are pregnant, why take a chance on tap water when you have so much at stake? You have enough to worry about without having to worry whether or not the water you are drinking is poisoning you and your child.\n\nHave a bottled water home cooler installed and rest a little easier knowing that the water you are drinking isn't going to harm your baby.

They all love them too.\n\nHere are the top 5 reasons why you should get one in your home:\n\nBottled water tastes SO much better than tap water!\n\nBottled water is cleaner and safer (no chemicals) than tap water!\n\nConvenience--bottled water home coolers are delivered to your door so you never have to lug those heavy jugs or cases of water home from the store!\n\nYou will have more space in your fridge without all of those water bottles and jugs!\n\nYou will be healthier because you will drink more water because it tastes so good and it's always conveniently cold!\n\nThere are a lot of different companies around that you can bottled water home coolers from. I tried a couple before finding one I really liked. Their service is great, and they have a lot of different brands of water for you to choose from. Their prices are really good too.\n\nSunday, December 30, 2007\n\nIf you don't have \"drinking more water\" on your list of New Year's resolutions, then you need to add it it right now!\n\nIt is absolutely crucial to keep your body properly hydrated by drinking enough water every day. And most people are guilty of not drinking as much as they should.\n\nHere are the top 5 reasons why drinking water is so important and why drinking more of it should be on your list of New Year's resolutions:\n\nYour skin. Drinking water is the cheapest, easiest and most effective method of maintaining clear, healthy skin. So stop wasting a fortune on expensive skin care products and drink more water.\n\nYour head. Did you know that headaches are one of the most common side effects of failing to drink enough water? Next time you have a headache, drink 2 glasses of water and see what happens.\n\nYour weight. When your body is dehydrated, it sends out signals that are usually misinterpreted as hunger. So if you drink enough water, you won't feel hungry all of the time, you will eat less, and lose weight.\n\nYour kidneys. Your body needs a lot of water to function properly and flush all of the toxins from your system. When you chronically dehydrate yourself, your kidneys suffer. And trust me, you don't want to deal with kidney infections or kidney stones - they are extremely painful!\n\nYour life. Your body is 98% water so you have to drink a lot of water in order to stay properly hydrated. If you don't you dehydrate, and if you become seriously dehydrated, you will die. So, drink water and stay alive.\n\nSo do your body a favor and commit to drinking more water in 2008! If you hate the taste of tap water, or just don't feel comfortable drinking it, then have bottled water home coolers delivered to your home. It's easy, convenient and a lot cheaper than you think.\n\nFriday, December 21, 2007\n\nHave you decided what your New Year's Resolutions are going to be? Well, if drinking more water isn't on your resolution list, it certainly should be. Proper hydration is crucial for maintaining clear skin and your overall health. And by taking advantage of Water.com's new Value Plan for bottled water home coolers, drinking more water will one resolution that will be easy to keep!\n\nThis new Value Plan is called \"New Year, New You,\" and it is designed to promote proper hydration by making it cheaper and easier for people to drink bottled water at home.\n\nThe \"New Year, New You\" plan offers one low rate each delivery, providing up to 4 gallon bottles plus the use of a dispenser starting at less than $1 per day. When you think about the fact that an 8oz bottle of water costs you about $1 at the store, this really is an awesome deal.\n\nIt is so convenient having the water delivered to your home. Why lug home heavy jugs and cases of bottled water when you can have it delivered right to your door? Plus, you will be helping out the environment because you will no longer be contributing to the overflowing landfills with all of those plastic water bottles.\n\nWater.com carries 7 different major brands of quality bottled water (Alhambra®, Belmont Springs®, Crystal Springs®, Kentwood Springs®, Hinckley Springs®, Sierra Springs® and Sparkletts®) and you can decide which brand you want in your home bottled water cooler.\n\nSo when you sit down to write out your New Year's resolutions, make sure to include drinking more water to the list. Proper hydration is so important to your body, and is just as important, if not more, than exercise and diet. And with Water.com's New Year's Value Plan, it is cheaper and easier than ever!\n\nWednesday, December 12, 2007\n\nChemicals in local tap water don't just make the water taste and smell bad, they can also be a real health hazard for some people. Many people believe that tap water is dangerous for pregnant women, and women that are nursing. There have also been concerns raised that the chemical used to treat public water supplies are responsible for a number of other health-related issues. There are even some people who insist that these chemicals are silently causing long-term health problems that won't be discovered for years.\n\nAnother reason that so many people have decided to switch to bottled water home coolers is because they are afraid of drinking contaminated tap water. Tap water is regulated by local authorities, but contamination does occur periodically. Some people don't want to risk getting sick from contaminated water, while other people simply don't trust their local authorities to properly regulate the drinking water.\n\nFortunately, bottled water does not contain chemicals and there is pretty much zero risk of contamination. That's because all bottled water, unlike tap water, is regulated by Food & Drug Administration. The FDA has much higher standards for bottled water than local governments have for tap water, and you can be certain that all bottled water available for sale is safe because it has been thoroughly tested prior to being approved for sale to the public. For many people, this is the reason why bottled water is the obvious winner in the tap water vs. bottled water debate.\n\nFor some people, the tap water vs. bottled water debate is all about taste. Tap water tastes disgusting and bottled water tastes good, end of story. Of course, some people have a bit more to say than that. They praise the taste of bottled water, insisting that the difference between the crisp, clean, refreshing taste of bottled water and the taste of tap water is like the difference between champagne and castor oil.\n\nOthers complain that not only does their tap water taste bad, it smells bad too. Some say their local water tastes like chemicals, some say sulfur, while others insist that theirs reeks of sewage. With stinky tap water like that, it's certainly easy to understand why people are opting for bottled water home coolers!\n\nThere is actually a very good reason for the discrepancies in taste and smell between tap water and bottled water. Chemicals like chlorine and fluoride are added to most public water supplies, and they \"flavor\" the way water tastes and smells. Local conditions, like a high concentration of sulfur in the soil, can also affect the water in unpleasant ways."

      "text": "Dr. Jason Eberhart-Phillips: Are toxins on tap in our drinking water?\n\nIS THE WATER we drink as clean and safe as it should be? Growing numbers of environmental and public health advocates aren't so sure.\n\nThese critics contend that years of lax regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency under the 38-year-old federal Safe Drinking Water Act has raised troubling questions about whether the water coming out of our taps is as free from chemical contamination as we are led to believe.\n\nIn the decades since federal regulation of drinking water began in 1974, researchers have identified hundreds of chemicals in drinking water supplies that may cause cancer, birth defects or other health problems. But the EPA has prescribed standards that water companies must meet for just 91 of these contaminants.\n\nIn the past 16 years, only one harmful substance — perchlorate — is in the process of being added to the list of regulated contaminants, and that one exception came only in response to a public outcry.\n\nBeyond this, many of the standards used for contaminants the EPA actually regulates may be out of date. Most of the maximum contamination levels the EPA allows — levels given in parts per billion — have not been changed since the 1980s or earlier, despite new research that points to unwelcome health effects for some contaminants at lower concentrations than previously thought.\n\nOne outspoken group leading the charge on drinking water safety is the\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnvironmental Working Group, an advocacy organization based in Washington, D.C. After reviewing the water quality records of almost 48,000 suppliers in 45 states from 2004 to 2009, EWG investigators found that more than 200 unregulated but potentially harmful chemicals were present in the nation's drinking water supply.\n\nBecause no maximum allowable levels have been established for any of these contaminants in drinking water, they are legally permissible in any amount — even at levels that may, over time, endanger the health of some consumers, the EWG says.\n\nRecords obtained by EWG for the two largest suppliers in Marin County found no violations of mandatory state or federal standards, but each had eight unregulated chemicals detected in their water at levels exceeding established health guidelines. For details of these findings, and all other records obtained by the EWG, go to: \n\nIn all large systems, drinking water is routinely monitored for contamination related to infectious agents, radioactive particles and chemicals, both organic and inorganic. These contaminants can be naturally occurring, or they may enter the drinking water supply at the source as the result of urban storm-water runoff, industrial or domestic wastewater discharges, agriculture or mining.\n\nToday public health attention is increasingly focused on the potential risk from the immense array of chemicals now on the market, including pesticides, fertilizers, volatile organic compounds and pharmaceuticals. The vast majority of these chemicals will never appear in treated drinking water, but as the EWG data show, hundreds of them do — and most aren't being regulated.\n\nA report released last year by the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, asserted that when it came to assessing the risk from new chemical contaminants for possible regulation, the EPA relied more on the easy availability of data than on considerations of risk to public health. Even worse, the GAO said that once chemicals made it to the EPA's list for consideration as regulated contaminants, the agency often failed to use testing methods that were sensitive enough to detect low-level exposures that could be harmful to health.\n\nThe GAO report also criticized the EPA for failing to protect especially vulnerable populations — including young children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems — from pollutants in drinking water. Children have a greater susceptibility to many toxins because their bodies are rapidly growing. They also consume far more drinking water per unit of body weight than adults do, increasing their exposure to whatever contaminants their drinking water contains.\n\nIn-home filtration devices can help to remove some contaminants, but to be effective they require repeated filter replacement and that can be expensive over time.\n\nThe best way forward for whole communities is for greater protection of drinking water sources from chemical pollutants. At a minimum, the current concerns over chemical contamination point to a need for an increased investment in the monitoring of drinking water and far more research into potential health effects, both in the general population and in more sensitive groups.\n\nOnly with sufficient data, reviewed through an open and transparent scientific process, can adequate regulation be undertaken to assure that our drinking water is as clean and safe as it can be.\n\nDr. Eberhart-Phillips is the former Marin County Public Health Officer, whose column appears every third Monday. He is a specialist in preventive medicine and the author of two books on emerging infectious diseases."

      "text": "Why are some wells contaminated and some are not? All wells are not equally vulnerable to contamination because of differences in three factors: the general aquifer chemistry, groundwater age, and paths within aquifer systems that allow water and contaminants to reach a well.\n\nWhen it comes to questions about water and gas wells, the answers are clear as mud. State water officials were at Bayfield High School on Tuesday evening to provide information about a water case decided last year by the state Supreme Court and related to recently passed legislation.\n\nWyoming is close to having its first new standards for water wells in more than 35 years. The rules are expected to take effect this spring or summer and would apply to all new residential, industrial and municipal water wells in the state. The rules would impose tougher standards to keep pollution and bacteria from contaminating groundwater.\n\nThe 2010 General Assembly has returned to Denver for its 120-day session. During the next four months, legislators will tackle issues such as ground water boundaries, vehicle registration and illegal diversion of surface water. The first water bill of the 2010 session got its first hearing Thursday.\n\nThe government is spending $40 million in federal stimulus funds to pull water from underground aquifers in drought-stricken California, even as evidence is growing that the well-drilling boom could degrade the quality of water delivered to millions of residents.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency unveiled a new national strategy to enforce safe drinking water laws in small, rural communities on Tuesday and pledged to redouble efforts to protect children from toxic water in schools."

Not only can you use them to polish silver (really), help cure warts (hmm) and even make paper from it. now there's evidence banana peels can help remove heavy metals from contaminated river waters.\n\nAn article published in the American Cancer Society's Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research journal claims that a device using minced banana peel can be as effective (sometimes even more) effective in removing copper and lead from rivers than conventional methods. Gustavo Castro and a team of colleagues from Brazil's Instituto de Biociências de Botucatu at the Universidade Estadual Paulista have found that heavy metals accumulate from farm run-off, mining and industrial waste, polluting our waterways.\n\nBanana peels can be used up to 11 times without compromising its cleansing properties.

In fighting these stealthy germs, industry professionals use several approaches based on research, health department regulations and current Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommendations.\n\nOne of the most effective tools to prevent the threat of swimmer sickness is still the old-fashioned chlorine sanitizer. In fact, chlorine has a long history of effectively destroying water invaders. In London during the 1800s, more than 25,000 people died in less than a decade due to cholera from raw sewage in the River Thames. In 1855, London became the first city to treat sewage with chlorine. As a result, cholera cases were reduced to nearly zero. The use of chlorine for drinking water in the United States reduced cholera cases from 25,000 in 1900 to only 20 in 1960.\n\nBecause of its proven ability to disinfect, chlorine became popular for swimming pool use in the 1920s. In 2000, Life magazine called the use of chlorine as a disinfectant in water \"one of the most important inventions of the last thousand years.\"\n\nDo The Math\n\nWhen chlorine sanitizer is used against contaminants in pool water, varying contact time (CT) values exist, depending on the type of pathogenic (disease-causing) microorganism.\n\nFor example, Giardia has a CT value of 45 minutes at 1 ppm of chlorine. That is, a Giardia protozoa is inactivated in 45 minutes of contact with pool water carrying a 1-ppm residual of chlorine.\n\nThe problem child of pathogenic microorganisms is Cryptosporidium (Crypto)–which has a CT value of 9,600 minutes or 6.7 days–so it remains active for a week or longer in chlorinated pools. Recent studies conducted by the EPA have shown that the average adult swimmer swallows up to one ounce of water while swimming, and children usually swallow twice as much as adults. With the possibility of billions of chlorine-resistant Crypto cysts present in pool water, it is easy to see how swimmers can become infected. This is especially true in pools with a high bather load.\n\nCrypto is extremely chlorine-resistant, and has a size of 4 to 6 micron, making it difficult to control. The majority of public facilities still use sand filters that only filter down to 25 micron. Many residential pools use diatomaceous earth (DE) filters that can pick up under 4 micron. While the DE filter may appear to be a solution to the problem, studies have shown that the Crypto cysts actually have the ability to elongate and press through filtration media in a viable state.\n\nExisting preventative measures for Crypto hardly seem effective, currently ranging from ensuring swimmers shower to keeping sick swimmers out of the water.\n\nHyperchlorination methods are recommended by health departments to deal with the suspicion of possible Crypto in pools. The hyperchlorination method is typically 20 to 30 ppm for eight to 12 hours. This method may vary depending on local health regulations. CDC reported in 2004 that there was not conclusive evidence to prove complete eradication of Crypto using this recommended method.\n\nNew Methods To Deal With RWIs\n\nOzone is becoming popular as a possible backup means for eradicating Crypto. Ozone kills bacteria and Crypto cysts 3,125 times faster than chlorine.\n\nUltraviolet light (UV) is another system quickly gaining popularity. After an outbreak at a splash park in New York last summer, the state mandated the use of UV at all public splash park facilities. High turbidity of the water can be a problem that may cause UV systems to become ineffective against Crypto. For this reason health departments also regulate turbidity levels in public pools.\n\nThe biggest problem with many public facilities is that they rely only on chlorine, and use sand filtration. Thus, to effectively deal with Crypto, expensive upgrades–such as ozonators and UV units–need to be installed. Many private and publicly funded aquatic facilities simply don't have the budget to make such vast improvements."

      "text": "Reverse Osmosis\n\nReverse osmosis is a process of separation that uses pressure to force a highly concentrated solute through a semi-permeable membrane to a region of lower solute concentration, which leaves the solute on one side and only the solvent on the other.\n\nThe image below depicts the process of Reverse Osmosis\n\nWith the normal osmosis process, a liquid with two different concentrations will naturally move from an area of low solute concentration through a semi-permeable membrane to an area of high solute concentration to reach equilibrium. When two solutions are mixed together that contain different concentrations of a solute, the total amount of solutes in the solution will distribute equally. The semi-permeable membrane allows the solvent to move from one compartment to the other, but prevents the solute from doing the same. Osmosis is achieved when the solvent has moved from the areas of low solute concentration to the area of high solute concentration.\n\nThe method in which reverse osmosis works is that it uses the opposite process by which the normal osmosis process flows. With reverse osmosis, the same concept is applied with that of normal osmosis, but in this case, pressure is applied to the side of high solute concentration so that force influences the movement of the water as well as the normal osmotic pressure in osmosis. In order for reverse osmosis to occur, the pressure of the feed water must exceed that of the osmotic pressure.\n\nAt the heart of the reverse osmosis process is the membrane used to filter the concentrated solution. There are various types of membranes used in reverse osmosis, two of which are cellulose triacetate membranes for use with heavily chlorinated water, and thin film composite membranes for use with waters with high TDS (total dissolved solids). Thin film composite membranes are typically constructed using numerous layers of materials bonded together and wound around a spiral core tube. One of the layers of film used is polyamide, which is permeable to water and impermeable to other impurities like salt ions. These types of membranes are typically used in water purification or water desalination systems.\n\nThe rate of liquid passage through the membrane during reverse osmosis depends on various factors such as pressure, concentration and the temperature of the molecules.\n\nHow reverse osmosis works within the membrane is by a process called cross flow filtration. The feed water is passed along the filter membrane at a positive pressure in relation to the permeate side. Water which is smaller than the membrane pore size passes through the membrane as processed permeate water; all other material is retained on the feed side. The permeate flows through the spiral tube of the membrane, while the concentrate does not and is retained. This allows the filter to operate continuously with the concentrate or waste water going to the drain.\n\nReverse osmosis works with a variety of applications and can be utilized in various ways. Reverse osmosis systems are typically found in households to improve the quality of water for drinking water. However, reverse osmosis is also widely used for commercial and industrial applications when the initial purchase and operating costs outweigh the negatives of water problems that one is experiencing. As of today, reverse osmosis is the most economical technology to purify water to high quality standards."

Groundwater pollution could therefore seriously reduce the amount of drinking water worldwide.\n\nGroundwater pollution is often refereed to as the groundwater contamination and refers to the introduction of different pollutants (contaminants) into groundwater. These pollutants make the groundwater unclean and unsafe for drinking as well as unsuitable for different other particular purposes.\n\nCleaning groundwater pollution is very costly, in the most severe cases aquifer can be contaminated up to such level that it needs to be abandoned, meaning that the community must find a completely new supply of water which is extremely difficult and costs a lot of money.\n\nThe sources of groundwater pollution are usually classified by its origin and the four most common types of groundwater pollution include municipal, agricultural, industrial and individual groundwater pollution.\n\nThe infamous example of groundwater pollution was Love Canal where in 1978 its residents noticed high rates of cancer and an alarming number of birth defects because of the organic solvents and dioxins from an industrial landfill which had contaminated the groundwater.\n\nEach and every one of us can do something to prevent groundwater pollution by disposing hazardous materials like oil, paint, medicaments, and solvents responsibly in a facility which is certified to handle such materials.\n\nOne of the most frequent groundwater pollutants in industrialized countries is Vinyl chloride which can cause cancer in people.\n\nReliable and accurate estimation of the exact type of groundwater pollution sources is still a major challenge in cleaning efforts because of the many uncertainties involved and the lack of adequate observation data in most cases. Some scientists have even proposed the idea of using computer algorithms to identify exact sources of groundwater pollution.\n\nGroundwater pollution is usually cleaned by using bioremediation technologies which involves using microbes to clean up organic contaminants in water supply. In most of these cases microbes feed off the organic contaminants and, in the process, convert them to non-toxic products.\n\nSome groundwater pollution occurs naturally which is the case with arsenic commonly found in the sediments of the rock. Arsenic poisoning of the groundwater is especially serious issue in Asian countries such as Bangladesh, India and Vietnam. According to a 2009 study more than 140 million people in southern Asia drink groundwater contaminated with arsenic every day."

      "text": "It's possible that over the course of your lease term, you'll get a \"boil water notice\" in your apartment mailbox. This means that your water district has detected levels of bacteria or other harmful contaminants in the water supply that exceed local drinking water standards.\n\nGetting a boil water notice shouldn't be a cause for panic. Very often, the problem has to do with the water treatment or distribution pipes, and not a criminal or terrorist act. But you should take all boil water notices seriously.\n\nIf you get a boil water notice, take the following action:\n\n8 Things to Do After Getting a Boil Water Notice\n\nFollow notice's instructions. Start by reading the notice carefully. It should give instructions on what you should do -- and what you should avoid doing -- until the boil water notice is lifted.\n\nCheck and discard. Look through your apartment's kitchen and pantry for any food, ice, or baby formula that you've made with (unboiled) water during the period of time the notice indicates the water supply has been unfit for consumption. Promptly discard any such items you find. If you're in doubt about whether a particular food is safe, err on the side of caution and throw it out.\n\nBoil water before use. Don't use water from the tap unless you boil it first. Boiling kills bacteria and other harmful organisms, so the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency advises consumers to boil water for at least a minute before using it to drink, prepare food, make ice or baby formula (if applicable to you), or brush your teeth. Of course, you'll want to allow the boiling water to cool before using it. You can speed up this process by putting your already boiled water in your refrigerator or freezer until it has cooled down to the right temperature.\n\nBuy bottled water. Bottled water is a safe alternative to tap water, and it's convenient while a boil-water notice is in effect because you don't need to boil it or take other steps.\n\nMoney-saving tip: Buy bottled water in bulk and look for sales at supermarkets and wholesale clubs such as Costco, BJ's, and Sam's Club. Look carefully at the price label and you'll probably see the \"cost per unit\" included, which tells you how much an individual bottle will wind up costing you if you buy the pack. Since packs can vary as to the number of bottles included (as well as the number of ounces per bottle), comparing the unit cost is the easiest way to determine which is the best deal (without having to do the math in your head or fuss with a calculator).\n\nTake note of symptoms. The notice should tell you what contaminant was found and what symptoms to look out for. For example, it might say, \"Disease symptoms may include diarrhea, cramps, nausea, and possibly jaundice, and any associated headaches and fatigue.\" It will probably also advise you to take symptoms particularly seriously if you or anyone in your household is a young child, a senior citizen, or has an immune deficiency.\n\nIf you see a doctor (or bring your children to a pediatrician) for any reason after a boil water notice, be sure to point out the notice and the list of symptoms. The doctor might not be aware of it (especially if she lives and works in town unaffected by it) and should keep it in mind while examining you to determine if it's relevant.\n\nSpread the word. Inform your apartment neighbors about the boil water notice. If there's a bulletin board in the lobby, mail room or other common area, post a copy of the boil water notice you received. When informing others about the boil water notice, keep in mind that exaggerating or spreading misinformation can cause unnecessary fear. Remember that you're not expected to act like a health department representative but just trying to be a helpful neighbor. So, stick to the information in the boil water notice and point out the phone number(s) a neighbor can call for answers to lingering questions.\n\nGet all the information you need. Don't be afraid to get more information, if you have concerns that you believe aren't adequately addressed in the notice. Look for the phone numbers of your water district and your county or local health department on the notice.\n\nTake final steps. Read what the notice says about a possible estimate for the water problem to be fixed. Also, find out how you'll be informed about an all-clear. For example, will you get another notice, or perhaps a robocall? Or does the original notice instruct you to check your local newspaper or online news sources for important updates?\n\nResume drinking your tap water only after you've gotten the all-clear. (Remember, any estimate indicated in the notice is only that). Once you get the all-clear, follow any steps contained in the notice or in subsequent news reports on what precautions you should take. For example, your health department may advise you to thoroughly flush the service line to your apartment and all taps by running water from each faucet for five minutes before resuming normal use."

      "text": "The users of the water supply (a town, factory, or just a building) need to have water pressure to maintain the safety of the water supply. If a water supply is not pressurized sufficiently, several things can happen:\n\nwithout a water tower, parts of gravity flow water supply systems in hilly areas may be subject to negative pressures (see siphon). Negative pressure in the system may cause shallow groundwater to be sucked into a leaky water supply system, polluting it with microorganisms, dirt, sand, fertilizers, and any other toxiccontaminants that may be in the groundwater;\n\nThe height of the tower provides the hydrostatic pressure for the water supply system, and it may be supplemented with a pump. The volume of the reservoir and diameter of the piping provide sustain and flow rate. However, relying on a pump to provide pressure is expensive; the pump would have to provide a constantly varying output pressure (and thus need an expensive control system), and it would have to be sized sufficiently to give the same pressure at high flow rates. Very high flow rates have been recorded during program breaks during the television broadcast of large sporting events or popular shows.\n\nWater towers can be surrounded by ornate coverings including fancy brickwork, a large ivy-covered trellis, etc., or it can be simply painted.

Fracking has reduced our dependence on foreign oil, decreased carbon emissions and made significant contributions to our nation's economy. However, the technology can have significant social and environmental impacts, according to Duke professor Avner Vengosh.\n\nVengosh described how shale gas drilling and fracking can disturb residents of formerly quiet towns with nearly-constant noise, odor and truck traffic.\n\n\"This is changing the dynamics of small towns in Pennsylvania [and other states] pretty significantly,\" he said.\n\nVengosh said that fracking can also impact air and water quality — and thus human health. Earlier this year, he published the first peer-reviewed paper to examine well-water contamination from shale-gas drilling and hydrofracking. He and his colleagues found that drinking water wells within 1 km of a drilling operation were more likely to have high concentrations of methane, the primary component of natural gas.\n\nFracking is also very water-intensive, requiring millions of gallons of water at drilling each site. In areas experiencing drought conditions, this presents a serious problem, Vengosh said.\n\nMany companies recycle the water they produce. However, the water that flows out differs significantly from water that went in, often containing high levels of salts, heavy metals and naturally-occurring radionuclides that can be difficult to remove. According to Vengosh, some companies bypass that difficulty by discharging their wastewater to nearby rivers or streams."

As a consequence of this lack of safe water and sanitation the occurrence of diarrhea cases multiply. Only in 1998 the WHO estimated the number of deaths caused by diarrhea in 2.2 million people, most of them under 5 years old [3].\n\nIn order to avoid this WHO recommended a series of key measure, the first and most important one beingaccess to safe drinking water. Stephanie B. Velegol, Ph.D., a researcher at Pennsylvania State University seems to have find the way to do that in an inexpensive way, but how?\n\nHowever purifying water inexpensively is not so easy to achieve, or at least it wasn't until now. Supplying safe drinking water in developing countries required until now big investments inwater purification plants, chemical products and so on, rendering impossible its implementation in most cases.\n\nBut now, a new hope for those developing countries have arisen with the announcement of the findings of a research done by Stephanie B.

The CDC proclaimed fluoridation to be one of the top\nten greatest public health achievements of the past century. Former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop stated, \"Fluoridation\nis the single most important commitment that a community can make\nto the oral health of its citizens.\"\n\nPresently, nearly 2/3 of U.S. residents who receive water from a\npublic water system, now receive fluoridated water. Fluoride is a\nnaturally occurring element in the environment that is known to be\neffective in preventing tooth decay in children and adults. Some\nwater supplies contain fluoride naturally, but others, like Sebago\nLake and the wells serving Steep Falls, do not contain enough\nfluoride to be beneficial. At the Sebago Lake Water Treatment\nFacility in Standish, the level of fluoride in the water is adjusted\nto an optimal concentration of 0.7 mg/L. Water samples are collected\ndaily to ensure that fluoride levels in the water remain within the\nbeneficial range. Fluoride was added to Greater\nPortland's water supply in 1997 as a result of a publicly-initiated\nreferendum.\n\nWhen did water fluoridation begin in the United\nStates?\nWhile the benefits of fluoride were first discovered in the 1930s,\nit wasn't until 1945 that water systems added fluoride to the\ndrinking water.\n\nIs fluoride safe?\nExtensive research conducted over the past 50 years has shown\ntime and time again that fluoridation of public water supplies is a\nsafe, effective and economical way to reduce tooth decay for all\nages.\n\nA\ndetailed review by the National Research Council in 1993 found no\nlinks between low-level fluoride ingestion and occurrences of\ncancer, kidney disease, gastrointestinal disorders, immunological\ndisorders, reproductive effects, genetic disorders, or bone\nfractures.\n\nMany healthful substances can be harmful if you get too much.\nThis is true of salt, iron, vitamins A and D, and even water itself.\nWhile\nexposure to high levels of fluoride over a long time can cause\ndental fluorosis, a condition that leads to mottled tooth enamel,\ndiscoloration, and in some cases erosion of the gum line, the fluoride\ncontent in your drinking water is limited under federal law and the\nlevels are very low.\n\nCurrently, over 162 million people in the United States are\nreceiving the benefits of water fluoridation.\n\nHow does fluoride prevent tooth decay?\nFluoride protects teeth in two ways:\n\nSystemic fluoride. This is the fluoride in\ndrinking water, fluoride vitamins or supplements. This fluoride is\nswallowed. Systemic fluoride in saliva strengthens the tooth\nstructure and helps prevent decay. It reaches teeth still forming,\neven before you can see them in the mouth.\n\nTopical fluoride. This is the fluoride in\ntoothpaste, gels and rinses. It strengthens teeth already in the\nmouth.

Early in the days of dental studies dentists noted that some children in certain geographical areas did not have the cavities or even what was many times considered baby bottle tooth decay from the sugars and upon study they discovered that where these children lived they had enough natural fluoride in the water to make the teeth re-mineralize and basically resist tooth decay. Studies were done for verification and in every case where water was naturally fluoridated to one part fluoride per million parts water people had less dental decay.\n\nLaws were passed shortly after this not to poison anyone but to bring areas insufficient to what occurred naturally in other parts of the country of 1 part per million or to the same levels found in nature. If you drink from a spring you likely have naturally fluoridated water and in many cases you may in fact have water with more than 1 part per million and nature did it not man. Some parts of Texas and other areas I have lived exceed that by quite a bit. Where we live now for example does not fluoridate the water because it is not needed. Nature did it for us.\n\nI live in an area that is 1.5 parts calcium fluoride per million. That is natural fluoride and it is bound to the calcium. It occurs in nature the problem is the man made sodium fluoride that is used .It is unstable and cumulates in the body by wanting to join with a calcium ion. That is why it accumulates in the pineal gland. We add calcium into our body and it attaches to the free fluoride.\n\nnatural calcium fluoride passes out the body.\n\nThe natural PH of the body is between 7.5 and 8.5. If we ingest acid foods the body balances the ph by becoming more alkaline. The reverse happen when we eat alkaline foods, most man made products fall into this category. That is why we should not eat unnatural products. Most natural foods are acidic.\n\nNature works on basic chemistry so does our body.\n\nWhy do you think dairy products are a problem? We are the only mammal that continues to ingest milk ect after we have been weaned. It contains free calcium. You can eat it if you know how to release the calcium.\n\nThat is why fasting and body cleaning methods are used by some. Itís to balance the body. We do not have to eat like our last meal every day, fast and give your body a break.\n\nThe natural PH of the body is between 7.5 and 8.5. If we ingest acid foods the body balances the ph by becoming more alkaline.\n\nI don't agree with you, you got living examples that eat acidic food and do not do very well. Take a look at meat eaters, even fruit eaters. The body would balance if you had a higher alkaline PH. Balance does not mean higher PH but a balance. Since you are low on PH how do you expect acidic food to raise your PH.\n\nI was watching an interview last night with Dr. Rick Strassman who wrote the book 'DMT:The Spirit Molecule' and is involved in research into DMT and he is quite adamant that at this time it is unknown whether DMT is made in the Pineal Gland and that ongoing research is still trying to establish whether or not it is - I think David Wilcock is incorrect in saying the gland secretes DMT.\n\nFLUORIDE CHLORINE etc... To cleanse drinking water - buy some natural rock quartz points. Cleanse, charge & program them (info on google). Fill jug with tap water, gently put a charged, cleansed programmed quartz point in the water, place in fridge overnight. Taste the difference! This is how I deal with my drinking water. Cleanse, charge & program weekly.\n\njust to say im going through heavy phychic/spiritial stuff in my life and when i connect,start getting pictures i get an energy/pressure/best way i can desribe it,in the middle of my forehead.this was pushed on me rather than me looking for it to happen so dont know if the floride thing would hinder it.im going to try go without it for a while and see if theres a difference.\n\nthink its just awful if this is the reason why this stuff is force fed us.....bloody shameful.......but not surprised!!!\n\nHeres a few notes I made from a film I recently watched relating to the activation of the pineal gland. The film is called The ring of power 2.\n\nI spotted this thread and thought I'd post them to see if anyone else had experience of this. There is a section near the end of the film where a technique for activating the pineal gland is described. I've been trying it out myself and would say that there is something in it.\n\nThese notes are only rough but they get the idea across\n\nPineal gland activation\nThe seat of the soul - gateway to higher realms.\nThe link between the physical and the spiritual realm.\n\nFluoride accumulates in the gland causing it to be less effective.\nOutdoor activities, eating less sugar, eliminating processed foods and fluoride can help to revitalise it.\n\nTechnique for re-activating the pineal gland should not be attempted by anyone who does not feel ready to explore higher realms of consciousness beyond the five senses.\n\nTo begin the exercise, it is necessary to find the correct vibrational tone of voice. hum the word love in a mid pitched voice. When you find the correct tone, it will feel right.\n\nSit comfortably with your eyes closed and scan your body for any signs of tension.\n\nTake three long breaths through your nose and exhale the tension through your mouth.\n\nThink about opening the third eye and entering a loving universe where all that exists is complete bliss. Take a breath through your nose and hold it for a few seconds. Just before you exhale, purse your lips and place your tongue between your teeth. Press down gently on your tongue with your teeth. As you slowly exhale through your pursed lips, loudly hum the word love and vibrate the V sound until all of the air is expelled from your lungs. Repeat this exercise 4 more times, taking a few moments rest between each repetition.\n\nTo awaken the pineal gland, this exercise should be repeated for 2 more days in a row at 24 hours apart. The entire exercise only has to be done once to be effective. It may take 6 weeks or more to experience your newly awakened abilities.\n\nWhen I did this I began to see a very small, centered, bright white sphere. Vivid images also began to appear, not all were pleasant.\n\nJust finished watching a couple of David Wilcox vids and interesting in one he mentions the sheild that surrounds the the pineal gland and describes it as being red....the red shield\n\nIn the second vid he talks about the Rothschild name meaning ...red shield...is there some connection here?"

      "text": "Throughout the world people have become seriously ill and sometimes even died due to lack of clean drinking water. Most people may assume that this only a problem for third world countries; however it also happens in developed countries. Although the Safe Drinking Water Act was passed almost forty years ago, much of the tap water in the United States is unsafe to drink because of an overwhelmed regulatory agency, inadequate fines to prevent violations, and new threats that are currently unregulated.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for enforcing standards set by Congress and The Safe water Drinking Act. However according to Charles Duhigg, in his article \"Clean Water Laws Are Neglected, at a Cost in Suffering,\" it has become more difficult for the EPA to do their job due to downsizing caused by cutbacks. In addition, today's EPA has more to inspect and even fewer personnel to do so. Many corporations have benefited a great deal because of the EPA being overwhelmed. With the EPA overwhelmed, this decreases the chance of fines, and increases the chance of violations. When companies do receive fines, they are often less than adequate to prevent further infractions. For instance, some fines are so low in comparison with the corporation's profit that the loss can be made up within 10 hours. Furthermore, it has become even more difficult for the EPA, and other groups to prevent water contamination because the corporations have become effective lobbyist. It's not uncommon for former EPA agents to switch sides for higher pay. Besides the difficulty of enforcing an effective preventive water pollution program, the EPA faces the additional challenge of unregulated sources of Pollution. For instance, water runoff from farms have contaminated many waterways, but are not currently included in the Water Protection Act.\n\nIn the End, without support, and backing of the larger government agencies the EPA cannot effectively maintain a safe water supply. The fines are so small and infrequent that they have little or no impact. Unsafe drinking water, and the health risks that accompany it, will continue as long as the corporations are the ones that decide if the drinking water should be safe. After all, there is much more money in polluting water, than keeping it clean."

      "text": "Hexavalent Chromium (Cr-6)\n\nNationwide interest in levels of hexavalent chromium (Cr-6) in drinking water followed a report released in December 2010 covering major cities, including the Washington, D.C. region. There is much uncertainty about the significance of very low levels of Cr-6 in drinking water so we are providing the following facts to keep our customers informed about the issues regarding Cr-6 and WSSC's actions.\n\nWhat is chromium and where do you find it?\n\nChromium is a naturally occurring metal found in rocks, soil, plants, and animals. Chromium is also used industrially in steel making, metal plating, leather tanning, paints, dyes and wood preservatives. It is also discharged by industrial facilities such as coal burning power plants. It is most commonly present in the environment in three forms: trivalent (Cr-3), hexavalent (Cr-6) and Cr-0, the metal form. Cr-3 is an essential micro-nutrient in the human diet and generally not considered toxic. Cr-6 is known to pose human health risks from inhalation, and a new risk assessment, not finalized yet, has raised concerns about the risk to human health from exposure to very low levels of Cr-6 by ingestion.\n\nIs Cr-6 allowed in drinking water?\n\nCr-6 is currently regulated under the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Safe Drinking Water Act only as a component of \"total chromium\" (along with Cr-3). The allowable level (or Maximum Contaminant Level, MCL) for total chromium is 100 parts per billion (ppb). However, the current MCL was set almost 20 years ago based on the best available science at that time when Cr-6 was not believed to be a significant health risk from ingestion of drinking water. So the current MCL does not necessarily address the recent concerns that have been raised about Cr-6 at levels much lower than the MCL.\n\nTesting for Cr-6\n\nCurrently, the EPA does not require that Cr-6 be separately tested in drinking water. However, it does require that we measure total chromium and that measurement includes Cr-6 along with Cr-3. Total chromium levels in WSSC water are routinely less than 2 ppb – 50 times less than the EPA limit. This is chronicled annually, along with other required water quality test results, in our Water Quality Report.\n\nIn light of the recent concerns in January 2011 the EPA issued guidance for water utilities who wish to voluntarily monitor for Cr-6. Following this guidance, WSSC began testing separately for Cr-6 at a variety of points within our system.\n\nSampling points included the source water we take into our Water Treatment Plants (WTP) from the Potomac and Patuxent Rivers, and treated water at those plants and a variety of public locations, including a fast-food restaurant, a local college and a coffee shop. WSSC uses careful sampling procedures to collect representative samples and avoid sample contamination.\n\nWe performed tests on a monthly basis for a year, going beyond the EPA recommendations that we test quarterly. All data from those tests have been made available to regulators, our customers and the public through our website, and we will keep those results online. And while not required to, we will voluntarily continue testing for Cr-6 on a quarterly basis until more definitive guidance or regulatory decisions are available.\n\nHere is a table detailing the results of our Cr-6 samples testing. It will be updated as additional tests are conducted.\n\n*ND - Non-detection - results are below the minimum level (0.05 ppb or 0.02 ppb) the lab method can reliably detect. It does NOT necessarily mean that the concentration is zero, just that it's too low for the lab to confidently assign a number if it is present.\n\n** Sample results may be invalid due to improper sample preservation, but are shown for informational purposes.\n\nResults from sampling to date:\n\nResults to date indicate a very low level presence of Cr-6 when it is detected above the minimum reporting limit at the eight sample locations. See the Cr-6 Frequently Asked Questions for information about the potential significance of Cr-6 at these very low levels."

Waste water must be therefore purified through appropriate purification plants.\n\nThe various plants are designed and built according to the load of pollutants to be disposed of. Purification processes therefore vary a lot and depend on the technology applied, the selected process, the safety margins to be achieved, the investments available, and the operating costs to be borne.\n\nThis overview clearly shows the vastness of the topics to be dealt with and, thus, the great number of possible solutions."

In the developing world, more than a billion people lack access to clean, safe drinking water.\n\nMark Benjamin, Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering, is using a common water treatment additive, aluminum oxide, in an innovative new way to improve conventional water filtration processes. In laboratory studies Benjamin heated aluminum oxides to produce microparticles that form a thin layer over polymer filtration membranes. The layer protected the membranes from fouling and, surprisingly, removed pollutants from the water far more effectively and efficiently.\n\n\"In this approach, the aluminum oxide layer is the critical component, and the membrane becomes just a support structure,\" Benjamin said. \"This simple, low-tech advance suggests we can use much cheaper membranes and significantly decrease treatment costs.\"\n\nThe UW Center for Commercialization awarded Benjamin a Commericalization Gap Fund award in 2008 to continue work confirming the science behind his approach. \"Patrick Shelby in the UW Center for Commercialization has not only provided key market information and potential licensees, but also helped me understand how industry views my technology and how to attract their attention,\" Benjamin said.\n\nThe next step will be to demonstrate practicality for municipal, industrial, and even portable field uses of the scaled-up prototype."

People need less iron after age 50.\n\n\"Metallic flavor, caused by the dissolved iron and copper commonly found in groundwater or which may be introduced to tap water by the nation's corroding infrastructure, has been an issue for drinking water consumers and utilities,\" Dietrich said.\n\nMore than two million miles of the nation's infrastructure of water and wastewater pipes is nearing the end of its useful life, but the mostly underground facilities often do not attract much attention because of this \"invisibility,\" said Sunil Sinha, Virginia Tech associate professor of civil and environmental engineering and a colleague of Dietrich's. Sinha is directing two new research projects to develop a National Pipeline Infrastructure Database.\n\nStudies also suggest that older people who consume too much iron — especially in dietary supplements and iron-rich foods — may be at increased risk for Alzheimer's disease and other age-related conditions. Scientists long have known that taste perception fades with age. Dietrich's group set out to fill in gaps in knowledge about how aging affects perception of a metallic flavor in water.\n\nTheir results with 69 volunteers, aged 19 to 84 years, identified a distinctive age-related decline in their ability to taste iron. People over age 50 tended to miss the metallic taste of iron in water, even at levels above the thresholds set by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency and the World Health Association.\n\n\"Our findings are . . . unique in that drinking water is the source of the environmental sensory contaminant and evidence is provided for wide variation in the human population,\" the report states. \"Whereas our research focused on iron, there are implications for other metals of health concern, most notably copper from copper pipes as our previous research has demonstrated that copper is less flavorful than iron and it is known that copper is also more toxic than iron.\"\n\nFracking news:\n\nHow \"Fracking\" Works\n\nSACRAMENTO –The Brown administration is scrambling to convince an increasingly wary public that state regulators are getting a handle on hydraulic fracturing, a controversial oil extraction method that can pose a hazard to drinking water.\n\nState environmental officials last week requested that energy companies disclose where they conduct \"fracking\"operations and what chemicals they inject into the ground to tap oil deposits. They also were considering whether to launch an independent study to assess effects of the practice.\n\nThe administration plans toundertake a statewide \"listening\" tour for public comment on an extraction technique that until now has drawn the greatest attention in the Rocky Mountain West and Northeast, where the discovery of toxic chemicals in drinking water near fracking operations has sparked calls for moratoriums and more regulation.\n\nRegulators have yet to develop rules or reporting requirements for the procedure in California, the fourth largest oil-producing state in the nation. Only 78 of the tens of thousands of oil field injection wells in California, where fracking might occur, are listed on a national fracking registry.\n\nThough officials maintain that existing laws protect the state's drinking water, they acknowledge they have little information about the scale or practice of fracking, causing growing anxiety in communities from Culver City to Monterey. The energy industry is touting the potential of the procedure here to tap the largest oil shale formation in the continental United States.\n\nMark Nechodom, director of the Department of Conservation, sought to assure lawmakers last week that the state was taking the issue seriously.\n\n\"If there's been any impression that [the administration] has dismissed or ignored public concern about fracking, I apologize but it's simply not true,\" he said. \"We share the concern.\"\n\nLawmakers were not convinced. At a hearing Wednesday, they blasted the administration's actions as little more than cosmetic tweaks, saying that regulations are long overdue for a state that is widely considered the birthplace of the modern environmental movement. Separately, they are pushing legislation that would require oil companies to disclose where they employ the procedure, what chemicals they use and how much water they pump. The bill stalled last year after objections by the energy industry.\n\n\"What the Legislature clearly has been saying we want is information and regulations,\" said Assemblyman Jared Huffman (D-San Rafael). \"And we don't have either.\"\n\nThe lower house's subcommittee on resources tabled the administration's request for an additional 18 positions in the state's oil and gas agency, noting that 35 positions had already been approved in the last two years, in part to develop fracking regulations. The state's nonpartisan legislative analyst reported that 13 of those slots remain vacant.\n\n\"To kind of just go along and wait for a study…really isn't acceptable,\" said Assemblywoman Betsy Butler (D-Marina del Rey). \"There are other states who have prevented fracking from taking place until they have put those regulations into place. So why would California allow this to be happening without regulations?\"\n\nNechodom, a former senior adviser and scientist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, told lawmakers he was \"a bit surprised\" that California had no regulations on fracking, a common procedure at wells statewide, when Brown appointed him conservation director in December.\n\nMonitoring fracking in oil fields would require more staff in an agency that Nechodom described as short-handed and overworked. And though he said California's geology makes fracking safer here than in the Rocky Mountain West or Northeast, regulators are at the whims of energy companies when it comes to detecting damage.\n\n\"The industry outguns us in information by orders of magnitude, with their 3-D modeling,\" Nechodom said. \"We simply have to take their word for it unless we develop some other technique for modeling.\"\n\nTupper Hull, a spokesman for the Western States Petroleum Assn., said his trade organization already encourages oil companies to post fracking operations on the national registry and was working with lawmakers on disclosure legislation.\n\nBrown has said he plans to visit oil-rich Kern County to meet with energy companies and environmentalists to learn more about fracking. In the meantime, he recently told a conference of renewable energy investors that oil companies have an incentive to be good environmental stewards.\n\n\"I don't think any company wants to pollute the aquifer,\" he said, \"because we have trial lawyers in California — and a very vigorous tort system. So I think there's a certain self-discipline that they can operate with the management of fracking issues.\""

      "text": "What are cross connections? Cross connections are physical connections between a potable water supply and some non-potable source. Potable water is water free of harmful levels of pollutants and contaminants and suitable for public consumption. A non-potable source could be anything from a direct connection to a sewer pipe to a hose dangling in a swimming pool.\n\nAren't cross connections controlled by the plumbing code? Plumbing codes do address connections. No cross connections are supposed to be allowed in internal plumbing systems. In addition, several normal cross connection situations, such as boiler feeds, are required to be protected by specific types of backflow preventers.\n\nNotwithstanding the many references in plumbing codes, cross connections are prevalent in the plumbing systems of almost every structure. Potential cross connection situations, in which cross connections can occur with a simple rearranging of plumbing such as placing the hose into the swimming pool, add greatly to the likelihood of cross connection occurrences.\n\nAre cross connections dangerous? Under normal circumstances, with normal flows and pressures in internal systems, cross connections usually do not affect the potable water quality. When changes take place in the normal water flow or pressure, cross connections can become dangerous. Whatever non-potable source the cross connection is attached to can mix with the potable water. This mix can range from harmless to unpleasant to fatal depending on the nature of the non-potable source.\n\nSo cross connection control means the elimination of cross connections?\nPartially. Water purveyors as a goal would strive to see the elimination of all cross connections. This elimination would insure the maintenance of the incoming water quality throughout the structure. Water purveyors can reasonably control water quality in distribution systems, but continuously controlling what happens in internal plumbing systems is impossible. Many cross connections are created unknowingly and innocently by simple plumbing rearrangements.\n\nCross connection control also means the addition of control devices to protect against the occurrence of non-potable substances mixing with the potable.\n\nWhat does backflow prevention have to do with cross connection control?\nBackflow is a hydraulic condition that may occur during several types of events such as hydrant flows, main breaks, or any other system hydraulic imbalance. In many backflow conditions water pressure is lowered at one point in the system, and water at a higher elevation or higher pressure moves in a direction opposite to its normal flow. If backflow occurs where a cross connection to a non-potable substance exists, the substance can enter and pollute the water system.\n\nBackflow prevention involves the installation of devices, backflow preventers, to prevent the consequences of backflow incidents by minimizing the chances of non-potable substances mixing with potable water.\n\nCan't I tell when backflow occurs and take suitable action to minimize the consequences? Backflow in plumbing systems is often unnoticed. Many times it happens silently without the knowledge of any resident. It may occur briefly during a pressure fluctuation only to have normalcy restored before notice is taken of the situation. If the normal potable water was contaminated during the low-pressure period, the tainted water may still be present in the internal plumbing of the structure. Even with dilution with the normal water supply, the tainted water, depending on the contaminating substance, may contain enough of that contaminant to present health risks if ingested or if skin contact is made.\n\nPublic water purveyors are required to have a cross connection control program in place. Kennebec Water District has such a program. Under KWD's program, each structure is required to have an appropriate backflow prevention device on its service entrance. This policy is known as containment. Containment effectively keeps any contaminants generated by a cross connection in the structure within the structure and out of the public water supply's distribution system. KWD requires different types of backflow preventers based on the degree of hazard potential within the structure. A hospital, with devices such as sterilizers and aspirators connected to the internal water system, requires a top-of-the-line reduced pressure zone (RPZ) device, whereas a normal residence without any special water uses requires a low-end dual check backflow preventer. The devices vary in protective capabilities and in cost.\n\nMany homes and businesses do contain no apparent cross connections. The potential for development of a cross connection, however, is available in all homes and businesses. This potential risk must be addressed just as an existing physical cross connection must be addressed. KWD is seeking to protect 100% of the services within its distribution system. By completing this program, each structure will be protected from contamination or pollution originating within another structure on the distribution system.\n\nThere are many possibilities for cross connections within residential structures. As mentioned before, the extension of a hose into a non-potable substance, whether it is a pool, a sewer during a flushing procedure, a darkroom or laundry sink, or into any other foreign substance is a typical residential cross connection occurrence. The lawn and garden fertilizer and pesticide unit that attaches directly onto an outside hose is a classic cross connection scenario that has resulted in several documented backflow incidents.\n\nSome household appliances such as garbage disposals and washing machines have direct connections between the potable water system and sewer line or dirty water source. Also, many toilet fill valves, located in the tank of the toilet, are not of the anti-siphon design and may allow tank water to be drawn back into the household plumbing during backflow. Even a PVC garden hose left in the hot summer sun may increase in pressure to force water containing chemicals leached from the plastic hose itself back into the household plumbing.\n\nYes. The containment device is intended to protect the public water system. It will act to reduce the occurrence of backflow within the structure as well, but it will not completely prevent backflow from taking place internally. For this reason, knowledge of how backflow occurs and what steps can be taken to reduce the potential for a backflow incident in each building is essential. In industrial and commercial structures some fixture isolation occurs where additional backflow preventers are installed to protect against specific hazards. This fixture isolation can also take place on a residential level and is highly recommended.\n\nIn fact, hose bib backflow preventers are an easy way to prevent backflow involving outside hoses. Inspecting the internal plumbing of each structure within a distribution system would be a daunting, impossible task for a water purveyor, and help from individual owners is necessary to control all possibilities.\n\nThermal expansion is the buildup of pressure within the plumbing system of a structure due to the heating of water. When water is heated it expands. If the water is contained in an enclosed pipe while it is heated, it continues to increase in pressure until something gives. In a household plumbing system with a hot water heater or boiler, water is being heated frequently for the domestic needs of the household. If the pressure increase caused by the water heater's heating action is not relieved in some way – normally by someone opening a faucet on a hot water line – then the pressure continues to increase. When the system pressure reaches the preset level of the temperature /pressure (T/P) relief valve required with each hot water tank or boiler, the relief valve opens and exhausts water until pressure returns to normal. The pressure increase is directly attributable to thermal expansion.\n\nIn a system without a containment backflow preventer, the expanded water from the hot water heater would be forced back out into the distribution main. The pressure buildup would not occur. With a containment backflow device in place, however, the pressure is most likely trapped within the structure's plumbing. Pressure relief through the T/P relief valve may occur.\n\nA thermal expansion tank may be added to the internal plumbing system to control the pressure buildup in the plumbing and eliminate concerns with the operation of the T/P relief valve. The expansion tank absorbs the expanded water and allows the system to remain at a reasonable pressure.\n\nKWD is implementing its program to protect all its customers from the hazards of backflow incidents. KWD is aiding its customers in residential situations by providing low-cost backflow devices (less than $45 paid by the customer) and installing the devices, when plumbing allows, at no charge to the customer. Because KWD has no master plumber on staff, it is limited in how much contact it may have with private plumbing systems, but KWD has been able to procure devices that connect directly to its meter installation. For residences that have plumbing that will not support this type of device, a plumber will have to complete the work.\n\nOn industrial and commercial services that require a specialized device, plumbers are necessary for the complete installation.\n\nKWD also remains an active member of the Maine Chapter of the American Backflow Prevention Association. This is a group of water utilities, testers, plumbers, regulators, and industry people. The primary goals of the organization are education and certification of device testers.\n\nThere are testing procedures to determine if devices are functioning as they should. For the more complex devices, a differential pressure gauge and specialized testing procedures are necessary. These must be checked when installed and at least annually thereafter by a certified tester.\n\nNumerous backflow incidents occur annually. Many do not get publicized for a variety of reasons. Many are not recognized as backflow incidents. But there is a continuous flow of documentation on many cases of fatalities or serious injury due to cross connections.\n\nThe cancellation of the Holy Cross football season many years ago was due to a cross connection to an unsafe source. Cases of Legionnaire's disease have been traced to cooling tower cross connections. Several cases of illness or death due to the use of fertilizer and pesticide attachments to outside hoses have been noted.\n\nLocally, the contamination of the Norridgewock public water supply a few years ago was traced to a cross connection in an in-town restaurant. Even in KWD's system, we have seen backflow incidents (backflow of carbonic acid in a post-mix carbonated soda machine and a unsightly incident involving a water cooled compressed air unit in which a buildup of air pressure caused the eruption of a flush valve toilet were two past incidents).\n\nThere are opportunities for backflow incidents daily in water systems everywhere due to normal operations of the systems. Cross connection control and backflow prevention are the methods used to insure that the backflow conditions do not result in contamination of potable water supplies."

      "text": "What's this pink stuff\n\nThis is a common problem both in the UK and abroad. It most often occurs in bathrooms. The pink residue is from naturally occurring airborne bacteria which produces a pinkish or dark grey film on surfaces that are regularly moist including toilet bowls, showerheads, sink drains and tiles.\n\nThe exact species of bacteria is not known, most experts have concluded that this pink staining is most likely from the bacteria Serratia marcescens. These bacteria thrive on moisture, dust and phosphates and are widely distributed having been found naturally in soil, food and also in animals. The conditions for the survival of Serratia marcescens are minimal and the bacteria may even feed upon itself in the absence of other nutrients. On the Isle of Man we have noticed an increase in this type of complaint since we started orthophosphate dosing to combat plumbosolvency (the dissolving of lead from lead communication water pipes into the water supply). It could be possible the orthophosphate is being used as a food source for these particular bacteria.\n\nOften the pinkish film appears during and after new construction or activities such as the replacement of bathroom fittings. The dirt and dust stirred up from the work probably contains Serratia bacteria. Once airborne the bacteria seek moist environments to proliferate.\n\nSome people have even noticed the pink residue in their pet's water bowl, which causes no apparent harm and be easily cleaned away. Others have indicated that the bacteria is more apparent during a time of the year when the windows are open for the majority of the day. These airborne bacteria can come from any number of naturally occurring sources and the condition may be further aggravated if customers remove the chlorine from their water by way of an activated carbon filter.\n\nWhat to Do\n\nThe best solution to keep the surfaces free from the bacterial film is continual cleaning. A chlorinous compound is best, but use care with abrasives to avoid scratching the fittings which would then make them even more susceptible to bacteria. Chlorine bleach can be periodically stirred into the toilet cistern and flushed into the bowl itself. A proprietary toilet block placed in the cistern that contains a disinfectant can also be used. The porous walls of a toilet cistern can harbour many opportunistic organisms. Cleaning and flushing with chlorine will not necessarily eliminate the problem but will help to control the pink bacteria. Keep bathtubs and sinks wiped down and dry to avoid this problem."

They can tell you whether your water is regularly tested for that type of pesticide and how much, if any, has ever been found.\n\nIf you have a private well or if your water has not been tested for that type of pesticide, contact your state pesticide program. They can assist you in determining whether testing is warranted, choosing the type of analysis to be performed, identify laboratories capable of performing the analysis, and determining the significance of testing results."

The OCD people I guess can make COSTCO runs to stock their dorm rooms, but I bet others learn to refill their reusable bottles if they haven't already. Heck, my kids' HS has a special bottle refiller station - it isn't rocket science.\n\nYes. If you're buying \"spring water\" you're often just drinking a different community's TAP water. There's a graphic somewhere that shows which town's water you're drinking according to the brand you buy.\n\nAll of us on the parent board are of the same approximate generation. Have any of you had problems back in the 60's, 70's or 80's with plain ole tap water? When exactly did we think it wasn't safe and we had to buy the \"special\" stuff?\n\nUcba, thanks for the recommendation, but why distilled water? While I do wash my hands and brush my teeth with our tap water, I do not drink it or prepare food with it. We keep gallon jugs of spring water on hand for those purposes. We live in an area where all the homes have well water. There are many farms and manicured lawns in our immediate vicinity. The amount of chemicals that we observe going into the ground is staggering. So yup, we avoid consuming the water. We also have a centralized water filtration system in our basement. Not sure how much it helps.\n\nLorem, if you read the labels on the water containers most of them identify the source of the water. You are correct, brands like Dasani are just purified municipal water. But there are other brands that list the source as natural springs and identify where the water is coming from. But in either case, the water is probably cleaner that what is coming out of our well.\n\nI like our city water and will readily drink our tap water. I do still buy bottled water, though, because it seems no matter how well I wash a water bottle I still get sick if I reuse it. In situations when only well water is available, I have to drink bottled water because for some reason the well water makes my throat swell shut once in a while-- I know sulphur has that affect on me so I wonder if it could be traces of sulphur in the water. I try to only use bottled water in a situation when water in a glass really would not do, which isn't all that often. I read recently that the student government at my alma mater is pushing hard to ban water bottle sales, and I would have been really aggravated if they had done that while I was still there. I usually had my own bottles but if I ran out of water or ate an unplanned snack and needed something to drink, I would not have been pleased to have to buy pop instead of having a healthy choice.\n\nI wish more schools would have a 'no bottled water' initiative. Brita and other water filters are great for use in dorm rooms, and filling stations throughout campus are brilliant.\nWe're creating a nightmare for future generations at the rate at which we're consuming bottled water."

      "text": "Smart tips on going back to the tap for safe and great-tasting water\n\nBelow:\n\nWe all know it's cheaper to drink tap water than bottled water and the latest \"green\" campaign has stars like Cameron Diaz asking us to help save the world by \"filling our own bottle.\" But how can we be sure the water from our faucet is safe?\n\nAt some point not too long ago, Americans stopped trusting the water from their own house and started turning to companies like Dasani, Brita and Culligan to provide them with healthy, great-tasting water. But the tide is turning! Real Simple magazine's Kris Connell explains how we can determine if the water from our faucet is clean enough to drink and then offer some tips for finding the right filter to fit our family's needs and eliminate contaminants:\n\nHow Safe is Your Tap Water? Generally, our water is very safe. The U.S. has some of the cleanest drinking water in the world. According to the EPA, 9 out of 10 public water systems meet federal health and safety standards.\n\nA Great Place to Start Your Search Read the water-quality report that your utility company is required by law to release each year. Go to your water utility's website or to the EPA's site, which has links to scores of local water-quality reports.\n\nShould You Test Your Water? Even if the report is reassuring, you might want to test your water for lead and arsenic, both of which are potentially harmful to your or your children's health. Lead contamination can come from the plumbing in people's homes (most often in houses built before 1986), so it isn't accurately represented in water-quality reports. Arsenic is common in both well water and public water collected from wells. If you're worried about unregulated contaminants (if there's a factory upstream or someone in your household has a weak immune system) you might want to test for microorganisms and other contaminants. If you find your water has contaminants, contact your local water carrier.\n\nThe EPA does not test individual homes, and cannot recommend specific laboratories to test your drinking water. However, states do certify water testing laboratories. You can call your state certification officerto get a list of certified laboratories in your state. Depending on how many contaminants you test for, a water test can cost from $15 to hundreds of dollars.\n\nDo You Need to Use a Filter? If you learn that your water has lead, arsenic, or other contaminants, yes. And if you're concerned about your water quality for any reason, you should buy one. Filtering tap water is affordable and can remove everything from potentially dangerous chemicals and microbes to foul-tasting additives.\n\nChoosing Filter Based on Targeted Contaminant At the NSF site you can search for certified water filters by the contaminant you're targeting; click on \"Consumer,\" then \"Drinking Water\" or click here.\n\nA Few Other Common Water Problems\nHard Water: minerals in your water can mean residue on your clothes, body and household surfaces.\nTaste: if you water has a distinct taste, then it is a tell-tale sign that something is wrong.\nOdor: if your water has a distinct smell, then there is most likely a problem\nIron: reddish stains on your clothing, yellow colored water and a metallic taste could all be signs there is a high iron count in your water.\nCopper: metallic taste, corrosion on aluminum surfaces are signals that copper may be sneaking in from your plumbing.\n\nNo matter what the source, a home filtration system can purify your water further. Whether you need to eliminate contaminants or just correct a funny smell, there's a filter that can do the job.\n\nHow It Works: Faucet-mounted filters either replace the faucet aerator or screw on over it. They duplicate some or all of the filtration technologies used in pitchers.\nPros: Easy to install; lets you enjoy filtered water conveniently from your tap; makes cooking with filtered water easy\nCons: May work slowly; cartridges require frequent changing (at least every two to three months), and filtration can slow further with extended use.\nExamples: Chrome Brita On Tap filter, approx. $30, at most major retail stores. Two-pack of replacement filters: approx. $30; GE GXFM03C Faucet Mount Filter, approx. $25.\n\nUnder Sink\n\nHow It Works: These filters hook into the cold-water line under the sink and need to be attached to a wall or cabinet back. Filtered cold water is drawn through a separate faucet.\nPros: Filters quickly; cartridges can be long-lasting (change every three to six months).\nCons: Usually requires professional installation; filter cartridges can be hard to change.\nExamples: Whirlpool® Under Sink Main Faucet UltraEase™ Plus Filtration System, approx. $58. Replacement filter: approx. $30; Culligan US-600 ACE Slim Under Sink Water Filter System\n\nPoint of Entry — Whole House\n\nHow It Works: Point-of-entry filtration systems hook up where the water line enters a home, filtering water for cooking, cleaning, and bathing. Good for homes with hard water.\nPros: Filters all water entering your home; protects appliances.\nCons: Professional installation required; some brands need a filter change every three months.\nExamples:Culligan Valve-in-Head Whole House Water Filter, approx. $35, plus about $200 for installation. Replacement filter: approx. $7; Ace Valve in Head Whole House Water Filter, approx. $37, plus installation."

      "text": "Household water treatment (HWTS) methods, such as boiling or chlorination, have long been recommended in emergencies. While there is increasing evidence of HWTS efficacy in the development context, effectiveness in the acute emergency context has not been rigorously assessed. We investigated HWTS effectiveness in response to four acute emergencies by surveying 1,521 targeted households and testing stored water for free chlorine residual and fecal indicators. We defined \"effective use\" as the percentage of the targeted population with contaminated household water who used the HWTS method to improve stored drinking water microbiological quality to internationally-accepted levels.\n\nChlorine-based methods were distributed in all four emergencies, and filters in one emergency. Effective use ranged widely, from 0%-67.5%, with only one pre-existing chlorine program in Haiti and unpromoted boiling use in Indonesia reaching >20%. More successful programs provided an effective HWTS method, with the necessary supplies and training provided, to households with contaminated water who were familiar with the method before the emergency. HWTS can be effective at reducing the risk of unsafe drinking water in the acute emergency context. Additionally, by focusing on whether interventions actually improve drinking water quality in vulnerable households, \"effective use\" provides an important program evaluation metric."

      "text": "Why is water disinfection needed?\nDisinfection of drinking water is one of the major public health advances\nin the twentieth century. In the early 1900s, typhoid and cholera\nwere common throughout American cities; disinfection was a large factor\nin reducing these epidemics. Chlorine was the preferred disinfectant\nback then and continues to be the most widely used substance for water\ndisinfection in the United States\n\nPublic health officials overwhelmingly agree: In a 1992 survey of\npublic health officials, 92% agreed that chlorine in drinking water\nis safe. Safe drinking water has played a key role in: a 50% plus\nincrease in life expectancy, from about 45 years in the early 1900s\nto about 76 years at present; a dramatic decline in infant mortality\nrates and the virtual elimination of cholera, typhoid fever, dysentery\nand gastroenteritis, as well as many other waterborne diseases which\nonce killed tens of thousands of Americans.\n\nWhat are disinfection by-products?\nDisinfectants such as chlorine can react with naturally occurring\nmaterials, such as plant and other organic matter, in the water to\nform unintended by-products that may pose health risks. With more\nand more chlorine added to drinking water supplies to meet increased\ndisinfection requirements, the risk of these unintended by-products\nreaching unhealthful levels has increased. The challenge for water\nsuppliers is to meet new disinfection requirements, while minimizing\nthe levels of disinfection by-products (DBPs).\n\nHow\nis PWD minimizing disinfection by-products?\nAt the PWD, careful consideration has been given to this matter. In\n1994, the PWD switched to an alternative disinfectant, ozone, to meet\nthe increased disinfection requirements necessary to protect our customers\nfrom more resistant, microbial contaminants such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium.\nAn additional benefit of the conversion to ozone was a reduction in\nthe levels of chlorine needed to disinfect the water and the potential\nfor DBPs. One such group of DBPs, trihalomethane or THM as it is commonly\nknown, can be harmful if levels continually exceed 80 ppb in the drinking\nwater. As seen in the chart, THM levels have always been well below\nlevels that may prompt concern, and were basically eliminated after\nthe switch to ozone."

      "text": "Treating Water\n\nadvertisement\n\nHere's the scoop on water: It's no longer safe to drink water straight out of a river, a stream—or even a pond. That's because in recent years, backcountry parasites such as Giardia Lamblia and Cryptosporidium have set up shop in our wild places, traveling from mammalian intestines to pristine-looking streams through feces. Other contaminants include pesticides and herbicides.\n\nThe simple fact is this : If you don't treat backcountry water, you're risking spending your vacation in intestinal distress. Here's how to stay out of trouble:\n\nBoiling. This is the tried and true method of killing microscopic beasties, but it takes a lot of fuel. Fires work, but they're not exactly minimum impact, plus your water ends up tasting like woodsmoke. If you do use a fire, decant the water from one bottle to another to get rid of the sour burnt taste. Or throw in a couple of herbal tea-bags.\n\nThere's a lot of disagreement over just how long you need to boil water for. Some agencies recommend five minutes or even longer, especially at higher altitudes. Others say that a strong rolling boil at any altitude will kill the cooties. The Centers for Disease Control recommends three minutes to make sure everything is really and truly dead, including hardy viruses (more a problem in developing countries than in the American backcountry).\n\nIodine. Iodine has some compelling advantages: it's lightweight, reliable, and trouble-free. But it does not kill the most recent arrival on the microbial scene: Cryptosporidium, which causes giardia-like symptoms and has no cure (the disease runs its course in 7 -10 days). Iodine is available in liquid, crystals, or tablets. Read the directions for how much to use and how long to wait—more iodine and longer waiting times are required in cold or especially dirty water. To mask the flavor, you can drop in tablets made by Potable Aqua. Or stick a piece of lemon peel in your water bottle—it'll freshen several liters. Note: it's not a good idea to use iodine for days on end, but it is an excellent idea to carry a few tablets, even if you plan to mostly filter or boil your water. That way, even if you don't feel like filtering or boiling (say it's terrible weather and you're exhausted), you'll still be able to drink.\n\nFilters. Few pieces of backpacking equipment are as vilified as water filters. Think of filters as microscopic strainers. They give you clean water with no bad taste—and no residue of fugglies floating in your canteen. To choose a filter, first look at the\"absolute\" pore size, which should be 1 micron or less for hiking in North America: That'll take care of both Giardia and Cryptosporidium. For hiking abroad, you may also need a filter that can handle viruses.\n\nFuss-free filtering. Clogging is the main filter problem. You can help prevent it by keeping the filter element as clean as possible. Start by using clear water. If that's not an option, let clouded water sit for a while so that the gunk settles on the bottom. You can also pre-filter water through a bandanna or use the prefilter that comes with some filter systems. If you're filtering directly from the water source, use a float to keep your intake tube off of the river or lake bottom.\n\nUnclogging. Filters clog because they do their job: The gunk that clogs them is gunk you'd otherwise be drinking. Make sure you take your filter's directions into the field with you. Some ceramic filters can be cleaned by scrubbing the element with an old toothbrush. Others can be wiped clean. Some filters can be backwashed, which is a temporary solution. Reverse the intake and output tubes, then pump backwards so the water flushes the gunk out of the filter element. After backwashing, you must run clean water that has been treated with iodine or bleach through the filter and its hoses.

      "text": "It's been scientifically proven that 60% of the human body is made up of water. Add to that the fact that a person needs a minimum quantity of 3 liters consumption of water per day in order to keep oneself fit. These two just go on to prove the essentiality of water for us humans. It can also be considered as one of the basic necessities i.e. food, clothing and shelter and water undoubtedly forms a part of the food component as it is a necessary element required for proper digestion of the food consumed by any person. So, it can indisputably be deduced that without water a person would be in peril.\n\nWith the increasing population and pollution, the necessity and need for the hour, in any area of the world is more of getting hold of required amounts of water, and more so getting pure water, than just water itself. Industrial wastes, wastes from households and many other polluting elements are present in all sorts of water ranging from water for bathing, washing and even drinking water in alarming and life threatening levels.\n\nWhat is a person to do under such circumstances? There is only but one solution for this problem. Getting a water purifier in order to ensure that the water one is consuming is potable, safe and will not lead to any negative consequences to his health. For this, one needs to first understand the types of purifiers available in the market, what exactly it is and how it works. By the end of this article, you'll have a fair knowledge about the functioning and working of a simple RO purifier.\n\nLet us first look at the basics.\n\nWhat is this Reverse Osmosis?\n\nReverse Osmosis works on a similar theory as osmosis, but in the reverse route, wherein, external pressure (as opposed to internal pressure in osmosis) is used on the sect enclosing salty solution, then pure water is enforced out of the cell and the salt is preserved. As the water is removed from the salty solution, the concentration of the water increases along with the osmotic pressure. This process goes on till the osmotic pressure value of the left over salt solution inside the cell matches with the external pressure used.\n\nIt involves a method in which dissolved inorganic solids (such as salts) are removed from a solution (such as water). This is achieved by domestic water pressure pushed through the tap water via a semi permeable membrane. The membrane (about the same thickness as an average cell phone) permits only the water to flow by, not the dirt or impurities. These go down the drain.\n\nKind and number of total dissolved solids (TDS) contained in the water\n\nThe type and quality of filters and membranes attached for use in the RO System.\n\nWhat are the basic components of any RO purifier? (Must be checked before zeroing in on the purchase)\n\nCold Water Line Valve\n\nPre-Filter (s)\n\nReverse Osmosis Membrane\n\nPost filter (s)\n\nAutomatic Shut Off Valve (SOV\n\nCheck Valve\n\nFlow Restrictor\n\nStorage Tank\n\nFaucet &\n\nThe Drain Line\n\nIs 100% purification guaranteed?\n\nNo. None of the RO purifiers, be it any brand or company, can guarantee a 100% purification (even if it claims so), as like any other scientific process, this has limited effectiveness .Reverse osmosis will eliminate up to 96-99% of basic ions, and 99.5+% of all other contaminations.\n\nAnd, the most important of all.\n\nWhy RO?\n\nYou first need to make your mind up your mind about whether you want to go for a UV based purifier or an RO based purifier. Research indicates that UV purifiers can eliminate bacteria and viruses but not additional contaminants like nitrates, arsenic, fluorides, mercury etc., Moreover, UV filters would not lessen the quantity of total dissolved solid (TDS) in the water. The rational and prudent decision here would be to opt for an RO purifier as it would ensure increased levels of purity in the water in comparison to a UV purifier. As, reverse osmosis membranes hold back all kinds of impurities, it is the ideal choice as a water purifier.\n\nTo know about how to get the best water purifier, you will have to familiarize yourself with the various techniques involved as well as the methods. Once you know about the nuances of the functioning of the systems, components used, etc. you will be able to choose the right and the best water purifier. To collect information about the same as well as to know about the various available brands, just go online. You will come across a wealth of information materials. Do not miss the comments and reviews posted by users in various water forums. Users post real experiences both positive and negative about the home water purifier systems they use. You will then be able to choose the brand as well.\n\nDo not just blindly buy a home water purifier only because it is the best water purifier based on your survey. You should first get the water you receive tested. You can also come across water testing labs. Once you get the water tested you will know which home water purifier, i.e. whether you need reverse osmosis or UV water purifier or some other system or blends.\n\nThe UV water purifier is used at homes where water received in the tap or any source and full of micro organisms. Most of these micro organisms cause water borne diseases that may play havoc on your health. And if you drink such water regularly without getting it purified, you will nurture diseases that will prove dangerous for you in the long run. The UV outfitted in the UV water purifier operates deactivating all micro organisms. Go for such a system with multi-purifying techniques involved. It is the need of the hour to protect your health against water born diseases by drinking only purified water.\n\nWe all know that water is a very important part of our lives. In fact we cannot live for even a single day without water. On the other hand this is the only thing that is causing maximum deaths in our country. Countless water borne disease\n\ns have spread today like Cholera, Escherichia and many more. The best way out to avoid such health problems is to get a water purifier at home. People often get confused between water filters and water purifiers. Water purifiers remove smallest bacteria's like E. coli, Cholera, and Salmonella whereas the water filters do not remove all these. It is very important to have a good water purifier for you and your family's safety.\n\nAlthough water filters remove the chemicals and the foul odor but they do not remove the smallest virus micro organisms only water purifies can do that. Now that you know the difference between water filter and water purifier, it depends on you which one to choose. There are many types of water purifiers in the market which you can get at very reasonable prices like; Reverse Osmosis, UV purifiers, under sinks purifiers and portable water purifiers. Reverse Osmosis water purifiers are generally meant for the commercial purposes and used at big places. It removes the unwanted impurities and bacteria's but is not so good at preserving the minerals in water.\n\nIf you are looking for a water purifier for your house then UV purifiers is the best to go for. It removes all unnecessary impurities and preserves precious minerals with a good taste. These are EPA approved water purifiers that take care of all the impurities present in them. Although the tap water is also treated by municipal corporation but the viruses and bacteria present in it can cause various health problems. Under sink water purifiers come under this type of water purifier only. Another factor that is added to these purifiers is their portability. Many water purifiers are made in such a way that you can carry them easily on any outings like picnics, holidays etc.\n\nYou can buy these water purifiers from any home appliances shop. It is very important to go for a good water purifier and company. Since these water purifiers require routine maintenance therefore you must buy it from a good and reputed company. There are many online sites also from where you can choose the most appealing and affordable water purifiers. These sites give you the best deals for buying anything you want. From a house hold material to a big commercial one you can get everything on these sites. You can easily choose the mode of payment for your water purifiers.\n\nPermeate stream consists of: Product water which has been forced through the membrane & is virtually free of TDS\n\nParameters that affect RO:\n\nWater Temperature:RO system ratings are based on 770F/ 250C water temperature\n\ni.e. : RO system rated at 20 GPD (gallons per day) at 340F/10C will only produce 6 GPD\n\nFeed Water Pressure: A lack in water pressure (less than 40 PSI) will reduce product water; this can be helped with the aid of a booster pump\n\nContaminants in Feed Water: Large particles, iron concentration or high levels of hardness in feed water can cause clogging of the membrane. Clogging of the membrane can decrease its life\n\nMicroorganisms: RO membranes can filter out bacteria, depending on the bacteria size, however this may cause fouling of the membrane as bacteria can begin to grow through pores of membrane causing BACTERIA CREEP – RO systems should not be installed on non-potable water\n\nSo, you have read about the benefits of using RO water purifiers. You have read about this purification mechanism after getting your water tested in the nearest lab and you have been recommended of using a reverse osmosis filter system.\n\nIt is not only the information material but also reviews and comments that have let you know about the best brand and variants of RO water purifiers available in the market or via direct sales. This is exactly what a wise consumer does before buying a product, especially a home consumer durable product. And when it comes to water purifiers, more effort and time is put because health cannot be compromised. With 80% of the diseases in the world being water borne, it is a must to drink water that is purified in advanced water purifiers involving the right mechanism.\n\nWhen you buy a reverse osmosis filtration system, do consider the storage capacity as well. For a small family a low storage will do and vice versa. Most RO water purifiers that are a bit high on the budget come with advantageous features such as:\n\nMulti-stage filtration with the use of multiple cartridges in addition to RO membrane\n\nMicro switch float feature to stop over flow of water\n\nAuto shut off mechanism, thus saving energy for you\n\nManual flush facility, cleaning the cartridge and enhancing its life\n\nPost taste enhancer for reviving the original taste of water\n\nTDS reduction to maximum percentage and TDS support facility\n\nEase of cleaning the storage tank totally from inside from time to time\n\nFacility for elimination of tough new-age contaminants.\n\nOf course, there are downsides associated with the reverse osmosis filtration mechanism. But for every purification mechanism, there are both pros and cons. So, it is advisable to go for the highly hi-tech reverse osmosis filtration system of a reputed brand; in such a system, the cons are reduced compared to those that come with simple RO mechanisms.\n\nThe biggest downside of using a reverse osmosis filtration system is the amount of water wasted during the filtering process besides the time it takes to purify water. But even that makes sense if your water is high in TDS content. Only the use of such a mechanism will prove effective to ensure that you consume only 100% safe and pure water.\n\nIt is also removes many taste, color, odour-producing chemicals, particulates, total dissolved solids, turbidity, and radium. There are two types of Reverse Osmosis Water System membranes typically used in home or cottage water purification systems:\n\n1. Thin Film Composite (TFC)\n\n2. Cellulose Triacetate (CTA).\n\nTFC membranes will filter out considerably more contaminants than a CTA membrane however, they are more susceptible to degradation by chlorine.\n\nAre you are considering a RO system on a chlorinated water supply? It is important that it include quality activated carbon pre-filters to avoid this degradation.\n\nA typical RO system is composed of first, activated carbon (GAC) pre-filters, the RO membrane, a storage tank, and a faucet to deliver the purified water to your counter top.\n\nRO Water System\n\nMost people today feel safe that the water they are using for drinking is safe. This may be true for people that obtain their water source from their Municipality. However, the water received is not 100% guaranteed to be clean. People using water from private sources such as wells are at an even higher risk of drinking contaminated and unsafe water.RO Water System units are used to filter and flush away contaminants in the water.\n\nHow do RO Water Systems Work?\n\nThe water purification process of Reverse Osmosis is done by forcing water through a plastic membrane. The membrane is small and only allows water molecules to pass through. Larger compounds that may be found in the water are rejected and do not continue through the system. After the water has passed through the membrane, it then goes through a special filter. The filter is made to get rid of dangerous chemicals such as; chlorine, mercury, copper, chromium, and even pesticides. When the water has been filtered it is then stored in a water tank until it is ready for use. The water will go through a carbon filter just before use to enhance the waters' taste.\n\nWhat are RO Systems Used For?\n\nAlthough Reverse Osmosis water systems are used to purify water, it is necessary that the water is first evaluated. Water sources such as wells need to be tested for other types of water contaminants such as microorganisms. Once it has been proven that the water is safe to drink you can further enhance the quality and safeness of the water by using a RO Water System. Like many other water filtering systems, Reverse Osmosis is great for purifying untreated sources of water, but is not completely effective against microbiological contamination.\n\nBenefits of Using RO Water System\n\nRO water systems are a lot more efficient when compared to other water filtrating systems. An approximate 3 gallons are used to obtain 1 gallon of purified water with Reverse Osmosis. This type of water filtration allows water in your home to be mineral-free. As most of us know, certain minerals can be harmful to our health. Untreated water commonly contains minerals such as; lead, manganese, salt, calcium, and iron. Minerals are not the only hazard; chemicals such as fluoride are also often found in untreated water.\n\nChoosing the Right RO Water System\n\nOne important thing to consider when purchasing a RO system is selecting between a CTA or TFC unit. A cellulose triacetate membrane (CTA) uses an organic membrane that is more susceptible to bacterial growth. The thin film composite (TFC) is made from inorganic material and is not prone to growing bacteria. While there are many more types of RO systems to choose from, CTA and TFC units are among the more common ones. Another thing to remember while looking for the ideal RO system is if you want one that includes a tank. Tanks are used for storing filtered water, but can take up a lot of room and run a bit slower. Systems without tanks usually work at a faster speed and are more compact. Lastly, do not forget to search for a system that is efficient. Some units only purify 1 gallon of water per every 6 gallons used. This makes the efficiency rate less than 15%. Ideally, each gallon should only use 2-4 gallons of unpurified water.\n\nMembranes are a selective barrier used in anything. The idea of membranes has been derived from the biological cell membrane. It is an artificial polymeric barrier used to stop any kind of dust or dirt from getting further deep into any kind of system.\n\nRO means Reverse Osmosis. Reverse osmosis is a method of filtration. This filtration system removes any kind of big molecules by applying pressure on one side of the membrane. The use of the RO system is applied in filtering the water in the following forms:\n\nDrinking water\n\nBoiler feed water\n\nSea water\n\nDesalination\n\nUltra pure water\n\nUSP water\n\nWater reuse\n\nBrackish water\n\nHigh flow commercial application\n\nReverse Osmosis system is the most effective system for any kind of cleaning of water. The basic filtering media is the RO membrane.\n\nHow does an RO membrane work?\n\nThe RO membrane is a membrane that is a form of a filter in general terms. The pore sizes of its elements can be between 0.1 to 5,000 nanometers (nm). The size depends upon the component being filtered from the water. The smallest filter can restrict minerals and salts to pass through the membrane and purify the water through a pressure system. The pressure system works by applying pressure to the water which forces the water to gush through the membrane which in the process purifies it and cleans the water. The membrane systems are strong enough to filter different bacterias and germs from the water as well.\n\nSea water RO membranes: This kind of RO membranes are the best and very high in quality as they clear all kind of salts in the sea water and desalinate it completely for easy drinkable human use.\n\nThe life of a commercial RO membrane:\n\nNormally the life expectancy of any RO membrane is about 2years. After 2 years or maybe a little more or less they loose their way of purifying completely. They should be changed by the time they loose their life so that the water purification system stays. The water after purification gets clean and leaves behind a whole mass of different particles like oil, silica, clay, iron, sulfur and acids.\n\nRO means Reverse Osmosis. It is a process that is used for water filtration. The impurities of water are cleaned and filtered through the machinery used in the RO system and bring it in drinkable form. The RO system works so well that it can clear all kind of impurities including bacteria and minerals and other such particles that cause water contamination. The RO system is used also to filter acids, chemicals, gases and several other liquid items.\n\nThe working of the RO system:\n\nThe RO system works with the help of a membrane. The membrane is used to separate all kind of particles and other materials which reduce concentration materials between different solutions.\n\nA high pressure pump is fit in the machinery that purifies water. The machinery has two tanks that are used for holding water. The first tank holds the contaminated water to which full pressure is applied by the machine and forcing it to pass through the membrane into the second tank. Due to the forceful passing through the membrane; all kinds of particles and molecules contaminating the water remain in the membrane leaving the water completely pure. This clean and pure water is drinkable for humans.\n\nThe duty of the RO system:\n\nThe reverse osmosis system works for long hours without exhausting. It is used in industries and factories on large and small scale. It is needed to clean all kind of impurities and other ions from the water. The membrane that does the main work of cleaning the water lasts for about two years.\n\nThe reverse osmosis system plants are available with capacities that go from 25 GDP to 500,000 GDP. It cleans the feed water also which has the capacity of TDS water capacity of 1000 ppm to 5000 ppm.\n\nThe RO systems is highly used in Municipalities for the common public use. It is very important to provide clean and healthy water for drinking purpose to people. This water is used for the following things:\n\nMicro electronics\n\nFood\n\nBeverages\n\nPower\n\nMarines\n\nPharmaceutical facilities\n\nCompany designs:\n\nMost companies design Reverse Osmosis systems that are low in cost and high in producing the best results. The filters are designed in such a way that the system is complete with all kinds of pipes and fitting material. The plant also includes a complete manual that helps in fitting the whole ting easily.\n\nThe plants include:\n\nMembrane elements\n\nValves\n\nFilters\n\nPumps\n\nNano filtration equipment\n\nUltra filtration equipment\n\nFitting manual\n\nThe RO systems have all the sense of draining only those components that are impure. The things that are used for the cleaning of the water are not strained by their membrane. The membrane does not filter chlorine and other such things that are added to water for making it pure.\n\nThe RO system has smaller plants that can be fitted in homes. The residential plants are quite small and quite adjustable to all kind of domestic designs.\n\nHi-Tech Sweet Water Technologies Private Ltd. is a reliable offshore water treatment development company in India.\n\nThe Company deals into Commercial & Industrial RO Systems also along with Domestic System. The company manufactures packaged RO systems for ground, bore well, well, river and tap water applications in standard capacities of potable water production from 8 Liter per hour to 1,00,000 Liters per hour, single, double, triple tube water filters with and without UV attachment, Softener, DM Plants & water vending machines in various capacity. We can design, manufacture and install customized systems to meet our clients' requirements.\n\nHitech RO manufactures, sales and service commercial RO systems, industrial RO systems and domestic RO systems. Hitech RO has gained a great demand in the market with quality product and after sales service. Long lasting performance, effectiveness in purification and reliability are the characteristic features of all Hitech RO water purifiers."

If it's too high (or if serious pathogens are detected) they will put out a warning telling people to boil or avoid using the water, but it isn't ever zero even on good days. It's also a pretty standard experiment in beginning microbiology courses to plate tap water and see what grows up.\n\ngreybird\n\nthe article blames the neti pot, but shouldn't we be blaming the water? where did they get this water? a lake? or is Louisiana using inadequate chlorination?\n\nif snorting water is strongly associated with brain amoebas, wouldn't we see babies dropping dead nationwide??\n\nsad story: ridiculous conclusion.\n\n Marja Erwin\n\nAnd I thought I had trouble with neti pots, just from water painfully sloshing around inside my ears for weeks afterwards.

It can of course survive for a finite time in cooler water if it is flushed from the spring into a river or something. You generally do not risk exposure in cool water.So, it would seem that the water source for these people in Louisiana has to be either A, quite warm, or B, at least in close proximity to warmer waters that support populations of the amoebas.

      "text": "Tag Archives: pollution\n\nPost navigation\n\nStorm-water ponds are the closest alternative source of water for many people living in urban areas. In an emergency this source of water may be all that is available to you. Eventually any water you have stored will be consumed and the water in a storm-water pond may be the difference between life and death. With the proper treatment your local storm-water pond can be a great backup source of drinking water.\n\nIndustrial storm-water pond (source: info.evergreen.ca)\n\nStorm-water presents a unique set of challenges during treatment. Because storm-water ponds collect surface water, the water is exposed to all the contaminants on the ground in the catchment area. This includes but is not limited to pesticides and fertilizers applied to lawns, motor oil and gasoline leaking from vehicles and litter like cigarette buts. It all ends up is the storm-water pond. Those chemicals are already in storm-water ponds on a normal day. During an emergency there may be additional contamination from sewage runoff from an overloaded or broken sewage system. The water in the pond will also contain all the microorganisms like ecoli, giardia and cryptosporidium normally in surface water. Any one of these will make you very sick if you get infected with them.\nFinally, there will be high levels of nitrates in storm-water ponds. Too much nitrates consumed by young children can cause blue baby syndrome.\n\nThe first step in treating water from a storm-water pond is straining. Straining the water through a cloth or loose sand filter will remove large particles (ones you could pick up with your fingers). Remove as much of the suspended particles from the water as you can. Straining the water first will extend the life of your proper water filter.\n\nIf you have a clarifying agent like aluminum sulfate, this is the best time to add it to the water. It will make contaminants too small to be filtered become attracted to each other and become significantly larger. Larger particles are easier to remove from the water. Let the water sit still for at least 30 minutes without disturbing it. All the newly formed large particles (called floc) will sink to the bottom. When you take the water from this container, make sure you leave the majority of the settled material at the bottom of the container.\n\nUrban Storm-water pond (source: greenbmp.blogspot.com)\n\nThe next step is to filter the water. Filter the water even if it looks clear, the human eye is five times too weak to detect dangerous levels of particles. Filter the water at least once through an activated carbon filter. Activated carbon is known to remove many different chemicals from water including pesticides, chlorine and fluoride. Activated carbon is not the same as charcoal. Charcoal is similar, it can remove toxins from water but it is nowhere near the efficiency of activated carbon.\n\nThe third step is oxidation. Oxidation will help with disinfection as most disinfectant chemicals are also oxidizers. Chemicals like sodium hypochlorite and potassium permanganate are both oxidizers and disinfectants. Oxidation will break down many of the remaining contaminants and inactivate many of the remaining bacteria. Keep adding the oxidizer/disinfectant till you can detect a residual after 20 minutes. The 20 minutes is the minimum you should wait for a gallon of water. Wait longer for larger volumes. This is because oxidation is a chemical reaction that isn't instant. It needs time to complete the reaction.\n\nThe fourth step is to filter the water again. Filtering again is necessary because the disinfection/oxidation step will create some potentially carcinogenic byproducts. We filter before oxidation to minimize the amount of chlorine (or other chemical) and to limit the possibility of forming dangerous byproducts. We filter the second time to remove any byproducts that have been formed.\n\nThe final step is to boil the water. This will help with disinfection, but the main goal of boiling at this point is to remove any volatile chemicals. Any chemical with a boiling point lower than water will be removed after boiling.\n\nA note about disinfection. If all of these steps are followed there is no need for a step dedicated for disinfection. Between the oxidation and the boiling of the water any microorganisms will be inactivated. If you are storing the water for a long time then add some sodium hypochlorite for a residual disinfectant. The residual disinfectant will prevent the water from becoming recontaminated before you drink it.\n\nOne additional possible step is to aerate the water. Ponds are frequently stagnant. Stagnant water is green with algae, it smells bad and tastes worse. After the water is made potable, transfer the water back and forth between two glasses. This adds oxygen to the water and will make the water taste better.\n\nThis may seem like a lot of work for something as small as a storm-water pond. What I have described are the basic steps to turn the potentially toxic water in the pond into clean and safe drinking increaseWhat do you do with your unused and expired medications? How do you get rid of used motor oil and solvents? Your painting is done but you have some paint left over, what do you do with it?\nMany people will say \"I pour it down the sink or flush it down the toilet\". Even more people will lie when they say they don't put it down the drain. Your drains are not garbage disposals for all our waste. Doctors usually recommend that expired medications get flushed down the toilet. This line of reasoning is to prevent children and pets from consuming the drugs. Maybe a doctor can expand on their reasoning more, the purpose of this article is to make a case for why using the toilet to dispose of medication is a bad idea.\n\nWhy is dumping things down the drain such a bad idea? The answer is both simple and complicated at the same time. The simple answer is that everything that goes down the drain in whole or in part survives long enough to make it back into drinking water supplies. The long answer is that contaminates survive the sewer and waste water treatment and are released back into the environment with the treated water. Then the lakes and rivers are used for drinking water. The contaminants survive the drinking water treatment and enter our drinking water. Most of these contaminants survive because the largest part of waste water treatment is biological. Therefore, anything non organic will either pass through the treatment or disrupt the treatment process or become part of the biological organisms that are there to break down waste.\n\nIn either scenario, and really all scenarios happen all the time, contamination enters the environment. In 2011, a shipment of municipal biosolids from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada was refused at the American border. The biosolids are supposed to cross the border for disposal. This shipment was refused due to radioactivity. The radioactivity came from cancer patients as the chemicals from chemotherapy pass through the body and the wastewater plant all while remaining radioactive. Radioactivity is easy to detect and in this example the chemicals came from people's bodily waste which is supposed to go down the drain. I only mention this example because it so clearly outlines how persistent many chemicals can be.\n\nSome chemicals mimic our hormones and disrupt our natural body systems. They have been found to cause feminization of fish and are believed to cause early onset of puberty in humans. These chemicals can come from people's medication and from all our waste. BPA is the most famous hormone mimic. It come from the breakdown of plastics and mimics estrogen in humans. Other pharmaceuticals tend to do what they are designed to do, just now they are affecting the wrong people. Most other chemicals just cause cancer.\n\nThis contamination isn't limited to water. Earlier I mentioned that the chemicals can enter organisms. This is especially true of plants. Plants will absorb these chemicals and then they enter the food chain. I won't describe the food chain here, all you need to know is that the concentration increased the higher up the chain. This is called biomagnification. The apex predators get poisoned first. The main problem with biomagnification is, we are the species that eat the most other animals.\n\nThere was a study in Scanadnavia that found flame retardants in cancer patients. They traced the chemical back to the bread they had all eaten. Then back to the wheat in the field where biosolids were spread. The flame retardants were found in the municipal wastewater facility and the municipal sewers. It was traced back to one manufacturer who was putting flame retardants down the drain as part of their process. I can tell you this happens everywhere. Even if you live on a remote septic system, there is always someone upstream. Hardly seems worth it for dumping chemicals down the drain.\n\nYou might be wondering why this matters to you. Simply, it matters because we all have a part in what we put down the drain. This is true whether you live in a large metropolitan area or a remote cabin on a well and septic system. What we release into the environment comes back at us in many different directions. Detecting these chemicals is difficult because there are so many different chemicals out there that nobody can check for them all or even most of them. A lot of these chemicals pass through store bought filters. Many of these molecules are smaller than the water molecule. That means every filter is ineffective against them. To put is simply, this problem affects everyone."

      "text": "WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today are announcing important steps to ensure that standards and guidelines on fluoride in drinking water continue to provide the maximum protection to the American people to support good dental health, especially in children. HHS is proposing that the recommended level of fluoride in drinking water can be set at the lowest end of the current optimal range to prevent tooth decay, and EPA is initiating review of the maximum amount of fluoride allowed in drinking water.\n\nThese actions will maximize the health benefits of water fluoridation, an important tool in the prevention of tooth decay while reducing the possibility of children receiving too much fluoride. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention named the fluoridation of drinking water one of the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.\n\n\"One of water fluoridation's biggest advantages is that it benefits all residents of a community—at home, work, school, or play,\" said HHS Assistant Secretary for Health Howard K. Koh, MD, MPH. \"Today's announcement is part of our ongoing support of appropriate fluoridation for community water systems, and its effectiveness in preventing tooth decay throughout one's lifetime.\"\n\n\"Today both HHS and EPA are making announcements on fluoride based on the most up to date scientific data,\" said EPA Assistant Administrator for the Office of Water Peter Silva. \"EPA's new analysis will help us make sure that people benefit from tooth decay prevention while at the same time avoiding the unwanted health effects from too much fluoride.\"\n\nHHS and EPA reached an understanding of the latest science on fluoride and its effect on tooth decay prevention, and the development of dental fluorosis that may occur with excess fluoride consumption during the tooth forming years, age 8 and younger. Dental fluorosis in the United States appears mostly in the very mild or mild form – as barely visible lacy white markings or spots on the enamel. The severe form of dental fluorosis, with staining and pitting of the tooth surface, is rare in the United States.\n\nThere are several reasons for the changes seen over time, including that Americans have access to more sources of fluoride than they did when water fluoridation was first introduced in the United States in the 1940s. Water is now one of several sources of fluoride. Other common sources include dental products such as toothpaste and mouth rinses, prescription fluoride supplements, and fluoride applied by dental professionals. Water fluoridation and fluoride toothpaste are largely responsible for the significant decline in tooth decay in the U.S. over the past several decades.\n\nHHS' proposed recommendation of 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water replaces the current recommended range of 0.7 to 1.2 milligrams. This updated recommendation is based on recent EPA and HHS scientific assessments to balance the benefits of preventing tooth decay while limiting any unwanted health effects. These scientific assessments will also guide EPA in making a determination of whether to lower the maximum amount of fluoride allowed in drinking water, which is set to prevent adverse health effects.\n\nThe new EPA assessments of fluoride were undertaken in response to findings of the National Academies of Science (NAS). At EPA's request, NAS reviewed new data on fluoride in 2006 and issued a report recommending that EPA update its health and exposure assessments to take into account bone and dental effects and to consider all sources of fluoride. In addition to EPA's new assessments and the NAS report, HHS also considered current levels of tooth decay and dental fluorosis and fluid consumption across the United States.\n\nComments regarding the EPA documents, Fluoride: Dose-Response Analysis For Non-cancer Effects and Fluoride: Exposure and Relative Source Contribution Analysis should be sent to EPA at FluorideScience@epa.gov. The documents can be found at \n\nThe notice of the proposed recommendation will be published in the Federal Register soon and HHS will accept comments from the public and stakeholders on the proposed recommendation for 30 days at CWFcomments@cdc.gov. HHS is expecting to publish final guidance for community water fluoridation by spring 2011. You may view a prepublication version of the proposed recommendation at: \n\nMore information about the national drinking water regulations for fluoride:\n\nOne Thought on \"Preventing tooth decay while preventing excessive exposure to flouride\"\n\nThe first lawsuits against the U.S. Atomic bomb program were not over radiation, but over fluoride damage. US government and its multinationals are capable of killing Americans for profit, conversion and for war preparations. None of you may be aware of the extent to which a government is willing to damage the health of its own citizens and it is best illustrated in USA. I am reminded of the fluoride story in USA. During the Manhattan Project, which built the first atomic bomb massive quantities of fluoride were essential for the manufacture of bomb-grade uranium and plutonium for nuclear weapons. To protect the secret atom bomb development the US government went to extreme cover-up operations. During the Atom bomb development in USA plenty of fluoride waste was produced and it spread to surrounding areas and killed humans and animals. US government wanted to keep the bomb project a secret. So their scientists created fake research reports saying that the fluoride waste is good for teeth. The end result was fluoridisation of drinking water, fluoride tooth paste for the whole world.\n\nFluoride is one of the most toxic chemicals known, emerged as the leading chemical health hazard of the U.S atomic bomb program, both for workers and for nearby communities. Atom bomb scientists and engineers went to work to create proof to show that fluoride is safe for humans in low doses like the fiction created by the nuclear scientists that radiation in low doses are good for health. They secretly provided evidence useful in litigation against defense contractors for fluoride injury to citizens. Human studies were required. Bomb program researchers played a leading role in the design and implementation of the most extensive U.S. study of the health effects of fluoridating public drinking water, conducted in Newburgh, New York from 1945 to 1956. Then, in a classified operation code-named Program F, they secretly gathered and analyzed blood and tissue samples from Newburgh citizens, with the cooperation of State Health Department personnel. The original secret version of a 1948 study published by Program F scientists in the Journal of the American Dental Association shows that evidence of adverse health effects from fluoride was censored by the most powerful government department, in U.S. which is the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) for reasons of so called national security. The bomb program's fluoride safety studies were conducted at the University of Rochester, site of one of the most notorious human radiation experiments, in which unsuspecting hospital patients were injected with toxic doses of radioactive plutonium. In the fifties there were seminars that hailed the health benefits of lower levels of radiation for humans. Looking back, it was the publicity hype of the nascent nuclear scientists to promote their profession. They envisaged unlimited fusion power very soon and Homi Bhabha claimed that India will achieve it very soon. Homi Bhabha was assassinated by USA in a plane crash created by the CIA due to this.\n\nThe fluoride studies were conducted with the same ethical mind set, in which national security was paramount. US multinationals are poisoning every American with their chemical and one example is the chemical called C8 that is in the blood of every US citizen in detectable level. In Kerala state in India, the American firm Coca Cola cheated the farmers, by giving them contaminated chemical waste of its factory as fertilizer and thereby damaging the whole ecosystem of the area. Union Carbide killed tens of thousands of Indians in the world's worst Industrial disaster in Bhopal India. Hindustan Coca Cola Beverages Ltd plant harmed the farming sector and environment in the area by dumping solid waste as fertilizer which is similar to the fluoride story in USA.\n\nFluoride is not good for teeth and is a dangerous chemical and a poisonous substance, which does no good to the human body. Fluoride destroys muscle structure, muscle function and depletes muscle energy. Fluoride destroys the bone, destroys the teeth, destroys the RBCs, destroys the Blood Vessels, destroys the lining of the stomach and intestine causing GI problems and in some individuals it causes infertility. Twenty years of follow-up studies conducted on Human Subjects and Hospital patients and those residing in places where fluoride content ranges in drinking water from 0.5 p.m to 38.5 ppm in India showed that the gastro-intestinal complaints are the earliest manifestations of fluoride toxicity and fluorosis. The most common complaints due to fluoride toxicity include, headache, nausea, pain in the stomach, gas formation in the stomach, constipation and intermittent fermentation diarrhea. Studies on human teeth have shown that fluoride alters a chemical substance in the matrix of the tooth. The mineralization process is abnormal, leading to changes in mineral content, and cavities or pitting are known to occur. In other words, Fluoride induces cavity formation, as well as discoloration of teeth. It is also evident that use of fluoride can lead to loss of teeth at an early age and one becomes edentulous.\n\nFluoride in circulation has an affinity to get deposited in tissues rich in calcium although some amount is excreted. In children, the fluoride ingested has adverse effects on kidney function. Muscular and Neural manifestations in Fluoride Toxicity in Rabbit and Man were studied. It emerged from studies on human patients of skeletal fluorosis, degenerative changes that were well defined at the ultrastructural level in the fluoresced muscle obtained from patients of Skeletal Fluorosis. Study of structural and functional aspects of bone with reference to fluoride poisoning showed that chemical defects are occurring in the tissues as a result. Fluoride inhibits the activity of enzymes of Glucose-6-Po dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase in erythrocytes leading to impairment of carbohydrate metabolism. Fluoride adversely affects membrane bound enzyme (ATP – ase) and affects the transfer of calcium and magnesium ions in erythrocytes. Fluoride inhibits antibody formation in rabbits and may occur in human subjects as well. Fluoride inhibits protein and DNA synthesis in cultured lymphocytes. Fluoride reduces the number of lymprocytes in circulation by inhibiting their proliferation. Fluoride is not good for teeth. Fluoride does more damage to teeth than any good. Prolonged use of fluoride leads to a decrease in the organic matrix of rabbit tooth but Dermatan Sulphate content is increased. High Dermatan Sulphate content appears to be the detrimental factor in causing dental fluorosis. Patients afflicted with fluorosis will have reduced plasma cortisol levels. Fluoride treated animals also produced less cortisol and revealed adrenocortical hypofunction.\n\nExcess fluoride ingestion can result in pituitary gland hypofunction which is possibly the reason for adrenal insufficiency in the production of steroid hormone. Fluoride toxicity impairs cortisol production, thereby altering the bone matrix constitution both organic and inorganic, leading to defective and abnormal mineralization process. Aortic calcification, which is very frequently occurring, is a result of excess ingestion of fluoride through food, water, drugs, cosmetics like tooth paste/mouth rinses and fluoridated water. The disappearance of Dermatan Sulphate from soft tissue, which normally has high concentration of Dermatan Sulphate, is the beginning of nucleation for calcification of the soft tissue. This process is activated by fluoride. The impact of the above contributions in the Indian National scene has been significant. Fluoride is known to induce calcification of blood vessels of the fetus. Yet it is seen that artificial fluoridation of drinking water is being done in many nations thinking that it is good for health. Fluoridation is an ineffective means of improving dental health, and is in fact quite dangerous to those forced to consume it. The limit is 1 ppm as per WHO handbook. Research have shown that the safe permissible upper limit of fluoride in drinking water is 0.3 ppm."

      "text": "Share\n\nThursday, August 27, 2009\n\nWhat the Hell is 'Fracking' and How Does it Poison Our Groundwater?\n\nWater: two hydrogen, one oxygen...and the crystalline compound adamantane? With 2-butoxyethanol, or 2-BE?\n\nThat's what citizens in states like New Mexico, Alabama, Ohio, Texas, Pennsylvania and Colorado are finding in their drinking water. The culprit? Fracking.\n\nHydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a process used by natural gas and oil companies. Fracking allows the oil and gas in reservoir rock to move more freely from the rock pores. A chemical mixture of sand and fluids is injected under high pressure, which creates or enlarges fractures in the rock to unlock the deposits buried deep underground. Then the oil and gas is able to move to a production well where the it can be brought to the surface.\n\nAccording to the investigative Web site ProPublica, fracking has vastly increased the amount of natural gas drilling in the United States. In 2007, there were 449,000 gas wells in 32 states, thirty percent more than in 2000, and by 2012 the nation could be drilling 32,000 new wells a year. Today, according to the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, nine out of 10 gas wells in the United States currently use fracturing fluids.\n\nBut at what cost?\n\nThe same chemicals used in fracking have been found contaminating the precious drinking water supply in rural areas across the United States, and with many harmful results. In some cases chemical compounds, those of most concern being adamantes and 2-BE, have been found in streams, springs and water wells that provide for neighboring towns. These compounds are not only dangerous to ingest, but they're potentially volatile. In one case, a house exploded after hydraulic fracturing created underground passageways and methane leaked into the residential water supply.\n\nA Debate in Compromise\n\nWhether or not the fluids used in fracking are polluting the drinking water is still a matter of debate -- largely because many officials aren't sure what they're arguing about. The 2005 Energy Policy Act has excluded fracking from the jurisdiction of the Safe Drinking Water Act, making the precise make-up of fracking fluids trade secrets in the industry.\n\nThe study concluded that hydraulic fracturing posed \"no threat\" to underground drinking water because fracturing fluids aren't necessarily hazardous, can't travel far underground, and that there is \"no unequivocal evidence\" of a health risk.\n\nBut documents obtained by ProPublica show that the EPA negotiated directly with the gas industry before finalizing those conclusions, and then ignored evidence that fracking might cause exactly the kinds of water problems now being recorded in drilling states.\n\nBuried deep within the 424-page report are statements explaining that fluids migrated unpredictably -- through different rock layers, and to greater distances than previously thought -- in as many as half the cases studied in the United States. The EPA identified some of the chemicals as biocides and lubricants that \"can cause kidney, liver, heart, blood, and brain damage through prolonged or repeated exposure.\" It found that as much as a third of injected fluids, benzene in particular, remains in the ground after drilling and is \"likely to be transported by groundwater.\"\n\nWhile the EPA allows companies to make \"every effort...to maximize the production of oil and gas\", the FRAC Act would \"require these companies to disclose the chemicals they are using in our communities -- especially near our water sources,\" DeGette said in a press release, vice chair of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.\n\n\"Our bill simply closes an unconscionable Bush-Cheney loophole by requiring the oil and gas industry to follow the same rules and everyone else,\" DeGette added.\n\n\"Families, communities and local governments are upset that the safety of their water has been compromised by a special interest exemption, and we join them in that frustration,\" said Polis. \"It is irresponsible to stand by while innocent people are getting sick because of an industry exemption that Dick Cheney snuck in to our nation's energy policy.\"\n\nSince the bill's introduction, the FRAC Act has made slow progress not only due to the immense workload Congress has been under, but also because of fierce industry opposition. The energy industry maintains that state regulations are proficient enough to protect drinking water from hydraulic fracturing contamination. They also argue that the legislation would hamper exploration, raise fuel prices and cost Americans jobs and energy"

What?\n\nCleanbiofilms?\n\nHow do I clean biofilms?\n\nAnd what are biofilms, anyway?\n\n\"Biofilms are offensive slimes,\" says Michael J. Hurst,\nBSc(Hons) FRSPH, consulting microbiologist, principal, Watermark\nConsultancy. \"They act as food for fast-growing bacteria and can be\na hazard in the kitchen.\"\n\nBiofilms promote bacteria growth, helping them colonize quickly\nto slippery, gooey surfaces that can give off an unusual odor.\n\n\"Biofilms can act as\nfoodfor fast-growing bacteria.\"\n\n-Michael J.

Choosing a water cooler that is easy to clean\nis beneficial.\"\n\nHow Contamination Begins\n\nWhile it's virtually impossible to create a completely sterile\nenvironment in any home, says Hurst, when it comes to bottled water\ncoolers, you can limit exposure by following these safe-handling\ntips:\n\nAlways wash hands before handling your cooler's water bottles,\nespecially when loading a new bottle into the unit.\n\nWhen possible, avoid touching the neck of the water bottle\nduring refilling (even with clean hands).\n\nKeep dirty hands and fingers or unsanitary plastic bottles from\ndirect contact with water cooler faucets.\n\nChoose water coolers with easy to clean and maintain reservoirs\nand faucets.\n\nSteer clear of using aerosols or other contaminants around the\nwater cooler itself, since these things can be drawn into the\ncooler when the water is dispensed.\n\nPosition the water cooler in a convenient kitchen location away\nfrom where you handle meat and greens, since there have been\nincidences of dangerous bacteria coming from foods like spinach and\nalfalfa sprouts.\n\nTime to Clean: Signs & Symptoms\n\nOf course, it's best to clean all kitchen appliances\nregularly-and that includes bottled water coolers and their\nreservoirs. Set a cleaning schedule you can remember, such as the\nlast day of the month or the same day you clean your coffee maker\nor refrigerator.\n\nNot sure when you last cleaned?

      "text": "why vistabrite?\n\nwhoa, that looks complicated!\n\nWhile the VistaPure looks really complicated, we assure you that it's a breeze to use. Each and every tube and fitting has its purpose but all you need to worry about are the simple controls on the left edge of the board. We don't mess around with clumsy cosmetic covers, which only add cost and difficulty for service techs to get to the system.\n\ntwo qualities of water\n\nThe VistaPure has your on-demand water needs covered. Autoclave quality water is stored in the 2.7-gallon storage tank and non-corrosive quality water is sent directly to the faucet for on demand bottle filling or drinking water.\n\nyour magic wand\n\nFilling your autoclave is easy with the VistaPure's wand. Just squeeze of the trigger to fill your autoclave with pure, distilled-quality water. No more lifting heavy jugs of water; no more back aches!\n\ntop-side faucet\n\nalways on tap\n\nPure water for your autoclave is always available thanks to the 2.7-gallon storage capacity of the included storage tank. No more waiting for water to be made or purchasing water from the store. Better yet, the tank fits neatly under your sink, still leaving you plenty of room for other supplies.\n\ninstant system status monitoring\n\nEach VistaPure has an in-line TDS meter that constantly monitors the quality of water being produced. This meter makes it easy to know when its time to replace your filters.\n\nvistapure annual tank maintenance\n\nfrequently asked questions\n\nWhat does VistaBrite™ actually do?\n\nA VistaBrite™ pre-treats water use for in instrument washers. Contaminants are reduced or removed in order to protect instruments in the washer and increase the washer's performance. It reduces the total dissolved solids (TDS) and associated contaminants about 80% - 95% depending on the system water pressure.\n\nWhere can a VistaBrite™ installed?\n\nA VistaBrite™ is built on a 22\" x 16\" board and can be mounted in a cabinet, above a cabinet, in the equipment room, a closet or other remote location. However, closer to the instrument washer is best if there is room.\n\nWhy do I need a VistaBrite™ when I already have a Hydrim?\n\nThe VistaBrite™ was specially designed to be used in conjunction with a Hydrim or other instrument washer. The combination of a VistaBrite™ installed ahead of an instrument washer will help keep the interior surfaces of the washer much cleaner while also protecting the instruments.\n\nWhat kind of maintenance is involved?\n\nVistaBrite™'s simple design requires virtually no maintenance. Water quality should be checked periodically with the include TDS meter and the results posted in the system manual. The Prefilter (R4151) should be changed at least once per year and the Hyperfiltration element (R4155) changed about every 2-4 years which will depend on the raw water quality, system pressure and volume of water used. Testing the water quality as directed in the system manual will tell you when to change the Hyperfiltration element.\n\nI already have a VistaClear™ and VistaPure™ - why do I also need a VistaBrite™?\n\nVistaClear™ is specially designed to reduce bacterial contamination in water used in dental delivery units. VistaPure™ provides two grades of water – one for use in water delivery bottles and ultra pure distilled quality water for use in autoclaves. VistaBrite™ uses a similar technology as VistaPure™ but produces water much more quickly and, by design, does not reduce the dissolved solids to as low a level.\n\nHow do I know if I need a VistaBrite™?\n\nThe most obvious sign would be spots and stains on your expensive instruments and internal surfaces of your instrument washer. Of course, a water test will also give you a good indication what is likely to cause problems. If you are unsure about your water quality, Sci-Can has teamed up with Nelson Analytical Lab to provide a simple but comprehensive water testing kit. Within days your results will tell you whether or not treatment is advisable.\n\nHow can investing in a VistaBrite™ system save me money?\n\nAnything that can reasonably be done to preserve the finish, function and life of expensive instruments is worth doing. Even one load of instruments can cost more than the price of a VistaBrite™ which makes it a smart investment in most any situation.\n\nHow long do the filters last?\n\nThe Prefilter element (R4151) should be replaced at least annually. The Hyperfiltration element (R4155) should be replaced about every 2-4 years which will depend on the raw water quality, system pressure and volume of water used. This will typically be when the TDS reduction drops below 70%.\n\nHow much extra water will the VistaBrite™ use?\n\nThe VistaBrite™ does not require the use of electricity or chemicals to do its job. It uses only water and water pressure to remove contaminants at the molecular level. The Depending on the water pressure available, the ratio of good product water to drain waste water is about 3:1.\n\nHow much water pressure is needed to make the system work?\n\nGenerally speaking, the higher the pressure the more efficiently the VistaBrite™ will work. The minimum inlet pressure should be 40 psi (2.76 bar) and the maximum is 80 psi (5.52 bar).\n\nWill it change how I use my Hydrim?\n\nThe normal operating procedure will remain unchanged. One added benefit is that the internal \"softener\" function of the Hydrim can be set to \"0\" or the lowest possible setting which will save money. Check with your Sci-Can technical service representative for specific installations. VistaBrite™ works behind the scenes and does not require any daily attention to do its work.\n\nDoes it use electricity?\n\nNo. Like all Vista Research Group \"green\" products, VistaBrite™ requires no electricity for its operation.\n\nCan I still use a VistaBrite™ during boil-water notices or other disasters?\n\nIt's highly unlikely that operations would continue as normal in an office under a boil-water notice or disaster. The VistaBrite™ system is not designed to filter pathogenic bacteria and should not be used during such times.\n\nWhat plumbing to I need available to install a VistaBrite™?\n\nVistaBrite™ has been designed to connect to standard garden hose faucets just like those installed for instrument washers. Garden hose x quick connect fittings are included with each system. All required tubing and accessories are also included. Typically nothing more than a cutter for the poly tubing and a screw drive for the drain assembly are required.\n\nDo I need to have my city water softened before going into a VistaBrite™?\n\nIf the source water is hard and has trace levels of iron, installation of a water softener would be very helpful to the VistaBrite™ operation and to help protect the plumbing and fixtures in the entire facility. However, in normal-to-low hardness waters a water softener is not required.\n\nWhat expense will there be in replacement parts?\n\nOther than the regular replacement of the Pre-filter and the Hyperfiltration element, there should not be a need for replacement parts.\n\nIs there any maintenance require for the water storage tank?\n\nAt least annually, the captive air tank's air pre-charge should be checked. There is a diaphragm in the middle of the tank that separates the compressed air in the lower section from the product water in the top section of the tank. This is what gives the tank the energy to push treated water out of the tank to the instrument washer. When the tank has no water in it, the air pre-charge should be 7.5 – 8.0 psi. This can be checked by removing the cap on the air valve on the side of the tank. A simple tire gauge (preferably digital for accuracy) and a tire pump or small compressor is all that is needed. A good time to perform this check is during the annual Pre-filter element change.\n\nWhat protocol is needed to keep the system lines clean?\n\nDuring the annual Pre-filter element change, it is recommended to sanitize the tubing and tank by using a small amount of standard bleach. A small amount can be injected into the lines using a simple luer tip syringe then turning on the water to make a contact solution that can be rinsed out after about 20 minutes.\n\nWhat does the \"Pre-filter\" element do to the water?\n\nThe Pre-filter performs very important functions. It must first remove any sediment and physical particles from the water to prevent plugging of the Hyperfiltration membrane and make it work more efficiently. It must also remove water treatment residuals like chlorine that can damage the membrane. These are the reasons it must be changed on a very regular basis … at least once per year.\n\nWhat does the \"Hyperfiltration\" element do to the water?\n\nThe\n\nWhy does VistaBrite™ use both hot and cold water? How does this impact cycle times?\n\nThe Hydrim instrument washer uses both hot and cold water sources. Some other brands of washers use only a cold source. In both cases, the instrument washer must heat the water to high temperatures for their process. Since heating water increases cycle times, the VistaBrite™ uses proprietary ThermoBlend technology to get a blend of hot and cold inputs to optimize the water treatment while helping to decrease the washer's cycle times.\n\nHow difficult is it to get water at the right temperature?\n\nIt's very easy. There are two ball valves on the manifold. One controls hot water and one controls cold water. The installer simply adjusts the valves to the optimal temperature much like you would do when blending hot and cold water at your sink. Once the optimal temperature is reached the valves are left in that position and don't need to be re-set unless the inlet temperatures are changed.\n\nWhat temperature is the water when it goes into the storage tank?\n\nSince \"hot\" water can't be treated since it would cause damage to the VistaBrite™ filters, warm water is created for the process as explained above. The optimal temperature at the manifold is 95° F (35° C). By the time the water runs through the filters and heads towards the tank the temperature will drop usually by +/- 10% depending on the temperature of the room in which it's installed.\n\nWhy do you need VistaCheck™ Backflow Preventer check valves on this system?\n\nProtecting water systems from possible backflow is always prudent and is required in some codes. Also, if a facility has a hot water re-circulating pump installed, the system pressure on the hot side will most always be higher than the cold side of the plumbing. VistaCheck™ are installed on each of the lines to prevent hot water from back feeding into the cold line and visa versa.\n\nWhere does the treated water go first – to the storage tank or the instrument washer?\n\nThat depends. When the VistaBrite™ makes new water it flows towards the storage tank. If the instrument washer does not need water at that moment, its water inlet solenoid valve is closed and all the water flows into the storage tank. When the tank is full the system knows to stop making water and shuts off. When the instrument washer needs water, its solenoid valve opens and, since the storage tank is under pressure, water is sent directly into the washer. Simultaneously, the VistaBrite™ system senses water is being used and automatically starts treating new water and sends it towards the storage tank. If the washer still needs water the new treated water flows directly to the washer instead of going into the tank. When the washer's water solenoid closes since it has the water it needs, all the newly treated water will flow into the storage tank until it becomes full so it's ready for the next time the washer needs water.\n\nHow often can I use my Hydrim in a day when a VistaBrite™ is hooked to\n\nWhat if there isn't enough treated water in the storage tank when the washer needs"

Or in a calorifier where an electrical coil is used to produce the heat. These boilers tend to scale up very greatly if the water is hard, primarily if the temperature is high accordingly. Frequently, such boilers also start to rust after a few years and this is why stainless steel boilers are used to a greater extent today. Merus clears the scale in the boilers if used properly and this scale is then flushed out with the water. Existing rust deposits are partially dissolved and converted. At boilers heated electrically might occure the problem of less efficiency, if the coil gives a strong electrical field. These electrical heating systems may emit fields, which impair the\n\naction of Merus so only slight scale removal occurs. Generally, only the build-up of scale again is greatly reduced in such cases. See as well the case study Water in Fitness Clubs or a Public Pool in the city of Munich."

The water is pumped into water cooled condensers that are set up as fences (pipes with aluminium fins) down wind from solar heat collectors. After flowing through the condensers the water(slightly warmer now) moves up-wind through pipes painted black that run half pipes (parabolic heat effect ) to parabolic dish that concentrates heat to a coiled black pipe that super heats the water to steam where it is released into the trade wind which blows the humid air back to the condensers (down-wind) where the pure water drips into trough then to pipe to fresh water reservoir.\n\nNote... Wind mills can also be used to aid in pumping or in the case of no wind, to electrically fan air towards condensers.

One, the sea is salty. Two, salty water isn't so great for drinking or growing plants. Three, you can't just take the salt out of water, just like you couldn't dissolve the sugar out of your tea. Or can you?\n\nReverse osmosis is one of the processes that makes desalination (or removing salt from seawater) possible. Beyond that, reverse osmosis is used for recycling, wastewater treatment, and can even produce energy.\n\nWater issues have become an extremely pressing global threat. With climate change come unprecedented environmental impacts: torrential flooding in some areas, droughts in others, rising and falling sea levels. Add to that the threat of overpopulation -- and the demand and pollution a swelling population brings -- and water becomes one of the paramount environmental issues to watch for in the next generation.\n\nWater treatment plants and systems are now adapting reverse osmosis to address some of these concerns. In Perth, Australia (notably dry and arid, yet surrounded by sea), nearly 17 percent of the area's drinking water is desalinated sea water that comes from a reverse osmosis plant [source: The Economist]. Worldwide, there are now over 13,000 desalination plants in the world, according to the International Desalination Association.\n\nBut while knowing that reverse osmosis can convert seawater to drinking water is useful, what we really need to understand is how the heck the process occurs.

And then turn to the water that is plastic bottled and say: \"Be gone ye impostor of the pure.\"\n\nNot that tap water is particularly pure (and, in fact, is decidedly impure in many municipalities in the USA and the world at large). But, the drift here is that bottled water is far worse, particularly when you look at the whole picture. Like when you weigh in the costs to your pocket book, health and the environment…\n\nDrinking plastic bottled water is absolutely crazy.\n\nWant to carry water around? Put it in a non-plastic container. But first, think about running the tap water through a filter, just to make sure that it's pure.\n\nWater, Carried the Old Fashion Way\n\nIf you do, you'll be joining a growing number of people and organizations that have already had their head examined and have purged their homes, offices and cars of plastic bottled water.\n\nOver the past few years, at least 60 cities in the United States and a handful of others in Canada and the United Kingdom have agreed to stop spending taxpayer dollars on bottled water, which is often consumed during city meetings, said Deborah Lapidus, organizer of Corporate Accountability International's \"Think Outside the Bottle\" campaign in the U.S.\n\nSo, what would it take for you to stop buying bottled water, use a filter for tap water, and put the purified water in a non-plastic container?\n\nIs money a good enough argument? The average U.S. citizen spends $400/yr on bottled water.\n\nHow 'bout the environment? 1,500 water bottles wind up in the garbage EVERY SECOND. In 2004, 126,000,000,000 liters of bottled water were consumed, using 17,000,000 barrels of oil to make the plastic bottles and emitting 2,500,000 tons of carbon dioxide in the process.\n\nSurely your health?

Like them? Good! Hey, didja know that they like plastic water bottles? Sure do! So go buy our plastic water bottles even though they're toxic, waste energy, overflow land fills, and are inferior in every way to the cheaper solution of filtering tap water and placing it in a healthy, non-plastic container!\"\n\nWhat the video should make you think is:\n\n\"If I want to help make this a better world for my children, I will not buy plastic water bottles!\"\nBabies, yes.

Water is essential nutrient that is involved in every function of the body. It helps transport nutrients and waste products in and out of cells. Because 70% of our body is water, we should consume clean water as well in order to make sure our body parts function properly.\nWhat is \" AMIDIS\" Distilled Water?\nAMIDIS is healthy drinking water, which is processed by distillation system or evaporation as well as heated for up to 180 degree Celsius. These series of process produce pure drinking water ( NON-MINERAL) free from any pollutants, inorganic mineral as well as any other contaminated material such as chemical or pesticide.\nDifference Between Organic and Inorganic Mineral\nA couple of opinions state that human body needs mineral. It is correct, but what kind of mineral does a human body need? A human body only needs Organic Mineral.\nOrganic Mineral is the only type of mineral that a human body needs, which we can get from various foods we consume every day such as rice, chicken, fish, egg, vegetables, fruits as well as supplement vitamins. Inorganic Mineral is the opposite, which is the kind of mineral that is not needed by a human body.\nGround Water contains Inorganic Mineral that is hard to digest and is not needed by a human body.\nHarms Caused By Inorganic Mineral\nInorganic mineral in water contains Iron Oxide, Mercury, Arsenic, Magnesium, Aluminium and many other chemical substances originated from the earth. As we may all know, each of those substances has different density; if consumed, will stay in human body and will have negative effect on our body, especially to our liver and kidney because these two body parts act as a filter in our body.\nThis deposition that is mainly caused by Inorganic Mineral could cause diseases such as kidney stone, gallstone, hardening artery, and diabetes. The deposition could also happen to body axis, which could lead to arthritic.\nDifference Between \" AMIDIS\" Distilled Water and Non-Distilled Water\n\" AMIDIS\" distilled water has Total Dissolved Solid ( TDS) of 0 PPM ( Part per Million) , which means it does not contain any substance or pollutant, hence PURE WATER ( H20) .\nConversely, non-distilled water or is usually called Spring Water has Total Dissolved Solid in a range of 50 – 150 PPM. This means every millilitre of it contains 50 – 150 different kind of pollutant, inorganic mineral, and any other unknown contaminated substances that are dangerous to a human body if consumed in a long period of time.\nBenefits of \" AMIDIS\"\n1. TDS = 0 PPM means AMIDIS could help to optimise any detoxification process that in a human body.\n2. Protects our body from bright disease, gallstone disease, arthritic, hardening artery, diabetes, etc. Keeps your skin soft and smooth and prevents wrinkles because AMIDIS does not contain any harmful chemicals or pollutants that clog pores.\n3. Enlighten the work of kidney, especially for people with bright disease.\n4. Helps people with urinating problems.\n5. Helps reduce hypertension as distilled water does not contain any sodium.\n6. According to research, one factor that causes Autism is excessive inorganic mineral in a human body. AMIDIS does not increase inorganic mineral in our body.\n7. AMIDIS helps your diet program become more effective and successful because AMIDIS does not contain Sodium that binds water in a human body.\n8. AMIDIS is very good for athletes and sportsmen because it helps generate sweat from our body better.\n9. Perfect to be consumed by people with all ages.\n10. AMIDIS is your solution to non-expensive, pure, high-quality and clean drinking water.\nProduction Process of \" AMIDIS\" Distilled Water\n\" AMIDIS\" Distilled Water is not just plainly filtered like non-distilled water but it is done through an extensive series of process such as Evaporation where filtered water is heated up to 180 degree Celsius by using Reverse Osmosis system. This process is done to make sure any chemical or other contaminated substance is gone. The next process is called Condensation and Sterilisation by using Ozone and Ultraviolet. These series of process would produce 100% Pure, Healthy AMIDIS Drinking Water, free from any pollutants ( PURE WATER H20) .\nMD References\n• \" Our body needs mineral from food we eat, not from water we drink.\" ( Dr. Clifford Denison)\n• \" Water that contains inorganic mineral is the main cause of all diseases\" ( Dr. Charles Mayo)\n• \" Inorganic mineral in water, such as Fosfat, Calcium Carbonate, etc. stays in human body and that could lead to damages of internal body organs, which may be leading to death\" ( Dr. N.W. Walker, \" Water Can Undermine Your Health\" , 1996 Norwalk Press, USA)\n• \" Damage to internal body organs is mostly caused by inorganic mineral that mixes with fat and salt in our body. This mixture could block blood cell to body organs, which decreases blood supply and damages the organ function.\" ( Paul C.N.D. Phd., \" The Shocking Truth About Water\" )\n\" Consuming distilled water ( non-mineral) would not have any negative effect to our health, but it has a couple of advantages to our body. It does not increase the level of inorganic mineral in our body and it decreases any inorganic mineral that may be in our body.\" ( Dr. Allen E. Bani, \" Your Water and Your Health\" , Keats Publishing, Inc., 1990, Connecticut, USA)\nWhat is AMIDIS ?\nAMIDIS distilled water is the result of a series of process, combination of RO ( Reverse Osmosis) , Evaporation ( by heating the water around 180 degrees celcius that makes all anorganic minerals, chemicals, and other contaminated materials abandoned) , Condensation, as well as being sterilised by Ozonisation and Ultraviolet.\nWhy AMIDIS ?\n• Enlightens the work of kidney, especialy for people with bright disease.\n• Helps reduce hypertension as distilled water does not contain any sodium.\n• Keeps your skin soft and smooth and prevents wrinkles because AMIDIS does not contain any harmful chemicals or pollutans that clogs pores.\n• TDS = 0 PPM means AMIDIS could help you to optimise any detoxification process that you may have.\n• Helps vitamins and all good substance distribution in your body through bloodstream.\n• AMIDIS helps your diet program become more effective and successful.\n• Makes all your foods and drinks taste better.\n• The perfect drink to all family members.\nWhat is Mineral?\nMineral in natural water is only inorganic that is rejected by the cells and tissues of human body, which if not evacuated, can cause arterial obstructions and even more serious damage. Only plants can convert inorganic mineral to organic mineral, which can be useful for human body.\nBesides drinking, what are some other uses for distilled water?\nCooking: Chlorine-free soups & vegetable ( taste the improvement) pots and pans are easier to clean.\n\nPhotography: Perfect development.\n\n1. is water that has been turned into vapor so that its impurities are left behind. Upon condensing, it becomes pure water.\n\n2. is the only type of water which meets the definition of water: hydrogen + oxygen.\n\n3. is perfectly pure water.\n\n4. is also odorless, colourless and tasteless.\n\n5. is free of virtually all inorganic minerals including salt.\n\n6. is the only natural solvent that can be taken into the body without damage to the tissues.\n\n7. acts as a solvent in the body by dissolving nutrients so they can be assimilated and taken into every cell.\n\n8. dissolves the cell wastes so the toxins can be removed.\n\n9. dissolves inorganic mineral substances lodged in the tissues of the body so that the substances can be eliminated in the process of purifying the body.\n\n10. does not leach out organic body minerals but does collect and remove the toxic inorganic minerals, which have been rejected by the cells of the body and are therefore, nothing more than harmful debris obstructing the normal functions of the body.\n\n11. is indeed the most ideal and beneficial water for all humans and for animals.\n\n12. leaves no residue of any kind when it enters the body.\n\n13. is the most perfect water for the healthy functioning of those great sieves, the kidneys.\n\n14. Is the perfect liquid for blood.\n\n15. Is the ideal liquid for efficient functioning of the lungs, stomach, liver and all other vital organs.\n\n16.

Is fresh, clean and has pleasing taste.\n\n19. makes foods and drinks prepared with it taste noticeably better. The flavor is subtle enough not to interfere with the food it is mixed with.\n\n20. Is the only pure water left on our polluted planet!\nWhy I Drink Distilled Water?\nPure distilled water...\nHelps transport substances through out my body\nAs one of the greatest solvents known, water helps prepare substances for transport across cell membranes and/ or distribution through our bodies by way of blood and lymph. This function of water in our bodies is impaired when the water is filled with contaminants that interfere with its ability to dissolve bodily substances efficiently.\nHelps my body chemistry to regulate and function properly\nMetabolic activities depend upon enzymes, coenzymes, trace minerals and other substances which are present in minute quantities.\nContaminants and toxic chemicals, introduced into our body through our drinking water can interfere with normal metabolic activities and enzymatic pathways.\nWe can understand this interference better when we consider these vital elements may be present in quantities of a few thousand ions or molecules; whereas, just one swallow of water containing one part per million of a toxic chemical will contain six hundred quadrillion ( 600, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, ) toxic molecules.\nHelps cleanse my body of waste materials\nWithin the body, water acting as a solvent, reaches into every cell to absorb and carry away the poisons that are formed as a part of the life process. Lots of pure water is needed for this task.\nWe all know that it is easier to wash dishes in a sink full of clean water than in a cup full of dirty water. The blood circulates 400 gallons of water through the kidneys each day.\nCommon sense tells us that when the water we consume is pure, it can do a much better job than when it is already contaminated with toxic substances.\nHelps keep my body cool\nThis is accomplished when water in my body evaporates from the skin.\nIf the water in my body is full of contaminants they will be left as residues that will encrust the skin, leaving it rough, dry and a breeding ground for bacteria. Drinking lots of pure water, on the other hand, will help leave the skin soft and pliable.\nMakes my food and beverages taste better\nWhat a delight it is to drink a glass full of frozen juice made with distilled water! Without the chemicals and minerals in the water, there is nothing to hide the natural fresh taste of the fruit.\nMany people have told me they cannot drink their favorite beverage made with tap water once they begin using distilled water.\nAnd, distilled water also makes foods cooked in water tastier and the color remains bright like nature intended, since there are no chemicals and other toxic substances to turn them brownish-yellow.\nI do not consume any harmful substances when I drink distilled water\nChlorine, which has been added to our tap water, may be one of the most dangerous chemicals consumed by man.\nResearch studies indicate that chlorine combines with organic substances found in tap water to produce chlorinated hydrocarbons that may be involved in such insidious diseases as hardening of the arteries, heart attacks, strokes and cancer.\nI have a chlorine test kit which I use to test for chlorine level in my tap water. It may be higher than allowed in my swimming pool.\nTap water may be drinkable but don' t swim in it.\nThe fallacy about drinking water for the minerals it contains\nSome people have the mistaken belief that essential minerals are derived from water they drink. Yes, we do need minerals. But the source of minerals for the body is food we eat - not the water we drink.\nPlants have a unique ability to convert inorganic minerals absorbed from the soil and water into organic forms our bodies can use. Our bodies can use few, if any, of the minerals absorbed in water. These minerals merely contaminate our water and hinder the water from performing its material functions.\nAccording to experts in the field, there are several different kinds of water, and almost all of them are harmful in some way. These waters carry minerals, metals and inorganic compounds into our body that we can' t use. These waters carry 80% of all sickness and disease. They may contain over 700 identified chemicals all of which permeate our systems and may begin accumulating there.\nWhen water brought into our bodies is already polluted, its natural cleansing functions are impaired. As a result, we may develop health problems as these pollutants build up in our blood vessel, joints and internal organs.\nSome health specialists believe we experience hardening of the arteries, arthritis, kidney stones, gall stones, vision problems, ( glaucoma and cataracts) , loss of hearing, diabetes, obesity, emphysema and other ailments in greater intensities and more frequently when we live with and consume polluted or contaminated water.\nOf the several types of water, such as: rain, snow-melt, raw, hard, filtered, soft, de-ionized, boiled and distilled - only distilled water is pure and virtually free of all contaminates. As a result, distilled water has no taste, no color, no odor, no bacteria, no heavy metals, no acids, no organic minerals, no toxic chemicals, no poisons.\nDistilled water enters your system clean. It is free to absorb and wash away the poisons your system generates and the poisons that have accumulated.There' s not absolute proof that drinking distilled water will remove kidney and gall stones, reduce cataracts or cure emphysema. But, there are hundreds of case histories of people who have enjoyed success in alleviating or overcoming these health problems when they began distilled water exclusively.\nThis water has been relatively pure containing only moderate amounts of naturally occurring substances. But conditions have changed. Since the industrial revolution, and especially since World War II, we have dumped synthetic chemicals by the thousands into the environment. We are not adapted to these man-made chemicals. We know that many of them are toxic. We do not know the effects they will have on the bodies of our children and the generations to come.\nPollutants are dangerous. Amidis is free from any pollutants that may harm your body. Samples shown on this page are the result of splitting anorganic minerals from Mineral Water by using an Electrolyzer. Iron in vegetables you eat, such as spinach, is organic mineral and is useful to your body but iron in water you drink is harmful as they are anorganic that can cause cancer and other harmful diseases. Amidis is free from any anorganic mineral that can be harmful to human.\n\n• Dr. Charles Mayo from Mayo Clinic, USA, says: \" Water that contains anorganic mineral is the main cause of all disease.\"\n• \" ...Anorganic Mineral that solubles in the water like calcium fosfate, calcium carbonate, etc, stays in our body, and will cause damage to body cells and even causing death...\"\n\n- Dr. N.W. Walker, \" Water Can Undermine Your Health\" , 1996, Norwalk Press, USA.\n• \" Land below us contains loads of anorganic mineral but our body could never use them, only plants could, and change them into organic mineral that is good for human and animals. ...\"\n\n\" The biggest damage to body organs is caused by anorganic mineral that has mixed with fat and kitchen salt in blood. The mixture clogs blodstreams to body organs and damage the function of the body organ.\"\n\n- Paul C. Bragg, N.D./ Phd., \" The Shocking Truth About Water\" , Health Science, Box & Santa Barbara California.\n• \" Drinking distilled water does not have side or negative effect to your health instead it brings more benefit to your health. Firstly, it does not add up more anorganic mineral to your body, and secondly, it cleanse up any anorganic mineral in your body.\"\n\nWHAT IS DISTILLATION?\n\nDistillation is one of mankind' s earliest forms of water treatment, and it is still a popular treatment solution throughout the world today. In ancient times, the Greeks used this process on their ships to convert sea water into drinking water. In far-eastern cultures, water was distilled for use in \" Ranbiki\" tea ceremonies.\n\nToday, distilled water is still used to convert sea water to drinking water on ships and in arid parts of the world, and to treat water in other areas that is fouled by natural and unnatural contaminants. Distillation is perhaps the one water treatment technology that most completely reduces the widest range of drinking water contaminants.\nNot only is distillation one of the most effective forms of treatment, but it is also one of the easiest to understand: untreated water is converted into water vapor, which is then condensed back into liquid form. Most of the contaminants are left behind in the boiling chamber, with the condensed water being virtually contaminant-free. Anyone who has accidentally let a pot of water boil completely out on the stove is familiar with this process, and familiar with the crust of contaminants typically left behind after the water is gone.\n\nIn nature, this basic process is responsible for the hydrologic cycle. The sun causes water to evaporate from surface sources such as lakes, oceans, and streams. The water vapor eventually comes in contact with cooler air, where it re-condenses to form dew or rain. This process can be imitated artificially, and more rapidly than in nature, using alternative sources of heating and cooling.\n\nSixteenth Century Clay Porcelain Distiller\nEarly distillation equipment was very simple in design: a pot of undrinkable water ( or water unfit for a ceremonial, commercial, or medical purpose) would be heated over an open flame until it boiled, forming steam. The steam would then condense on a cool surface suspended above the pot. The condensed water droplets would then run off into a storage container for future use. Alternatively, sponges could be suspended above the pot to collect the treated water. While such systems were relatively inefficient, it tended to be quite adequate for the limited water treatment needs of the time.\n\nThe efficiency of the distillation process began to see improvements as distillation was adapted to commercially refine many different liquids such as alcohol, perfume, petroleum, and various solvents. Finally, population demands have strained water resources in the 20th century to the point where efficiently treating otherwise undrinkable sources of water for human consumption is increasingly important.\n\nHow Distillation Systems Work\nSeveral different types of distillation systems are available, the system chosen generally depending on the quantity of water required. Most households and businesses use inexpensive and effective single-stage distillers to provide less than a gallon, or up to 100 gallons, per day ( gpd) of treated water. More economically efficient commercial distillation units produce up to 5, 000 gallons per day, and use variations in steam pressure to help heat the water. Converting water into steam requires significant amounts of heat.\n\nMost distillation units use either electricity, or, to a lesser extent, gas to generate the heat necessary. While it is difficult to get past the initial heating of the water, efficiency can be gained in keeping the process going by reusing the heated steam to preheat the incoming water.\n\nHousehold Distillation\nThe most common type of household and commercial distiller available is a basic, single-effect distiller. Single-effect distillers are simple in design, inexpensive, and effective. They are less efficient in energy use than some of the more elaborate processes used mainly for commercial treatment. Most single-stage distillers are relatively compact counter top or stand-alone units for use in the kitchen or office. These distillers can be either batch distillers, where a measured quantity of water is manually poured in, distilled, and collected; or plumbed distillers that automatically treat and maintain a constant supply of drinking water.\n\nIn a single-effect distiller, a heating element heats the water until it boils and eventually becomes steam. The steam is then drawn away from the boiling chamber, where it cools, condensing into highly treated distilled water. The contaminants in the original water are left behind in the boiling chamber\n\nModern Point-of-Use Distillation System\nThe condensing process is accomplished by using air or water to cool the steam. With some designs, the steam passes through coiled tubing which is either immersed in cool water, or cooled by a fan. ( See above) . In others, the roof of the boiling chamber is cone-shaped, with the cone being cooled by the non-heated water stored above it. Water droplets condense on the inside of the cone-shaped dome, and run down for collection in a drip pan. With some water-cooled systems, a portion of the heat lost as the steam is cooled and condensed can be reclaimed by channelling the heated cooling water into the boiling chamber. It is then replaced with fresh, cool water. The pre-heated water requires less new energy to convert it into steam. ( See the WaterReview Technical Report \" Efficiencies of Distillation Equipment\" for more information on energy-conserving designs.)\n\nWhile the distillation process alone is very effective, certain pesticides and contaminants like volatile organic compounds ( VOCs) and radon convert into vapor readily, and can travel with the steam our of the boiling chamber. Almost all household distillers use special vents and carbon pre- and post-filters to effectively deal with these contaminants.\n\nDistillation units do require some maintenance, which usually involves draining off the concentrated sediment and other contaminants that accumulate at the bottom of the boiling chamber. The walls of the chamber may also need to be cleaned of hard-water scale and other sediment that can accumulate. The required amount of cleaning depends greatly upon the initial quality of water used. Very hard water can produce heavy scaling in a relatively short period of time. If soft water is used, cleaning difficulties should be minimal. The carbon pre- and post-filters must be changed periodically as well.\n\nTypical household distillers cost between $ 300 and $ 1, 000 and produce water for as low as $ .25 a gallon, energy and filter costs included. Look for the WQA Gold Seal ( S-400) to find products that have been successfully tested by WQA to industry performance standards.\n\nCommercial Distillers\nMany commercial operations use multiple-effect distillers, to provide from 75 to millions of gallons per day. These units typically contain a number of boiling chambers, with the first chamber being under increased pressure, and successive chambers having progressively decreasing pressure. This takes advantage of the fact that the greater the steam pressure, the higher the boiling point and temperature of the steam produced. The steam created in the first high-pressure chamber is \" superheated\" to a point well above the temperature needed to create steam in the lower-pressure chambers. As this superheated steam moves through tubes surrounding each of the succeeding boiling chambers, it \" flash\" vaporizes some of the cooler, lower-pressure water in each chamber. The flash vapor is then condensed into distilled water, as is the superheated steam when all of its heat energy is exchanged. The self-sustaining nature of this process can be quite efficient for large quantities of water, since only an electric or gas heating element is required for the first boiling chamber as an energy source.\n\nA variation of the multiple-effect distiller concept is the vapor-compression distiller, which is typically used in commercial applications requiring between 25 and 5000 gallons per day. Vapor-compression water distillers also use high-pressure, superheated steam to boil water; however, they only use a single chamber. The water in the boiling chamber is initially converted to steam at normal pressures and temperatures by an electric or gas heating element. The steam then passes through an electric compressor; the compression causes it to become superheated. The superheated steam is then directed through tubes back into the boiling chamber, where it eventually takes over the boiling process, condensing into distilled water as the heat transfer occurs. These systems are typically more efficient than multi-stage units, since the energy required to operate the compressor is less than that required to heat water using a heating element. The greater efficiency usually brings with it a greater cost, as compared to multistage units.\n\nBoth multi-stage and vapor-compression distillers can incorporate various forms of filtration to make a broadly effective treatment system. These systems can provide water for such uses as commercial water bottling. Both systems also require water that is softened to be practical, to prevent debilitating scaling with resultant heat transfer losses and maintenance costs.\nAt the municipal level, both multi-stage and vapor-compression distillation can provide large quantities of distilled water for drinking use, and are especially used in distilling seawater for use in arid areas adjacent to the oceans.\nWhat Distiller Units Treat\nDistillation is an effective process for producing highly treated drinking water. Distillation can significantly reduce levels of sediment, metals, and biological contaminants, which are unable to travel out of the boiling chamber with the steam. When combined with effective activated carbon filtration, contaminants like VOCs and radon can also be controlled. It is recommended that only units designed and tested for health-contaminant reduction be used for such purposes. These units, when combined with activated carbon filtration, can be used to effectively treat such contaminants as:\n• Arsenic\n• Asbestos\n• Atracine ( Herbicide/ pesticides)\n• Benzene\n• Fluoride\n• Lead\n• Mercury\n• Nitrate\n• Tri chloroethylene ( TCE)\n• Trihalomethanes\n• Radium\n• Radon\n• Biological contaminants ( bacteria, viruses, and water-borne cysts like cryptosporidium)\nA distillation system with activated carbon filtration can also be quite effective for treating aesthetic drinking water contaminants like chlorine or iron bacteria, which lead to unpleasant tastes, odors, or colors.\n\nConclusion\nDistillation is an effective water treatment technology for household and commercial use. It provides water with a distinct clarity, up to 98% free of impurities. Distillation units are continually being improved to increase efficiency and water output, making them increasingly popular and cost-effective for residential and commercial users alike.\n\nThis article first appeared in the WaterReview Technical Brief, ( 1995) Volume 10, No. 2; a publication of the Water Quality Research Council; Copyright 1995 by the WQA.

That's the theory behind the Department of Water and Power's latest project in Los Angeles, which aims to prevent the formation of a carcinogen in two drinking-water sources, the Ivanhoe [pictured] and Elysian reservoirs.\n\nThe unwanted chemical, bromate, forms when sunlight, chlorine and the naturally occurring mineral bromide intermingle. The city considered solutions, like a tarp or metal cover, but they were all too costly, labor-intensive or ugly. Then the ball idea, courtesy of LADWP biologist Brian White, floated to the top. The layer of three million black polyethylene balls prevents sunlight from completing the deadly cocktail. If it seems a bit temporary, it is—officials plan to retire the balls in five years, when a replacement underground reservoir near Griffith Park is finished.\n\n16 Comments\n\nThese black balls prevent sunlight from reaching the water, yes... but how much heat will they absorb, and what effect will the increased water temp have on bacterial growth? I mean, this is southern California - and it is drinking water, right?\n\nWhat are they going to do with the balls after they've been removed?\n\nA black tar pit-esque layer of several tons of black, non-biodegradable balls is somehow not ugly?\n\nno really where are they going to put the litle rubber balls once they are removed. how are we going to use them again. scientists should think about things like this before they dump rubber balls or do stupid things like that.\nWHOO HOO\n\nnybaseballm, have you ever seen a tarp on a backyard pool? Seen it after it rains? Now multiply that by an order of, oh, lets say 1000. I've spent plenty of time in San Dog. It's not overly wet but it does rain, not to mention that water would make it's way over the edge of a tarp and eventually drag it lower and lower.\n\nScottSEA, the fact that the balls are black will only heat the upper layer of water. The lack of penetration of light to the lower depths will allow it to remain cool, if not grow colder. There will certainly be an increased temperature differential but it will most likely not have a major impact on the overall temp of the body of water. On top of that, any bacterial growth can be and is already filtered out at the water treatment plants. There isn't a pump that pulls the water straight out of the reservoir and dumps it right into your tap. I do agree with you about the eventual future of the balls though. It's more of a re-direction of problems than a true \"solution\" but then again, I don't have a better answer for the problem so it's hard to knock it. Maybe they could make one SERIOUS carnival ball pit when they're done.\n\nWhy don't the convert their water treatment plant from injecting chlorine, to one of the newer ozone based plants?\nIf the problem is the interaction between chlorine, and the bromide compound, wouldn't this be a better alternative? They would also eliminate there dependency on chlorine.\nMilwaukee converted their systems years ago, after they had a mishap with the chlorine, and ended up causing a crypto outbreak. The way I understand it is that Milwaukee tap water is some of the best in the country, and they are proud of it.\n\nThe article says the balls are made of polyethylene, which is recyclable. It is not harmful to your health. Go look in your kitchen, most of the plastic food containers will have a recycle symbol with a number 1 on the bottom, which means it's made of polyethylene. The bromine in the water will react with chlorine to most likely form either bromodichloromethane or dibromochloromethane before it forms bromate. These are less carcinogenic than bromate. Treating the water with ozone would immediately cause bromate to form, not to mention retrofitting their treatment plant would cost millions as well. The treated water could be filtered through granular activated carbon filters to remove these bromide species before distributing it to the public, but the municipality must have determined this retrofit option to be too expensive.\n\nideally there should be a natural, or at least more practical sounding, solution, as some of you have said. but if you think about it more practicaly, this a very sensible and cunning solution to a potentialy dangerous, or at least very costly, problem in a city with an already outrageous budget at a time when our economy isn't very good. why retrofit the system? why not use cheap, recylable plastic balls when you're just going to switch to a new resevoir in a few years anyway? seems like a great idea to me.\n\nHey timias...\nOzone, chlorine dioxide, even hypochlorite have been observed to produce bromate form bromide ion. So converting to an ozone system is not a good idea to prevent bromate formation in this water.\n\nThe best solution is to have a covered reservoir for their finished water, like every other municipality"

One\nof the major advantages of plastic pipe is that it will not rot or corrode.\n\nA disadvantage for some types, such as flexible polyethylene, is that it cannot be used for hot-water lines. Any\nplastic pipe used to carry drinking water should have the seal of the National Sanitation Foundation.\n\nFollowing is a list of common plastic pipes and their characteristics.\n\nUsed in pressure supply and drainage systems to carry water for uses such as golf-course sprinklers and agricultural\nirrigation, and in underground gas-distribution systems, industrial and chemical piping, corrosive fume ducting and\ncrude-oil transportation.\n\nChlorinated Polyvinyl Chloride (CPVC) - excellent chemical, crush and fire resistance,\nhigh-impact and tensile strength, and is nontoxic; CPVC can be used for hot and cold-water applications. Functions at\n180× F in pressure systems and at higher temperatures in low- and non-pressure systems. CPVC does require a special\nsolvent cement different from cement used for other types of plastic welding.\n\nIt is used in hot and cold water-supply systems and hot and cold chemical-distribution systems.\n\nPolyethylene (PE) - excellent chemical and crush resistance. Has high impact strength and\nflexibility and good low-temperature performance. Functions in temperatures from -65o to 120 degrees F in low-pressure\napplications and to 200 degrees in non-pressure applications.\n\nPE is used in low-pressure water systems, such as golf-course sprinklers; to carry corrosive liquids and gases; as\nunderground conduits and gas-pipe reliners; in industrial and chemical laboratory drainage systems, and underground gas\npiping. Perforated PE is used as a corrugated drainage pipe for foundation drainage.\n\nPolybutylene (PB) - only flexible plastic tubing suitable for use with hot and cold water\nin pressure systems. PB has excellent chemical resistance to acids and alkalis, but is not suited for fuel oil,\ngasoline or kerosene distribution systems.\n\nPolybutylene can be joined with heat fusion, flare or compression fittings. However, it is not solvent weldable.\nSeveral plastic fitting designs are available for use with PB.\n\nPolybutylene has excellent strength characteristics. Manufacturers of PB claim that should water freeze inside, the\ntubing will not burst. However, some fittings used with PB will break under ice expansion.\n\nPB is rated to function at 180× F up to 100 psi; higher temperatures can be tolerated with a relatively small\nreduction in pressure.\n\nPolypropylene (PP) - excellent chemical resistance, resistant to sulphur-bearing\ncompounds, lightweight, good tensile strength and saltwater resistance. Stronger and more rigid than polyethylene with\na higher functioning temperature (190 degrees F), polypropylene is popular as a material for tubular products, such as\nP-traps, because of its high chemical resistance.\n\nAlthough there are many types and sizes of plastic pipe available, the most popular for home use is flexible\npolyethylene pipe with 1/2\", 3/4\" or 1\" inside diameter. This pipe is lightweight and can be cut with an ordinary sharp\nknife or a fine-toothed hacksaw blade.\n\nWhen metal pipe is buried underground, care must be taken to drain water before temperatures drop below freezing.\nOtherwise, both pipe and fittings would rupture when freezing water expands.\n\nThese precautions are not necessary with flexible plastic pipe. It can be buried a few inches below the surface or\ndeep enough to protect the pipe against accidental damage from digging or cultivation.\n\nTo install flexible plastic pipe, the homeowner simply unrolls a coil of plastic pipe; couplings are not required\nunless the pipe is cut.\n\nSemi-rigid and rigid plastic pipe, which is sold in 10' to 20' lengths, does require coupling.\n\nDepending on the chemical composition of the pipe, pieces are joined with an insert coupler using metal straps to\nhold the coupling to each section of pipe or with a coupler that is sealed with a pipe cement. This cement creates a\nchemically fused bond between coupling and pipe that is as strong as the pipe itself. The exception is PE, which cannot\nbe welded with cement.\n\nMost plastic pipe can be joined with and worked into metal plumbing with the use of proper adapters or transition\nfittings.\n\nRapid technical advances in the manufacture and use of plastic pipe have made it imperative for consumers to follow\nthe manufacturers' information on use, installation and pressure ratings of the pipe and fittings.\n\nOne area where these changes are most evident is in supply tubing. Supply tubing has gone through a metamorphosis\nfrom copper to corrugated copper to polybutylene and vinyl supply tube. Vinyl supply tubing is easy to hook up, and\nwith its flexible \"give\" will alleviate a mild water-hammer condition created by many single-lever faucets with quick\nshutoff. Stainless-steel braided flexible supply connectors are another form of supply tubing. Stainless-steel braiding\nencases a nontoxic synthetic polymer or neoprene rubber core suitable for both hot and cold water.\n\nManufacturer claims include high-burst pressure ratings (1,500 psi to more than 2,400 psi), resistance to\nembrittling, and crimping on fittings that won't creep or blow off.\n\nNo cutting or flaring is involved which eliminates pipe bending, soldering and special tools.\n\nStainless steel braided connectors are available for faucets and toilets as well as for water heaters, water\nsofteners, dish and clothes washers, hot tubs, etc.\n\nSimilar connectors use nylon braiding which offers a reduced burst pressure in the 600 psi range.\n\nSOIL PIPE\n\nSoil pipe is made of vitreous clay, bituminous fiber, plastic, drainage type copper (DWV),\nor cast iron. Each has certain advantages depending upon location, soil types and price. Copper and cast iron are more\nexpensive, but serve better where rigidity is a must or where tree roots are massive enough to crush fiber or enter\nclay joints.\n\nCopper and plastic (where permitted) have advantages of prefabrication and long lengths. Cast iron pipe also comes\nin longer lengths.\n\nType L - lighter than K; used most often in residential water lines. K and L are\nmanufactured in hard (rigid 20' lengths) and soft (60', 100' and 200' lengths, the latter in smaller sizes).\n\nType M - hard (20' lengths and under). Recommended for light domestic water lines and is\nnot permitted in some city codes.\n\nRefrigeration - 50' coils and rigid 20' lengths. Most refrigeration copper has moisture\nremoved and ends sealed for better performance of refrigerants. It is often used in heater connectors, but has a\ntendency to build a crust of corrosion on the inside if gas has any trace of sulphur. Flexible brass or soft-aluminum\npipe seems to be more efficient for gas transmission to household heating and appliances.\n\n'K' is used in municipal and commercial construction. 'L' is used for residential water lines. 'M' is for light\ndomestic low friction coefficient\n\nProbably the most popular pipe today. Often a smaller diameter will suffice because of low friction\ncoefficient\n\nWrought Iron (or galvanized)\n\nHas to be threaded. More difficult to cut. Measure- ments for jobs must be exact\n\nLower than copper because nipple unions reduce water flow.\n\nScrew on connections\n\nRigid lengths up to 22 ft. Usually cut to size wanted\n\nCorrodes in alkaline water more than others. Produces rust stains\n\nGenerally found in older homes\n\nRecommended if lines are in a location subject to impact\n\nPlastic Pipe\n\nCan be cut with a saw or knife\n\nSame as copper tubing\n\nInsert couplings, clamps; also by cement\n\nRigid, semi - rigid - 10 ft., 20 ft. lengths. Flexible\n\nLong life; resists rust / corrosion\n\nFor cold water installations. Used for well.\n\nLightest of all; weighs about 1/8 of the weight of steel\n\nTRAPS AND TUBULAR GOODS\n\nTRAPS\n\nPlumbing fixtures are equipped with either a P or S trap, which is frequently fitted with a clean-out plug on the\nbottom. The trap bend holds water which prevents odors from backing up into the home.\n\nDrum and bottle-type traps for bathtubs or kitchen sinks consist of a cylindrical metal box or settling basin\nattached to the waste pipe. They are generally provided with a screw-cap cover that can be removed when cleaning is\nnecessary.\n\nIn most areas 1-1/4\" chrome-plated brass traps are used in lavatory drains, and satin-finished or nickel-plated\nbrass 1-1/2\" traps are standard equipment on residential kitchen sinks. (Satin finish is unpolished chrome-plated\ntubular).\n\nPlastic P and J traps can be used in retrofit as well as new plumbing work with adapters and transitional couplings\nto connect plastic with other materials.\n\nCorrugated flexible plastic drain is useful when installing new sinks or vanities with older drain systems. Many\ntimes the drain from a new installation will not line up with the old drain pipe. Corrugated, plastic drain pipe allows\nthe d-i-yer to connect misalignments by as much as several inches.\n\nThese are primarily used in adding disposers to existing sinks. There is a fair market for 1-1/4\" threaded\ntailpieces that extend lavatory wastes to the correct distance for trap connection.\n\nFittings for tubular brass consist almost entirely of 45 degree ells, 90 degree ells, couplings and tees in 1-1/4\"\nand 1-1/2\" sizes-all with slip joint nuts and washers. Strap wrenches are recommended for most work with chrome-plated\nbrass.\n\nCheck your state and local codes before starting any project.

      "text": "INFANT FORMULA & FLUORIDE The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2006 announced that it will allow bottlers to claim that fluoridated water may reduce the risk of caries (tooth decay). The American Dental Association (ADA) agrees with the FDA that this health claim is not intended for use on bottled water marketed to infants, for whom lesser amounts of fluoride are appropriate. The right amount of fluoride is needed to help protect teeth and prevent caries. Fluoride intake above optimal amounts, however, creates a risk of developing enamel fluorosis in teeth during their development before they erupt through the gingiva (gums). Most cases of enamel fluorosis result in faint white lines or streaks on tooth enamel that are not readily apparent to the affected person or the casual observer.\n\nOPTIMAL FLUORIDE LEVEL The optimal fluoride level in drinking water is 0.7 to 1.2 parts per million, an amount that has been proven beneficial in reducing caries. In some areas, naturally occurring fluoride may be above or below these levels. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requires notification by the water supplier if the fluoride level exceeds 2 ppm.\nPeople living in areas where naturally occurring fluoride levels in drinking water exceed 2 ppm should consider an alternative water source or home water treatments to reduce the risk of fluorosis in young children.\n\nRECONSTITUTED INFANT FORMULA\nThe ADA offers these recommendations to reduce fluoride intake from reconstituted infant formula. Breast milk is widely acknowledged as the most complete form of nutrition for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends human milk for all infants (except for the few for whom breast-feeding is determined to be harmful).\n\nFor infants who get most of their nutrition from formula during their first 12 months, ready-to-feed formula is preferred to help ensure that their fluoride intake does not exceed the optimal amount. If liquid concentrate or powdered infant formula is the primary source of nutrition, it can be mixed with water that is fluoride-free or contains low levels of fluoride to reduce the risk of fluorosis. These include water labeled as purified, demineralized, deionized or distilled, as well as reverse osmosis filtered water. Many stores sell these types of drinking water for less than $1 per gallon.\n\nParents and caregivers should consult with their dentist, pediatrician or family physician regarding the most appropriate water to use in their area to reconstitute infant formula. Ask your pediatrician or family physician whether water used in infant formula should be sterilized first (sterilization, however, will not remove fluoride).\n\nTOOTHPASTE & MOUTHRINSE\n\nUnless advised to do so by a dentist or other health care professional, parents should not use fluoride toothpaste in children younger than 2 years, because they may inadvertently swallow the toothpaste. Children 2 years and older should use an appropriate-sized toothbrush with a small brushing surface and only a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste at each brushing. They should always be supervised while brushing and taught to spit out, rather than swallow, toothpaste.\n\nFluoride mouth rinses have been shown to help prevent caries in both children and adults. Unless the child's dentist advises otherwise, the ADA does not recommend the use of fluoride mouth rinses in children younger than 6 years, because they may be more likely to inadvertently swallow the mouth rinse. Fluoride supplements are not recommended for children younger than 6 months. Children should receive only dietary supplemental fluoride tablets or drops as prescribed by their dentist or physician based on the supplement schedule approved by the ADA, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry\n(visit \"\n\nMotivating people to make positive changes to their behavior can be difficult. Direct attempts to persuade them may backfire and/or cause resistance.\n\nBut by empathizing with you about the difficulty of quitting and by offering you ongoing support, we may become a trusted ally.\n\n.\n\nLet us help you learn various ways to quit smoking. Medications like Chantix and various QUIT programs may give you a fighting chance. Wanda Brown, RN at St. Croix Regional Medical Center specializes in various Quit Programs, too.\n\nUse the Link at the bottom of the page to access information on Chantix … and feel free to ask us about helping you quit.\n\nDrug Information Web Site\n\nWhat about OTC whitnening products like strips, toothpastes, rinses, etc?\n\nThere are various products made by Crest and Rembrandt that are safe and effective. However, they are not for everyone. Also, their effectiveness and usefulness are limited.\n\nWhitestrips … these are small strips [think cellophane tape] that fit over the front teeth and have a gel on the inside. This gel has a similar active ingredient as the office gels we supply as part of our home whitening system.\n\nWhitestrips … Who should use them? First of all, note that all bleaching products only work on natural teeth, not fillings or crowns. I have not seen consistent success with adults. For ages 18-30 it can be very effective for many. For most adults the office supplied, customized products we use can get very good results and with fewer side effects.\n\nRinses and toothpastes … Most of these have minimal effectiveness for \"whitening.\" They primarily help to eliminate or reduce surface staining. Also, some people develop sensitivity with their teeth with regular use. Bottom line … pick a toothpaste that tastes good and has fluoride. They are all so similar as to make them essentially equal.\n\nIn-Office [one appointment] bleaching… This is a system that uses very concentrated products to get your whitening done in a single appointment. I am not an advocate of this because it is expensive, labor intensive, can cause more tooth sensitivity, and doesn't end up with any better result than our home whitening system.\n\nHome bleaching trays … This is our preferred method. It allows flexibility for length of time used and allows flexibility on the most appropriate products. Also, if you keep your tray you can touch up once a year and simply buy another tube or two of the bleaching gel. We supervise its use and can usually get very nice results.\n\n3rd molars [wisdom teeth] usually develop and erupt around age 18. It is at this time that a special X-Ray is often times taken … called a panoramic x-ray. At our office we then decide if the 3rd molars should be extracted.\n\nTypical reasons for removing 3rd molars are:\n\nThere is not enough room for full eruption into the correct position.\n\nThey are impinging on the neighboring molars.\n\nThey may increase the odds of further crowding of your other teeth.\n\nThey develop very sore or infected gums if they are only partially through the gum … and cannot fully erupt into position.\n\nIf they are partly erupted they are very hard to clean and much more prone to decay and gum disease.\n\nWithout the 3rd molars it is easier to clean the 2nd molars in front of them … further reducing the risks of cavities and gum disease on these teeth.\n\nThe American Dental Association position on Community Water Fluoridation\n\n• All water, including lakes, rivers and the ocean, contains naturally occurring amounts of fluoride. If the natural level of fluoride in water is very low, public water systems may adjust it to an optimal level proven to help prevent tooth decay–approximately 1 part of fluoride dissolved in a million parts of water. This process is called community water fluoridation.\n• Based on the weight of scientific evidence, which indicates that community water fluoridation can help prevent up to 40 percent of tooth decay, the American Dental Association remains a strong advocate for community water fluoridation. The World Health Organization, the American Medical Association, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the ADA and many other health organizations acknowledge that water fluoridation is a public health measure that has contributed to a significant decline in dental decay over the past 70 years."

Until now, there was not much we could do about this because clean water solutions were costly, required electricity, spare parts, and so on. But the LifeStraw offers a practical way to provide tens of millions of people with clean water every year.\n\nLifeStraw is a personal, low-cost water purification instrument with a life time of 700 liters or approximately one year of water consumption for a single person. Positive test results have been achieved on tap, turbid and saline water against common waterborne bacteria.\n\nLifeStraw has been tested by independent and qualified research laboratories. The instrument contains PuroTech Disinfecting Resin (PDR). PDR is a patented, effective material that kills bacteria on contact. Active carbon withholds particles such as parasites. The tests and studies indicate the following: The level of bacteria in the water will be reduced to levels that are safe for human consumption and any health risk is slight. Any parasitic properties in the water will also be reduced significantly. Adults and children of any age can use the LifeStraw, provided they have access to drinking water.\n\nIf we can find a way of manufacturing and distributing one of these to each human at risk, every year, we could save countless lives.\n\nEach LifeStraw lasts for one person's annual needs of clean water.\n\nA straw costing a few dollars will save numerous lives per year.

To ensure that our water is safe and healthy, it goes through quite a process before arriving at our homes. It's an intricate system that we tend to take for granted.\nCeleste Cantu: We look at water as something that God gives us, it flows down and the rain and we always expect it to be pure and sparkling, and we take a lot for granted. But in fact a lot of work goes into making that water safer humans to drink and to keep our streams safe and healthy for fish and for humans to swim in and enjoy.\nLisa McRee: Our supply is constantly being tested and treated and as new contaminants emerged state and federal standards continued to evolve to ensure our water's quality.\nMale: As we improve our technology so that we can measure contaminants, pollutants that at a much lower level and we previously thought as we understand more about the effects of different compounds, chemical compound on our health whether it's long term or short term.\nLisa McRee: Treating our drinking water is really the second step in water—the first is curtailing the introduction of harmful substances before they reach the water supply. Our everyday activities contribute to the water pollution problem. Taking the dog for a walk and not cleaning their waste, going outside for a smoke and tossing the butt into the street only to be washed into the storm drains with thousands of other butts. We wash our cars or change the oil and the dirt and grease go down the gutter and into the storm drain. We like a lush green lawn so we spread fertilizer to help it grow. All these substances can end up in our rivers and estuaries.\nCeleste Cantu: People don't think about that very often and they don't realize, they think water just comes out and it goes down the drain and God knows where it goes after that, but it goes back to the river and the next town has a big pipe and it sucks it out at the river and treats it for our domestic consumption. So if you can imagine that every piece of bacteria and every piece of oil or every spot of—grows downhill and that drop of water that's rolling accumulates all that pollution until it hits the estuary, the impact is tremendous."

It's a horrific, nightmarish thing to go through. No one can fully understand the pain of this unless you experience it.\n\nIt appears the Sautners might have said some things they'd rather not have the public know, doesn't it? They're more than willing to shed their privacy to challenge Cabot, DEP, EPA and all the other folks who have investigated and found their water to be safe. The phrase \"Craig Sautner, Dimock\" generates 28,100 pages on Google but, suddenly, the world is supposed to respect their privacy so they can tell but half the story? It's a bit like the brown water they carry around in that jug – effective as long as it's not tested – isn't it?

They are, in fact, declaring \"Enough Is Enough\" and starting to speak out against the ongoing effort aimed at maligning their community, aided and abetted by a fawning media inclined to believe anything that is said about natural gas producers as long as it happens ...\n\nPennEnvironment has been on a tear lately putting out videos slamming the responsible development of natural gas, notwithstanding the group's putative status as a supporter of clean energy. We watched just a few of these videos and evaluated some of the claims and assertions made therein. The first up is \"Farming,\" the ...\n\nI just got done watching one of the best videos I've seen for educating citizens on the process and potential involved in developing the Mighty Marcellus. \"Shale and America's Future\" is a 30 minute movie produced by the American Clean Skies Foundation (ACSF). ACSF is a non-profit organization that works ...\n\nThose who have a weak position like to demonize and thrown stones at people who protest and speak out and stand up for the truth. This country is built on freedom of speech and freedom to protest and resist what one believes is an injustice and untruth. So, imput bad motives to us all you want, but the Truth will prevail. If you have the Truth , you don't have to malign others and twist words and situations to make them look worse.\nBy the way, another methane , emission stack was put up today in Franklin Forks in front of the country store, \"Heavenly Angels\".\n\nYou and I are old enough to remember the Dave Clark Five's song by that name. The last stanza went like this:\n\n(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)\nNow you've gone and I'm all alone\n(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)\nAnd you're still way up there on your throne\n(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)\nNothin' seems to ever go right\n(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)\n'Cause night is day and day is night\n\nTom, How dare someone only tell half truths. Your honest, altruistic and elevated ethics have again revealed a sordid conspiracy by those no good rich people that only care about themselves and their second homes. You are a shining star in the community!\n\nWell, there are a lot of \"rich people that only care about themselves and their second homes\" when it comes to natural gas development the region desperately needs but I never said they were \"no good\" and what in the world any of that has to do with this story is beyond me. Bill captured it pretty well, however, in this story:\n\nIt was out of that post that Dimock Proud was born, as friends rallied to her story. We are proud to have given her a platform on our site and to call her and the members of Dimock Proud our friends, because our views happen to coincide most of the time.\n\nRegardless, that's not the issue here. What is at issue is the fact Vera is only telling half the story, refusing to show how Craig acted or what the EPA said.\n\nWow; a purporting-to-represent-my-county outfit started by a couple that's been IN my county for almost as many years as Victoria Switzer!\n\nLENOXVILLE PROUD, on the other hand (where we picked the RIGHT company – SWN – and DON'T busybody against our neighbors having water), FORGOT more about how things are done in Susquehanna County in the few decades that IT's been in it including BEFORE 2003 than what the Grimsleys have learned since their 2003 arrival.\n\nDimock Proud includes many residents who have lived in the area their entire lives. Moreover, Jim and Ann are phenomenal people doing a phenomenal job and are viewed as leaders by their neighbors. Nevertheless, I'm thrilled you're thrilled with SWN. They are a good company and so is Cabot.\n\nI have a water well in the southern tiern NY, no oil an gas drilling in our state. Guess what, I wont drink my water. I will bath, wash my hands and use it without reservation. But I wont drink it. Sediment and a lack of confidence in it. Must be Cabot Oil and Gas's fault.\n\n\".\"\n\nThis comment kind of sums it up. I am amazed at the lies these people get caught in everyday and yet people still follow?\nThis will be like the Y2k garbage and fear campaign. People will remember those that blindly followed. The comments will probably flow like this. Hey isn't that JoJo the guy that bit hook line and sinker on that fracking fear scam? Yes I bet he still has boxes of can goods still left over from y2k in his basement too.\nMaybe someday the headline will read NY falls pray to Park funded media scam, the damage to jobs and revenue has taken from a generation.\n\nto keep their home\ncash in an amount twice the assessed value of their home\na water filtration system to 'remediate' a methane problem which pre-existed their home\nlots of attention from the press and celebrities\n\nVera darling…..nice old cliche. However before you can think about walking a mile in those moccasins it would help if you are grounded. You have become anesthetized and are suffering from tunnel vision; you are obsessed.\n\nSo here is a cliche that might help: Sometime you can't see the forest for the tree's.\n\nIt's so nice of Vera to respect the Sautner's privacy after helping them to become a public household name. Why then, does she not respect the privacy of other landowners when it comes to giving tours to non-residents and non-American citizens.\n\nThe venting stack placed in Franklin Forks at Heavenly Angels was for preventative measures. Historically, most houses in Franklin Forks that have wells (not spring fed water sources) have been vented at one time by the landowner themselves (very ingeniously I might add).\n\nIt's just a coincidence that all these people have water problems now that is occurring naturally????? All these years their water came out of their faucet like brown sludge and we never heard about it??? It would have been the talk of the town. And to state someone is building a house with their royalty money, how do they know that for a fact???? These articles that are written, where do they get their facts?\n\nit's not a sin to build a large home and Scott Ely owns land and inherited land from his Dad and his wife is a Dentist and he is doing most of the work on his home himself. And we have documents , predrill tests from Cabot that shows no preexisting problems or methane\nin the water and can show that to anyone. The gas companies have their propaganda and travel from town to town with the same story if any concerns, complaints , problems come up and say it's pre-existing and was always bad or a problem. They are doing the same in Franklin Forks and the truth will come out. Would you rather believe the corporation that came into town to make a profit or your own neighbors?\n\nI assume that by \"if appropriate\", you mean that you'll put it up only \"if\" there's at least one tidbit in it that can be embellished to help Enough Already's spin. Therefore, I suggest that Vera send it to Brian Oram instead. He handles things in an unbiased manner unlike you.\n\nThe left posing as doing good for the people of this country are doing more to tear it down. Will someone please explain how we can lessen our demand on foreign oil and keep this country strong and capable of supporting itself? As someone in the energy field (electric power generation) for 30 years I know wind turbines and solar panels and not the answer. Like it or not \"drill-baby-drill\" is the answer until the left finishes creating & manufacturing the perpetual motion machine.\n\nI very much appreciate the comments on the newly posted video. Not only are individuals identified improperly (ATSDR is a federal agency, not a state one) but also it shows just how little whoever was editing this video knows about water quality, testing and contamination.\n\nThe COMPLETE video is HERE–within a link in this article:  But on the video posting on vimeo, It CLEARLY stated fair use BY PERMISSION ONLY. You did NOT have permission from me to use this video. Nor did you have my permission to create a derivative product. You are violating my copyright license. You are also greatly distorting what happened. CEASE and DESIST all use of my work product.\nAs the video explains, the EPA RAISED ITS DETECT LEVELS for the contaminants in question. They SAY they raised the detect levels to give the water the 'all clear' because of \"LAB CONTAMINANTS: and/or 'CONTAMINATED FIELD SAMPLES'—YOU HAVE LIBELED THE SAUNTERS AND VIOLATED MY COPYRIGHT. CEASE AND DESIST. You are also mean. Lisa Barr\n\nVery curious as to who ownes the water well these people (litigants)claim doesn't work or has issues in the video. Since numerous statements have been made about it I'm guessing these people have some sort of proof to back up their claims. I challenge them to show what if any proof they have right here and right now. Post it on this page for everyone to see. In simple terms Put Up or ShutUp!!!!\n\nI can't believe the people of Dimock are not standing up for these familes. I guess it's true, they just want the drilling to resume to get their share $$$. What happened to neighbors helping neighbors? How can it be a coincidence that all these people have water problems now that is occurring naturally?? I would react exactly how they did, no I would be worse. I visited one of the families many times whose water was like pure spring water before Cabot. They did not have one problem with their water. It's brown sludge now. I wouldn't use it to flush my toilet. DEP declared Cabot contaminated it with their faulty cement, what happened to that statement? You people that are not standing up for your neighbors that have water problems now, better pray that your water doesn't get contaminated when drilling resumes. If it does you better keep your mouth shut or the turncoats will be after you also.\n\nThat is insane. How can they raise the detect levels of chemicals because they found contamination which was caused by their own testing? Think they better get professionals in there to do the testing that won't contaminate their own work. EPA now looks like a big joke. Political, no question about it.\n\nFor Dimock Proud to edit that video is really going low. How can you be proud of that???\n\nWhy don't all the people that don't agree with these families load up on their water, take it home to your families. Drink it, use it for 6 months. Any volunteers????? Yes, I agree, Put Up.\n\n\"I've looked at all your historical data, all the way back to 2008, and other than some bacteria, that seemed to be somewhat persistent early on we didn't see anything in there that raised any alarms in our eyes.\"\n\nshows how little you know , Tom and how you spread \"half-truths\":\nthe Cabot bottled water is long gone; the water in the garage is water given, donated by\ncaring people outside of Dimock and usually outside of our county and State. When I give tours, I ask the people to bring bottled water to donate to the families that\nneed it, since their own neighbors won't help them… and\ngroups and individuals in NY , especially, donate water to help . It's being stored\nat Sautners for distribution.\n\nAgree with you , PG PG: the water has changed, is changed since drilling . It's amazing to me how people turn a blind eye to helping their neighbors with bad water when they have the money dangled in front of them. The lust for and the love of money is truly an evil. Dimock , as our whole county , many, have falled in lust for money and the prospect of it. The future for us is truly dim since this industry has come in.\n\nsorry, we disagree on what is a \"fact\" and what is \"contamination\". The EPA did not use the word \"contamination\" . They wrote that the water is not a \"health concern\".\nThere is a difference of meaning in those choice of words !\n\nI see Vera and her new so called friends haven't taken on my challenge. I guess they actually have no proof of the claims they have made. Since they can't back up anything they have said maybe they should retract the statements. If you have proof that peoples water and wells are bad then you should show it. Since you have no such proof you people have been caught in yet another lie in a along list of them. It's just disgusting what you people will do for money and fame. You talk of greed yet you are the ones who are greedy. You've made so many statements that make the people and town of Dimock look and sound bad. Yet you people are the ones who truly are. You have set such a bad example of how people should act and treat one another. You have set such bad examples for your children and grandchildren. You are all embarrassments to NE PA."

The mineral, which can be produced as a powder or granules, can be used to absorb toxic heavy metals from water located beneath the ground or waste water streams.\n\nNichola is now looking at creating other types of filter and forming barriers that could prevent pollutants spreading from contaminated areas.\n\nDetails of the research have been published in the International Journal of Environment and Waste Management.\n\nRelated Topics\n\nMore Coverage\n\nGround Glass Solution for Cleaner Water(Sep. 15, 2011) — British science has led to a use for waste glass that cannot be recycled that could help clean up polluted waterways by acting as an ion-exchange filter to remove lead, cadmium and other toxic ... > read more"

      "text": "I'm not sure that you could survive long-term on the amount of water you could distil that way, although it certainly would work. I'm thinking about getting one of these to stash in my \"preparedness cupboard\" ;-) \n\nI think It was Gandi who confessed to the world he owed his health to drinking a glass of his own urine every morning. Is he still alive?\n\nA few years back a rescue by the Australian Navy of a British Sailor who had ripped the keel off his racing yacht. Sonar bulbs dropped from the ships Helicopter picked up the sound of Tony Bullimore in his upturned yacht pumping drinking water. He used a Osmosis pump (available in many survival shops) to desalinate sea water for drinking.\n\nI bought one after that and carried it everywhere with me. One day I had to use it. 100 pumps per tumbler full of water. Took forever to get a decent drink but it tasted OK. What was my water source? Urine of course! I mixed urine from 5 people and filtered it with the osmosis pump.\n\nBeen there, done that, taught it, never got cholera. Distillation process removes vibrio bacteria as well as others. Your numbers are way off on composition of Urine. Check medical text next time, not Wikipedia! Salt and other impurities ARE remove by a solar still.\n\nFalse information.Urine is a pure substance.It is used in a lot of medicines some people drink urine for their own health.If you care to do some research on Google .You will discover some truth about URINE what it does in the body when you drink it.I had a cancerous sore on my leg.An old codger said to me all you do it put your own urine in the hole and it will deal. Surprisingly it did\n\nThere is a much easier way for things like this, Survivorman purified salt water, you need a container with water in it, a cup in the middle, then you cover it with something, preferably clear, (like seran wrap) and then you put a rock on the plastic, over the cup. The sun will evaporate the water, it condenses on the plastic, and drips into the cup. ALSO, you can just drink urine straight away, just don't let it sit before you do, or it goes septic. But if you pee, and then drink it straightaway, you're fine.\n\nLife straw will NOT FILTER SALT from water, it will purify saltwater, but it does NOT DESALINATE. Go with a few solar stills (yes a few, like more than 2) per person. Did I mention that if you drink salt water through a lifestraw, as your only source of water, system you will die?\n\nas one whose drunk his urine, first thing, mid stream, every day for 5 years, and having read every book on the subject, such asyour own perfect medicine and the golden fountain, ican assure you all its an UNNEEDED bodily product, poop is waste, urine is sterile and 96% water, the remainder is extremly beneficial. Anyone who says otherwise should research the subject fully as i have before stating something that the Indian culture has benefited from for 5000 years!!\n\nI'm quite famiiiar with this method and it generally doesn't yield much when used in an environment where it is necessary to use such methods to collect water. There are better ways to collect drinking water and this should only be a last resort. Also you shouldn't drink urine.\n\nall plants release water in a gas form through the pores in their leaves and \"skin\" as part of the water cycle. (i cant remember the name of the step, but i learned it last year) so poison plants would work.\n\nGood explanation of a solar still. However, for any water that is \"suspect\" -- which is anything that doesn't come out of a bottle or a tap -- being able to purify it easily is important. In case of emergency, we have a large pond on our property, but I wouldn't drink out of it, so we've always kept an extra gallon or two of Clorox (the original stuff, not the fancier, newer flavors) in case we need to drink pond or rainwater. The mix is 16 drops per gallon for drinking water, and a 1:9 mix is an extremely good disinfectant. Since no one will remember the mix to use (including me, probably), I have the formula written in permanent magic marker on the side of the Clorox container. I suspect treating urine with this mix would make it safely drinkable ... though perhaps still not very appealing.\n\nthe problem with drinking urine isn't germs, it is everything dissolved in it that your (or someone's) body was trying to get rid of. think drinking sea water, or blood. not exactly the same, but similar problem: you wouldn't expect bleach to be able to make either of those potable. no, you have to distill it (and leave all the solids behind) as in this instructable."
