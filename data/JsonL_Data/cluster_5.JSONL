      "text": "Q: Do penny stocks always sell for pennies or would a stock selling for several dollars also qualify? -- C.G., via the Internet\n\nA: A penny stock refers to an inexpensive equity, generally selling for $5 a share or less.\n\nThese often trade over the counter, such as on the OTC Bulletin Board or the pink sheets, though sometimes on exchanges. The Securities and Exchange Commission warns investors in penny stocks that they could lose their entire investment.\n\nHighly speculative penny stocks are hyped in millions of spam e-mail messages sent by promoters every day. These breathlessly extol virtues of obscure companies and make outrageous stock predictions.\n\nThose who already own the stock usually benefit. When they see the price inflate, they dump their shares and leave you holding them as the stock plummets.\n\nIf you decide to invest in penny stocks in the hope your selections will prove the exception, don't invest much. Ask first for the company's financial details (if it doesn't have to file audited reports with the SEC) and find out its market value (it's better if it's $50 million or more)."

Finance when compared to other sites.\n\nResolution\n\nUsers are often curious why the intraday high/low data we show for the Dow Jones Industrial Average ^DJI differ from other sites reporting. The short answer is that there are two different methods to calculate high and low prices for the index—Theoretical and Actual—and we choose to display the Theoretical high/low data in historical prices since the data ranges back to 1928, versus 1992 for the Actual data.\n\nThe intraday data we display for ^DJI on the quote summary page is Actual data. Explanations of both calculation methods are below.\n\nThe Theoretical Dow Jones Industrial Average assumes all index components hit their high or low at the same time during the day. At the end of the trading day, the daily highs for all 30 Dow components are used to calculate the index high for the day, and the same is performed for the index low.\n\nIn 1992, Dow Jones started using the Actual method, which calculates the index every 10 seconds throughout the trading day. Before 1992, the Actual method did not exist. Since all index components almost never hit their highs and lows at the same time, the Theoretical high is almost always higher than the Actual, and the Theoretical low is almost always lower than the Actual."

      "text": "Technical or Fundamental Analysis?\n\nThere are many reasons which can prove that technical analysis is better and superior than fundamental analysis. Here is a comparison between technical and fundamental analysis. Technical analysis focuses on the study about market action, while fundamental analysis focuses on supply and demand forces that guide trend movements in the market.\n\nStrategies of technicians and fundamentalists\n\nThe main motive of fundamentalists is to know the basic value of stocks and every factor that affects price is being determined by them. A fundamentalist decides to sell the stock, when its intrinsic value is under the current price because in that case a stock becomes overpriced. Stocks should be purchased at the time when its price is less than the intrinsic value because at that time market is undervalued.\n\nFor technicians, reasons behind the market movements are least important but fundamentalists concentrate on the study of market movements. Technicians are of the view that the effect of all events that lead to change in price is being reflected by the price. Hence, studying price action is an essential step for them.\n\nTechnical and fundamental analysis both are important\n\nBoth technical and fundamental analysis has been used by most of the people for trading purpose. Many fundamentalists and technicians have basic idea about technical approach and fundamental approach, respectively. However, most of the people prefer to adopt one method.\n\nWhy to select technical analysis?\n\nAs technical analysis is adaptable and flexible, therefore technical rules can be implemented to every market, including stocks or futures. A technician has ability to handle many markets at one time and this has been considered a strong point because in each market one can handle big movements.\n\nTechnical rules can be used for swing trading, day trading and long-term trading. Only time of charts can be changed and all other rules are same. According to some people, short-term trading is the only trading where the use of technical analysis is perfect but this is not correct. The potency of technical analysis has proved weekly and monthly charts that refer to several years and with the help of this one can experience long-term trading. The slower pace of technical analysis is one of its major disadvantages.\n\nWhy to choose fundamental analysis?\n\nIn case of technical analysis, if a person knows the history of a stock, he can easily predict its future but if a new company enters stock market, one cannot predict its future because it does not have any past. So in that case, fundamental analysis can be helpful.\n\nConclusion\n\nOne can get the best returns in the stock market if the combination of both technical and fundamental analysis is used. The best way is to understand both the methods and then select one as a principle method and other as help."

Also, I suspect that PTJ has grown as a trader since that time, judging by size and reputation. All told, I have serious respect for the guy. And from what I gather, he seems to be a man of notable character, with his philanthropy being one example.\n\n(Admittedly, I'd be more than a bit surprised if he still used Gann and Elliot stuff. But, hell, who knows. In any event, as he is often cited as having said, it's largely about risk control.)\n\nWhat is the spread you typically get for the spot Euro?

      "text": "The Scam\n\nBy understanding\nhow the Wall Street con game operates, you can at least avoid being taken to the cleaners and perhaps\ngo on to study enough to profit from this knowledge.\n\nThe unwary investor is made to believe - by a press\nowned by the very people who are part of the Wall Street scam - that they can make a killing in the\nstock market if they get lucky. Over the years outsider, small-time investors have lost billions of\ndollars to the insiders who control and manipulate the stock market to take money from the ignorant.\n\nThe brainwashed investor believes that the stock market goes up and down according to what he\nreads in the Wall Street Journal or hears about on his evening TV program: interest rates, inflation rates, wholesale prices, gross national product, public fears about foreign and domestic events, and the rantings of the head of the \"Federal\" Reserve Board. This is all a con game to make the hapless investor believe that the rise and fall in stock prices is not being manipulated by the specialists. The astounding fact is that specialists, working at the behest of their investment banker cronies, are creating the ups and downs\nof the market to bring them obscene profits!\n\nThis is how the specialists pull off the scam:\n\n1. The specialists must first buy stocks at the lowest possible price, using one of the magic tricks of\nthe market called short selling (selling stocks you don't yet own in the hopes that the\nprice drops, so that you can purchase it back at a lower price; the difference between what you\nsold it for and what you purchased it back at is your profit): 1\n\nSince they control the stock prices, they simply begin lowering the prices\n\nThey \"borrow\" the stock from their or another brokerage firm's pool, with the understanding that at a\nlater date they will return the shares\n\nThe Wall Street Con Game News will announce that stock prices dropped sharply on\nlight trading, which is a cover\nfor the specialists' actual manipulation of the decrease in stock prices. The specialists don't want\nheavy trading and straight-line lowering of stock prices, else they might have to buy a lot of stock at\na higher price than desired. So they usually lower prices through a series of ups and downs of the\nmarket, dealing with small investors' shares as they go.\n\nThe SEC rules prohibit NYSE members from \"demoralizing the market by effecting short sales at\nor below a price lower than that of the last sale.\" But specialists have an insider loophole\nallowing them to sell short on downticks (drops in stock prices) without having to report these\ntransactions as short sales. Those same SEC rules force the hapless, small-time investor\nto sell short only on upticks - when stock prices are higher than the last preceding price. A very\nneat scam indeed.\n\n2. When the specialists have purchased their inventories of stocks at the lowest possible price (let's say\na million shares at an average of $20 a share: $20,000,000 investment), they then begin increasing\nstock prices.\n\nThey will wait until the stock prices reach a top price where they can realize windfall profits\n- let's say the stock reaches the price of $40 a share.\n\nAt this point the specialists sell their million shares at $40 a share and receive $40,000,000. A\nprofit of $20 million is easy if the con game is fixed in your favor.\n\n3. When the specialists want to buy stocks, they lower prices - and wait till the stocks are at the lowest\nprice possible before buying. The investors have been herded into \"panic buying\" as the prices drop.\nWhen the specialists want to sell stocks, they raise prices and sell at the highest\nprice. The uninformed investor is told that he or she must get in on the skyrocketing market boom.\nThe roller-coaster of the stock market is not a natural phenomenon at all, as the Wall Street\ncon game would have it, it's simply the Insiders doing their thing to take billions of dollars from\nhapless investors.\n\nBut meantime the unwary investor has purchased the stocks at their highest price, being conned\nby their stockbrokers to believe that they must get into the \"rising market.\" Then when the stock prices\nplummet, the brokers tell the witless investors they should \"cut their losses\" and sell. That $20 million\nhas to come from somewhere - from the small investors who didn't have a clue about what was going\non."

      "text": "Technical Indicator Balance Volume (OBV) is a momentum technical indicator that relates volume to price change. This indicator was introduced by Joseph Granville, OBV is considered to be a pretty simple indicator. If the closing price of the current bar is higher than the previous closing price, volume of the current bar is added to the previous volume of OBV; if the closing price of the current bar is lower than the previous closing price, current volume is deducted from the previous volume of the balance.\n\nOn Balance Volume analysis is based on the principle that OBV changes precede price changes. According to this principle balance volume rising indicates that professionals invest into the instrument. When later wide audience invests funds, On Balance Volume starts rapid growth.\n\nIf the price precedes OBV movement, a \"non-confirmation\" has occurred. Non-confirmations can occur at the bull market tops (when the price rises without the OBV growth or precedes it) or in the bottom of the bear market (when the price starts falling and the On Balance Volume does not decrease or precedes it).\n\nThe OBV is in a rising trend when each new peak is higher than the previous one and each new trough is lower than the previous trough. The same way, OBV falling trend is supposed successive decrease of peaks and troughs. When the OBV is moving sideways and is not making successive highs and lows, it is an indicator that a trend is not defined.\n\nIf a trend stops it will remain in the same position until the break takes place. The trend break may happen in two cases: when the trend changes from a rising trend to a falling trend or on the contrary: from a falling trend to a rising trend.\n\nIn second case the OBV becomes undecided and remains undecided for more than 3 periods. Thus, if uptrend changes to an undecided one and remains undecided for only two days and then changing back to uptrend, On Balance Volume is considered to be an uptrend for all this period.\n\nWhen the OBV trend changes its direction to a rising or falling trend, a \"breakout\" occurs. The OBV breakouts usually warn about a price break and investors should hold long positions if the OBV makes a break upwards and sell in case the BVI breaks downwards. Open positions should be held until the trend changes.\n\nCalculation\n\nIf today`s close is greater than yesterday`s close then: OBV(i) = OBV(i-1)+VOLUME(i)\nIf today`s close is less than yesterday`s close then: OBV(i) = OBV(i-1)-VOLUME(i)\nIf today`s close is equal to yesterday`s close then: OBV(i) = OBV(i-1)\nWhere:\nOBV(i) - is the indicator value of the current period;\nOBV(i-1) - is the indicator value of the previous period;\nVOLUME(i) - is the volume of the current bar."

Therefore, many Exchanges introduce a guarantee system to ensure the fulfillment of settlement obligation of market participants. The Korea Exchange and its member companies require investors to deposit an amount equivalent to the maximum risk exposure of their positions in the market (\"Margin\") as an assurance against settlement default. The KRX acts as counterparty in every transaction carried out in its Derivatives Market and asks investors to deposit certain level of margin based on the size of orders and positions they hold.\n\nTypes of margin\n\nMargin is categorized by paying entity and time of payment.\n\nBy paying entity\n\n\"Member Margin\" is paid by member companies to the KRX.\n\n\"Customer Margin\" is paid by customers to member companies.\n\nBy time of payment\n\n\"Pre-Margin\" is collected before accepting order.\n\n\"Post-Margin\" is collected after the end of trading at the market.\n\nMember Margin is subject to Post-Margin. However, with regard to Customer Margin, currently only Qualified Institutional Investors who are deemed to have adequate capability to fulfill the settlement obligations are subject to \"Post-Margin.\"\n\nComposition of Customer Margin\n\nPre-Margin shall be an amount exceeding the sum of each of the following amounts;\n\namount equivalent to sum of the orders,\n\namount equivalent to net risk exposures based on the previous day,\n\namount equivalent to net loss of the day,\n\nnet settlement amount of the day.\n\nPost-Margin shall be an amount exceeding the following amounts;\n\namount equivalent to net risk exposures based on the day,\n\nnet settlement amount of the day.\n\n※ For more detailed information concerning the KRX margin system, please refer to the KRX Derivatives Market Business Regulation (\n\nManagement of margin rate\n\nThe margin is determined by the level of the amount of maximum net loss that may sustain when the price or value of underlying asset changes to a specified level.\n\nThus, the margin rate applied in the Derivatives Market is adjusted on the basis of objective factors such as the price volatility. However, it is determined by taking into account other subjective factors such as the characteristics of derivatives product and market conditions.\n\nTo apply margin rate in a timely manner, margin rate is reviewed every quarter, if it is deemed necessary to adjust the margin rate, the rate is adjusted.

      "text": "Gamma is the largest risk in selling options which is the reason that the Gamma symbol has been chosen for this website. In fixed income it is called convexity and in Calculus/mathematics it is called the second derivative or the rate of change of the first derivative. Gamma tells us how much our delta, or exposure to the underlying, changes with a small change in the same underlying. You can read more about mitigating gamma losses in a previous post, but for now I just want to touch on one subsection of the gamma story.\n\nGamma changes as options get close to expiration. If you sold a put option with a strike of $50 and the option is trading at $55 with a few days to expiration, chances are that the delta of the option is close to zero. The problem is that the delta of that option moves quickly to -1 as we fall to $50 on the stock price, which implies that the gamma spikes as we get close to the strike. The point is that both delta and gamma change rapidly as an option gets near to expiration. What this means for a trader is that a written option that seems like a clear winner can quickly turn into a loser when the market moves quickly.\n\nA few recommendations for the option sellers with regards to short-dated options:\n\nGamma is not a fixed value. Do not fool yourself into thinking that you are safe because your negative gamma is small. More sophisticated traders will shock their option positions on a nightly basis.\n\nDon't be greedy. If you sold an option for $1 and the option is currently trading for $.05-$.25 then seriously consider closing out the position. Regardless of the calculated implied volatility on the short dated option, it is often not worth the dislocation risk to hold that position to expiration"

      "text": "Related Topics\n\nWhen you buy stocks it is very important to understand equity derivative.\n\nEquity derivative\n\nIn finance, an equity derivative is a class of financial instruments whose value is at least partly derived from one or more underlying equity securities. Market participants trade equity derivatives in order to transfer or transform certain risks associated with the underlying security. Options are by far the most common equity derivative, however there are many other types of equity derivatives that are actively traded.\n\nEquity options\n\nEquity options are the most common type of equity derivative. They provide the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) a quantity of stock (1 contract = 100 shares of stock), at a set price (strike price), within a certain period of time (prior to the expiration date).\n\nWarrants\n\nIn finance, a warrant is a security that entitles the holder to buy stock of the company that issued it at a specified price, which is much higher than the stock price at time of issue. Warrants are frequently attached to bonds or preferred stock as a sweetener, allowing the issuer to pay lower interest rates or dividends. They can be used to enhance the yield of the bond, and make them more attractive to potential buyers.\n\nConvertible bonds\n\nConvertible bonds are bonds that can be converted into shares of stock in the issuing company, usually at some pre-announced ratio. It is a hybrid security with debt- and equity-like features. It can be used by investors to obtain the upside of equity-like returns while protecting the downside with regular bond-like coupons.\n\nEquity futures, options and swaps\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to the equity markets using futures, options and swaps. These can be done on single stocks, a customized basket of stocks or on an index of stocks. These equity derivatives derive their value from the price of the underlying stock or stocks.\n\nStock market index futures\n\nStock market index futures are futures contracts used to replicate the performance of an underlying stock market index. They can be used for hedging against an existing equity position, or speculating on future movements of the index. Indices for futures include well-established indices such as S&P, FTSE, DAX, CAC40 and other G12 country indices. Indices for OTC products are broadly similar, but offer more flexibility.\n\nEquity basket derivatives\n\nEquity basket derivatives are futures, options or swaps where the underlying is a non-index basket of shares. They have similar characteristics to equity index derivatives, but are always traded OTC (over the counter, ie between established institutional investors), as the basket definition is not standardized in the way that an equity index is.\n\nThese are used normally for correlation trading.\n\nSingle-stock futures\n\nSingle-stock futures are exchange-traded futures contracts based on an individual underlying security rather than a stock index. Their performance is similar to that of the underlying equity itself, although as futures contracts they are usually traded with greater leverage. Another difference is that holders of long positions in single stock futures typically do not receive dividends and holders of short positions do not pay dividends. Single-stock futures may be cash-settled or physically settled by the transfer of the underlying stocks at expiration, although in the United States only physical settlement is used to avoid speculation in the market....\n\nEquity index swaps\n\nAn equity index swap is an agreement between two parties to swap two sets of cash flows on predetermined dates for an agreed number of years. The cash flows will be an equity index value swapped, for instance, with LIBOR. Swaps can be considered as being a relatively straightforward way of gaining exposure to an asset class you require. They can also be relatively cost efficient.\n\nEquity swap\n\nAn equity swap, like an equity index swap, is an agreement between two parties to swap two sets of cash flows. In this case the cash flows will be the price of an underlying stock value swapped, for instance, with LIBOR. A typical example of this type of derivative is the Contract for difference (CFD) where one party gains exposure to a share price without buying or selling the underlying share making it relatively cost efficient as well as making it relevantly easy to transact.\n\nExchange-traded derivatives\n\nOther examples of equity derivative securities include exchange-traded funds and Intellidexes"

In order to prevent such acts, insider trading laws and rules were created by the SEC. We'll be taking a look at the different forms required to be submitted in order to prevent insider stock trading.\n\nDefinition of SEC Form 3, 4, 5\n\nThe SEC requires all corporate insiders and any owner of 10% or more of a company's stocks to be registered and file Forms 3, 4 and 5. There are sites that automatically track insider trades such as Inside Monitor but the best way, as always, is to get the information directly from the source, i.e. the SEC website.\n\nThe initial filing is on Form 3. An insider of an issuer that is registering equity securities for the first time under Section 12 of the Exchange Act must file this Form no later than the effective date of the registration statement. If the issuer is already registered under Section 12, the insider must file a Form 3 within ten days of becoming an officer, director, or beneficial owner.\n\nChanges in ownership are reported on Form 4 and must be reported to the SEC within two business days. You can find the limited categories of transactions not subject to the two-day reporting requirement in the new rule.\n\nInsiders must file a Form 5 to report any transactions that should have been reported earlier on a Form 4 or were eligible for deferred reporting. If a Form must be filed, it is due 45 days after the end of the company's fiscal year. — SEC\n\nHow to Read the SEC Form 4\n\nAssuming you know how to get to the SEC Edgar page and enter the company ticker, a list of filed submissions is displayed.\n\nI am using (ValueVision) VVTV as an example of insider trading because of the recent heavy, albeit good, activity. Click on the HTML format for the form you wish to view and select the HTML format again on the next page to bring up the following Form 4.\n\nThere are a lot of boxes but I've circled what I feel to be the important parts. Form 4 shows the reader which insider is trading, whether their trade was a buy or sell and whether it was an option or open market purchase. Insider buying on the open market is a very good sign that the insiders believe the company is trading at a cheap price compared to its prospects.\n\nFrom the latest Form 4 filed by Keith Stewart of VVTV, we can see that he made an open market purchase of 50,000 shares at a price of $0.66.

We sell our stocks for many reasons but buy for only one. Insiders are the same. They may need the money for a downpayment on their private jet or vacation homes but they buy for one reason and one reason only. The shares of their company is cheap. If we look at VVTV again, their recent insider trading activity has been heavy. The CEO of VVTV has been snapping up shares in the 60c range. This also helps to build investor confidence that insiders are putting their money where their mouth is.\n\nThe insider trading rules to submit Forms 3,4,5 not only helps illegal insider trading, but also offers a glimpse of how management think of their company.\n\nDiclosure\n\nI hold VVTV at time of writingHi,\nDo you know why sometimes insiders buy shares on one day just to sell them at the next day or so?\nFor example, CARTER WILLIAM, CEO of Hemispherx Biopharma Inc. (HEB) bought 820,826 shares on 2010-08-10 and sold 377,388 shares on 2010-08-11.\n\n Jae Jun\n\nI have absolutely no idea. The officers may be day traders\n\nGregory P\n\nThis article does not give anywhere enough information to help read the forms. This needs to be expanded to include all the variations of the variables in order to be useful. There are many more variations of this form that mostly confuse and are difficult to understand. The simple case of buying a direct ownership in the company is the easiest to understand and the least variation needing explanation.\n\nA description of the various transaction codes, the presentation of stock options and stock grants and indirect purchases, transfers, etc … are commonly seen in practice and require further explanation to the novice.\n\nGregory P\n\nWith respect to Maxi's question concerning HEB: The shares bought on that date are related to an stock grant, not an open market purchase as it seems, and then subsequent selling to cover the taxes on that grant.\n\nNormally, when I see stock grants, the price is set to $0 rather than the current stock price on the day, so I do not like the way this looks on the completed forms that HEB issued.

      "text": "Saturday, December 12, 2009\n\nTechnical analysis is a study of past prices of an index/ Stock or Commodity with the assistance of certain mathematically derived tools to forecast the future price movements. However, the simplest & most effective tool devoid of mathematical applications which identifies and confirms a trend is called a trendline (Channels) . Stocks move up on persistent demand(buying) or down because of relentless supply (selling) or sideways because of a close tussle between buyers & sellers. A trendline in most occasions says it all. If you observe lane discipline and travel by the sign boards, you reach your destination safe & sound. Trendlines help you reap the richest haul from the markets in a similar safe way. A trend line is a straight line that connects two or more price points and then extends into the future to act as a line of support or resistance. The upward sloping trendline may be called a demand line as stocks bounce of that line due to a rise in demand and similarly the downward sloping trendline may be called a supply line as every time the stocks reaches that line supply comes in & prices fall. In a sideways market, the unresolved \"supply & demand\" gets into a tussle for supremacy which gets resolved when either demand or supply overpowers the other. As long as the larger trendline is intact, each sideways move will get resolved in favour of the main trend. Uptrend Line(Demand line) An uptrend line has a positive slope and is formed by connecting two or more low points. The second low must be higher than the first for the line to have a positive slope. Uptrend lines act as support and indicate that net-demand (demand less supply) is increasing even as the price rises. As long as prices remain above the trend line, the uptrend is considered solid and intact. A break below the uptrend line indicates that net-demand has weakened and a change in trend could be imminent. Downtrend Line (Supply Line) A downtrend line has a negative slope and is formed by connecting two or more high points. The second high must be lower than the first for the line to have a negative slope. Downtrend lines act as resistance, and indicate that net-supply (supply less demand) is increasing even as the price declines. As long as prices remain below the downtrend line, the downtrend is solid and intact. A break above the downtrend line indicates that net-supply is decreasing and that a change of trend could be imminent.\n\nSemi-log Chart for Higher cycles(Week/Month)\n\nHigh points and low points appear to line up better for trend lines when prices are displayed using a semi-log scale. This is especially true when long-term trend lines are being drawn or when there is a large change in price. Most charting programs allow users to set the scale as arithmetic or semi-log. A semi-log scale displays incremental values in percentage terms as they move up the y-axis. A move from Rs10 to Rs20 is a 100% gain, and would appear to be a much larger than a move from Rs100 to Rs110, which is only a 10% gain. The rate of ascent appears smoother on the semi-log scale. On the semi-log scale, the trend line fits all the way up.The semi-log scale reflects the percentage gain evenly, and the uptrend line was never broken till jan.08. Long term investors will do well to use this semi-log charts to maximise their gains by increasing their holding period. Smart investors will exit at the channel peak when the sentiment reading is of \"Euphoria\" with highest PE. Arithmetic Chart for lower cycles(Day/Hour) An arithmetic scale displays incremental values (5,10,15,20,25,30) evenly as they move up the y-axis. A Rs10 movement in price will look the same from Rs10 to Rs20 or from Rs100 to Rs110. On the arithmetic scale, three different trend lines were required to keep pace with the advance.\n\nIt takes two or more points to draw a trend line. The more points used to draw the trend line, the more validity attached to the support or resistance level represented by the trend line. The general rule in technical analysis is that it takes two points to draw a trend line and the third point confirms the validity. The magic of trendlines unfold into channels when parallel lines are drawn and these channels give you often the \"targets\" to book out as well as \"fresh entry point\" as illustrated in the chart of \"UNITECH\".\n\nAs the steepness of a trend line increases, the validity of the support or resistance level decreases. The angle of a trend line created from such sharp moves is unlikely to offer a meaningful support or resistance level.\n\nCombining timecycles:\n\nAs illustrated from the chart of \"SAIL\"- Daily & Hourly, a trendline breakdown in the lower time cycle(Hour) may be construed as a mere correction as long as the higher timecycle prices are trending up within the channel. When the price breaks down in the hour which also coincides with the likely breakdown in the daily, a critical reversal point is spotted early on and a trade could be initiated with a high potential profit with limited risk. In EW study, trendlines play a very important role in identifying a wave(as Elliott never defined what is a wave?), the end of corrections, type of corrections, target setting coupled with fibonacci relationships and most important of all is the early warning signal of the end of the 4th wave with a small(false) break down in the trendline, thereby initiating the swift 5th wave trade which then completes the trend.\n\nTrend lines can offer great insight to trading coupled with horizontal support and resistance levels or peak-and-trough analysis. Trendlines are easy to apply and the trader need to be persistent as well as consistent and balanced in his approach. Highly traded stocks has highly tradeable channels. As trendlines follow only the prices, not the often distracting technical oscillators, many traders swear by it and base their trading strategies with only trendlines.\n\nThe simplest of all technical analysis, Trendlines, which effectively captures the demand & supply - the very basic of stock price behaviour, if exploited in a balanced way with tremendous amount of patience & conviction, can bring the riches beyond a trader's/ investor's imagination..Believe in it. Get Rich Slowly.\n\nBob Richards, the former pole-vault champion, shares a moving story about a skinny young boy who loved football with all his heart. Practice after practice, he eagerly gave everything he had. But being half the size of the other boys, he got absolutely nowhere. At all the games, this hopeful athlete sat on the bench and hardly ever played. This teenager lived alone with his father, and the two of them had a very special relationship. Even though the son was always on the bench, his father was always in the stands cheering. He never missed a game.This young man was still the smallest of the class when he entered high school. But his father continued to encourage him but also made it very clear that he did not have to play football if he didn't want to.\n\nBut warmer all four years. His faithful father was always in the stands, always with words of encouragement for him. When the young man went to college, he decided to try out for the football team as a \"walk-on.\" Everyone was sure he could never make the cut, but he did. The coach admitted that he kept him on the roster because he always puts his heart and soul into every practice, and at the same time, provided the other members with the spirit and hustle they badly needed.The news that he had survived the cut thrilled him so much that he rushed to the nearest phone and called his father. His father shared his excitement and was sent season tickets for all the college games.\n\nThursday, December 10, 2009\n\nA narrow trading day with some predictable range. At the end of it all, the indecision remains. \"Declining & lowest Volume\" precedes some decisive move.. \"Day High Ema\"(5145) was the resistance for the day. Though breached in intra day, it could not close above it and in the end closed below even the \"Hour High Ema\"..\n\nAt 12.12PM: Correction from 5152.5 has ended. May attempt 5160 if 5116 Pivot holds. There is +ve div in 5-minute charts. If Nifty can go above 5116(Pivot) and trade above 5120-5125, some upsides to 5135-5145 possible. Staying below 5116, will drag it down.\n\nWednesday, December 9, 2009\n\nNifty has closed below 5-DMA & Day High Ema but above 5-Ema. Correction continues. Critical level to watch out for would be 5090 & 5150. A 100 point trading range of 5062 to 5162 & spending better part above 5110. All the emas have come up and unless Nifty manages to climb higher, the rising averages will press it down. 13DMA/Ema provided support last time @ 5060 and have climbed to 5080. A close above high ema only can bring momentum.Until then it is only trading ranges. Finally the \"Dollar Index\" updated @ 5.10PM showing a 2nd wave correction. As long as it stays above 75.45 & reverses up, bears will rejoice. After the 3rd wave, this index has gyrated in a range for 2 days which should explain the choppy moves.Once this range of 75.40 to 76.40 is resolved, then some direction to equities..!!

Only overnight and morning cues from global markets will be important. From 2.40 pm. to 3.30 pm Future Nifty went up from 5090 to 5160, and there was spikes in volume at 5120, 5130, 5140 and 5150.Keep these things in mind when we trade tomorrow.\" ******************************************************************* As much as possible try to follow the prices or whatever system/ method you have like the one \"Mynac\" has. Once in a while, you might get stopped out of your position. I would watch the Weekly pivot @ 5087 for any support, failing which this correction may continue further down. For Bulls, the last support is 5005(Week ema) & in the very short term 5109(Day ema). Trade light if you are uncomfortable. Markets all over are quite choppy with a narrow band. Let the band break for serious trading..Till then, just play...\n\nTuesday, December 8, 2009\n\nNifty is poised to clear the previous intra high of 5182. However, it has closed at the highest(5148) by closing above the previous highest close of 5142. Holding 5100 only, new highs are possible. Besides Nifty has just entered into the previous resistance zone of 5150-5160. Positive global cues may help it climb higher. How high this upmove will take Nifty to is debatable with many valid targets but it will be the \"Last upmove\" based on EW, weekly \"OB\" as well as Monthly OB. Play along the current trend till warning bells ring in the form of \"Negative divergences\" & Completed wave forms. A redrawn Hourly channel gave a break out above the \"Day's high till 1.30PM(5107). \"Day Low ema\" gave a perfect support. By closing above \"Day High ema\", the momentum is back in Nifty to make new highs.Hour macd is back into +ve territory.\n\nDepending on the Asian Mkts, the intra day bounce may get restricted to 5065 or 5075 or 5080 after a gap down.Gap down may find supports either @ 5035 or 5020. After the intra day bounce, Nifty will seek lower levels to 5015 or 5005.(5 week ema). Any fall below 5005 will take Nifty towards the gap area 4955-4975. If the fall is not arrested @ 5005 or @ 4975, deeper correction will follow.\n\nAt 3.14:(Tech Table updated) A close below Previous day's low(5082) is bearish. ******************************************************* At 2.03PM:(Tech Table updated) Fall continues below 5087. SL for shorts @ 5101NS. ******************************************************* At 1.10PM:(Tech Table updated) Nifty has taken support @ weekly Pivot @ 5087. Fall will accelerate below this. If it moves past 5113NS, it may trigger a short term buy. A move past 5132NS, one may need to close all shorts. Updated at 12.42PM As marked in the \"PreMarket view\" chart, Nifty faced resistance @ 5130-5135(Pink) and has fallen and trading below 5118(Daily Pivot).As long as it trades below 5135(Presumed as 2nd wave of the move down from 5161 of Friday), more downsides towards 5065 or lower is possible.\n\nKeep the weekly pivot-5087 in mind. For the day, the pivot is 5118. Cover the shorts & Long @ 5075-5060 with a S&R @ 5050. Fine tune the levels as per Asian cues @ 10.00AM & the intra TA. ********************************************************* I will not be available continuously during the day due to other commitments.

      "text": "Art Of The Chart: Look For Key Reversals, Shakeouts\n\nWhen poring over stock charts for proper bases, you should look for positives such as upside reversals and shakeouts.\n\nBasically, positive reversals and shakeouts tell you that there's demand for shares. Both are good things to see on charts, and at times, they can be buying opportunities.\n\nAn upside or positive reversal is when a stock sells off and then bounces back, finishing higher on the session. A stock may open lower on disappointing earnings news, lowered guidance or a downgrade, but battle back to close higher on the day. The action is bullish and is even more so if it takes place in robust volume.\n\nUpside reversals show strength in times of adversity. Sometimes they occur at key moving averages such as the 50-day or 200-day lines on a daily chart. They can also take place at prior lows or consolidation levels.\n\nWhile positive reversals are good things to see on the daily chart, investors should also look for them on the weekly time frame. Erasing a good part of a loss and finishing in the upper 60% of the week's range in strong volume are good signs.\n\nFor stocks that stage weekly upside reversals, volume should be in above-average volume or at least up from the previous week. This could be a sign of support from institutions.\n\nShakeouts can come in several ways. A pullback that creates a handle can be a shakeout. The retreat scares out weak holders and sets the stock for the next leg up.\n\nOther times, a shakeout involves a more prolonged downturn and subsequent bounce that takes place over several days or weeks.\n\nA shakeout can also take place when a stock takes out a prior low and then rebounds. It doesn't have to close higher, but well off the time frame's worst levels. For example, the second low in a double-bottom base is a shakeout.\n\nSunPower (SPWR) cleared a deep cup-with-handle base at 40.10 back in January 2007. The correction was 47%, which is unusually deep.\n\nThe stock staged a huge upside reversal in the week ended July 21, 2006, in big volume. (1) showing solid demand. Turnover that week dwarfed that of the prior week. The stock also staged a solid reversal in mid-June, finishing in the upper half of the week's range. (2)\n\nThe reversal week marked the 23.75 low in the base. After breaking out, SunPower rallied 310% by November the same year.\n\nSee AlsoCompanies in the leading IBD group shares fell hard on possible tariffs on Chinese solar manufacturers as high as 60% in Europe.

      "text": "Investment Education\n\nUnderstanding Time Premium\n\nWhat is an option and what gives it value? This week, we take a look at why options are insurance against financial uncertainty and why this insurance is often very reasonably priced.\n\nQuick Basics\n\nWhen you buy a call, you pay a premium for the right, but not the obligation, to buy a particular stock at a particular price, known as the strike price. When you buy a put, you pay a premium for the right, but not the obligation, to sell the stock at the strike price.\n\nIn Figure 1 below, we show an example of some call and put option premiums on Reuters. In our example, the stock price is $45 per share and the three strike prices are $40, $45 and $50. Looking at the calls, notice that the $40 strike has a total premium of $5.75. It has $5.00 worth of tangible or exercise value, since if you exercise it, you would be able to buy the stock at $40 and immediately sell it at $45. This call is said to be in-the-money. This option also has $0.75 worth of time premium. (This is the part of the option premium that is not tangible value.)\n\nThe $45 strike call has a total premium of $2.25. It is said to be at-the-money. It is has no tangible value, but with the stock equal to the strike price, it has a time premium of $2.25. In fact, this is the highest time premium of all the strikes. The $50 strike call has no tangible value. It is said to be out-of-the-money, since you would not want to exercise it. It has a lower time premium of $0.65.\n\nLooking at the puts, we see similar patterns. The in-the-money $50 strike put has a total premium of $5.65, of which $5.00 is tangible value (since you can buy the stock at $45 and exercise your right to sell it at $50) and $0.65 is time value. The at-the-money $45 strike put has the highest time premium of $2.25, while the out-of-the-money $40 strike put has no tangible value, and a time premium of $0.75.\n\nOptions as Insurance\n\nWhy do the at-the-money calls and puts have the highest time value, while both in- and out-of-the-money options have lower time values? And, why are the time values of the calls and the puts in this example the same for each strike price?\n\nThe answer has to do with the type of insurance that options offer. It is easy to understand that options come with insurance because you only have to exercise them if it is to your advantage to do so. But to fully understand the concept of options, you need to ask what are you really insuring against when you buy an option? Is it losing money? Yes, partly, but that is only part of the story.\n\nOptions also offer insurance against \"opportunity loss.\" That is - they can insure you against missing out on profits if they occur. Often, doing nothing can be the worst course of action.\n\nThus, what options really insure you against is uncertainty - against being wrong after the fact. If you buy a call, you do not have to say, \"I wish I had bought that stock, when l could have\" or \"I wish I hadn't bought that stock.\" If you buy a put, you do not have to say, \"If only I had sold (or shorted) that stock,\" or, if you are hedging, \"I wish I had held on to that stock.\"\n\nAre Options Expensive?\n\nMany people claim that options are prohibitively expensive, and sometimes they are. However, often they are fairly priced (or even underpriced) compared to reasonable expectations of how the stock is likely to perform. Therefore, they can offer surprisingly good value as insurance.\n\nLet us use an example of hedging Reuters at $45, by buying the at-the-money put for $2.25. (Again, look at Figure 1.) Let's say that you hold the stock and are worried about where the stock might go. Based on past behavior, you think that a big move is possible. (The stock has traded as high as $50 and as low as $32 over the past 12 months.)\n\nWith the at-the-money put, you are buying the maximum insurance. This is because you are buying insurance, with no deductible, against a big move in either direction.\n\nIt may surprise you to know that if an at-the-money option is fairly priced (i.e. the premium is in line with future volatility), there will be a 69% likelihood that the stock will end up outside the range of this premium paid. In the case of Reuters, it could move more than $2.25 to above $47.25, or down more than $2.25 to below $42.75. Either way, after the fact, you are likely to be glad you bought the option. In the graph on page 3, we show an example of this particular hedged position. The heavy bent line (and the left-hand scale) shows the gains (or losses) of the stock plus the hedge, while the curve with the drop lines (and the right-hand scale) shows the probability distribution. The area above $47.25 represents 35% of the possible outcomes, while the area below $42.75 represents 34%.\n\nIf the stock makes a big move in either direction, you will be happy you bought insurance. If Reuters goes to $60.00, you will have made a $12.75 profit ($15 less than the premium you paid). Alternatively, if the stock falls to $30, the put will offset the loss on the stock, so that all you will lose will be your $2.25 premium.\n\nThe Cheaper \"Deductible\"\n\nBut what if you are bullish on Reuters, but still feel that you need to insure against a really big loss? Or, what if you have turned extremely cautious on the stock, but do not want to miss out if the stock were to rise significantly? In either case, you may be willing to take a \"deductible\" on your time premium insurance.\n\nFor instance, if you are bullish and are willing to forgo some of your insurance on the downside (against cash losses), then you can take the \"deductible\" by buying the out-of-the-money $40 strike put for $0.75. The $5.00 difference between the stock and the strike price represents your deductible. That is how much you are willing to give up before your insurance kicks in. On the upside, your profits will be greater, because you have bought less insurance.\n\nAlternatively, if you are very cautious about holding the stock, but don't want to fully discount the possibility of a large rise, you can take a deductible by hedging with the in-the-money put. By buying the in-the-money $50 put for $5.65, you have effectively taken a $5.00 deductible on possible gains. Remember that your time premium is only $0.65. At expiration, for all outcomes below $50, gains and losses in the stock and the option offset each other, so that all you will lose is the $0.65 time premium. If the stock goes from $45 to $60, you will have made $9.35, ($15 less your $5.65 premium).\n\nFinding Fairly Priced Options\n\nAs we have often noted in these reports, there can be a lot more option buying opportunities than one might think. In our Option Screener, you can screen for underpriced options under Additional Option Information. Simply select as one of your criteria, Buyer's Under/Over Priced and specify a maximum of 0%. As of June 20, 2005, approximately 59% of all call and put asking prices were underpriced according to the Value Line option model's forecasts of future volatility."

      "text": "Your stock trading rules are your money. When you follow your rules you make money. However if you break your own stock trading rules the most likely outcome is that you will lose money.\n\nOnce you have a reliable set of stock trading rules it is important to keep them in mind. Here is one discipline that can reap rewards. Read these rules before your day starts and also read the rules when your day ends. Rule 1: I must follow my rules\nNaturally if you develop a set of rules they are to be followed. It is human nature to want to vary or break rules and it takes discipline to continue to act in accordance with the established rules.\n\nRule 2: I will never risk more than 3% of my total portfolio on any one stock trade\nThere are many old traders. There are many bold traders. But there are never any old bold traders. Protecting your capital base is fundamental to successful stock market trading over time.\n\nRule 3: I will cut my losses at 5% to 15% when I am wrong without question\nSome traders have an even lower tolerance for loss. The key point here is to have set points (stop loss) within the limits of your tolerance for loss. Stay informed about the performance of you stock and stick to your stop loss point.\n\nRule 4: Never set price targets\nThis is a style that will allow me to get the most out of rising stocks. Simply let the profits run. Realistically, I can never pick tops. Never feel a stock has risen too high too quickly. Be willing to give back a good percentage of profits in the hope of much bigger profits.\n\nThe big money is made from trading the really BIG moves that I can occasionally catch.\n\nRule 5: Master one style\nKeep learning and getting better at this one method of trading. Never jump from one trading style to another. Master one style rather than become average at implementing several styles.\n\nRule 6: Let price and volume be my guides\nNever listen to any opinion about the stock market or individual stocks you are considering trading or are already trading. Everything is reflected in the price and volume.\n\nRule 7: Take all valid signals that show up\nDon't make excuses. If an entry signal shows up you have no excuse not to take it.\n\nRule 8: Never trade from intra-day data\nThere is always stock price variation within the course of any trading day. Relying on this data for momentum trading can lead to some wrong decisions.\n\nRule 9: Take time out\nSuccessful stock trading isn't solely about trading. It's also about emotional strength and physical fitness. Reduce the stress every day by taking time off the computer and working on other areas. A stressful trader will not make it in the long term.\n\nRule 10: Be an above average trader\nIn order to succeed in the stock market you don't need to do anything exceptional. You simply need to not do what the average trader does. The average trader is inconsistent and undisciplined. Ask yourself every day, \"Did I follow my method today?\" If your answer is no then you are in trouble and it's time to recommit yourself to your stock trading rules.\n\nStock picking is a very complicated process and investors have different approaches. However, it is wise to follow general steps to minimize the risk of the investments. This article will outline these basic steps for picking high performance stocks. Step 1. Decide on the time frame and the general strategy of the investment.

      "text": "Options Trading & Analysis\n\nBasic Options Strategies: Long Put\n\nBasic Options Strategies: Long Put A long put can be an ideal tool for an investor who wishes to participate profitably from a downward price move in the underlying stock. Before moving into more complex bearish strategies, an investor should thoroughly understand the fundamentals about buying and holding put options.\n\nMarket Opinion? Bearish\n\nWhen to Use? Purchasing puts without owning shares of the underlying stock is a purely directional strategy used for bearish speculation. The primary motivation of this investor is to realize financial reward from a decrease in price of the underlying security.\n\nThis investor is generally more interested in the dollar amount of his initial investment and the leveraged financial reward that long puts can offer than in the number of contracts purchased.\n\nExperience and precision are key in selecting the right option (expiration and/or strike price) for the most profitable result. In general, the more out-of-the-money the put purchased is the more bearish the strategy, as bigger decreases in the underlying stock price are required for the option to reach the break-even point.\n\nBenefit A long put offers a leveraged alternative to a bearish, or \"short sale\" of the underlying stock, and offers less potential risk to the investor. As with a long call, an investor who purchased and is holding a long put has predetermined, limited financial risk versus the unlimited upside risk from a short stock sale.\n\nPurchasing a put generally requires lower up-front capital commitment than the margin required to establish a short stock position. Regardless of market conditions, a long put will never require a margin call. As the contract becomes more profitable, increasing leverage can result in large percentage profits.\n\nThe maximum profit amount can be limited by the stock's potential decrease to no less than zero. At expiration an in-the-money put will generally be worth its intrinsic value. Though the potential loss is predetermined and limited in dollar amount, it can be as much as 100% of the premium initially paid for the put. Whatever your motivation for purchasing the put, weigh the potential reward against the potential loss of the entire premium paid.\n\nBreak-Even-Point (BEP)? BEP: Strike Price - Premium Paid\n\nBefore expiration, however, if the contract's market price has sufficient time value remaining, the BEP can occur at a higher stock price.\n\nAny effect of volatility on the option's total premium is on the time value portion.\n\nTime Decay? Passage of Time: Before Expiration? At any given time before expiration, a put option holder can sell the put in the listed options marketplace to close out the position. This can be done to either realize a profitable gain in the option's premium, or to cut a loss.\n\nAlternatives at Expiration? At expiration most investors holding an in-the-money put will elect to sell the option in the marketplace if it has value, before the end of trading on the option's last trading day.\n\nAn alternative is to purchase an equivalent number of shares in the marketplace, exercise the long put and then sell them to a put writer at the option's strike price. The third choice, one resulting in considerable risk, is to exercise the put, sell the underlying shares and establish a short stock position in an appropriate type of brokerage account"

      "text": "The Basics of Shorting Stock\n\nAn explanation of the speculative practice of shorting stock\n\nArbitragers, speculators and many individual investors engage in a practice known as shorting stock. These \"shorts\" make money when the price of the stock they are shorting goes down.\n\nThe Basics of Shorting Stock\n\nI own 10 shares of company ABC at $50 per share. You believe the stock price of ABC is grossly overvalued and is going to crash sometime soon. You are so convinced that the stock will crash, you come to me, and ask to borrow my ten shares of ABC and sell them at the current market price for $50. I agree to lend you my shares as long as you pay me back ten shares of ABC at some point in the future. You take the ten borrowed shares, sell them for $500 and pocket the money (10 shares x $50 per share = $500).\n\nThe following week, the price of ABC stock falls to $20 per share. You call your broker and tell him to buy 10 shares of ABC stock, at the new price of $20 per share. You pay him the $200 (10 shares x $20 per share = $200). A few days later, you pick up the shares of ABC and bring them by my office. \"Here are the ten shares I borrowed,\" you say as you put them on my desk.\n\nDo you see what happened? You borrowed my shares of ABC, sold them for $500. The following week, when ABC fell to $20 per share, you repurchased those ten shares for $200 and gave them back to me. In the mean time, you pocketed the difference of $300.\n\nThe Speculative Nature of Shorting Stock\n\nWhat if the price of ABC stock had risen? The person shorting stock would have had to buy back the shares at the new, higher price, and absorb the loss personally. Unlike regular investing where your losses are limited to the amount of capital you invest (e.g., if you invest $100, you cannot lose more than the $100), shorting stock has no limit to the amount you might ultimately lose. Famed investor Ben Graham told us there is nothing stopping an overpriced stock from becoming more overpriced. In the unlikely event the stock had shot up to $1,000 (which actually happened to shares of Northern Pacific during a short squeeze in 1902), you would have had to purchase ten shares at $1,000 a share for $10,000. Taking into account the $500 you received from selling the shares earlier, you would have lost $9,500 on a $500 investment.\n\nSome investors practice shorting stock as a hedge to protect their portfolio. In most cases, this is not required nor recommended for individual or institutional investors. If you have selected a company you believe has excellent prospects for the next decade, you should view a declining market as an opportunity to purchase more of a good thing, not something to be dreaded.\n\nShorting Stock in Your Personal Portfolio\n\nIn order to begin shorting stock, you must open a margin account with your brokerage firm. You will be charged interest on the borrowed funds as well as subject to several rules and regulations that govern shorting stock (for example, you cannot short a penny stock, and before you can begin shorting a stock, the last trade must be an uptick or zero-plus tick.) After taking these factors into consideration, you will, hopefully, realize shorting stock is not a financially fattening activity in most cases.\n\nMore Information About Trading Stocks\n\nTo learn more, read our guide to trading stocks. It will explain some of the basics of stock trading, pitfalls, and much more."

Most modern stock exchanges, like NYSE Euronext, have both a trading floor and an electronic trading system.\n\nIncreasingly, exchange owners and operators are getting themselves listed on their own exchanges and have become private companies just like any other company. This is the case with companies like NYSE Euronext, Deutsche Boerse AG and the NASDAQ OMX Group. These companies have evolved into international groups operating on different continents and gathering multiple activities like traditional stock markets, derivatives markets and commodities markets.\n\nStock exchanges have a vital function in modern economies as places where investors and companies can meet and exchange capitals. They offer standardized instruments which are traded with transparency contrary to what happens in OTC transactions. They display prices and volumes for every products they trade.\n\nIn the 80's and 90's with the development of computer technologies, stock exchanges have been dematerialized and most of the transactions now happen electronically though some exchanges have kept floor trading activities like the NYSE. Euronext has adopted a fully electronic system.\n\nTraditional stock exchanges have met increasing competition from fully electronic platforms. Electronic trading has reduced the cost of entry into the market and several new exchanges have recently developed.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first stock exchanges date back to the Middle Age in Europe with debt trading between merchants. However the first stock trading can be found in the 17th century with the creation of various companies to explore European colonies such as the Dutch East India Company. Historically stocks and bonds were traded in a physical place or building with traders gathering on the floor and exchanging financial titles by hand.\n\n14c Stocks were instruments of punishment.

It takes a lot of gumption, resolve and nerve to try to trade your own money for something as volatile as the foreign exchange market. Some have found success in finding a financial advisor to manage their funds; others have gone to the do-it-yourself route by installing a Currency Trading Program in their own computers and learning about the whole exercise from the ground up. Both ways carry a lot of risks. The first one involves a lot of trust on a virtual stranger to handle your money. The second involves a lot of self-studying and self-discovery.

You have to understand that the market is very volatile, which can drive prices up and down over a very short window period. High volatility occurs when the currency prices fluctuate in a very short time while lower volatility involves a lot more lead time. The volatility can be an absolute number, usually $0.3000, or a portion of the initial amount. Looking at it from another angle, volatility refers to how much you are willing to risk regardless if you are hiring somebody to trade for you or purchasing Financial Trading Platforms.\n\nBots"

The actual orders used would be \"buy to open\" or \"sell to open\". Once you are long or short an option there are a number of things you can do to close the position: 1) Close it with an offsetting trade 2) Let it expire worthless on expiration day or, 3) If you are long an option you can exercise it. If you are short an option you may experience the other side of exercise—being assigned. Let's look at each of these choices in detail.\n\nBefore we begin it is important to note that most stock options traded on all the US exchanges are American-style options. They differ from European-style options in that they can be exercised at any time up until expiration. By contrast, European-style options can be exercised only on the day they expire (although they can still be bought and sold at any time prior to that).\n\nOffsetting the Option\n\nOffsetting is the primary way that most traders close a position. Offsetting is simply a method of reversing your original transaction to exit the trade. You can always sell an option that you previously bought, or buy an option that you previously sold, at any time before the end of the last trading day. The last trading day is usually the first business day prior to the option's expiration date (the third Friday of the month for stock options).\n\nIf you own (bought) a call, you have to \"sell to close\" exactly the same call (with the same strike price and expiration) to close your position. If you are short (sold) a call, you have to \"buy to close\" that same exact call to close your position. If you own a put, you have to \"sell to close\" exactly the same put. And if you sold a put, you have to \"buy to close\" the put with the same strike price and expiration.\n\nIf you do not offset your position, then you have not officially exited the trade. If you are a long a call and you sell another call (with a different strike price or expiration month) you may have reduced your risk, but you have not closed your position. Instead, you would now have two positions (although you may think of it as a single combinational position). Doing an offsetting transaction is usually the best way to close out a position if there is still time remaining before expiration.\n\npage 2\n\nExercising the Option\n\nYou can only exercise an option if you are long (own) the option. If it is before the expiration date, you are almost always better off closing it with an offsetting transaction rather than exercising it. When you exercise an option, you give up any extrinsic value it may have. Only the intrinsic value will be realized – any time value remaining is lost.\n\nWhen you exercise an option you are actually buying or selling the underlying asset. Exercising an option would be appropriate in a situation where there is little or no time value and you want to buy the underlying (in the case of a call) or sell the underlying (in the case of a put). By exercising an option you have purchased, you are choosing to take delivery of (call) or to sell (put) the underlying asset at the option's strike price.\n\nIn certain instances, an option may be auto-exercised by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC). Stock and ETF options with an intrinsic value greater than $0.25 at expiration are subject to auto-exercise, but it is always best to actively manage your option position rather than allowing auto-exercise to occur.\n\nGetting Assigned\n\nYou can get assigned only if you are short the option. You will receive a notice of assignment only if a person that owns the same option exercises it. You have no control over this – it is a decision that has to be made by the other party in the options contract (or when it is auto-exercised on expiration day).\n\nIf your short option is in-the-money on expiration day, you are pretty much guaranteed to be assigned. If someone that owns the same option you are short chooses to exercise it early (before expiration day), the OCC (semi-) randomly assigns the exercise to someone that is short the same option. And it is always possible that will be you. However, as mentioned in the previous section, it rarely makes sense to exercise early. So it is unlikely you will be assigned prior to expiration day.\n\npage 3\n\nOnce you are assigned you must fulfill your obligation under the option contract. In the case of a call option you would have to sell the underlying asset at the strike price to the call holder. In the case of a put option you would have to buy the underlying asset at the strike price from the put holder. How do you meet your obligation in the assignment? It depends on if the option was covered or naked.\n\nIf you sold a naked option, you would have to go out into the open market and do the proper trade in the underlying (i.e. buy the stock if you are obligated to sell it. If you already have the correct position in the underlying, you have to do nothing. Your position in both the option and the underlying will be closed out.\n\nIf you covered the sold option using another (long) option of the same type and in the same underlying asset (but with a different strike and/or expiration month) you can always exercise it to meet your obligation. However, if the long option is in a farther-out expiration month and has time value left, you are better off closing it with an offsetting transaction and doing a separate transaction in the underlying to meet your obligation.\n\nLetting the Option Expire\n\nThe final way you can close an option position is to let it expire worthless. If an option has no value at expiration, and it has not been offset or exercised, the option expires worthless and no further action is required. An option will expire worthless only on expiration day, and only if the option is at- or out-of-the-money (OTM) – that is, the strike price is higher than the underlying price for a call or lower than the underlying price for a put.\n\nLetting your option expire worthless is really the only viable decision when it has no value, which will be the case for virtually all out-of-the-money options at the close of the last day of trading. If you are long an OTM option you will notice that there is usually no Bid price being quoted, since no one wants to buy a worthless option. If you are long (own) an option that expires worthless, you lose all the money you invested in the option.\n\npage 4\n\nOf course this outcome is exactly what option sellers are hoping for. If you are short (sold) an option, then you want it to expire worthless because then you get to keep the credit you received from the option premium. You can almost always offset a short option up to the very end of trading – there is almost always an Asked price quoted because lots of people would like to sell you a worthless option.\n\nConclusion\n\nBefore entering any option position, you should understand all the possible ways to close the position. When you are the owner of an option you can close it by doing an offsetting (sell to close) transaction, exercise it, or let it expire worthless. Option sellers can only choose to do an offsetting transaction (buy to close) or let it expire worthless, and there is always the possibility that they may get assigned.\n\nImportant Note: Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors.

The spreadsheet also generates the pricing lattice, which can be viewed.\n\nAmerican options allow the holder to exercise an option contract at any time before the expiry. European options, on the hand, can only be exercised at the expiry date. This means that for any given situation, American options demand a higher price than European options because of their greater flexibility.\n\nUnlike European puts, American puts cannot be valued analytically. Therefore numerical techniques (such as monte-carlo simulation, the method of lines, the Bjerksun-Stensland model, or binomial trees) must be used . This article, for example, describes a novel Monte-Carlo method to price American Options\n\nBinomial trees divide time (from the current time to maturity) into a large number of slices. At each stage, stock price can either increase (with probability p) or decrease (with probability 1-p) in value. Call and puts are then priced by moving backwards in time (this is known as backwards induction).\n\nThis method gives the price of an option at multiple points in time (and not just at the expiry date, as with the standard Black-Scholes model). Binomial trees are hence particularly useful for American options, which can be exercised at any time before the expiry date.\n\nAdditionally, binomial trees can help analysts decide when best to exercise an American option because the change in option price is given over time.\n\nPrice an American Option with a Binomial Tree\n\nThe Excel spreadsheet is simple to use. Simply enter your parameters and then click the Draw Lattice button. The price of the option is given in the Results box.\n\nAdditionally, some clever VBA will draw the binomial lattice in the Lattice sheet.\n\nThe theory behind Binomial trees, and their implementation in Excel, are described in greater detail in this tutorial. The spreadsheet uses the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein method.\n\nIf you would like access to the VBA used to generate the binomial lattice, please use the Buy Unlocked Spreadsheet option.\n\n6 Responses to \"Binomial Tree for Pricing American Options\"\n\nHi,\nI would like to know if it would be possible to have the VBA code for the binomial tree for pricing the american options and the one forthe Excel spreadsheet for pricing American options with the Barone-Adesi & Whaley, and Ju & Zhong approximations."

      "text": "Spam Emails About Individual Stocks: What's The Scam?\n\nA reader wrote to me recently asking about the proliferation of spam emails concerning individual stocks:\n\nI often get two or three spam emails a day touting a specific stock. I'm smart enough to realize that this is some kind of scam, but how exactly does it work?\n\nThis type of scam is called a pump and dump, and you're far better off ignoring such emails completely than looking at them at all.\n\nThey all generally follow the same form: they identify a company and a stock you've likely never heard of and give some astounding reason as to why this stock is going to go crazy in the next day or two, usually some sort of \"news\" that came out after the market closed yesterday.\n\nHere's exactly how the scam works:\n\n1. Overnight, a con man sends out the spam emails identifying this \"hot\" company. The email usually encourages people to track the stock.\n\n2. The next day, right at the start of trading, the scammer buys a fair amount of the stock, causing it to make an initial jump in price.\n\n3. The scammer then often posts on message boards or on blogs about how this stock is hot, pointing to the huge upward trend to start the day.\n\n4. The scammer usually continues to buy in bits and pieces throughout the day, keeping the demand up and lifting the price even higher, but this isn't always necessary.\n\n5. At some point during the day, though, the scammer executes a sell-limit order, meaning that his brokerage is to sell all of his stock if it reaches a certain level. For example, the stock might start the day at 1, the scammer is able to buy enough so that the price goes up to 6, and he executes a sell-limit order at 10, meaning that the instant the stock hits 10, all of his shares go up for sale.\n\n6. Often, after a half day of doubling or tripling in price, some of the scammed people decide to buy in, driving the stock even higher.\n\n7. When the scammer's sell-limit price is surpassed, all of his shares go up for sale at the elevated price. Anyone who has fallen for the scam will then buy these inflated stocks.\n\n8. The scammer gets out of the stock entirely, selling all of them at an inflated price and making a big profit. The people who believed in the scam are now holding onto vastly overvalued stocks, which will rapidly plummet in price down to their low level.\n\nIf you buy this stock, you're going to be the person left holding the overinflated stock that's rapidly losing value. In other words, you were just talked into buying a $1 stock for $10 or more – and very quickly, that stock will go back to $1.\n\nHow can you fight this? First of all, ignore all emails promising a hot stock tip. If it's an unsolicited tip from someone you don't know, someone's out there scamming a buck – and you're the one who's going to get scammed if you pay attention. Second, if you must follow up on a stock tip, do some research. Find out if the company actually files reports with the SEC – if they don't, that's a sure sign of a giant scam. If they do file reports, very, very carefully investigate the \"big news\" – and only accept the news if it comes from reputable sources (AP, Wall Street Journal, and Reuters, basically). Better yet, don't waste the time and just delete that email entirely – it's not worth the risk"

For example, if you are long a currency pair position and believe the price will rise to a certain level, but are unsure what it will do beyond that level, placing a take-profit order at that point will automatically close out your position allowing you to lock in profit. Example: Buy $100 worth of yen at 107.4 yen per dollar = 100*107.40 = 10,740 yen Place a take-profit order at 108.80.

If an account has $1000 usable margin available and the trader has a 1% margin requirement and wishes to place a trade for 30K, the amount that is deposited into the used margin field after placing the trade can be figured by multiplying the trade size by the margin requirement ($30,000 x 1% = $300). This leaves the trader with $700 of gross usable margin ($1000 - $300 = $700). The next step is to subtract the spread from the gross usable margin to get the net usable margin. The EUR/USD is worth $1 per pip for every 10K contract. So a 30K contract would equal $3 per pip. If there is a 3pip spread then a 30K contract would cost $9 ($3 x 3pip spread = $9). Now take the original $700 gross usable margin and subtract the spread and there is $691 net usable margin ($700 - $9 = $691). Now to figure how many pips the market can move against the position to bring the net usable marigin to zero, take the net usable margin and divide it by the cost per pip ($691 / $3 = 230pips)My question deals with margin in the Forex market, and is as follows:\nHow is margin requirement calculated for Forex?\nCan you have a fixed dollar amount for the margin for one contract (like the futures market)?\n\nHiero,\n\nWhile the first answer above spoke mainly about available margin, let me address the issue of margin requirement more directly.\n\nMargin required is a straight-forward deal between a forex market maker and you the trader.\n\nYou are going to trade with currency lots of higher value than your capital, or margin. The market maker (or FX broker) wants a security deposit for this fact. They incur risks if they offset your transaction with a clearing house (other market maker). This market maker wants security from them.\n\nThe transaction between you and your broker is put forward by the broker to you. They simply say: \"You, the trader, have to put down a small percentage of the value of the transaction you do.\"\n\nIn retail forex the norm is 1%, but you also get 0.5%, 0.25% and others such as 2% - 5%.\n\nLike the previous answer explained you must calculate the margin required as a percentage of the lot / transaction value. (Not all brokers have fixed lot sizes. With some you can trade any transaction size from $1.00 up.\n\nYour margin will always be the agreed percentage of the value of the transaction that you make.\n\nIf your margin account is denominated in USD your margin per transaction is calculated in USD. If you trade eurusd the value of the transaction in USD is the amount of euro X value of eurusd. This is somewhat confusing if you never looked at this before.\n\nToo many traders approach \"money management\" from the point of view of margin required and not the full notional transactional value. This is a serious mistake (in my eyes). Let me explain to you why:\n\nIf you have 2 margin accounts at different brokers, the one has 1% margin requirement and the other 0.5%. Let's say you have $5,000. You trade fixed 10K lots.\n\nMany traders say as part of \"money management\" that they will risk only say, 10% of their capital at any given time. What they mean is that they will do transactions to the value of 10% of their margin based on the margin requirement.\n\nThe problem with this approach is that margin required has absolutely ZERO to do with risk. Here is why:\n\nSame trader, same size account, same money management technique, two brokers, different margin requirement:\n\nSay broker A's requirement is 1%, Broker B = 0.5%.\n\nTrader decides to do a maximum trade (for him, following his MM) (10% of margin) at both brokers.\n\nLet's say the trade was not such a good idea. the eurusd moves 50 points in the wrong direction. With broker A he loses $250, with broker B, $500.\n\nSo, if he knows this and decides to address the matter by putting a \"money management\" stop on the higher leveraged transaction (Broker B) to exit the transaction at 25 pip loss, then he really starts cascading down the slippery slope of trading like a person bound on losing his money.\n\nThe solution is that you must calculate your risk not by using your margin required percentage but by looking at your leverage or gearing ratio:\n\nI.e. Broker A = EUR50,000 (5 10K lots)/ $5,000 (total capital) = gearing of 10:1. I.e. you take your capital, wish wish it is EUR50,000 (for which you give the broker some measily security of 1%) and off you go. Risking not 10% of what you have but risking wat you have 10 times.\n\nBroker B = EUR100,000 (5 10K lots)/ $5,000 (total capital) = gearing of 20:1. I.e. you take your capital, wish wish it is EUR100,000 (for which you give the broker some measily security of 0.5%) and off you go. Risking not 10% of what you have but risking wat you have 20 times.\n\nBecause margin required is a variable it can not be used to judge the risk where the other properties of the transaction are all fixed (non-variable): Margin = $5000, lot size = EUR10,000 and pip value = $1.00/ per 10K.\n\nThat is why you should look at the transaction from the notional value angle and not the variable margin requirement angle like most do.\n\nI always say, you must know there must be reasons why the large majority lose and struggle. They basically do the same things. The above is one of them. If you want to change your fortunes in currency trading start doing things differently than the losers.\n\n(The forex market does not revolve around your subjective ideas of MM, reading of indicators / charts, entry exit parameters and money / risk management. You are with all of these properties as part of your trading but a cork in the forex ocean.\n\nFeatured Forex Brokers\n\nRisk Management Calculator\n\nLeverage\n\nLeverage is the ability to gear your account into a position greater than your total account margin. For instance, if a trader has $1,000 of margin in his account and he opens a $100,000 position, he leverages his account by 100 times, or 100:1. If he opens a $200,000 position with $1,000 of margin in his account, his leverage is 200 times, or 200:1. Increasing your leverage magnifies both gains and losses.<p>To calculate the leverage used, divide the total value of your open positions by the total margin balance in your account. For example, if you have $10,000 of margin in your account and you open one standard lot of USD/JPY (100,000 units of the base currency) for $100,000, your leverage ratio is 10:1 ($100,000 / $10,000). If you open one standard lot of EUR/USD for $150,000 (100,000 x EURUSD 1.5000) your leverage ratio is 15:1 ($150,000 / $10,000).\n\nA market maker provides pricing and liquidity for a particular currency pair and stands ready to buy or sell that currency at the quoted price. A market maker takes the opposite side of your trade and has the option of either holding that position or partially or fully offsetting it with other market participants, managing their aggregate exposure to their clients. If a market maker chooses to keep the trader's position without offsetting it in the market, the trader's profit is the market maker's loss and vice versa, leading to a possible conflict of interest between the trader and his market maker. A market maker earns their commission from the spread between the bid and offer price"

Take a look at the example below.\n\nIf the current price is 1.2000 and you place a market order you will enter the trade somewhere around the price of 1.2000. You won't know the exact price, just that you will get in around the current price. If you need a specific price you will need to use another entry order type.\n\nEntry Stop Orders – This is an order that gets you into a trade once the price begins to move a specific direction. A buy stop will buy the position when the price moves up to a specific price and a sell stop order will short the positions when the price moves down to a specific price. Take a look at the example below.\n\nIn this example you would place a buy stop order if you wanted to enter the trade when the price moves up to your specified price. If the current price is 1.2000 and you wanted to enter if the price moved to 1.2500, you would place your buy stop order at 1.2500. If you wanted to short at 1.195, you would place a sell stop at 1.1950. These order types get you into the trade at a specific price but not a specific time.\n\nEntry Limit orders – This type of order is the opposite of the entry stop order in that you would be buying when the price moves down and shorting when the price moves up. The idea would be to wait for a better price than the current market price before getting into the trade. See the example below.\n\nIn this example you can see that if the current price is 1.2000 you would go long when the price drops back down to 1.1950 and you would short if it moved up to 1.2500. Again, you would know the price but not the time for entry.\n\nThese are some of the more commonly used entry order types. You should take some time to review each of these orders so you know how to enter correctly. You may use each of these types of entry orders depending upon the type of methods you are trading. In one you may use market order, in another you may you entry stops or limits. Regardless of what you use you need to make sure you know what types your platform offers. The more you know about how to enter the trades the more choices you will have in your trading.'m up $411 on a $25,000 new Virtual Trading Account in one day!\n\n- Joe W.\n\nBill, I have been teaching at the university since 1965.

As a result potential short sales would have to pass a tick test to make sure that the stock was trading up or flat before the short sale could go through. The restriction was eliminated after the SEC concluded that U.S. markets functioned orderly enough that excessive short sales would not artificially drive down prices.

The other and more common use of the term has to do with the relation of the level of implied volatility of puts relative to the ATM options or OTM calls. Shops use several different methods to measure skew. Many use the 25 delta call relative to the 25 delta put at either 30, 60 or 90 days to expiration. Others measure puts and calls relative to ATM option (my preferred method). The CBOE SKEW Index uses the relation of far out-of-the-money puts (sometimes called tail risk puts, swan puts, or units) relative to more standard OTM puts.\n\nMark Sebastian offers up some pioneering research and analysis of the CBOE SKEW Index and its suitability as a tool for helping to predict the direction of the VIX."

      "text": "SEARCH\n\nCategories\n\nThe 1929 Stock Market Crash – Let's Not Do That Again!\n\nThe Roaring Twenties were a celebratory and prosperous time; after World War I, citizens enjoyed the peaceful time and reveled in new technologies such as the radio and the automobile. People were able to travel far and wide with the increased availability of airplane flights.\nAs the stock market began its upward climb, everyone and their brother wanted to hop on board. The widely-held opinion was that the stock market would always go up; most investors in that day simply didn't understand the volatility and risk involved. It seemed like such a safe bet that people actually began pouring their life savings into the market, mortgaging their homes to buy up \"hot stocks\".\n\nOne factor that seemed an incredible help to investors at the time, but which actually intensified the eventual devastation, was the fact that stock holders could purchase on the margin. To buy on the margin means to borrow stock in order to gain leverage. This strategy worked well when the market was up; for every dollar they purchased, an investor would borrow another nine dollars worth. If the stock went up 1%, they would make 10%. It sounded like a foolproof, lazy way to get rich, and many did! In the period from 1921 to 1929, as the Dow Jones shot up from 60 to 400, ordinary people became millionaires and began the trend of living beyond their means.\n\nThe downside to buying on the margin is that the same principles apply when the market goes down. An investor with a stock that had dropped 1% would actually lose 10% because they owed for the borrowed stock. This made even the smallest losses seem unbearably huge. And as people began to realize just how over-inflated the market was, the inevitable mass sell-off began. Thursday, October 24th, 1929 kicked off the devastating crash as investors panicked and tried to sell off all of their stock.\n\nOn October 28th and 29th, the bubble burst and millionaires were bankrupted in an instant. Average Joe's who had invested everything lost it all in one fell swoop. The Dow Jones hit just 145 by November 1929 and the Great Depression began. Another factor that contributed to the overall devastation felt by all was that the banks had invested heavily in the market and lost their customers money. Even though who had avoided the stock market in favor of safer savings investments were touched.\n\nAfter years of good times and good living, most stock market investors spent the next decade in complete and utter poverty. Although the stock market crash of 1929 is certainly one of the more dramatic and intense examples of what can happen when the financial bubble bursts, it is a warning to investors not to flood the stock market with excitement and emotional purchases. Had the investors of the day studied the companies they were investing in, they would have realized just how ridiculous the market was compared to the actual value of the companies."

But then , I am completely new to this and need to recalculate and recalibrate things to make them achievable and not blow up everything onto my face. )\nBasically , my plan is to go from $500 to $1000 in a total of 2-3 trading weeks(Considering I have a ratio of 75:25, good days to bad days, improbable but achievable.)\n\nPanning the whole thing out, I intend to not withdraw even a single penny for atleast 3 months(approx 13 trading weeks). The colloary of this is quite clear if you follow the calculation part.\n\nAlso, I will call it quits if I lose more than half of my trades, meaning if 3 trades go against me in a single day, dont trade.(Need to calibrate.). Following the plan, lose less-win more.\n\nSo, in a short, my plan is:\n1. Risk no more than 2% of my account.\n2. Quit for the day if already made 10% of my account.\n3. Quit for the day if you lose more than half of your trades.\n\nIs this achievable? I dont know, maybe some experienced guys can help me out here. Give some feedback.\n\nOriginally Posted by ThePhoenix\n\nIf you trade with your full leverage you will be overleveraging your account. You will probably lose your account as it is a huge mistake. If you leverage your whole account, even if you have a 10 pip sL and 10 pip TP, you will lose a large chunk of your account if you use all your available leverage.\n\nIf you lose 10 pips, then fully leverage your postion again each time you will exponentally lose your account. It will happen very quickly.\n\nI would try to work out a better system. Something to the effect of not riskying more that 1-10% per trade, over that 10 pip sl or TP. Compound your account slowly larger. If you consistently make 10 pips as your account grows, that 10 pip gain can equal more and more and still only risk x%.\n\nFor a more precise example. Lets say you only wanted to risk 1% on your account and had a -10 SL.\n\nNow lets say you win your ten pips. Your account has now gone up by 1%. Now you compound and figure eveything off of $505. Keep compounding up, and when you lose compound down at your desrection.\n\nPlease don't leverage your whole account. Sure you could get lucky and hit a few big trades, but eventually you are going to blow out. And since your account didn't last very long you won't have gained very much valuable experience that you need from your first account.Cheers.\n\nYes, that's exactly what I did at IBFX. You have to specify micro account or it will default to a regular account. You can specify the balance tooOthers might disagree with me, but I do not believe IBFX stop hunts. Other traders DO hunt stop, intentionally or otherwise. It's just that stops tend to gather around the same areas of support and resistance and retraces, as that is where everyone logically puts them. If anyone stop hunts it is the banks you are trading against. They have enough power to put pressure on price and make it move a bit to a support and resistance area they know stops are clustered around. They'll hit it, then since all the orders have been triggered, and they have their commisions, their is no reason for price to keep going that way. So, price continued where you orginally though it might. This is where traders get mad and think their broker is purposely moving price because they know where their stop is. It's not the broker (unless you are using one that is a scam), it's the 300 pound gorillas, the banks. It makes it look like price took a special little trip just to find your stop loss.\n\nIf you are getting stopped out a lot, it's likely you are jumping in a move as it happens and trying to chase price. By then it's too late, especially on the shorter time frames, the move is already on and will probably retrace by some amount.\n\nWhat you want to do is go long or short when price is moving short or long. In other words if you want to go long, you wait until price is retracing short, ALREADY under your entry and stop loss. That way if it is a retrace it will go up your long will trigger and you will catch a good portion of the move. If it isn't a retrace and the price continues short your trade won't even trigger unless you've set it too short or their is a large spike for some reason.\n\nSure you can get some wins trying to chase price and get in move as you see it, but more often than not it will end up hurting you.\n\nI can tell you from experience though, if you dont' use a SL thinking someone is stop hunting and it will eventually go in your direction, you will lose a lot more when you are wrong.\n\nI've asked IBFX on several occastions if anyone their trades on IBFX's behalf. I was told they are a Straight through processor and get their liquidity from a pool of banks. I asked them the other day, \"so if you don't trade against your traders, then why do your spreads widen around news?\" I was told. \"Because the price and spreads are basically fed to them from the banks they deal with.\"\n\ntwo things to respond to here --- firsttwo things to respond to here --- firstmy experiences only but i have a LOT of experience !\n\nmp\n\nHow long and what size account did you trade with IBFX?

If a stock closes at $10.00 and opens the next day at $10.05, we say the gap was 0.05, or we say the stock gapped up 0.05. If a stock closes at $10.00, and opens the next day at 9.90, we say the gap was -0.10, or the stock gapped down 0.10.

I would need to be able to get the approximate list of common stocks as is available in Telechart... I can not get this data at eoddata, for example...\n\nI would like to calculate market breadth indicators and would like to find out how many of common stocks traded were up or down 4% (breakouts/breakdowns) (Cl-Lag(Cl) > 0.04 (4% breakout), Cl-Lag(Cl) < -0.04 (4% breakdown)), how many of common stocks traded are down/up 25% in quarter etc.\n\nMy first problem is how to get a list of symbols with only common stocks (no ETFs).\n\n4 Answers\n\nBloomberg Open Symbology has this list. Look in the Common Stock precanned file. This will have a bit more data than you probably need as it has a separate entry and unique id for each place an equity is traded. However it is probably the highest quality list available for free anywhere.\n\nAs for filtering ETFs are broken out in a separate file (Equity_ETP) so you simply need to filter by exchange.\n\nThe stockSymbols function in the R package TTR pulls the data from nasdaq.com that @bellamyj mentioned. It also attempts to convert the symbols to a format acceptable to Yahoo Finance.\n\nThat said, I'm not certain how to filter this list for only common stocks. There are 1275 securities with \"n/a\" Sector or Industry, leaving ~5000. Perhaps the remaining categories in Sectors and Industries can help you further refine the list. to whether they are an ETF.\n\nGiven this list, which you can pull each night, you can then query Yahoo to obtain the necessary data to calculate your statistics."

      "text": "Options Trading Advice For Beginners\n\n(Photo credit: David Paul Ohmer)\n\nMany people want to make money in options trading. The unfortunate issue that arises is that most people become thoroughly confused by options. To understand options, one should understand a few things about stocks. When people buy a stock, they buy it for the short or long term, whether it is an investment or speculation. Options are not as risky as people sometimes believe. It can be a solid investment that can pay off in the long run. Not only that, but very little money needs to be invested in order to make a lot. For more information on this, check out this post on How To Succeed At Options Trading.\n\nWhen buying options, one can buy puts or calls. Puts are bought by investors who believe the stock will fall, while calls are bought by investors who believe the stock will rise. This can be bought as speculation, or as a longer term investment. This is because the options can expire months after the investor buys them. Furthermore, options can be used to hedge positions in a stock. For example, if an investor has a large position in one company, an investor can buy puts to protect their investment. Read more about"

      "text": "The chart patterns we have already looked at focused on one or two candlesticks at a time. In addition to these candlestick patterns there are also a number of different larger chart patterns which are formed by many candlesticks. Just like the candlestick patterns they are used to gauge the mood and psychology of the market.\n\nHead and shoulders pattern\n\nOne of the most commonly used chart patterns is the Head and shoulders pattern. It indicates that the buying pressure (in the case of an uptrend) is being exhausted. This is a reversal pattern which comprises of 3 peaks and 2 lows with the central peak being higher than the other two. The level joining the two lows are referred to as the neckline. Once the pattern is complete and the price breaks through the neckline it is expected to continue downwards.\n\nThe pattern can also appear at the end of a downtrend as an upside down mirrored version of the one drawn above with the head being lower than the two shoulders\n\nIt should be noted that the Head and shoulders pattern is often not perfectly shaped with the neckline often ascending or descending or one shoulders being higher/lower than the other. In order to qualify a pattern as a head and shoulders when this happens, the lowest point of one shoulder should be lower than the peak of the other. Often even once the price breaks the neckline there may be a temporary pullback to the neckline (to test the resistance level created by the broken support level) before the price resumes its course downwards."

      "text": "Stock Market Crash Articles & Newspapers\n\nStock Market Crash 1929 records exist mostly as newspaper and magazine accounts written before, during and after this historic day in October. Stock Market Crash 1929 newspaper editions explain that, leading up to this day, an atmosphere of confidence and economic prosperity was bursting in post-World War I America. Big inventions like the radio and airplanes gave people confidence, and booming business encouraged Americans to take their savings and invest it in the stock market in the 1920s.\n\nStock Market Crash 1929 newspaper accounts leading up to Black Tuesday, or October 29, described the stock market as an infallible investment for the future. In 1925, stock prices started to noticeably rise and gave way to a bull market in 1927. In 1928, the stock market became a place to get rich overnight as the boom continued. People without money to invest started buying on margin, meaning they borrowed 80 to 90 percent of the stock price, betting it would go up in price.\n\nWhen the stock market started to decline in 1929, after many banks had invested client money in stocks without consent, several mini-crashes in early 1929 were followed by a summer boom and then the ultimate crash on October 29, 1929. It also started the Great Depression.\n\nStock Market Crash 1929 Timeline\n\n1925-1926: The stock market started catching on as a great way to make fast money as stock prices began to level out and then rise. More people and businesses started investing in stocks.\n\n1927-1928: The stock market boom began. People borrowed money to invest, and banks invested clients' money without notifying these clients. Businesses also began investing capital in the stock market.\n\nMarch-August 1929: On March 25, there was a mini-crash and subsequent panic until bankers like Charles Mitchell assured customers that money would still be lent. This mini-crash was followed closely by reduced steel production and a slowing down of car sales and new home construction. June through August saw the stock market hit its highest peak.\n\nOctober 1929: Stock prices started dropping in September, and on October 29 (known as Black Tuesday), over 16.4 million shares of stock were sold in a nationwide panic that plummeted share prices.\n\nStock Market Crash 1929 Newspaper Articles\n\nNews-Palladium\n\nThe Stock Market Crash1929 newspaper edition published on September 25, 1929, by the News-Palladium, indicated that stocks were continuing to experience bearish pressure. The stock news reported by this Stock Market Crash 1929 newspaper talked about how the national banking system was failing, citing that within the past six months, over 80 national banks had withdrawn over $3 billion. This Stock Market Crash 1929 newspaper also talked of how national banks were deserting their state charters in favor of merging with trust companies. Examples cited included the merging of the National Bank of Commerce with Guarantee Trust Company, the Hanover National Bank with Central Union Trust Company, and the Chemical National Bank with the U.S. Mortgage & Trust Company.\n\nAlso mentioned in this Stock Market Crash 1929 newspaper edition was the fact that prices of grapes lowered while offerings doubled. That was an important indicator that the stock market had artificially high prices that did not accurately reflect the actual business or product profitability, which came true when the stock market experienced the major crash in October. The rest of the fruit market was also discussed, with prices being down on tomatoes and apples.\n\nOther areas reported as declining in this Stock Market Crash 1929 newspaper edition include the price of steel and commercial solvents going down, as well as railroad stocks. Wall Street reported reasons for these declines that included tight credit, reduced car output, possibly higher London bank rate and the falling of steel production. The market was promised to rally, however.\n\nTyrone Daily Herald\n\nThe Tyrone, Pennsylvania newspaper Tyrone Daily Herald was force to print the headline \"All Records Shattered in Frenzied Stock Market Trading\" when its October 29, 1929 edition hit the stands. The Stock Market Crash 1929 newspaper articles all centered on the horrible yet inevitable crash that helped lead America into the Great Depression.\n\nAs prices were crashing, the Stock Market Crash 1929 newspaper article reported that over eight million stocks had been sold by noon with no sign of slowing down as prices continued to plummet. In fact, the record would be set that day, with more than 16 million shares being sold on what would become known as Black Tuesday. A reported $50 billion was lost in the stock market combined over the past few days. Despite bankers and economists assuring people that the crash was over, it continued to happen.\n\nAlso discussed in this Stock Market Crash 1929 newspaper article was the fact that brokers were having difficulty determining pricing for sales, especially lump sales up to 50,000 shares, and this had deferred many sales by as much as 30 minutes and climbing. The public was reported to have started panicking after many millionaires were wiped out on October 28, especially after poorly managed accounts were called due to poor lending on margin to stock market speculators.\n\nPanic resumed, according to this Stock Market Crash 1929 newspaper article, after the John J. Bell & Company was suspended due to a failure to meet engagements. Despite some trying to rally the market by cutting margins and buying steel and radio stocks at higher prices, these efforts were not enough to sustain a rapidly failing market, and the crash continued.\n\nPut the knowledge you're learning to good use by signing up for a free trial account and begin tracing your family history today."

She could sell a contract today, in November, at the current higher price, and buy it back within the next six months after the price has declined. This strategy is called going short and is used when speculators take advantage of a declining market.\n\nSuppose that, with an initial margin deposit of $3,000, Sara sold one May crude oil contract (one contract is equivalent to 1,000 barrels) at $25 per barrel, for a total value of $25,000.\n\nBy March, the price of oil had reached $20 per barrel and Sara felt it was time to cash in on her profits. As such, she bought back the contract which was valued at $20,000. By going short, Sara made a profit of $5,000! But again, if Sara's research had not been thorough, and she had made a different decision, her strategy could have ended in a big loss.\"\n\nSorry if this seems particularly simple. I am clear on buying various contracts with reference to predicted price rises or falls, but am unsure how i would instigate a sale of a contract of this or any sort without owning something already and if this is even possible for an individual to do?\n\nWhen you \"sell\" (go short), you have not actually sold anything...yet. Likewise, when you \"buy\" (go long), you have not bought anything...yet. What you have done is enter into a contract to sell or buy by the time the contract (March Crude, for example) goes off the board. That margin you put up when entering a contract (position) is not money to purchase. Think of it as a security deposit. When you exit that position, that's when the purchase/sell money changes hands.\n\nNow, shorting:\nIt workskinda like this:\n\n(There's no margin involved here, because we're not going through a broker. This is personal. Just between you and me.)\n\n(You're about to go short one May Gun Cabinet)\nME: Hey, Tom, I'm looking for an oak gun cabinet. You wouldn't happen to have one you would sell me, would you?\n\nYOU: Gun cabinet?! No, I sure don't. Sorry.\n\nME: Darn. I really want one. I'd pay 1,000 $mackeroo$ for one. I really need it by May 11th.\n\nYou've just entered into a contract to sell me a gun cabinet by May 11th. But you really don't have one. You're short a gun cabinet. You're short one May Gun Cabinet at $1,000.00.\n\nBut that light in your head was the idea to go to a yard sale or sumthin' and pick one up for a lot less than a thousand bucks. (Hopefully you will find one for less than a thou, else you lose money on the deal.\n\nWell, you find one for 50, sell it to me for a thousand, you make 950. Except in the futures market, both parts of that deal go down simultaniously. Oh, yeah: and you hafta pay somebody a commission. And in the futures market, you get that margin (deposit) back.\n\nbut am unsure how I would instigate a sale of a contract of this or any sort without owning something already and if this is even possible for an individual to do?\n\nGene is completely correct about this. You see what you appear to be forgetting is the time element. You are selling it for future delivery. As long as you have it when it is due there is no problem, future delivery. Short selling brings with it an obligation to deliver in the future, to sell before you buy.\n\nSimply each transaction has a buy and a sell. When you remove the linear time progression, what difference does it make if you buy before you sell, or sell before you buy. All the elements of a transaction still occur. A buyer and a seller make an agreement for consideration.\n\nAlso remember that most contracts are never held to expiration for delivery. Only hedgers who deal in the underlying assets will actually want to take delivery (baker) or make delivery (farmer) on the contract. The vast majority of futures contracts are offset (closed out) well before expiration.\n\nAs a speculator, you can buy one contract and sell one later and you are flat (out of the market.) Or you can sell one and then buy it back and end up in the exact same place (flat the market.)\n\nSo it does not matter if you buy or sell first, so long as you later offset an equal position with the exact opposite trade to your opening position."

      "text": "Are Trading Algos Proprietary?\n\nElectronic trading had a blank slate when it was first envisioned. Many just figured that they would take their pit trading skills and transfer them to the screen. However, innovation creates more innovation. Engineers automated a lot of those old pit skills and created algorithms to automatically trade. In the pit, we always knew pit location was a big deal. Little did we know that co-location was going to be an even bigger deal in the electronic age.\n\nAs electronic trading has developed, there have been lawsuits filed when engineers have switched firms. They are being sued over the trading codes they developed. Firms are suing former employees. Part of the reason they do this is to try and keep them in line. Once you figure out a good code that works, it's pretty easy to go off on your own, raise some capital and let it rip.\n\nBut is trading code a patentable proprietary thing?\n\nWhen we were in the trading pits, nothing was patentable. If I figured out a better way to leg a spread, or put a trade on, you could follow me. You were free to copy me and try to compete. The Crush spread, the Crack spread, and any other strategy was easily copied once you figured out how to execute it.\n\nIf I backed you as a trader, taught you how to execute the strategy, and then you left and began executing it on your own I had little recourse. I might be able to beat up your reputation a little, but I couldn't stop you from trading with a lawsuit.\n\nIs there a fine line between trading code and any other code that becomes patentable and proprietary? For example, Google($GOOG) has a search engine code. It's defended by patents. There is case law that defends it. Yahoo($YHOO) sued Facebook($FB) earlier this year over patents. I intuitively understand how companies like that think they have some intellectual property that can be defended.\n\nBut I fail to see how a trading algorithm is intellectual property that can be defended in a court of law.

With that said, if you're new to currency trading and are looking for tips on how to get started, this article will give you the very basics; hence the title Currency Trading for Dummies…\" Before we continue, it might pay to know that luck sometimes play a huge role in succeeding with currency trading.\n\nOnce you're the game, you will sometimes notice a time when you make a reasonable amount of money and other times when you almost lose completely. During the winning period it may sometime mean you are having a lucky streak, not because you have suddenly become an expert forex player.\n\nThis means you should play the game smartly and be alert at all times. Unfortunately, most people are unwilling to admit their success is due to luck. They become so convinced they have a system that works only to lose a lot of money trying to refine it later. Anyway, currency trading is a lot like stock trading and all technical and fundamental analysis is approximately the same. Some people think the currency market is more difficult to trade than stock market but that depends on individuals.\n\nHowever, with currency trading, you just have to know that currency pairs (e.g. US Dollar vs. British Pounds) always go up and down and you'll be fine. Currency Trading Brokers: Usually, currency trading requires traders to used currency trading platforms or forex brokers. These brokers don't charge commissions like stock brokers; instead they gain from spreads among the currencies and their pairs. This means you should always look for currency brokerage companies with smallest spread possible to maximise your profit.\n\nSpeaking of forex brokers with the smallest spreads, as a 'Currency Trading for Dummies' reader, one major advice you should always keep in mind is that there are forex scams flying all over the internet. Most forex websites are of questionable honesty and are designed solely to steal your money. For example you'll come across website authors who claim they make so and so amount of money online. They'll prompt you to visit their website and pay them some money in exchange for their success secret or tips. When you do, you'll end up losing."

Is it necessary to open a chart to run a strategy?\n\nQ2. The strategy I am planning involves an single indicator/oscillator derived from from three instruments and trading three other instruments together as a basket. Each of the first three instruments needs two timeframes. There is no obvious bar series (either from the indicator or the basket) that stands out as a preferred default. Do I just pick any one instrument as a default, open a chart and specify one of the time frames? What are the possible/likely unanticipated consequences of this undesired asymmetry between instruments?\n\nQ3. Do I have to open a separate chart for every instrument I wish to trade? If so, does each chart have to recalculate the oscillator separately? How do I keep the basket in synch?\n\nQ4. Is it possible to put the complete traded basket on a single chart, together with the oscillator from the non-traded instruments?\n\n1) No, see \"strategies\" tab and related docs\n2) Multi series indicators are not supported at this time. Strategies are though. Does not matter which series is the first\n\nThanks. I see.\n\nSo this raises a question. In my strategy code, how do I know which of the 6 currency pairs I have chosen (from the strategy dialog) as the default first series? Alternatively, how can I make the data series specified in the strategy dialog always be a default choice that the strategy code knows and the user can't change?\n\nI'm guessing that the answer to both questions is that I can't. And I can live with that answer (uncomfortably). But this irks me as I don't like to sacrifice generality, particularly when it requires me remembering unimportant stuff that I have put into the code (like which indicator pair I must always use for the first series).\n\nNow I have some different questions concerning the order of event handling.\n\n1. I have three instruments each with two Added bar series. The first is a multi-minute bar and the second is an indicator built on the first, but with an OnBarUpdate method called per tick. The OnBarUpdate method for the complete strategy also functions per tick. For any given instrument, which OnBarUpdate method gets called first? (In other words, how do I know if the indicator has already been updated when the strategy method is called?)\n\n2. If a tick coincides with a bar close, which event triggers OnBarUpdate first, the bar close or the tick?"

      "text": "What You Should Know About Leveraged and Inverse ETFs\n\nWhat are leveraged and inverse ETFs?\n\nETFs that seek to produce a return that is a multiple of the return of its benchmarked index are commonly known as \"leveraged\". There are currently more than 100 different funds in this category with benchmarks that track commodities, currencies and various stock indexes. Some leveraged ETFs have multipliers of double or triple the benchmark (i.e., 2x or 3x), while others target returns that are based on the inverse of the benchmark (i.e., -1x, -2x or -3x). It is critical to understand the time period for which the leverage applies. Each fund explicitly states this time period in its prospectus.\n\nAt the time of this writing, all leveraged and inverse ETFs are designed to generate daily returns that are a positive or negative multiple of the daily return of a specified index. They are not designed to match the return for a holding period that is longer than the objective stated in the prospectus. Therefore, the daily compounded return of a leveraged ETF over one year, one month, one week, or even a two-day period may be significantly different from the returns produced by simply applying the stated multiple to the index's total holding period return. Daily monitoring and adjustment (buying and selling) by the investor could modify the return to match its stated objective over time.\n\nDaily leveraged ETFs may be unsuitable for investors who seek an intermediate-term or long-term holding period. Instead, this type of leveraged ETF may be better suited to traders who wish to increase or hedge their market exposure over a short period of time. Investors are encouraged to consult with their financial advisors or registered representatives to help determine if leveraged or inverse ETFs are suitable for them.\n\nWhat are the additional concerns an investor should review before investing in a leveraged or inverse ETF?\n\nInverse ETF fund managers may, at times, be unable to fully carry out their short-selling strategy as a result of difficulties in the derivatives markets, regulatory restrictions, or their inability to locate and borrow shares or for other reasons. This could cause the market price of the ETF to vary from its index target and NAV.\n\nMany leveraged ETFs (of both the long and the short varieties) rely on the use of futures, swaps and other derivative securities, along with other securities or commodities, to achieve their target returns. Some of these derivatives, such as swaps, are unlisted securities that depend on the swap issuer's ability to pay. Therefore, the leveraged ETFs that depend on such swaps may not be able to achieve their stated returns if a swap counterparty should default.\n\nLeveraged and inverse ETFs may be less tax efficient than other ETFs. It is possible for investors to have a tax liability, even in a year in which the leveraged or inverse ETF had a negative overall return. This outcome can result from the fund managers \"rebalancing\" the investments each day with derivatives to maintain the ETF's multiple. Such rebalancing can produce realized taxable gains with no offsetting losses. As with any potential investment, an investor should consult with his or her tax advisor and carefully read the prospectus to understand the tax consequences of leveraged or inverse ETFs"

      "text": "LONDON -- Currency brokers that cater to retail investors almost doubled their share of trading volumes in the foreign-exchange market last year... Foreign-exchange brokers...accounted for 18% of volume in the $4-trillion-a-day currency market, compared with 10% in 2010... (The Wall Street Journal, April 18)\n\nVadim Pokhlebkin\n\nJim Martens: First, currency markets are much larger than equity markets. By most estimates, the daily volume in forex is as much as 10 times larger than the combined volume of ALL of the world's stock markets. That makes it a very liquid market.\n\nPlus, we're also talking about a market that trades 24 hours a day. That means that if you are a short-term trader and the price spikes after hours, you can adjust your existing position or enter a new one without having to wait until the market reopens the next morning. Sometimes you can do that with stocks too, but typically the spreads (the bid/ask) in stocks after hours widen out, so you may have to pay extra to buy a stock that, for example, announced great earnings after the close of the stock exchange at 4 PM.\n\nThat's not the case with forex. Liquidity stays plenty deep for most investors around the clock. Yes, there are moments when currencies are less liquid, but for most participants, liquidity is fine even then. Spreads stay tight, too -- for example, for the euro-dollar exchange rate, or the EUR/USD, they are typically 2 pips (points) or less, and they may go to 3 pips when liquidity is not as high. But rarely do we ever see a major widening in spreads.\n\nSecondly, I think the ease of choosing a currency to trade is a big advantage. How many stocks now trade around the world? Between the U.S., European and Asian stock markets, there are at least 40 industries, each with a number of sub-industries, and each one of those with 100+ stocks. So we're talking about tens of thousands of stocks -- and you have to choose the right one! Even in bull markets, while \"the rising tide lifts all boats,\" as the saying goes, it may not lift your particular \"boat\" -- in fact, your stock may even decline if it's not the best stock in its peer group, or if you're in the wrong sector. Often, you see your sector or stock fall even as the general market rises, so you have to be very good -- or lucky -- at your stock picks.\n\nThe currency market has far fewer choices, and it's a good thing, because that makes your job much easier. Most forex traders stick to the major pairs; in fact, the bulk of trading is between the U.S. dollar and euro -- by some estimates, up to 70% of the total daily volume. Besides EUR/USD, we have 5 or 6 other major pairs -- and by watching those, you are basically watching the entire world.\n\nIn EWI's Currency Specialty Service, we track and forecast 12 most popular forex pairs, plus the U.S. Dollar Index.\n\nDollar Rates\n\nEURUSD\n\nGBPUSD\n\nAUDUSD\n\nDX, U.S. Dollar Index\n\nUSDCHF\n\nUSDJPY\n\nUSDCAD\n\nCross Rates\n\nEURCHF\n\nEURJPY\n\nEURGBP\n\nEURCAD\n\nAUDJPY\n\nGBPJPY\n\nOf course, we can expand forex trading into more cross rates -- those are non-U.S.-dollar currency pairs, like EUR/GBP, for example -- but even then we're still talking about maybe two dozen markets versus tens of thousands of stocks. So currencies are just easier to follow in that regard.\n\nThirdly, when you trade individual stocks, financial news plays a much bigger role: sector news, individual stock news like earnings, etc. With currencies, we focus on \"the big story\" instead. There are big economic data releases coming out of each country every week, but we watch economic data calendars and know when they are coming out -- and are rarely surprised by them. Instead, we spend more time watching forex markets' technical indicators.\n\nLastly, forex offers flexibility to go long and short with ease -- something that stocks just don't. When the broad stock market declines, most people are uncomfortable selling short -- that is, selling a stock they don't own in hopes of buying it back later, returning it at a lower price and capturing the spread. Most investors just don't do that, even with some new avenues for doing so that became open in recent years: mutual funds, ETFs, etc.\n\nIn forex, it's a whole different story. Whenever we quote a currency market -- take EUR/USD, again -- we are comparing one currency against the other; we are tracking the value of the euro against the value of the dollar. So even when we are selling one market, we are always buying another! We are always buying the base currency, which is the first one in name of the pair. In EUR/USD, the base currency is the euro. On the other hand, in dollar-Swiss franc (or USD/CHF) we track the value of the dollar relative to franc; the dollar is the base.\n\nForex markets have lots of volatility, too -- good for aggressive traders. And if you're a macro-trader, currencies are well-known for staying with the trend for a long time. Volatile at times, yes, but steadily trending.\n\nSo, there are several reasons why one might look at forex versus stocksJim Martens: Well, I'd go back to the first question you asked me. Easy? No. Easi-er than equities? Yes.\n\nIn forex, there are fewer markets, so you have fewer choices and less news to be concerned with -- so, fewer surprises. Our main goal is to find the one currency that looks the strongest against others, and one that looks the weakest. Found them -- now pair them together. Sounds easy, but in practice, keep in mind that when trading ANY vehicle, we are trying to predict the future, and that's a hard task. It's especially hard with individual equities, because you need a real system of how to approach first the broad market, then the sectors, then your stocks. That's why Wall Street investment houses have hundreds of equity analysts -- and maybe five technicians, the analysis who, like us at Elliott Wave International, focus on the markets' technical picture. That's also why a lot more forex traders use technicals than equity traders. But winning is hard in both markets.\n\nAs a technical trader, you can only control one thing when it comes to the future: How many viable chart pattern possibilities there are. Elliott wave analysis allows us to limit those down to a handful, and rank them in terms of their probability. That's a great advantage, but at the end of the day, trading is trading, so the requirements are the same:\n\nKnow at what price you are wrong before you get in the trade. (Elliott wave analysis is great at helping you determine that.)\n\nKnow your risk appetite and don't risk beyond what you can stomach. If you're only comfortable trading at, say, 5 times the leverage while risking 2% of your capital per trade, then don't push yourself beyond that limit. (It's different for everyone.)\n\nStick to your convictions. If your analysis strongly suggests the market will move in one particular direction, trust your analysis, not the \"noise\": the news, analysts' opinions, etc.\n\nManage money for YOUR own needs. This ties in with point #1: What are your goals? Are they realistic? How do you get there? Break it down to the smallest parts.\n\nVP: In your Currency Specialty Service, you and your teammates forecast forex using Elliott wave analysis. Why Elliott? Why not just watch the news and trade forex around the major economic report releases?\n\nJM: Yes, you should pay attention to the news! But relying solely on the news will get you into trouble. For example, let's say the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Will the dollar soar or fall? Using fundamental analysis, you can argue for both scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Higher interest rates are bullish for the U.S. dollar because it means the Fed thinks the U.S. economy is getting stronger.\n\nOR\n\nScenario 2: Higher interest rates are bearish for the U.S. dollar because they make borrowing more expensive, and that slows the economy.\n\nWith Elliott wave analysis, you don't have that. You know what the larger Elliott wave pattern is, so regardless of the news-driven volatility, you know the larger trend. Which means that can remain objective and not confuse yourself with the hour-by-hour news and the \"fundamentals.\"\n\nIn my work, I do follow the news -- I just use it differently. As technicians, we already know based on chart patterns where the market should go. We look at its reaction to the news and see how it fits into the Elliott wave pattern. Many traders shy away from taking risks around big news events, and I don't blame them, because volatility can be tremendous. But we've had some good success over the years at forecasting the markets before a big news report -- because we already know the larger trend! If wave patterns show a clear bullish or bearish setup in front of the news, we've often been able to use the subsequent volatility to our advantage.\n\nBesides that, why do I use Elliott wave analysis, in general? It just fits my personality.\n\nVP: How did you learn Elliott? How long was it before you were able to make confident forecasts? Where should one start with applying Elliott wave analysis to forex?\n\nJM: About 30 years ago, in mid-eighties, I first saw Robert Prechter, EWI's president, on TV. He had quite a following and was on almost every week. I watched his forecasts come true, for the most part; that certainly gets your attention. As many people did, I ordered his book, \"Elliott Wave Principle -- Key to Market Behavior,\" read it, and that was it.\n\nThe first 2 chapters tell you everything you need to know. It's not an easy read; you do have to stop and think. (Lots of pictures, though!) There is really not a wasted word in those 70-some pages. It took me several readings, and even now I go back and re-read them every once in a while.\n\nI started, like most people, by applying Elliott wave analysis to equities, but after joining EWI in 1993, I've applied it to virtually every market we cover (about 60 of them, give or take), in all time frames. So I've seen it work in every situation.\n\nHow long did it take to learn it? Well, I never stopped! Just the other day, I again watched one of Prechter's old videos on applying Elliott wave in practice. And I take the same approach with my subscribers. Every Friday, I record a 5-6 minute video for my Currency Specialty Service, where I explain our forecasts and also include an educational component, often about the basics. Learning the basics well will help you a lot. So, if you're a forex trader interested in Elliott, you start with Bob's book, you watch my videos, and then you progress to label your own charts.\n\nOver the years, I've seen that the most successful forex traders are not those who blindly follow my forecasts. It's those traders who do their homework, who do their own analysis, Elliott wave or something else. They think for themselves, and when they put on a trade, it's because they have their own conclusions. Once they've done that, then they look to see what my Currency Specialty Service is suggesting. If we agree on the trend, they have greater confidence. If we disagree, then the real work begins. Why do we disagree? What price levels need to break to make their wave interpretations work and mine fail, and vice versa?\n\nThat brings up another important point. Some say it's confusing that you may sometimes have a couple of different Elliott wave interpretations of the same price move. But the real question is, do they point in the same direction? If so, that's not confusing, it's a confirmation! Those subscribers who do their own Elliott, as long as their wave counts and mine give at least a common price target and stop-loss level, they can go ahead and act anyway. The market will eventually decide which Elliott wave count is right -- but if the trend is clear, go with it. That's how I use Elliott wave analysis"

      "text": "Investment FAQs – Derivatives\n\nThe term 'Derivative' indicates that it has no independent value. Its value is entirely 'derived' from the value of its underlying asset. The underlying asset can be securities, commodities, bullion, currency, livestock, etc. In other words, Derivative means a forward, future, option or any other hybrid contract of pre-determined duration, which is linked for the purpose of contract fulfillment to the value of a specified real or financial asset.\n\nDerivatives include -\n\nA security derived from a share, loan, and debt instrument whether secured or unsecured, risk instrument or contract for differences or any other form of security.\n\nFutures Contract means a legally binding agreement to buy or sell the underlying security on a future date. Future contracts are the organised/standardised contracts in terms of quantity, quality (in case of commodities), delivery time and place for settlement on any date in future. The contract expires on a pre-mentioned date which is called the expiry date of the contract. On expiry, futures can be settled by delivering the underlying asset or cash. Cash settlement enables the settlement of obligations arising out of the future/option contract in cash.\n\nOptions Contract is a type of contract which gives the buyer/holder of the contract the right (not the obligation) to buy/sell the underlying asset at a pre-determined price within or at the end of a specified period. The buyer / holder of the option purchases the right from the seller/writer for a consideration which is called a Premium. The seller/writer of an option is obligated to settle the option as per the terms of the contract when the buyer/holder exercises his right. The underlying assets are the same as in a futures contract.\n\nAn Option to buy is called Call option and option to sell is called Put option. Further, if an option that is exercisable on or before the expiry date is called American option and one that is exercisable only on expiry date, is called European option. The price at which the option is to be exercised is called Strike price or Exercise price.\n\nFutures contract based on an index i.e. the underlying asset is the index, are known as Index Futures Contracts. For example, futures contract on NIFTY Index and SENSEX Index. These contracts derive their value from the value of the underlying index.\n\nDerivative trading in India takes place either on a separate and independent Derivative Exchange or on a separate segment of an existing Stock Exchange.

      "text": "What Are Binary Options?\n\nIn today s trading market there are literally dozens of options for the investor. Day trading, futures trading, commodities trading, FOREX trading (Foreign currency trading) just to name a few and are all viable trading options in today s market. But less are as popular today as binary option trading. Some people have heard of it some and people have not but the fact of the matter is, it is one of the more popular and risk to ROI types of trading in the business.\n\nHere is a little history on options and how binary options evolved before we get started: The trading of options has been around for many decades and for a majority of that time was pretty much unregulated. Option trading was primarily considered OTC or over the counter transactions with very little regulation. Then in 1973 the Chicago Board Options Exchange was formed as a venue for trading options with specific regulations. Along with the formation of the Options Clearing Corporation, option traders could now be held to a higher standard of accountability for any trade they make punishable by temporary or permanent suspension for any regulation indiscretions.\n\nBinary options became a derivative of standard options trading early on and itself was primarily an over the counter transaction with minimal regulations. Binary options at first were actually one smaller part of much larger complex options and at that time were not considered much of a viable trading option. It wasn t until recent years in the mid 2000's that binary options would start to gain a foothold. With its increased popularity, in 2007 the Options Clearing Corporation made a change in the rules to allow binary options to be legal tradable contracts on the open market. As you can imagine with this change binary options popularity skyrocketed and in 2008 the American Stock Exchange became the first exchange to offer binary options publicly.\n\nSo what is a Binary option? A binary option allows for a payoff that is a fixed amount of an asset or nothing at all. It is a very black and white cut and dried form of option trading. Binary options exist in two main types: cash or nothing and asset or nothing. From either you are going to get only one of two results, and you are either in the money or out of the money hence the name binary. With a cash or nothing binary option a fixed amount is paid in cash if the option expires in the money. With the asset or nothing option, the value of underlying security is what pays. For example, let s say you purchase a cash or nothing call option on Acme Company's stock at $50 with a binary payoff of $500. Then at the maturity date if Acme company s stock is trading at $50 or above you receive $500, if it is trading at less than $50 you get nothing including your initial investment.\n\nDue to the Internet and the creation as well as implementation of many extraordinary tools for trading, binary options popularity has soared. Due to the expansion of online trading, now your everyday average day trader can now partake in every form of trading as well as option trading right from the comforts of home and binary options have become the trade of choice."

Can calculus be used to follow the trend?Calculus and the Stock MarketVery, very interesting post! That puts everything into perspective. If things are that complex, do people really make money trading stocks day to day?Thanks for replying. I'm interested in getting involved as I do have some risk capital available. Is the time series used to track daily trends, and then jump as trends increase?In as far as I see most simple models of stock market motion, one of the hypotheses that goes in all of these models is \"market equilibrium\" which means that \"all the available information is in the current price\". This means that the expectation value of the \"next future price\" is simply the current price ; in other words, the stochastic description of the stock value is a martingale. If you accept this hypothesis, it is strictly impossible to predict the expectation of future movements based on past movements better than to say \"it will stay at its current value\".\nAnother way of saying this is that most market models take on the \"no arbitrage\" hypothesis.\n\nThis can eventually not be the case ; if you are a fine market expert, you might know in advance how certain assets might move based upon information that is \"not yet in the price\" (in other words, that most traders ignore, or ignore how to use, and for which you are the world's only expert, or almost - or because you have inside information ).\n\nOf course you CAN make money on the stock market. If you are willing to take a risk, you should be (on AVERAGE) rewarded for that with a risk premium. Normally, stock with large volatility (large fluctuations) will also grow faster (or crash...). But there's no magic formula that allows you to predict future trends beyond that, for a particular course. The reason is simple: if that formula existed, traders around the world would use it, until the gain margin (the arbitrage) would be small again, which comes exactly down to the statement that the current price already reflects the future expectation (diminished with riskless bond growth).\n\nThanks! What would be the best way for a beginner to learn to take moving averages of, say stock prices throughout the day and determine when to enter?OK, but how does your broker know about the entry points?

      "text": "Long Term Trading with Technical Analysis\n\nUpdated on 2012-08-21\n\nTechnical analysis should not be applied to predict future prices but to measure the strength/direction of the different trends and the power of bullish and bearish pressure. Price movements and volume levels should be used to detect the market direction, verify our fundamental and sentiment predictions and confirm our expectation of the future performance of the securities we are analyzing.\n\nTechnical analysis is important for both buy and sell decisions. For the trend follower, it allows him to enter only positions that are in the direction of the market and exit any position that changes direction. Some traders base their decisions solely on technical analysis but it is often advisable to weight decisions based on several investing techniques (Fundamental analysis, Market analysis, Sentiment analysis...).\n\nDifference between Short and Long Term Technical Analysis\n\nIn reality, there is no much difference between analyzing stocks or securities using short term or long term technical analysis techniques. Almost every indicator or pattern can be applied to any period.\n\nYou should however choose long term technical analysis if your investments last from a few years to many years and short term analysis if your traders or positions trades last from few days to several days.\n\nAs an example, a long-term trader may detect a bullish trend by comparing the share price to its 250-bar (about a year) moving average.\n\nIn QuantShare, you can plot the 250-bar moving average by typing: a = sma(250);\nplot(a, \"SMA250\");\n\nA short-term trader, however, will detect a bullish trend using a much smaller moving average period: a = sma(10);\nplot(a, \"SMA10\");\n\nPlease note that short and long-term traders can use multiple time frames to take trading decisions. Usually, long term traders make decisions on whether to invest long or short using higher periods and they use lower period (short term analysis) to make timing decisions (the best time to enter the position).\n\nUsing Weekly and Monthly data\n\nLong-term technical analysis can be based on daily, weekly, monthly and even yearly data. You can even use several periods to make better decisions.\n\nHere is how to synchronize a daily and a weekly chart:\n- Open two charts for the same stock\n- Set a daily period for the first one and a weekly period for the second one\n- For each chart, click on \"S\" icon at the bottom and select the same link index\n- Now, your charts are synchronized. To see how it works, click on one of these charts to see the other chart(s) move\n\nBy following the same steps, you can synchronize three or more charts (for the same or different securities).\n\nHere is how to calculate an indicator using weekly data when working with a daily period:\n\nLet us say you have a daily chart and you want to display the daily and weekly RSI indicator (Relative Strength Indicator).\n\n- Right click on the chart then select \"Create New Pane\"\n- Right click on the new pane then select \"Edit Formula\"\n- Type the following formula:\n\nNote that QuantShare trading software allows you to create custom periods.\nTo create a 15 day chart period for example, open a daily chart, right click on that chart, select \"Chart Timeframe\", choose the first menu item then type \"15\".\n\nLong Term Trading with Support/Resistance Lines\n\nSupport/Resistance lines show you the areas where the forces of supply and demand meet.\nAs show in the below picture, long-term trading analysis requires that your support and resistance lines covers a longer period of data.\n\nThe auto support and resistance lines of QuantShare automatically build these lines based on the start/end points that you choose.\n\n- Click on the \"Auto Support/Resistance\" icon in the right bar (Drawing Tools)\n- Click on a chart then move your mouse and click again\n- You can resize the study later\n\nYou can also draw support and resistance lines programmatically using the \"AutoSR\" function.\n\nThe advantage of this solution is that you can use this function to create trading rules. For example, you can create a screen that shows all stocks that have risen above their long-term resistance line."

      "text": "Is Naked Short Selling Dangerous?\n\nAs financial markets careened wildly in the summer and fall, many corporations blamed short selling - especially naked short selling - for driving stock prices down. Short sellers sell stock they don't own because they expect the stock price is about to fall. In naked short selling - which came in for particularly sharp criticism when market prices plummeted - the seller doesn't borrow the shares for the transaction. The buyer has a claim (economic exposure) on the shares without actually receiving them, yet the seller still has the obligation to deliver."

Futures markets typically have a tick size that is specific to the instrument.

The tick value is what each price movement is worth in terms of dollars. A stock, for instance, has a tick size of 0.01, with a tick value of one cent. The e-mini S&P 500 contract has a tick size of .25 with a tick value of $12.50; each time price moves .25 (from 1110.50 to 1110.75 for example) the value changes $12.50, either up or down depending on the direction of the price"

      "text": "Mining Isn't a Good Bet For Stock-Market Predictions\n\nBy JASON ZWEIG good at this point.\n\nThere is no end to such rules. But there isn't much sense to most of them either. An entertaining new book, \"Nerds on Wall Street,\" by the veteran quantitative money manager David Leinweber, dissects the shoddy thinking that underlies most of these techniques.\n\nThe stock market generates such vast quantities of information that, if you plow through enough of it for long enough, you can always find some relationship that appears to generate spectacular returns -- by coincidence alone. This sham is known as \"data mining.\"\n\nEvery year, billions of dollars pour into data-mined investing strategies. No one knows if these techniques will work in the real world. Their results are hypothetical -- based on \"back-testing,\" or a simulation of what would have happened if the manager had actually used these techniques in the past, typically without incurring any fees, trading costs or taxes.\n\nThose assumptions are completely unrealistic, of course. But data-mined numbers can be so irresistible that, as Mr. Leinweber puts it, \"they are one of the leading causes of the evaporation of money, especially in quantitative strategies.\"\n\nMr. Leinweber got so frustrated by \"irresponsible\" data mining that he decided to satirize it. After%% accuracy.\n\nBut the entire exercise, he says, is a total crock. There is no conceivable reason why U.S. stock returns would be determined by Bangladeshi livestock returns.\n\nMr. Leinweber's exercise isn't much more absurd than some actual examples of data mining. One recent scholarly paper purported to show that you can predict stock returns by tracking the number of nine-year-olds in the U.S. Another academic study asserts that stocks are more likely to go up on days when smog goes down.\n\nThat points to the first rule for keeping yourself from falling into a data mine: The results have to make sense. Correlation isn't causation, so there needs to be a logical reason why a particular factor should predict market returns. No matter how appealing the numbers may look, if the cause isn't plausible, the returns probably won't last.\n\nHeath Hinegardner\n\nThe second rule is to break the data into pieces. Divide the measurement period into thirds, for example, to see whether the strategy did well only part of the time. Ask to see the results only for stocks whose names begin with A through J, or R through Z, to see whether the claims hold up when you hold back some of the data.\n\nNext, ask what the results would look like once trading costs, management fees and applicable taxes are subtracted.\n\nFinally, wait. Hypothetical results usually crumple after they collide with the real-world costs of investing. \"If a strategy's worthwhile,\" Mr. Leinweber says, \"then it'll still be worthwhile in six months or a year.\"\n\nMr. Leinweber still gets inquiries from money managers who want him to share his data on Bangladeshi butter production so they can get the latest numbers and build a trading strategy around them. \"A distressing number of people don't get that it was a joke,\" Mr. Leinweber sighSlicing and dicing data to predict the future can get dicey."

      "text": "More from Nial Fuller\n\nTrader and educator Nial Fuller describes a five-step process that allows forex traders to identify the dominant trend in the markets, form a bias, and develop a plan at the onset of each trading week.\n\nKnowing how to properly identify trend and market bias at the start of the trading week is a vitally important thing every serious forex trader must know how to do. Each Sunday, you should take about 30 minutes to analyze the markets that you trade and decide what you think is most likely to happen over the course of the upcoming trading week.\n\nIt is very important to do this when the market is closed so that you are completely unemotional; this will allow you to formulate an objective market bias that is influenced mainly by logic and common sense instead of emotion. Here are some practical tips that will allow you to effectively analyze the market at the start of each week so that you have a plan for the week ahead.\n\nTake Notes\n\nAs you analyze the market, you should make notes in your trading journal or in the notepad on your computer. You should jot down anything that you think is obviously important about the markets you trade; this can be significant levels or specific price action patterns or even important impending news events. This information will help you formulate a bias to work off of for the upcoming week. This exercise will help to get your mind in sync with the current ebb and flow of the market.\n\nIdentify Recent Market Conditions\n\nYou want to ask yourself some questions as you analyze and take notes about the market. Look at the last two weeks to one month of price movement on the daily chart and ask yourself, \"What is the most recent condition of the market?\" Is the market trending higher or lower, or is it consolidating sideways?\n\nThe recent or near-term market momentum is the most important factor to consider as a daily chart price-action trader. We want to try and make sure we are trading with the recent daily chart momentum at all times, as this gives us the best chance at profiting in the near term. Make a note of the most recent market condition over about the last month's time.\n\nDefine Key Support and Resistance\n\nAfter gauging and identifying the current market condition, you will need to identify and draw the obvious, or key support and resistance levels. I start with the daily chart, as I mainly focus on this time frame. I will draw in the obvious support and resistance levels over about the last three to six month's worth of price data.\n\nThis is not an exact science, but after some screen time and practice, your ability to identify the most important support and resistance levels in the market will become second nature.\n\nI also use the daily 8- and 21-period exponential moving averages (EMAs) to help identify dynamic (moving) support and resistance levels, as well as to help with daily chart trend analysis. (See these EMAs on the chart example below.)\n\nUsing Your Weekly Bias\n\nUpon identifying the near-term market condition and drawing in the significant support and resistance levels, you will have a solid guide to use for the upcoming trading week. If your bias for the upcoming week is bearish, you would watch for forex price action sell signals forming within the bearish market structure from the key resistance levels that you previously identified.\n\nIf you have a bullish bias for the upcoming week, you would watch for price action buy signals forming within the bullish market structure from key support levels that you previously identified.\n\nTo Trade or Not to Trade\n\nIf your bias for the upcoming week is neutral because the market has been very choppy recently and you are largely unsure about the upcoming week's direction, you may elect not to trade at all. Often, not trading at all is the fastest way to make money because you are avoiding losing trades and eliminating the temptation to overtrade and overleverage.\n\nThe key to successful long-term trading lies in knowing exactly what your trading edge is and only trading when it appears. In other words, trading like a sniper and not a machine gunner.\n\nExample Chart\n\nIf you analyze any price chart, you are likely to notice that most markets have a tendency to make substantial directional moves followed by periods of consolidation. This means that some weeks you might see chop or sideways movement for the entire week, and other weeks, you will see strong directional movement.\n\nIn the example below, we see the EUR/USD daily chart. In the red boxes, we see periods of around four or five days of consolidation and choppy price action followed by a stronger directional move. Even in trending markets like we see below, the market is likely to have periods of sideways movement before and after periods of strong directional movement. Thus, by doing some pre-week analysis, we can develop a good, educated opinion of what the market is most likely to do over the course of the upcoming week.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nFor example, if the market has recently consolidated for four or five days but is in an overall uptrend, we can safely assume that there's a good chance of a larger up move coming soon and a resumption of the trend.\n\nAlternatively, if the market has just moved significantly up or down over the course of the previous week, there's a better chance it will \"take a breather\" and consolidate for at least a couple days in the upcoming week.\n\nOf course, these are by no means concrete rules; they are just examples of how you can use the previous week's price movement to develop your bias for the upcoming week in the market.\n\nAs every trader should know, no two days in the market are ever exactly the same, so we cannot develop hard-and-fast rules. Instead, we need to be flexible in our thinking and in our approach to the markets.\n\nWe can, however, put the odds in our favor by doing some pre-week analysis based on objectivity and logic as well as trading with a simple, yet effective strategy like forex price action."

      "text": "The Candlestick Charts, popularly used today, were created in the 17th century in Japan to trade rice. The Japanese man, named Homma, discovered that beside the influence of demand and supply on markets there is another factor – emotions of the traders. The canons set up by Homma are the base for Candlestick Charts.\n\nIn order to trade using Candlesticks you have to know what it takes to create a candlestick and understand the candlestick patterns.\n\nCandlestick components\n\nThe following four pieces create a candle and its wick:\n\nOpen Price – it is the first price traded on the stock. Depending on whether bullish or bearish activity appeared on the stock, the Open Price corresponds to bottom or upper edge of the candle.\n\nHigh Price – the highest price reached during the trading day; creates the top wick of the candlestick. If a security opens at a certain price and then it trades only below this price, there will be no upper wick (Open Price = High Price).\n\nLow Price – the lowest price reported, corresponds to the bottom wick, if the activity on the stock is only bullish and the price doesn't fall below the Open Price then there will be no bottom wick (Open Price = Low Price).\n\nClose Price- the price that finishes trading; depending on the performance of the security it corresponds to upper or bottom edge of the candle.\n\nJust by looking at the candlestick you can tell if the trading day was up or down. White candle signifies that the buyers dominated the trading period and if the candle is black it means that there was more selling pressure than desire to buy.\n\nSingle Candlestick patterns\n\nLong vs. short bodies\n\nCandlesticks have different body sizes. Long bodies signify strong buying or selling pressure. The longer the body is, the more powerful the buying or selling demand. This indicates that either buyers or sellers were stronger and took control. Short bodies mean small activity.\n• Long white candlesticks indicate increasing bullish pressure, prices rose significantly from open to close and buyers were dominant.\n• Long black candlesticks illustrate strong bearish pressure, prices decreased dramatically from the open and selling pressure was big.\n\nLong Wicks\n\nLong lower and upper wicks provide some information about trading session.\n• Long Upper Wick indicates that Bulls controlled the trading session but by the end of the trading session they \"lost\" with Bears.\n• Long Lower Wick signifies that the trading session was dominates for a long time by Bears but in the end Bulls \"won\".\n\nSpinning Tops\n\nCandlesticks that have long upper and lower wicks are called Spinning Tops.\n\nThis pattern indicates the indecision during the trading session. Both, Bulls and Bears, had their moments but finally none of them won.\n\nMarubozu\n\nMarubozu is a candlestick that has no shadows. If the Marubozu is white it means that Open Price = Low Price and Close Price = High Price. Conversely, when Marubozu is black then Open Price = High Price and Close Price = Low Price.\n\nDoji with Long Candles\n\nDoji are the candlesticks that have same Open and Close Price or at least their bodies are very small. This pattern suggests indecision or struggle between Bulls and Bears. After Doji appears on the chart we should pay attention to the prior candlestick.\n\n• Doji plus Long White Candle means that the bullish trend is weakening, there are not enough buyers;\n• Doji with Black Long Candle means that the bearish trend is becoming exhausted, there's a lack of sellers.\n\nHammer and Hanging Man\n\nThese two candlesticks look the same but they have different meaning which depends on the previous activity of the price.\n• Hammer is a bullish reversal pattern, they might mark the end of downtrend or support level; long lower wick indicates the strong selling pressure;\n• Hanging Man is bearish reversal pattern, signifies end of uptrend or resistance level.\n\nInverted Hammer and Shooting Star\n\n• Inverted Hammer represents a potential trend reverse or support levels, long upper wick indicates that buyers tried to push the price higher but they didn't manage to do it.\n• Shooting Star is a bearish reversal pattern, signifies resistance or trend reverse.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many patterns in the Candlestick Charts but we covered only the simple ones in this part of the tutorial. There are many benefits of using this type of chart, like ease in understanding, ability to spot Bulls and Bears and even ability to foresee the next action of the price. However there are some risks connected with using Candlesticks. They are not very good to analyze very short term period, because the patterns that help us taking trading decision are not being created in a short time. Also some patterns are simple; some are complicated so all you need to do to become a serious trader is mastering these patterns."

Test stock A using ADF to decide whether A is I(0) or I(1).\n2. Test stock B using ADF to decide whether B is I(0) or I(1).\n3. Using Johansen or Granger-2-stage methods to decide if A and B are cointegrated.\n4. Trade the pair if they are decided to be cointegrated.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Are steps 1 and 2 neccessary?\n\nIn real-world, most prices series are either I(0) or I(1). And if two stock prices series are I(0) and I(0), we can still do\n\npairs trading on them, no?\n\nDo we really need both series to be I(1) to do the pairs trading?\n\n2. In steps 1 and 2, there are different versions of the ADF tests: for example, in R, the function ur.df\n\nhas \"none\", \"const\", \"trend\", \"both\" options.\n\nHow can we select the best ADF options programatically and automatically, both cross-sectionally and along the time axis?\n\nFor example, if we have a large universe of stocks and if we need to do rolling-window ADF tests, choosing the ADF options \"automatically\"\n\nand \"programatically\" become tricky...\n\n3. In steps 1 and 2, does the option of \"none\", \"const\", \"trend\" and \"both\" matter?\n\nFor example, if setting \"trend\" leads to the conclusion of stationary while setting to \"const\" leads to the conclusion of non-stationary,\n\nshould this series be declared as \"stationary\" or \"non-stationary\" for trading purposes?\n\n4. I read that cointegration is more or less a long term concept. How \"long\" is long term here?\n\nSuppose I am doing these tests on 15minute bars, how many data points shall I use in my rolling-window tests along the time axis? I am thinking of 500 data points. But maybe that's too much, remember the markets are changing and we have to be a bit adaptive... Any thoughts on this?\n\n5. Johansen has the advantage of being symmetical in A and B. But Johansen is not stable at all if we look at the rolling-window cointegrated vectors(the eigenvectors).\n\nIt seems that to get the hedge ratio, still one needs to use linear regression since it's more stable.\n\nBut then would you regress A onto B and regress B onto A? They do make a difference, from my experiment...\n\nOr does that matter?\n\n6. Some literature also mentioned using returns to do all these.\n\nMy understanding is that returns are used to find the hedge-ratios approximately.\n\nUltimately we are still trading prices, those are the tradables. We arenot trading the returns.\n\nSo after we do all the tests and obtained hedge ratios using returns or other series, we still come back to prices to form a pair and pairs-trade the price levels...\n\nThe hedge-ratio obtained from regressing returns of A onto returns of B is an approximation to the hedge-ratio obtained from regressing prices of A onto prices of B.\n\nWhen the prices of A and B are I(1), regressing prices onto prices will lead to spurious regression, but the estimate of Beta (the hedge-ratio) itself shouldn't be a problem.\n\nIn today's EFFICIENT markets pairs/basket trading...\nIs more a way to keep a portfolio market neutral...\nWhile one scalps continuously and captures the spread...\nThen the profitable cash cow it was 10 years ago.\n\nIt's about 50 times harder to make money...\nThan when I started trading 15 years ago...\nSo you have to make it up in automated volume."

      "text": "How To Trade: Margin Accounts Amplify Gains, Losses\n\nSavvy investors can use margin to get more bang for their buck in the stock market.\n\nThey also know and respect the risks of margin when things aren't working right.\n\nA margin account allows investors to borrow money from a brokerage to buy more securities than they otherwise could, creating the potential for bigger profits — or bigger losses.\n\nLet's say you pay $20,000 cash to buy 1,000 shares of a $20 stock. The stock rises to $30. Your profit would be $10,000, a 50% gain on your $20,000 investment.\n\nBut what if you buy the stock with $10,000 in cash and $10,000 from a margin loan? If the stock goes to $30, your $10,000 profit would yield a return of 100% on your $10,000 investment.\n\nOf course, you would have to subtract the interest on the margin loan from your profit. But buying on margin makes it possible to amplify your returns significantly.\n\nOn the other hand, margin investors can lose money very quickly. Those who borrow $2 for every $1 they invest can lose money at twice the rate of a cash investor.\n\nIn the example above, if the stock falls to $10, you will be left with only $10,000 — the $10,000 you borrowed from the broker and nothing for yourself. You would have lost your entire $10,000 investment, but a margin call from your broker would likely prevent that from occurring.\n\nWhen using margin, operate under strict buy and sell rules. Investors without a few years of investing experience should stick to cash-only investing.\n\n\"I've always used margin, and I believe it offers a real advantage to an experienced investor who knows how to confine his buying to high-quality market leaders and has the discipline and common sense to always cut his losses short with no exceptions,\" IBD founder William J. O'Neil wrote in \"How To Make Money In Stocks.\"\n\nMargin, he says, is best used in the first two years of a bull market, when three out of every four stocks go up. But when the market enters a correction, borrowing money to buy stocks is a bad idea. Three of every four stocks will go down.\n\nYour broker may issue a margin call as the value of your portfolio falls below a predetermined level. A margin call requires the investor to pony up extra cash or sell shares to cover losses.\n\nThe best thing you can do when a margin call occurs is to sell your stocks right away. Don't send good money after bad in the hope that your stock will rebound.\n\n\"You should never invest on margin unless you're willing to cut all your losses quickly. Otherwise, you could go belly-up in no time,\" O'Neil wrote.\n\nHe adds that it's even more important to cut losses if your portfolio consists mostly of fast movers, and that includes tech stocks, which are generally two to three times more volatile than average"

      "text": "For many stock traders, options trading is still shrouded in mist. They consider it to be a very dangerous form of trading which should be avoided at all costs. Nothing could be further from the truth: once a trader knows what he or she is doing, options trading could in fact be as lucrative as stock trading and more – with a lower degree of risk and a higher degree of flexibility.\n\nAn option is the right, but not the obligation to buy a specific share, currency, commodity or futures contract at the agreed price at a certain future date. A trader can, for example, purchase an option which gives them the right to buy 100 shares of Company X at a certain price (called the strike price) three months from now.\n\nBenefits of options trading\n\nTo buy 100 shares of Company X outright could cost a trader a few thousand dollars. Because options are leveraged, however, he or she can buy an option at a much lower price. This could be as low as 1% of the actual stock price.\n\nBut apart from that, how will options trading benefit a stock trader compared to buying the actual share? This part is quite easy. Let's assume this trader purchased an option to buy 100 shares of Company X for $21 three months from now.\n\nIf the share price should rise to $26 by that time, the trader will get the full benefit of the price movement, i.e. $5 x 100 shares = $500 – without actually ever owning the stock. Remember there is no obligation to exercise the option: at expiry the option price will reflect the price increase of the share, so a full profit will be made.\n\nIf the price of Company X shares should close below the strike price of $21 three months from now, even if it drops to $10, the options trader can never lose more than the amount initially paid for the option.\n\nCalls and Puts\n\nThe example we quoted above is that of a so-called call option. Someone should buy one of these if they expect the price of the underlying asset (share, commodity etc.) to go up between now and the expiry date.\n\nBut the incredible flexibility of options trading also allows a trader to benefit when the price of the underlying asset goes down. This is called a put option. Don't let it become confusing – it works in exactly the same way as a call option, except that the trader will benefit if the asset price moves below the strike price.\n\nAs with call options, when someone buys a put option, he or she can never lose more than the initial price that was paid for the option. This is called the premium of the option.\n\nProfit and loss scenarios\n\nA picture is often worth a thousand words they say. Below are the profit and loss scenarios if a trader buys call or put options. Note the limited loss if the price doesn't go where it is expected to go and the unlimited profit if it does.\n\nConclusion\n\nOptions trading can become much more involved than the examples given above, but once the trader understand the basics the learning curve is not so steep. There are even option trading strategies to benefit from a completely stagnant market, but more about that later.\n\nGold provides investors with an active options market, which allows them to trade gold using multiple strategies beyond directional movements. Options are available on gold futures on exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, spot gold in the over the counter market and gold ETFs on the Chicago Board of Options Exchange. There are two [...]\n\nWhen a trader obtains a call option, that trader has the right to purchase the underlying asset at the strike price on the expiration day. The buyer of a put option in turn has the right to sell an underlying asset at the strike price when the expiration day arrives. In both cases the buyer [...]\n\nAny trader who has been in a stock, FX or commodity trade knows how disheartening it becomes if one was of the opinion that the trading instrument would go in a certain direction and it turns around right after the trade is made and heads in the opposite direction.

Before the Internet, the only way for a trader to buy or sell trading assets was to ask a broker to execute the trade on his or her behalf. This usually happened over the phone. Understandably [...]\n\nWhile there are vital differences between options trading and trading in stocks, forex orfutures, there are also some similarities. One of them is that you should not simply enter anoptions trade without even a cursory glance at the price chart for the underlying asset. Timingyour entry using price charts can prevent costly mistakes. The type [...]\n\nThose unfamiliar with options trading often have a totally skewed perception when it comesto the risks involved with this type of trading.

As we will see below, both [...]\n\nIn the options world there exists two different exercise styles. These are called Americanoptions and European Options. The main difference between the two is that American optionscan be exercised before the expiration date, while European options can only be exercised atthe expiration date.

In this context a volatile market is where a sharp price increase or decreaseis expected. Typical examples of such a situation is just before publication of financialstatements, major news releases or court cases. Backspreads are able to profit whether the market [...]\n\nIntroduction At any given moment during its lifetime, an option is either In the Money (ITM), At the Money(ATM) or Out of the Money (OTM). An In the Money option is therefore only one of the 3options 'moneyness' states.

      "text": "The only proposition I hate about daytrading is that you never ever let a good trade ride.\n\nYou can definitely let a good trade ride while day trading and you can press the pedal to the metal. SteveH trades this way and explains that you can start with low initial risk and leverage your gains to ride a well-defined trending move intraday:\n\nQuote from SteveH:\n\nWhat you never emotionally want to do in the markets works best: ADD in strong trends. On the CL, on a DAY TRADE with a 5 min chart, using only 1 contract positions where your highest initial capital risk of loss is $150-$200, you can accumulate a 4-10 contract position spanning from 1 to 2.5 pts which can yield $2500 - $10,000 (within 30 mins to 3 hours exposure). You get 1-3 opportunities per day for these kinds of rewards. They're obvious moves with no more than a 20 ema to give you a point of reference.\n\nThe few traders I know of who can make single-trade killings every so often are doing so with options (simple buy side, no hedging) on something like the QQQ (60/40 tax split, just like regulated futures contracts, btw). When they expect a big move is coming up, they'll load up with like 300-700 contracts with an avg cost no greater than $1 per option ($100, of course). So that's roughly a 30K-70K position where the expectation is a 3x-5x gain.\n\nOne of the guys I follow in a forum made 700K on QQQ options positions in the flash crash incident in Spring 2010. He regularly makes 50K to 100K on the bigger QQQ option swing trades where he has around 20K-30K at risk.\n\nIronically, they are scared to death of the futures markets because it's a different mindset to them (unlimited losses due to marging reqs. vs. the option bet itself being the ultimate stop-loss upfront).Extraordinary thing to watch unfold. If you're at that level of the game, a QQQ or SPY option swing trader, it probably trumps day trading in the futures market. You get the 60/40 tax benefit, more leverage possible with less cash involved and you have a limited loss. [The time decay factor in options is not as much of an issue as you would think. They're good enough to peg a move within 1-3 days.]\n\nI mean, can you imagine being emotionally unfazed by 10K-30K 1 trade option losses because you're good enough to produce far many more 20K to 100K wins and you also get about 2-3 huge wins per year (200K-500K)?I can't imagine any successful trader(over 7 or 8 digits) ever considering profits as house money. Sounds more like something Cramer would pitch to the masses."

I never ever took the cash from my account and it is existing still in stock but I did acquire and sell the stocks. Most of the stocks had been not held for less than 6 months.\n\nBest answer:\n\nAnswer by Brieanne No, operating (wages) and investing (capital gains) are two entirely diverse factors. You can trade or invest all you want. You only require to pay unemployment back if you had been operating whilst collecting it. Trading is not the very same as working."

      "text": "Before you get serious about investing in the stock market, it is important to learn as much as you can about this ever-changing and fluctuating business This is why it is vital you determine which stock market style best suits you and your goals.\n\nLearning the popular forms of capital market trading may help you determine your trading style and help you find your own path in the business world, whether you're looking to buy gold at BullionVault or you want to invest in property abroad. There are various types of trading, including Scalping Trading, Swing Trading, Trend Trading and Momentum Trading. Below is a brief definition of each style to help you out.\n\nThe different types of trading are best differentiated by their time frame rather than their techniques. Different techniques are used in different trading styles in order to reap profits.\n\nScalping Trading – This is the term used to describe the method where trades are opened and closed within a very short time scale. This could be anything from a few seconds to a few minutes. This day-trading method sees Scalpers make several trades a day.\n\nMomentum Trading – This is another form of day-trading where the trader takes a long or short position in the stocks with the hope that its momentum will continue in the direction they want. They only take advantage of this trade after seeing an acceleration in a stock's price, earnings or revenue. However, after the momentum slows, the trade is exited.\n\nSwing Trading – This style is normally used by private or home traders. Traders attempt to capture gains in a stock within one to four days. The individual aims to exploit the short-term stock movements without the competition of major traders. Traders tend to focus more on the stock's price trends and patterns rather than their value.\n\nTrend Trading – Here, traders will try holding their commonly for up to a month. After analysing a stock for some time, the trader attempts to gain profits by following the asset's momentum in a particular direction.\n\nThe runaway success of its iPhone and iPad products combined with Steve Jobs careful succession planning is credited for these accomplishments. Basically, the company gave the public what it needs in an easy and even fun to use format.\n\nConsumers flock to Apple's products since they make everyone's life easier, thereby enriching Apple beyond even Steve Jobs wildest dreams.\n\nThis uber success has earned Apple a monster pile of cash. Estimated to be nearly $120 billion, the company has its own subsidiary to manage its hoard of lucre. This subsidiary is named Braeburn Capital and is located in Reno, Nevada. Braeburn is considered the world's largest hedge fund, dwarfing second place Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Fund by $20 billion.\n\n\"Wow, this is great information!\", was my first thought. \"All I need to do is review the 13F filings to find out how this seldom heard of behemoth is investing its money\".\n\nI am a huge proponent of following the big money when it comes to investing and what could be bigger than Braeburn? Well, after much digging and asking around, I found out that Braeburn is not a typical money management company. It doesn't file the expected forms such as 13Fs revealing its holdings. This is because Braeburn only has one investor, Apple. This fact is one reason it can skirt around some of the traditional fund regulations, namely revealing its specific holdings. Obviously, this made my mission much more opaque determining Braeburn's investments.\n\nFortunately, we are not completely in the dark regarding Braeburn's holdings. By studying Apple's 10-K filing in fiscal year 2011 and comparing it to fiscal year 2012, light can be shown on how Apple is investing its massive mountain of cash. While the exact holdings are not revealed, based on what is in the 10k's, it can be extrapolated how investors can follow Apple's secret hedge fund's primary investment themes.\n\nThe first thing to note is that Braeburn has grown from just under $80 billion in assets under management (AUM) to just under $120 billion over the last fiscal year. This is explosive growth no matter how you look at it.\nHowever, it's surprising how they chose to invest the money\n\nHere are the primary investment themes of Braeburn and the best way to replicate these ideas in your portfolio.\n\n1. Corporate Securities\nBraeburn's number one investing theme is corporate securities. The firm holds just over $46 billion of this asset class. Corporate securities are a broad sector. It can be bonds, stocks or derivatives. Braeburn increased its percentage owned of corporate securities by 31.5% from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012. Provided the size of Braeburn, it is likely that they are buying wide swaths of top rated, blue chip stocks and bonds. ETF's such as SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) for tracking equities and Vanguard's Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF (NYSE:VCLT) likely fit this investment theme. It's important to note that these ETF's pay nearly 3% and just over 4% annual dividend yields making them potential candidates for Street Authority's Carla Pasternak's Retirement Savings Stocks.\n\nExtrapolating further, we do know that Steve Jobs was a huge investor in Disney (NYSE:DIS). After his death, Job's $4.6 billion worth of Disney shares were transferred to a trust administered by his wife Laurene Powell Jobs. Obviously, I don't know for certain, but think it can be a safe bet that Braeburn also owns a large number of Disney shares, reflecting the investing spirit of Steve Jobs. The company just raised its annual dividend from $0.60 to $0.75 but it still just yields about 1.5%. Earnings are expected to grow to approximately $3.45 in 2013 and the company's acquisition of comic book powerhouse Marvel has renewed the public's interest in the entertainment giant. Technically, shares just jumped higher to heavy technical resistance at $52.50. This company looks good as a classic daily close break out buy strategy above $52.50.\nCHART\n2. U.S. Treasury Securities\nU.S. treasury securities make up just over 20% of Braeburn's holdings. However, the fund ramped up its investment in U.S. treasury securities by nearly 80% between fiscal year 2011 and 2012. This asset class is secured obligations of the U.S. government. In other words, these securities are government debt. Anyone of the number of U.S. treasury bond ETF's should more or less track Braeburn's holdings. I like PIMCO's 7-15 Year Treasury ETF (NYSE:TENZ) as a proxy for the debt of the U.S. government. The ETF has been uptrending on the weekly chart since April, 2010 but has recently hit technical resistance at $88. It trades very light volume, so be certain to always use limit orders to enter positions. It appears to be a solid pull back entry play right now with support at the 50 week moving average just under $86 per share. Entering now with stops at $84 makes technical investing sense.\nCHART\n\n3. Mutual Funds, Money Market Funds, Commercial Paper\nThe firm doubled its exposure to mutual funds by increasing holdings from just over $1 billion to more than $2 billion. Despite this 100% increase, mutual funds still only account for the third smallest capital allocation. Money market funds and commercial paper account for the smallest and next to smallest allocations.\n\nRisks to Consider\nIt's critical to remember that I am only trying to replicate the overall investing themes of Braeburn. The fund does not reveal its exact holdings and I am only speculating on how investors can replicate its holdings based on the investing themes found in Apple's 10K filing. Always use stops and position size wisely.\n\nAction to Take\n\nETF's make it easy for investors to replicate the themes of the world's largest hedge fund. This fund is dealing with a tremendous amount of capital, forcing it to only invest into macroeconomic themes and the largest companies. Judging by Braeburn's increase in U.S. treasury securities and Corporate securities, I think its a safe bet to say the fund is very bullish on the economic future of America.\n\nOur short call was early, as usual, but after taking a little bit of heat and averaging in one time, the shorts in the DJIA are solidly profitable from an average entry of 13168. The system is indicating an eventual trip down to sub 12000— although there will be short bursts of rallying on the down. This is how the market works, use the upthrusts as shorting opportunities. Holding shorts here for the longer term.\n\nAfter being LONG since January 1. our system has turned BEARISH on the DJIA. It is a full scale, no doubt reversal signal in the DJIA. We have reversed our long positions after booking solid profits and are now SHORT the DJIA e mini contract at 13133. ALL of our data, information and systems have turned bearish on the stock market. Holding shorts here. Good Luck!\n\nThis guy built his house out of shredded euro's. It is said that art imitates life, does this signal that the euro will soon be worthless? Artists are generally the first to key in on radical changes. Time will tell."

Typically, they'll want to know how much a company earns, whether it's in debt, its dividend structure and profit forecasts.\n\nEarnings In order to determine the true value of a market and to better understand the potential movement of its price, fundamental analysts hold earnings in important regard.\n\nIf a company earns more than it originally projected, its market price is likely to rise. Once these earnings figures are released to the public, positions can be opened to take advantage of any uptrend that emerges. Higher earnings figures mean a higher intrinsic value of a market which is of interest to fundamental investors.\n\nIf a country announces higher than expected unemployment figures, market prices typically take a tumble. If a Government announces measures that may affect GDP, spending, interest rates or other economic factors, prices may also make big moves.\n\nFundamental analysts keep thoroughly up to date with broader global commercial events, and often use them in conjunction with basic technical analysis to ensure they're opening the right positions.\n\nUnfortunately, there are times when the market moves against us. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, employ tight risk management and never let your emotions get the better of you when trading CFDs or forex.\n\nCFDs and margined Forex contracts are leveraged products and may result in losses exceeding your initial outlay"

      "text": "The National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) runs the\nNasdaq stock market. Unlike the NYSE or AMEX, Nasdaq lets brokers\ntrade from anywhere in the country electronically. It lists 4,700\ncompanies, and is known for listing smaller businesses that are\njust starting to emerge nationally. However, Nasdaq also lists\nlarger businesses like Microsoft and Intel.\n\nThere are two listings of Nasdaq stocks: the Nasdaq National\nMarket Issues are the largest stocks, for which Nasdaq publishes\ninformation much like that released by the NYSE. One difference\nis that symbols for Nasdaq stocks (for example, Microsoft is\nMSFT) have four or five letters, whereas NYSE and AMEX use\nsymbols of one to three letters.\n\nLet's look at a sample Nasdaq stock listing in the\nNational Market Issues:\n\nThe \"s\" in the margin indicates that the stock has\nsplit, meaning that there are now twice as many shares as before.\nIf you previously owned 100 shares, now you will own 200. The\nnext two numbers are the highest price and the lowest price of a\nshare over the past year. The reason the high price is so much\ngreater than the low and the current price is because of the\nsplit.\n\nNext is the name of the stock (in this case, just a fictional\ncompany called SomeName), then its symbol (SMNM). The next number\nis the dividends paid by the stock: 36 cents per share. For\nexample, if you owned 100 shares, you would receive $36 from the\ncompany. Dividends are a way for stockowners to share in the\nprofits of a company without selling their stock. Stocks will\noften have two varieties: common stock (which does not pay\ndividends), and preferred stock (which does). The dividend listed\nis simply the estimated annual amount of the dividend.\n\nAfter the dividend, percentage yield is listed. Percentage\nyield measures the relative amount of the dividend, compared to\nthe overall price of the stock. This stock closed at $27¾, or\n$27.75, so the percentage yield is simply the ratio of $0.36 to\n$27.75. The next value is the price/earnings ratio. It shows the\nratio between a stock's price by the earnings per share made\nby the company in the past year. In this case, the stock's\nprice is $27.75, and the P/E ratio is 12, so the earnings per\nshare in the last four quarters must be $27.75/12, or $2.3125.\nAlthough the P/E is not a guarantee of earnings, it does provide\na way to measure which companies have earned more over the last\nyear. A low P/E ratio implies high earnings.\n\nFollowing the price/earnings ratio, you'll find the\nvolume (in hundreds) or shares traded the previous day. If you\nsee a \"Z\" in this column, do not multiply by\n100. The number listed will be the actual number of shares\ntraded. If you see the stock underlined, it means that some new\ninformation has been released about the company, and the volume\ntraded will be unusually large.\n\nThe next three numbers tell the highest and lowest price the\nstock sold at the previous day, and the price of a share at the\nend of the day. The final column is the net change, which tells\nyou how the stock's price at the end of the previous day\ncompares to the stock's price at the beginning of the\nprevious day.\n\nThe other listing Nasdaq releases is the Nasdaq Small-cap\nIssues. These are the smaller companies Nasdaq is known for.\nFor these companies, the name, dividends, volume traded, closing\nprice, and the net change are the only values listed. Most of\nthese companies are too new to have records over the past year,\nsuch as a P/E ratio.\n\nLike the NYSE and AMEX markets, stocks must meet certain\nrequirements to be traded on the Nasdaq market. They must have an\nincome of $750,000 before taxesor shares totaling\none million dollars. Also, the shares must be distributed over at\nleast 400 owners, and the company must have assets totaling 4\nmillion dollars.\n\nIf a company cannot meet the requirements for one of the major\nmarkets, their stocks are considered \"OTC\", or\nover-the-counter stocks. These are the smallest, newest\ncompanies. They also outnumber the stocks traded on the other\nmarkets. There are almost 30,000 OTC stocks, compared to a total\nof about 7600 on the NYSE, AMEX, and Nasdaq markets."

      "text": "StatsTrade Robot-Analysts\n\nThere are various beliefs and approaches when it comes to analyzing the markets.\n\nSome, like our friend Nate below, believe in the power of Technical Analysis methods. Others, like Fred, give more weight to the fundamental profiles of the companies involved. Another approach (like Richard's, below) is to take into account external data for the analysis work: News reports, search engine queries, relevant twitter updates, and more unique data types.\n\nStatsTrade employs several robot-analysts to represent each of the approaches. Each robot-analyst has always been using the cutting edge technologies in his field, producing insightful Insights on the markets.\n\nEventually, the analysis results of all approaches can assist the enthusiast researcher, and help to shed more light on the market's behavior. Read on about each of the approaches below, as viewed by their corresponding leader.\n\nNate\n\nNate is a strong believer of the power of Technical Analysis methods. He uses standard indicators such as Moving Averages, MACD, RSI, Stochastic Oscillators together with some proprietary StatsTrade indicators. Nate then trains a few statistical learning algorithms, and lets them compete with each other. The best algorithm to suit the general trends in the market, as well as the specific (technical) events related to the company is honored to finally report as \"Nate's analysis results\". As of 2012, StatsTrade offers free access to Nate's analysis results in a daily Free Newsletter.\nThis is how Nate sees the world:\n\nTechnical methods always succeed in identifying the directions of the short-term trends (although after a relatively short delay). That's no belief, but a simple implication of their definition.\nAs long as traders all over the world continue to stare at graphs while making trading decisions, there's room for Technical Analysis. Maybe they're not enough to identify longer-term trends, but in some cases they might identify the longer-term behavior of those technical traders — and this may be just enough. According to StatsTrade studies, there exists a strong relation between the number of traders in a specific company who follow technical methods and the success of my approach.\n\n– Nate\n\nFred\n\nFred, as opposed to Nate, attempts to come up with his own valuation of the intrinsic value of a company. Fred closely monitors the fundamental profiles of companies, and gets really excited in the earnings season.\nAt first read, he might not understand all the numbers in a financial statement. Naturally, the more 'explicit' figures such as P/E ratio or dividend yield are given a special treatment and studied with comparison to the industry and past performance.\nAs for the rest of the fundamental numbers: The bad news are that Fred doesn't have a human judgement of his own. He can't for example decide whether some non-recurring income should have a dramatic affect on the valuation of the company stock. The goods news are that Fred is good in math (and some special statistical learning methods), and always eager to learn from human experts. There are a lot of human analysts out there who publish their estimations based on the same numbers with whom Fred is already acquainted. Fred keeps track of their records, and tries to mimic the way their valuations are produced. The more human analysts show interest in a stock, the easier it gets for Fred to learn from their work, and extrapolate for similar companies in the field.\nHere's what Fred has to say:\n\nI like doing things I understand, and I don't like being a part of the herd of technical traders. Nate and his friends are too naive. You know how they (the Technical traders) always say that the stock price should reflect its intrinsic value? That the forces of the market will make it so? Well, here's the catch: If such forces exist, they can't all be technical…\nThat said, my final analysis results always combine some mixture of technical and fundamental methods, tuned to the company and context. For example, whenever there are no good analysts following the stock, or when my valuation confidence is low, I turn to give more weight to technical methods.\n\n– Fred\n\nRichard\n\nRichard plays by other rules.\n\nI'm not allowed yet to share my beliefs with the general public. As of 2012, my insights are shared directly and exclusively only with StatsTrade employees and Partners."

      "text": "Understanding the Impact of High Frequency Trading in Forex\n\nEach day, billions of monetary units are exchanged on the foreign exchange currency market. FX trading is used to determine currency exchange rates across the world. While people have been trading currencies for thousands of years, modern technology has changed the way that many banks and individual investors do business. The following guide explores how high frequency trading (HFT) has impacted FX trading.\n\nIt can be extremely challenging to earn a profit when trading currency. In many cases, investors can lose significant sums of money. Exchange rates can be impacted by a variety of factors. This can include economic conditions, politics, weather, shipping conditions, piracy, technology advances and more.\n\nMany investors use tools that enable trading through technical analysis. Technical analysis looks at how historical exchange rates can impact future exchange rates. In some cases, certain patterns can predict future price movements. Using specialized algorithms, computer programs can be used to forecast the direction of a currency movement.\n\nIn addition, computers can be used to automatically trade currency. While lots of early trading programs would execute only a few trades a day, modern programs are designed to complete a significantly larger number of trades. In some cases, programs can execute millions of unique trades every day.\n\nMany HFT programs are installed in specialized data centres located near an exchange. Since the speed of execution is limited by the speed of light, many programmers and investors try to minimize the amount of time it takes for an order to be executed. This is possible by minimizing the amount of time it takes data to travel between a data farm and an exchange.\n\nMost HFT programs are designed to profit from very small price differences in a currency. In many cases, a program will make a profit of only a few cents per trade. However, millions of these types of trades every day can yield a significant profit.\n\nThere are several significant risks when running a HFT program. While many of the world's best programmers work in HFT, it's possible for there to be many potential problems. For example, trade execution errors and delays can cause price instability in an exchange rate.\n\nFor example, the stock market experienced a flash crash in 2010. During this flash crash, automated HFT trading tools sold large quantities of stock. In seconds, many of the world's top stocks dropped significantly in value. This caused large financial losses around the globe.\n\nAbout TradeTech FX:\n\nTradeTech FX will specifically focus on electronic trading and the execution of FX spot, futures & options. The two first main conference days will include big picture plenary panels and keynote presentations The afternoons will be divided into 2 streams on trading platforms & trading technology and market structure & regulation."

      "text": "Dec 17, 2010\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Our flawed understanding of how decisions in the present restrict our options in the future means that we may underestimate the risk associated with investment decisions, according to new research by Dr Ole Peters from Imperial College London. The research, published today in the journal Quantitative Finance, suggests how policy makers might reshape financial risk controls to reduce market instability and the risk of market collapse.\n\nInvestors know that there are myriad possibilities for how a financial market might develop. Before making an investment, they try to capture these possibilities in a single number to represent likely market performance. They can do this in one of two ways: 'ensemble averaging,' which runs possible scenarios in parallel, or 'time averaging,' which runs scenarios in sequence.\n\nThe ensemble average is the most commonly used approach. It is based on imagining multiple scenarios that all begin from the same starting conditions, and then averaging their outcomes. The alternative, time averaging, imagines all possible scenarios playing out over time.\n\nAs we live on a timeline, previous decisions cannot be undone as time passes. Any new decision constrains our choices when making subsequent ones. Time averaging provides the more accurate prediction for the real world outcome of an investment decision.\n\nToday's study shows that, in the investment world, the differences in the results from these two approaches are critical: time averaging inherently incorporates a measure of risk, but ensemble averaging does not.\n\nThis means that ensemble averaging consistently undervalues risk by underestimating the effects of time on investments and overestimating the degree of choice that investors have. It also encourages excessive leveraging of investments, which itself accentuates fluctuations in the market, increases market volatility, and imparts a negative drift in the market that helps drive investors into negative equity.\n\n\"In the investment world, ensemble and time averages give different results, with ensemble averages systemically ignoring the effects of fluctuations,\" said Dr Ole Peters, author of the study from the Department of Mathematics and Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London. \"If investors routinely used time averages, it would help to avoid scenarios such as the excessive leveraging of investments that contributes to market instability and the likelihood of market collapse.\"\n\nThe recent financial crisis clearly shows the effects of excessive leveraging used both between banks, and between banks and their borrowers. Investors using time averaging to calculate risk would require a good reason to exceed a leverage factor of 1. Leverage factors of 40-60, as used by some banks before the crisis, would ring alarm bells. Thus, time averaging could provide policy makers and regulators with an indication of the kind of ratios that we should expect in a healthy, robust investment market.\n\n\"Too often, investors behave as if they had access to different scenarios playing out in parallel universes whose outcomes they combine and average,\" explained Dr Peters. \"This misleadingly encourages them to think they have more choice and face less risk than is actually the case. In reality, we are stuck in one universe and, as a consequence, time has a bigger effect on investment risk than we imagine.\"\n\n\"Finding more accurate ways to predict and manage risk will improve the way we prepare for and respond to extreme events, and will help our consideration of future risks due to a changing climate,\" said Professor Sir Brian Hoskins, Director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London. \"In the wake of the financial crisis we are all aware of the fragility of the investment markets. This new research helps us understand why excessive risk-taking happens, how it destabilises the markets, and how regulators might better monitor and manage markets in the future\".\n\nRelated Stories\n\nAs the U.S. economy continues to lag, many investors remain wary about taking risks with the stock market.

      "text": "Related Topics\n\nWhen you buy stocks it is very important to understand the nasdaq stock market.\n\nThe NASDAQ Stock Market\n\nThe NASDAQ Stock Market, known as NASDAQ, is an American stock exchange. \"NASDAQ\" originally stood for \"National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations,\" but the exchange's official stance is that the acronym is obsolete. It is the largest electronic screen-based equity securities trading market in the United States. With approximately 3,700 companies and corporations, it has more trading volume than any other stock exchange in the world.\n\nHistory\n\nIt was founded in 1971 by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), who divested themselves of it in a series of sales in 2000 and 2001. It is owned and operated by the NASDAQ OMX Group, the stock of which was listed on its own stock exchange beginning July 2, 2002, under the ticker symbol , and is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission\n\nWith the completed purchase of the Nordic-based operated exchange OMX, following its agreement with Borse Dubai, NASDAQ is poised to capture 67% of the controlling stake in the aforementioned exchange, thereby inching ever closer to taking over the company and creating a trans-atlantic powerhouse.\n\nThe group, now known as Nasdaq-OMX, controls and operates the NASDAQ stock exchange in New York City -- the second largest exchange in the United States. It also operates eight stock exchanges in Europe and holds one-third of the Dubai Stock Exchange. It has a double-listing agreement with OMX, and will compete with NYSE Euronext group in attracting new listings.\n\nWhen the NASDAQ stock exchange began trading on February 8, 1971, the NASDAQ was the world's first electronic stock market. At first, it was merely a computer bulletin board system and did not actually connect buyers and sellers. The NASDAQ helped lower the spread (the difference between the bid price and the ask price of the stock) but somewhat paradoxically was unpopular among brokerages because they made much of their money on the spread.\n\nNASDAQ was the successor to the over-the-counter (OTC) and the \"Curb Exchange\" systems of trading. As late as 1987, the NASDAQ exchange was still commonly referred to as the OTC in media and also in the monthly Stock Guides issued by Standard & Poor's Corporation.\n\nOver the years, NASDAQ became more of a stock market by adding trade and volume reporting and automated trading systems. NASDAQ was also the first stock market in the United States to advertise to the general public, highlighting NASDAQ-traded companies (usually in technology) and closing with the declaration that NASDAQ is \"the stock market for the next hundred years.\" Its main index is the NASDAQ Composite, which has been published since its inception. However, its exchange-traded fund tracks the large-cap NASDAQ-100 index, which was introduced in 1985 alongside the NASDAQ 100 Financial Index.\n\nUntil 1987, most trading occurred via the telephone, but during the October 1987 stock market crash, market makers often didn't answer their phones. To counteract this, the Small Order Execution System (SOES) was established, which provides an electronic method for dealers to enter their trades. NASDAQ requires market makers to honor trades over SOES.\n\nIn 1992, it joined with the London Stock Exchange to form the first intercontinental linkage of securities markets. NASDAQ's 1998 merger with the American Stock Exchange formed the NASDAQ-Amex Market Group, and by the beginning of the 21st century it had become the largest electronic stock market (in terms of both dollar value and share volume) in the United States. NASD spun off NASDAQ in 2000 to form a publicly traded company, the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc.\n\nOn November 8, 2007, NASDAQ bought the Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX) for US$652,000,000. PHLX is the oldest stock exchange in America—having been in operation since 1790.\n\nTo qualify for listing on the exchange, a company must be registered with the SEC, have at least three market makers (financial firms that act as brokers or dealers for specific securities), and meet minimum requirements for assets, capital, public shares, and shareholders.\n\nQuote availability\n\nNASDAQ quotes are available at three levels:\n\nLevel 1 shows the highest bid and lowest offer — the inside quote.\n\nLevel 2 shows all public quotes of market makers together with information of market makers wishing to sell or buy stock and recently executed orders.\n\nLevel 3 is used by the market makers and allows them to enter their quotes and execute orders.\n\nTrading schedule\n\nNASDAQ has a pre-market session from 7:00am to 9:30am, a normal trading session from 9:30am to 4:00pm and a post-market session from 4:00pm to 8:00pm (all times in EST).\n\nIndices\n\nNASDAQ-100\n\nNASDAQ Biotechnology Index\n\nNASDAQ Composite\n\nNASDAQ Bank\n\nMarkets\n\nNASDAQ Capital Market\n\nNASDAQ Global Market\n\nNASDAQ Global Select Market\n\nNASDAQ PORTAL Market\n\nNASDAQ,Companies based in New York City,Companies established in 1971,Economy of New York City,Economy of the United States,Stock exchanges in the United States,Private equity portfolio companies,Electronic trading systems,Silver Lake Partners"

I'm not talking necessarily about one-day bumps, but general upward and downward trends – bull markets and bear markets.\n\nMarket Direction\n\nFor this reason, it's important to have an idea what the general trend of the market seems to be and what the market is telling us about future trends.\n\nYou can get a good idea of where the market is headed with just two pieces of information: Price and volume. When you put these two together, you get a picture that tells whether there are more sellers in the market or buyers.\n\nVolume tells you whether there is movement in the market and price tells you which direction.\n\nWe use the big three indicators: the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, to provide one of the indicators – price - to help us decide whether the market is going to continue its current trend or trying to reverse course. For more information on these leading market indexes, see this article.\n\nVolume Indicator\n\nThe volume indicator comes from the daily sales volume. Both of these indicators are available online from many different sites including: Yahoo! Finance.\n\nIf the market has a high-volume day and prices (of the indexes) are up, you are probably looking at mutual funds and institutional investors buying, which is a sign of an up market trend.\n\nOn the other hand, a high-volume day with lower prices could mean a downward trend with the big players backing out of the market.\n\nYou need to use some common sense when watching these indicators. For example, if you have three or four days of high volume and rising prices, it is not unusual to hit a high-volume day where the prices fall off.\n\nYou'll usually hear the talking heads on television refer to this as \"profit taking.\"\n\nChange Coming\n\nIf you begin to see the down days too frequently in a market that has been moving up, it may be a sign that it is about to reverse course or stall.\n\nMutual funds and institutional investors are the volume buyers and sellers that move the market. When they began moving in a direction, that's where the market goes and you can see it in the price and volume numbers.\n\nA market that shows sharp price movements in either direction without corresponding volume increases is sending false messages that should be watched carefully.\n\nWhat does this mean to you? Don't swim upstream. The obvious forces of supply and demand (except when something extraordinary occurs) drive the market. When there are more buyers (higher prices on higher volume) than sellers, the market is trending up.\n\nWhen there are more sellers (lower prices on higher volume) than buyers, the market is trending down.\n\nWatch for signs that the market is changing course (different price and volume than the prevailing trend), if you see more than a few of these, prepare for a change.\n\nConclusion\n\nReading the market from one day to the next may not be helpful, but you can watch the general direction of the market and with some study spot the warning signs that a change is coming."

      "text": "Forex Trading Basics\n\nIf you are interested in getting started with Forex trading, here are some basics you should know before getting started.\n\nFirst, Forex stands for Foreign Exchange Market, which is where currencies are traded. All currencies traded on the market are traded in pairs, for example a US Dollar for a Japanese Yen.\n\nThe Language\n\nIn currency pairs, the base currency is the first currency, and the quote currency is the second currency. So, in the above example, USD would be the base currency, and the Yen the quote currency. For example, USD/JPY = 77.50 would mean that one USD would buy 77.5 Japanese Yen.\n\nThe minimum rate at which currencies fluctuate is called a pip or point – which is 0.01 for the JPY, and 0.0001 for all other currencies.\n\nHow To Buy or Sell\n\nWhen you go to buy or sell currency pairs, you will a bid and ask price.\n\nThe bid price is the rate at which you can sell the base currency and buy the quote currency (in the example above it would be selling the USD and buying the JPY).\n\nThe ask price (or offer price) is the rate at which you can buy the base currency and sell the quote currency.\n\nThe spread is the difference between these prices.\n\nYou may see a currency rate as well, which is the value of one currency expressed in terms of the other currency (such as the exchange rate). This rate depends on a variety of factors, including supply and demand or operations by the government or central bank.\n\nFinally, you have a lot size. In most currency pairs, 1 lot is 100,000 units of a base currency.\n\nPractice Makes Perfect\n\nThe terms of Forex trading are very different from standard trading, and as such, you should look for a platform, such as the Alpari Metatrader Platform, which allows you to practice trading all of the features of Forex without using real money.\n\nBy doing this, you can hone your strategies safely, and then proceed to real trading once you are comfortable. This can save you for losing big from the start.\n\nphoto credit: flickr – bradipo\n\nGet free update via email:\n\nStay in touch with Joe and see how he handles Retiring by 40 and being a stay at home dad."

      "text": "The basics of technical analysis of the Japanese candlesticks\n\nThe shapes of fractured candlesticks\n\nThis shape is a special case of the \"Three Black Crows\" shape discussed earlier. The difference is that the second and third black bars open at or near the closing level of the previous bar.\n\nThe rules of definition\n\nThree long black days resemble steps down.\n\nNext day starts near the closing of the previous day.\n\nScenarios and psychology behind the shape\n\nThis shape is similar to a panic selling, which should trigger an additional downward movement. The closing of each day establishes a mark for the opening prices for the next trading day. This shape shows a complete lack of interest of the buyers.\n\nThe flexibility of the shape\n\nSince this shape is a special version of the \"Three Black Crows\" shape, there is virtually no flexibility.\n\nThe shape's fracture\n\nAs the \"Three Black Crows\" shape, the \"Three Identical Black Crows\" shape transforms into a long black candlestick. It fully supports a bearish tendency of this shape.\n\n«BREAKTHROUGH»\n\nA bovine \"Breakthrough\"\n\nA bearish \"Breakthrough\"\n\nComments\n\nA confirmation is recommended, especially for a bearish \"Breakthrough\" shape.\n\nA bovine \"Breakthrough\"\n\nA bovine \"Breakthrough\" shape occurs at the lower trend and indicates the acceleration of the sales to a potential oversold situation. The shape begins with a long black day, followed by another black day which body makes a downward jump. After the downward jump, the next three days set consistently lower prices. All the days of this shape are black, with the exception of the third day, which can be either black or white. Three days after the jump are similar to the \"Three Black Crows\" shape in a way that their top and bottom are consistently below. The last day completely crosses out small black days and closes within a jump between the first and second day.\n\nA bearish \"Breakthrough\"\n\nA bearish \"Breakthrough\" shape includes a jump in the direction of the trend, followed by three consecutive days with a higher price. In an uptrend, a long white day is being formed. The next day, prices make an upward jump to form another white day. This is followed by two days, which set higher prices. The color of the days should be white only with one exception: the third day of the shape or the second day after the jump, can be either black or white, until the new top price is defined (formed). The bottom prices set three days after the jump, should also be higher than each bottom price of the previous day. The meaning of this shape is that the prices have risen in the direction of the trend and an overbought situation develops. The last day sets the trend's fracture, closing within the jump of the first and second days.\n\nThe rules of definition\n\nThe first bar is long, has a color, and makes a jump in the direction of the trend.\n\nThe second bar has the same color and the body, makes a jump in the direction of the trend.\n\nIn the third and forth bars, the trend's direction is kept, with consistent higher closings in the direction of the trend.\n\nThe fifth bar has a long body and an opposite color; it closes within the jump, triggered by the first and second bars.\n\nScenarios and psychology behind the shape\n\nIt is important to understand what this shape does: the trend has increased with a big jump, and then begins to pull back, but is still moving in the same direction. The trend's worsening is quite clearly seen in this shape. Finally, a break in the opposite direction completely catches the price's action of the previous three days. The fracture provokes the fact that the jump has not been filled. A short fracture has occurred.\n\nThe flexibility of the shape\n\nSince the shape is rather complicated, it is difficult to consider its flexibility. As long as the general position is kept, this shape can offer some flexibility. More than three days may pass after the jump, until the last day will be closed within the initial jump. The presence of at least two days is also possible after the jump.\n\nThe shape's fracture\n\nA bovine \"Breakthrough\" shape transforms into a possible \"Hammer\" shape. A situation is possible when the second day jump is high and is followed by a significantly lower price on the third and forth days. This surely supports the shape.\n\nA bearish \"Breakthrough\" shape transforms into a long candlestick with a white body by the lower end of the range. There are chances that this candlestick will not be a \"Shooting Star\" due to a large space on the second day and higher prices following it. This means that a bearish \"Breakthrough\" requires a further confirmation before the sale's start.\n\n«TWO CROWS»\n\nComments\n\nA bearish shape of fracture. A confirmation is required.\n\nThis shape is only good for the upper fracture or a bearish shape. The upper trend is supported by a long white bar. The next bar makes a much higher jump, but closes near its bottom, which is still above the body of the first candlestick. The next (third) bar opens within the second black body, followed by sale into the body of the first bar. This closes the jump and gives us a shape similar to the \"Dark Clouds Curtain\", as if the last two days of the \"Two Crows\" shape were combined into a single candlestick. The fact that this jump was completed so quickly, eliminates the traditional gap analysis, which would have indicated the trend's continuation.\n\nThe rules of definition\n\nThe trend continues to be a long white day.\n\nThe second day makes an upward jump and is a black day.\n\nThe third day is also black.\n\nThe third day opens within the body of the second day and closes within the body of the first day.\n\nScenarios and psychology behind the shape\n\nThe market had a stretched upward movement. A jump followed by a lower closing of the second day shows that a weakness has occurred in the increase. The third day opens higher, but not above the opening of the previous day, and then a sale starts. This sale closes far in the body of the first day. This action fills the jump right after the second day. A bovine tendency rapidly disappears.\n\nThe flexibility of the shape\n\nThe \"Two Crows\" shape is a bit more bearish than the \"Two Ascending Crows.\" The third day is a long black day, which should close only inside the body of the first day. The longer this black day is, the lower it will close on the first day, and the more bearish tendency this shape has.\n\nThe shape's fracture\n\nThe \"Two Crows\" shape transforms into a possible \"Shooting Star\" shape. This supports a bearish tendency of the \"Two Crows\" shape."

The most widely used benchmark is what is called the Volume Weighted Average Price of a stock. The \"VWAP\" is calculated by multiplying the price against the shares in every transaction in a stock, then adding them all up, then dividing by the total number of shares traded that day. If the average price of a firm's trades is better than the average weighted price, then it is considered a good trade.\n\nWhat's next? Algos that will already be inferring what's inside a trader's head, said Marques.\n\n\"Rather than giving mechanical instructions such as 'go buy 10,000 shares by time-slicing it every 15 seconds, 300 shares at a time,' we may see a future situation where the trader is able to communicate to the machine and say, my portfolio objective is to minimize my implementation costs and given my horizon, I'd like to be relatively aggressive.\"\n\nWith the right formulas, a company's trading systems will spot opportunities and act on them, with the prior approval of trading managers.\n\nA basic example is pairs trading, said Jamil Nazarali, senior managing director and Global Head of the Electronic Trading Group for Knight Capital Group, which provides market access and trade execution services to buy- and sell-side firms.\n\nIn this tactic, traders find two securities, often rivals, where their daily price movements are very similar because they face very similar conditions. The trick is to act when the correlation weakens and one price moves up while the other moves down.\n\nAn algorithm, Nazarali notes, can fairly reliably be built that can make the correct buy and sell orders when the two stocks are moving apart and profiting from those moves by the time the prices converge again, to their traditional correlation.\n\nThen there are \"genetic\" algorithms which evolve over time toward better solutions to trading in stocks or other financial instruments. These are often considered forms of artificial intelligence, where computer coding tries to replicate the thinking process of the human brain.\n\nThe approach has not made huge approaches onto Wall Street. But Adam Afshar, the president of Hyde Park Global Investments in Atlanta, employs no analysts, portfolio managers or traders to identify arbitrage opportunities and price discrepancies. He relies solely on a robotic trading system to carry out instructions – and figure out how to improve trading strategies in the process.\n\nWhat's more imminent are predictive algorithms, according to DePetris, the COO of Portware. Thease are formulas that take past history and project what while happen, at some point in the future.\n\nThey can also act as the kind of \"recommendation engine,'' that Amazon has popularized with its sales of books and other merchandise. Its algorithms set up possible choices that can be made in a given situation that it thinks is appropriate, but leaves the final choice up to the human on the other side of the screen."

In response to prompting from readers, this column is devoted to a more in-depth discussion of this unique type of chart. [Go to the AAII Journal area of  for a link to the original article.]\n\nShare this article\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nE-mail\n\nSeekingAlpha\n\nStumbleupon\n\nDelicious\n\nLinkedIn\n\nAbout the author\n\nequivolume Charting\n\nTechnical analysis deals with two pieces of information—price and volume—in an effort to predict and measure future price movements. Traditionally, volume has been more of an afterthought, often placed at the bottom of the price chart. Price has garnered most of the attention, with an emphasis on the change in price.\n\nEquivolume charting, however, places just as much emphasis on volume—if not more—as on price. Furthermore, instead of focusing on price changes, equivolume places more emphasis on price ranges.\n\nTraditional charts, such as line, bar, and candlestick charts, use time on the horizontal axis. Equivolume charts, however, combine price and volume in a two-dimensional box, with the horizontal axis representing the relative trading volume. Equal distances on the horizontal axis for an equivolume chart translate into equal trading volume. The wider the rectangle, the greater the trading volume. Each box represents a trading period.\n\nWe've been helping investors for over 30 years.

(retail traders)\n\nTo hedge against price fluctuations (farmers, manufacturers etc)\n\nA futures contract (commodities trading) is similar to an options contract. What a futures contract entails is a contract between two parties for a set price on a standardized quantity of a certain asset which is agreed upon and then actually carried out using the contract at a later date. A futures contract normally comes with an obligation to actually carry out the futures contract (commodities trading) before the expiration of the contract. An options contract leaves no obligation. They're both long and short futures contracts depending on the agreement which is made between the buyer and the seller of the assets.\n\nUsually when it comes to futures contracts (commodities trading) the investor has to post a performance bond which is insurance that they are going to carry out the futures contract. Usually a bond is between five and 15% of the contract value. Bonds can be waived in some cases depending on the agreement that's made between the buyer and the seller, but generally bonds make it quite difficult to make a direct profit off of the futures contract over the short term.\n\nFutures contracts (commodities trading) are normally traded in order to get a better deal on commodities. Or to be traded later on as future contracts themselves to people who will be interested in these commodities during volatile market stages. The person is able to collect a good deal on a future and carry it through to purchase the commodities that they need for their business, it is possible for trader to save money in the future when commodities experience volatile prices are high raises the prices. As well from a trader's perspective simply buying and selling the futures contracts to people who require the commodities during a time when the market is up, can have the making of healthy profit just by making the futures contract at the right time.\n\nStudying the market and always being sure of what commodities are trading at while the trader to make educated decisions on when to trade futures and what the best price for a futures contract is. There are a number of ways in which people can start making futures contracts (commodities trading) and actually trading futures.\n\nIf you're new to trading futures it is probably best to start by talking to a trading professional or broker that specializes in trading futures. From there you'll be able to know exactly what the best future investments are and what commodities markets are the best to look at. Whether you decide to go through a broker or decide that online trading is best for you is entirely up to how much risk you want to put into your trading. While trading online can result in better profits and not having to pay a fee for brokerage, most of the responsibility for doing research and actually trading futures at the right moment falls on the shoulders of the traitor and not on a broker. Each side has its own benefits.\n\nAs worldwide markets will always need commodity trading futures contracts (commodities trading) will continue to be in place. The stand is one of the best ways to invest and if a trader is able to get in on a great contract they will see a healthy profit.\n\nCommodities Trading Benefits:\n\nExcellent market liquidity on all major contracts, as well as tight spreads\n\nTrade well over 450 instruments on live market prices from over 15 exchanges around the world\n\nTrade Currencies, Oil, Gold and Energies\n\nOnline Futures trading with Spectrum Live opens up the world's major markets, from Chicago to Singapore, at low commission rates.

I'm doing this by placing some orders and modifying them multiple times.\n\nanother way to accomplish this is to provide a section in the site where the myfxbook users can share this.

      "text": "Basic Strategies\n\nThe versatility of index options stems from the variety of strategies available to the investor. The most basic uses of index options are explained in the following examples. These examples are based on hypothetical situations and should only be considered as examples of potential trading approaches. Other strategies that might be used with equity options, such as spreads and straddles, can be employed with index options. For more detailed explanations, contact your brokerage firm or the exchanges where index options are traded.\n\nNote: For purposes of illustration, commission and transaction costs, tax considerations and the costs involved in margin accounts have been omitted from this example. These factors will affect a strategy's potential outcome, so always check with your brokerage firm and tax advisor before entering into any of these strategies. For illustrative purposes, the index option positions in all of the following examples are shown to be held until expiration. The premiums are intended to be reasonable, but in reality will not necessarily exist at or prior to expiration for a similar option.\n\nStrategy 1 - Buying Index Calls\n\nGoal: Positioning to profit from an increase in the level of the underlying index\n\nYou are anticipating an advance in the broad market or market sector measured by the underlying index in the near future. You want to take an aggressive position that can provide a great deal of leverage. This decision is made with the understanding that there is a possibility you may lose the entire premium you pay for the option.\n\nAn index call option gives the purchaser the right to participate in underlying index gains above a predetermined strike price until the option expires. The purchaser of an index call option has unlimited profit potential tied to the strength of advances in the underlying index.\n\nScenario\n\nAssume the underlying index that interests you is symbolized as XYZ and is currently at a level of 200. You decide to purchase a 6-month XYZ 205 call for a quoted price of $4.75 per contract. Your net cost for this call is $475 ($4.75 x 100 multiplier). You are risking $475 if the underlying index level is not above the strike price of 205 when the XYZ call expires. The break-even point (BEP) at expiration is an XYZ index level of 209.75 (Strike price 205 + premium paid $4.75) because the call will be worth its intrinsic value of $4.75, which is what you originally paid for it. The higher the XYZ index settlement value is above the break-even point at expiration, the greater your profit.\n\nPossible Outcomes at Expiration\n\n1. XYZ index level above the break-even point (209.75):\n\nIf at expiration XYZ index has advanced to 215, the XYZ 205 call will be worth its intrinsic value of $10 (Settlement value 215 - strike price 205). Your net profit in this case would be $525 (Settlement amount $1000 received from exercise - net cost of call $475).\n\nIf at expiration XYZ index has advanced to 207, the XYZ 205 call will be worth its intrinsic value of $2.00 (Settlement value 207 - strike price 205). You could exercise the option and receive the settlement amount of $200 ($2.00 intrinsic value x 100 multiplier). This amount would be less than the net amount paid for the call ($475), but it would offset some of that cost. The net loss in this case would be $275 (Net cost of call $475 - settlement amount $200 received from exercise). This loss represents a little more than half of your initial investment.\n\n3. XYZ index level below strike price (205):\n\nIf at expiration XYZ index has declined to 198, the call would have no value because it is out-of-the-money. You will have lost all of your initial investment, a net of $475. The net premium paid for an index option represents the maximum loss for an option purchaser.\n\nNote: No matter how far XYZ declines below the strike price, the loss will not exceed $475.\n\nStrategy 2 - Buying Index Puts\n\nGoal: Positioning to profit from a decrease in the level of the underlying index\n\nYou are anticipating a decline in the broad market or market sector measured by the underlying index in the near future. You want to take an aggressive position that can provide a great deal of leverage.\n\nThis decision is made with the understanding that there is a possibility you may lose the entire premium you pay for the option.\n\nAn index put option gives the purchaser the right to participate in underlying index declines below a predetermined strike price until the option expires. The purchaser of an index put option has substantial profit potential tied to the degree of declines in the underlying index.\n\nScenario\n\nAssume the underlying index that interests you is symbolized as XYZ and is currently at a level of 200. You decide to purchase a 6-month XYZ 195 put for a quoted price of $3.90 per contract. Your net cost for this call is $390 ($3.90 x 100 multiplier). You are risking $390 if the underlying index level is not below the strike price of 195 when the XYZ put expires. The break-even point (BEP) at expiration is an XYZ index level of 191.10 (Strike price 195 - premium paid $3.90) because the put will be worth its intrinsic value of $3.90, which is what you originally paid for it. The lower the XYZ index settlement value is below the break-even point at expiration, the greater your profit.\n\nPossible Outcomes at Expiration\n\n1. XYZ index level below the break-even point (191.10):\n\nIf at expiration XYZ index has declined to 185, the XYZ 195 put will be worth its intrinsic value of $10 (Strike price 195 - settlement value 185). Your net profit in this case would be $610 (Settlement amount $1000 received from exercise - net cost of put $390).\n\nIf at expiration XYZ index has declined to 193, the XYZ 195 put will be worth its intrinsic value of $2.00 (Strike price 195 - settlement value 193). You could exercise the option and receive the settlement amount of $200 ($2.00 intrinsic value x 100 multiplier). This amount would be less than the net amount paid for the put ($390), but it would offset some of that cost. The net loss in this case would be $190 (Net cost of put $390 - settlement amount $200 received from exercise). This loss represents a little less than half of your initial investment.\n\n3. XYZ index level above strike price (195):\n\nIf at expiration XYZ index has advanced to 202, the put would have no value because it is out-of-the-money. You will have lost all of your initial investment, a net of $390. The net premium paid for an index option represents the maximum loss for an option purchaser.\n\nNote: No matter how far XYZ advances above the strike price, the loss will not exceed $390"

The key to becoming a successful trader is to eliminate your\nown emotional biases about \"winning\" and \"losing.\"\nOne of the best ways to accomplish this is by boiling down your trade\nplan into a simple step-by-step process that will help you reap\nhuge rewards and minimize the risk of loss.\n\nJeffrey begins by explaining what every trader with a\nsystem must know: namely, the limitations of your system. To illustrate\nthis point, Jeffrey opens the online course with a question: Why do\npeople have difficulty trading with the Wave Principle?\n\nAnswer: It's because they confuse the Wave Principle --\na method of analyzing market price action -- with a trading methodology\nthat includes entry, exit, money management, etc.\n\nJeffrey quotes A.J. Frost and Robert Prechter's book The\nElliott Wave Principle to drive home his point: \"The primary\nvalue of the Wave Principle is that it provides a context for\nmarket analysis.\" [Jeffrey's emphasis]\n\nIn other words, Jeffrey explains, the Wave Principle itself\nis not a trading methodology; it's a tool for analyzing price action.\nThe Wave Principle alone will not tell you how much money you can afford\nto risk, what entry or exit level is best suited for your trading style\nor where to set your protective stop. Yet it will give\nyou everything you need to know to make these decisions, once you balance\nthe technical probabilities with your own risk-tolerance guidelines.\n\nHere's what you'll learn in this 1-hour online trading\ncourse:\n\nHere's what you will learn:\n\nThe 5 actionable wave patterns that\nare best suited for trading.\n\nThe 10 questions you must ask yourselfbefore you enter a position.\n\nHow to catch and ride trending price action.\n\nHow to identify entry points, exit points and protective\nstops.\n\nHow to forecast price targets.\n\nHow to listen and look for what the market is telling\nyou.\n\nWhat it means to make the market commit to\nyou before you commit to the market.\n\nHow to formulate multiple trade plans\nwhen you have two conflicting but equally viable wave counts.\n\nAnd perhaps most important: How to keep your analysis\nand emotion separate from the business of trading.\n(Here's a hint: Goal #1 is to ring the register.)\n\nPlease Note: If you are a DFJ or FJ subscriber, you have\nfree access to this video via your Traders Toolbox.\n\nBonus: Order now\nand get Basics of the Wave Principle FREE ($79 value)!\nThis 90-minute online video covers all the basics – from the\nrules and guidelines, to wave personalities and structures, to Fibonacci\nrelationships and more!\n\nJeffrey\nKennedy is editor of EWI's Daily and Monthly Futures\nJunctures, as well as the popular feature, Trader's Classroom.\nJeffrey is an active trader, has been an avid student of the\nWave Principle and the markets for over 15 years, and an accomplished\nteacher."

      "text": "Secrets of Penny Stock Investing (On Balance Volume)\n\nThere are a number of technical analysis (TA) techniques which our team applies in relation to penny stock investing. Some trading patterns imply that prices are going to spike higher, while others suggest growing interest in the shares among investors, or even the money flows into and out of the stock. A resistance level, for example, demonstrates a price point where the penny stock may have trouble breaking above.\n\nOne of the TA indicators with the greatest (and generally most accurate) application is On Balance Volume (OBV). This is a simplified method of illustrating net money flows into and out of a penny stock. When OBV shows money pouring into a penny stock, but the shares have not yet jumped higher as a result, it can be assumed that the price of the penny stock will soon jump higher as well. Transversely, if OBV illustrates net selling pressure, it can be assumed that the shares of the penny stock are likely to fall.\n\nOBV can be displayed by just about any free charting web site. You will see that the OBV line for any penny stock will very often mimic or lead the price activity of the underlying penny stock. An upward swing in OBV will appear very similar to an upward swing in the price of the shares, while a drop off in the shares may follow or appear concurrent with a drop off in OBV.\n\nWhen investing in any equities, it will benefit traders to check on the OBV direction. If you know that a penny stock has significant capital flows going into or out of it, your investing outlook may be somewhat changed.\n\nKeep in mind that OBV will be displayed in terms of the full time frame of the underlying trading chart. A one year chart will display OBV for the full year. OBV in penny stocks is best utilized over time frames of three months or less, preferably even a single month. You want to see the flow of capital in recent months or weeks to get an idea of the recent money flows, because in penny stocks that will be what has the greatest short term impact.\n\nWhile OBV is a useful TA indicator for investing in any type of stock, it is especially useful for penny stocks and investing in low-priced shares. After all, money flows into (or out of) smaller companies will have the most significant impact."

      "text": "Candlestick Patterns: Bullish Engulfing Pattern\n\nThe bullish engulfing candlestick pattern is a two-bar candlestick pattern. In this pattern, the first bar is a modest down day and in the next day a larger up day follows. The up day gaps down at the open (or in other words opens at a lower price than the stock price closed at on the previous day) and ends the day higher than the previous day's close, completely engulfing the previous day. This suggests that at the start of the session sellers sold the stock off, and then buyers came in and bought it all the way back up again and then some.\n\nGenerally speaking this is a bullish sign, and this pattern usually signifies a reversal to the upside after a downtrend. The downtrend could either be a longer-term downtrend or a shorter pullback within a larger uptrend. If this pattern is created within an uptrend or a sideways movement in stock price, it is generally accepted that it is not as significant.\n\nThe significance of this chart pattern is confirmed if on the day following the bullish engulfing pattern the next candlestick is white, the stock gaps up (opens higher) on the next day, or closes higher on the 3rd day.\n\nDifferent studies put the accuracy of this signal in the 60-70% range. Here is an historic example a bullish engulfing pattern and the implications that this chart pattern had in the future price movements of the stock price:\n\nExample: American Eagle Outfitters (AEO):\n\nOn October 4th 2011, a bullish engulfing pattern is shown in the following chart. October 3rd was a modest down day, and on October 4th the stock price opened below the previous closing price and was bid up all day. The closing price on October 4th was higher than the highest price the stock reached on October 3rd. The signal was confirmed on October 5th as the price closed higher than it did on the 4th.\n\nAs you can see in the following 2-year chart this bullish engulfing pattern occurred at the end of a down-trend. The stock doubled in price over the next year."

      "text": "Adaptive Frequency Weighted Moving Average (AFWMA)\n\nOne of the unique aspects of modelling financial time series is that recent data is more important than previous data. This is because forecasts need to be made for the next time period, and prices compound in value over time. The other unique aspect of time series data is that there tends to be a combination of random noise and mean-reverting tendencies (especially at shorter frequencies). The researcher often faces a tradeoff between weighting based on recency versus amplifying the noise and mean-reversion that exists at shorter frequencies. This tradeoff is logical, and should be captured explicitly as a function in an adaptive framework (success-weighted) versus back-testing different weighting schemes hindsight.\n\nRecency is easily captured by a weighted moving average (wma). In this scheme, prices are weighted in direct proportion to their recency (the recency rank divided by the sum of recency ranks times the price at time t). This link demonstrates the calculation :\n . Alternatively, the best way to eliminate disturbances induced by shorter frequencies is to middle weight the data. That is, we want to give data closest to the middle higher values than more recent data. This is best accomplished using a triangular moving average, which is essentially a moving average of the moving average of the same length. The smoothing induced by a triangular moving average creates maximum weighting on the middle value. The calculation is described here:\n .\n\nTo keep things consistent, we should use a weighted triangular moving average (wtma), which is exactly the same except it uses the weighted moving average versus the simple moving average in the calculation. Thus the Adaptive Frequency Weighted Moving Average can be calculated simply as:\n\nAFWMA= w*(wma)+ (1-w)*(twma)\n\nwhere \"w\" is a constant between 0 and 1\n\nThe purpose of the AFWMA is to find the optimal balance between recency and avoiding short-term noise. This can be found by solving for \"w\" to best minimize out of sample error in a forecast format, or to best maximize out of sample sharpe in a trading strategy format. It is a simple and logical way of compressing the value/information content that differs between the weighted and triangular moving averages without resorting to blind optimization (or worse yet the beliefs/opinions of a technical analysis \"guru\")."

The methods that I use for defining my trades are primarily based on Elliot waves however other disciplines are welcome provided that they are precise and you can produce a chart that clearly illustrates the concept on a timely basis. Moving average resistance, long-term trend lines, Fibonacci levels, and pitchforks are a few examples of sensible alternatives that should be watched.\n\nDiscussion should be limited to indexes and other vehichles that are tradable via futures. Longer term theories, sentiment indicators, and individual stock trades should be discussed on the regular E-wave thread.

Ideally such an entry should be a half or whole day trade that marks a significant intraday turn. To help maintain focus posting here should be limited to market hours.\n\nThere are a number of reasons for this that any successful wiggle board would have to overcome:\n\n1) Most important factor is text versus pretty picture. Nobody should have to read wiggle prose. It's painful. Post a picture or don't post. Further, every reply to a specific chart should repost the chart link at the end of the message. There is hardly anything worse than reading a bunch of short posts alng the lines of \"No, I think it is likely a 4 of c of C given that we did not violate that previous 1 low.\" Huh?\n\n2) Context. Most often, there is no context for the post. Its' important if someone is trying to time a turn that we know the context in the next larger timeframe/count.\n\n3) Timeframe. Anything under 10min or so is too noisy to be useful.

If we buy 500 shares the cost will be $7,250.00, but we will buy those 500 shares on MARGIN.\n\nMARGIN: A credit-based loan from your stockbroker, based on the value of the stock you buy. Generally, 50% is the norm. Why would the broker do that? They will sell you more shares and charge you interest on the money loaned to you - usually varying between 7 and 11% per year.\n\nSince we are going to write a Covered Call expiring the next month, this loan will cost us about 1%. However, for the simplicity of the tutorial, commissions and interest will not be included in the calculations.\n\nSo, we decide to buy 500 shares of AMTX for a value of $7,250.00. But with leverage of the loan, our cash required is only half of that: $7,250.00 : 50% on margin = $3,625.00.\n\nNow, we are in the month of January and we want to see what the PREMIUM is for the February Covered Call at $15.00 STRIKE PRICE.\n\nPREMIUM: The price the buyer pays us for the option to purchase our stock. (Writing a Covered Call means you sell to someone that option.) The premium for this AMTX option is $1.50. The person paying us the PREMIUM will have the right but not the obligation to exercise (to buy) our shares at the STRIKE PRICE OF $15.00 at or before the expiration date of February 21st.\n\nEXPIRATION DATES are always the third Friday of each month!\n\nSTRIKE PRICE: Is the price at which the underlying stock will be sold if the buyer of the option exercises their right to purchase.\n\nWhen you sell a Covered Call you must know that options, selling or buying, are always written in 100 share contracts. As we sell a Covered Call on AMTX for 500 shares, this equals 5 contracts.\n\nKnowing that, we see that the premium for a share of AMTX for the February $15.00 call can be sold for $1.50:\n500 shares x $ 1.50 = $750.00 PREMIUM.\n\nIf we want to CALCULATE OUR RETURN, we are going to divide the premium received by the cost of our shares:\n\nPREMIUM: $750.00 divided by Investment: $3,625.00 = 20.68 %\n\nRETURN FROM ONE MONTH TO THE NEXT, OR 248.16 % ANNUALIZED! (less commission and margin interest).\n\nSo far, we don't think we have lost you. Let's do a quick review of this exciting strategy:\n\nWe have decided to buy 500 shares of Amati Communications at the price of $14.50 a share for an amount of $7,250.00 on margin. Our out of pocket expense was $3,625.00.\n\nWe have also decided to write a February Covered Call for a strike price of $15.00.\nThe Premium for this Call is $ 1.50 a share which amounts to a total of $750.00 Premium paid.\n\nReturn Example 1\n\nIf from the time we write the Covered Call until its expiration date, the STOCK PRICE REMAINS AT ABOUT THE SAME LEVEL, the option buyer most likely will not exercise his/her option to purchase our stock. After the expiration date we are free to write another covered call for the next month. In this case, WE KEEP THE $750.00 PREMIUM RECEIVED, WHICH EQUALS 20.68 % RETURN.\n\nReturn Example 2\n\nIf from the time we write the Covered Call until its expiration date, the STOCK PRICE INCREASES IN VALUE TO THE LEVEL OF OR ABOVE THE STRIKE PRICE, the option buyer most likely will exercise his/her option and will buy our stock or part of it at $15.00 a share.\n\nLet's do the math:\n\nWe have to sell our 500 shares x 15.00 = $ 7,500.00\n\nAs we bought them for $ 14.50 a piece we have an additional gain of $.50 a share.\n\n$.50 x 500 = $ 250.00 + $ 750.00 premium = $ 1,000.00 return.\n\nThis situation will increase our return.\n\n$1,000.00 divided by $ 3,625.00 = 27.58%\n\nReturn Example 3\n\nIf from the time we write the Covered Call until its expiration date, the STOCK PRICE LOSES IN VALUE, the option buyer most likely will not exercise his/her option to purchase our stock. At that point we have a loss on the value of the stock. As an example, if the share drops to $13.00 from $14.50, that loss will be compensated by the premium received. From then on we can either sell another Covered Call on the same stock right away, or we can wait until the stock bounces back before writing a Covered Call at a higher premium. We can also sell the stock and buy another one we like better.\n\nAlso, if the decreased value in that stock is not offset by the premium received, your broker may ask you to make up for the difference in the new value of the underlying interest. This request from your broker is a Margin Call.\n\nAs a rule, for your own comfort, you should always have a minimum of 20% of your portfolio on margin in your cash account to cover a margin call.\n\n**All In The Money and H2O-iGroup is an Educational Information Network, which does not recommend nor offer to buy or sell securities.

      "text": "Contrarian Trading Indicator for the Week Ahead\n\nContrarian Trading – Strategies to Employ\n\nMarch 26, 2012\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis article is based on an explanation as to how you can use contrarian analysis to find out which stocks have the muscle to keep climbing in the suddenly wobbly market environment -- complete with a list of potential bullish and bearish picks.\n\nAlso included is a short summary of a contrarian trading philosophy, along with some simple indicators that can be used to determine the sentiment surrounding a stock.\n\nDefinition of Contrarian Trading\n\n'Contrarian' is defined as an investment style that goes against prevailing market trends by buying assets that are performing poorly and then selling when they perform well.\n\nA contrarian trader believes that the people who say the market is going up do so only when they are fully invested and have no further purchasing power. At this point, the market is at a peak. On the other hand, when people predict a downturn, they have already sold out, at which point the market can only go up.\n\nThe contrarian strategy is not as simple as taking the opposite side of the public's widely held viewpoint – \"the trend is your friend\" theme. A stock that goes higher and higher for an extended amount of time will naturally gain a lot of positive sentiment -- this does not mean that a contrarian investor immediately hates that stock. Going against the price trend is always a tough way to play. The approach is to look for stocks where the sentiment is counter to the established trend. In other words, the contrarian looks for stocks going higher despite a significant amount of pessimism.\n\nThe reason behind this strategy is that the pessimism indicates a lot of investors have been avoiding that stock, and are therefore sitting on the sidelines. If that stock continues higher, then at some point, the sentiment will change and that sideline money will (hopefully, all at once) begin to flow into that stock, thereby driving it higher in a short amount of time.The fast and furious rally is especially beneficial to those that are option traders.\n\nSeveral articles in regard to option trading that may present some opportunities for the investor are:-\n\nBy constantly monitoring the markets and reading about stocks or simply by reading the news and keeping an eye on other media outlets provides a feel for the sentiment. However, it helps to be able to quantify sentiment, and this can be done in a few different ways:-\n\n• Analyst ratings, for example, are pretty straightforward. Analysts give a buy/hold/sell recommendation on stocks, depending on what they think investors should do. If a stock is trekking higher, but has little to no \"buy\" recommendations, then the potential is there for upgrades -- which can influence those on the sidelines to buy the stock.\n\n• Shorting a stock or buying put options are two ways for investors to profit when a stock falls in price. Therefore, monitoring the changes in short interest and the amount of put buying are ways to quantify negative sentiment on a stock. If there's a large amount of these negative bets being placed on the stock, while it's still moving higher and higher, then you can assume that there is significant sideline money that can still be deployed to keep the rally going.\n\nContrarian Trading Stock Plays\n\nBelow are some stocks to keep an eye on using some of the indicators mentioned above. The following contrarian bullish stock plays were accumulated by observing stocks during the past six months and then following certain criteria:-\n\n• more puts bought to open than calls bought to open -- Put/Call Ratio.\n\nUsing the same indicators as above, this next table shows stocks that could be compelling from the short side. In other words, these stocks have been moving lower over the last six months, but analysts and investors keep making bullish predictions. If the underperformance continues, and the bullish investors change their minds on these stocks, you might see a sudden outflow of money -- driving the prices even lower. Specifically, the table shows stocks that are lower over the previous six months, even as short interest has decreased, the percentage of analyst \"buys\" has increased, and there have been more call options bought compared to put options.\n\n\"Success is simple. Do what's right, the right way, at the right time.\"\n\nOption Tip for your Success! Options traders are not successful because they win. Options traders win because they are successful."

      "text": "So as you work to develop your own investment philosophy, you might be wondering if it's more profitable to be a trend follower or a trend fighter. Truth be told, both are correct.\n\nRealistically, successful investors eventually understand that in the end you have to follow (or anticipate) trends or you'll go broke. One doesn't last long constantly standing against the prevailing winds. The market is too large and too strong: You'll just get blown over.\n\nPlus, why would you? As we've said over the years, it's our belief that the markets are not chaotic, but move in trends that persist for periods of time. The Nasdaq didn't fall from 5000 to 1500 in a day. To ignore this reality is to willingly suspend your awareness of the issue itself.\n\nWhat does it mean that trends persist? Weather offers the most obvious example. I can't tell you what the exact temperature in Chicago will be tomorrow, but I'd take odds that it's not going to be 85 degrees and sunny. The basis for that bet is the fact I've observed, for the last two months or so, a trend toward dark, cold and rather gloomy days. It's not impossible that the temperature will hit 85 tomorrow in Chicago, but it is improbable. Dealing in probabilities is how profitable investors are able to consistently win over time.\n\nOf course, to know what \"season\" the markets happen to be in involves doing research, which, in today's world, has come to mean briefly glancing at what other people think and taking their word on it. That's the lazy approach.\n\nThe best research, and thus, the best decision, is always the one you make from your own informed perspective. So you might talk to suppliers, pore over SEC filings, stay up late with annual reports and field test new products. That's slightly more effective, yet still one step removed from the one piece of information that matters most to your bottom line: price action. If you're going to profitably trade stocks, you should start by observing them. Nothing is more informative than the price of the actual security in which you're considering taking a position.\n\nSo I look at a ton of charts. Most laymen could tell you the Dow has been hitting new all-time highs, but few know how well Israeli stocks have been doing. How about Big Pharma, floating-rate funds or the business-development companies like Ares Capital Corp. or MCG Capital Corporation? You don't have to follow every trend, but you should be aware of the market's prominent themes at any given moment in time.\n\nEven more important is the realization that being a trend follower doesn't necessarily make you a crowd follower. When a security rises substantially, it's a common fallacy to believe the sole reason is because everybody is piling in. While most commentators are quick to interpret a market trend as the result of some action of investors, as we pointed out a few years back, it's often their inaction that's ultimately responsible for the move.\n\nThe law of supply and demand is also that of demand and supply, and it's not the presence of buying, but the absence of selling, that can easily prompt a market higher. When there's not much stock offered, even a small increase in demand can send a price soaring. It's exactly why you can buy just a few hundred shares of low-float stocks like Cimatron Ltd. or bulletin-board obscurities like Mills Music Trust and quickly send their prices spiraling upward. Of course, when you go to sell, the same law applies prices collapse on a market order of 200 shares or fewer.\n\nThe mistake is to falsely assume that just because XYZ has risen 30% in the last few months, the herd has already piled in and all the easy money has been made. The reality is likely that a few steady buyers are meeting comparatively few sellers. Volume and message-board buzz are much better indicators of the crowd presence. On a large scale, the best example was the 1990s tech boom. According to mutual-fund data from the Investment Company Institute, most people finally got into the market in February of 2000, long after the real move (read: trend) had been in place for years.\n\nTrend following isn't a profit panacea, but it is a state of mind that I strongly believe traders should embrace. The fact is that the world, markets included, moves in trends. Fighting them is a losing battle the limitless resources of the market will triumph over our few meaningless positions every time. We need not buy into every trend, but being aware of them provides the most meaningful insight into the markets there is.\n\nMoreover, being a trend follower doesn't always mean you're part of the herd. Bull markets are built on doubt, and very often strong price action is the result of lack of supply rather that the presence of demand. The skilled investor might not always follow the market's trends, but he should never fail to respect them. In an environment where uncertainty is the norm, they are the closest one can come to knowing anything at all"

      "text": "Update My Info\n\nBlack-Scholes Model\n\nBlack-Scholes is a way of modeling stock prices. The Black-Scholes model focuses on the current stock price and the volatility of the stock price to determine the likelihood of future price moves. This type of analysis is most often used to accurately price stock options based on the price of the underlying stock.\n\nThis type of analysis differs from traditional technical analysis because it does not select a direction for a move. Linear regression and Gann angles, for example, assume that a stock price will move in a straight line. A longer, straighter line means a stronger trend, so we can confidently predict that the stock price will continue to rise or fall at the same rate. Black-Scholes says that a stock chart with a price rising or falling in a straight line is very unlikely. A longer, straighter line is even less likely.\n\nBollinger Bands come closer to the Black-Scholes model. The standard deviation formula used in Bollinger Bands is similar to the volatility formula used by the Black-Scholes model. For that reason, neither one expects a sharp rise or drop in price to continue forever. If you see a stock chart with a pattern like that, and you add Bollinger Bands to that stock chart, then you will see the bands get wider and wider over time. The Bollinger Bands, like the Black-Scholes model, are saying that a stock like that becomes harder and harder to predict.\n\nBlack-Scholes differs, however, from Bollinger Bands, because Bollinger Bands expect an extreme move to be followed by a pullback. The center of the Bollinger Bands is set by a moving average, under the assumption that the price is likely to return toward that mean. Black-Scholes always centers its predictions around the current price, as in the efficient market theorem.\n\nThe Black-Scholes model is most obvious in our various running and consolidation alerts. These alerts tell the user when a stock chart is unusual because the current stock price is far from the prediction of the Black-Scholes model. We also use this model internally in many other places, allowing us to properly interpret the volatility of a stock.\n\nAlert Types\n\nWe offer the following alert types which are related to this topic.&nbsp\nClick on the icon for a detailed description of the alert, or\nclick on the example link for additional samples of each type of alert."

      "text": "Stock Market Investing 10 Minute Guide - page 37\n\nWarrants\n\nWarrants\nare very much like subscription rights in that they are usually used to purchase stock for less than what the stock is currently worth, or the\ncurrent market value.\nWarrants\ndiffer\nfrom subscription rights in that subscription rights entitle the bearer to deduct a certain amount from the price of the stock, whereas warrants entitle the bearer to purchase the stock at a predetermined price, regardless of the current price the stock is selling for on the\nopen\nmarket.\n\nPlain English\n\nWarrants\nare a type of financial instrument distributed by the company that originally issued the corresponding stock. The warrants grant the bearer the right to purchase that company's stock at a predetermined price, regardless of the market value of the stock at that time.\n\nFor example, suppose that you have just purchased 10 shares of XYZ Company stock at $10 per share. XYZ Company\nknows\nthat, as a new company, it may have a little difficulty finding new investors in the market right now, so the company attaches a warrant to each share that you have just purchased (free of charge, no less). The\nwarrant\nentitles you to buy a share of XYZ Company stock for $11, regardless of what it's selling for on the market. Since you have just bought the stock for $10 per share, it would be kind of silly to pay $11 per share right now.\n\nBut, in the course of time, the price of XYZ Company rises to $13 per share. By cashing in your warrants, you could buy 10 more shares of XYZ Company stock at the price of $11 per share, thereby making an immediate profit of $20 ($11 — 10 = $110, versus $13 — 10 = $130).\n\nLet's say that when you purchased those 10 initial shares and received the warrants, you were satisfied because you really only wanted 10 shares to begin with. You figured the warrants were nice but relatively useless, right? No. As in the subscription rights example, you can sell or\notherwise\ndispose of warrants however you see fit. Therefore, if the price of XYZ Company stock rises to $13 per share, you have 10 warrants to use for purchasing that stock at $11 per share.\n\nI'm an investor who wants to purchase XYZ Company stock, so you offer to sell me your warrants for $1 each. I use your warrants to purchase XYZ Company stock at $11 per share, and I still save $10 ($11 — 10 = 110 + $10 = $120, versus $13 — 10 = $130). You've just made $10 by selling me something you didn't want to begin with, and XYX Company has attracted a new investor. Everybody's happy.\n\nMore on Warrants\n\nMany investors buy and sell warrants, completely ignoring the underlying stock, because oftentimes more money can be made from the warrant transactions. For example, let's say you bought those 10 warrants from me at $1 each. Instead of using them to buy stock, you hold on to them and wait until the price of XYZ Company stock climbs to $14 per share. You then find another investor who is willing to pay $2 per warrant. The advantage to the buyer is that he or she acquires the right to buy XYZ Company shares at the bargain price of $11 each. The buyer will still save $10 in the transaction ($2 — 10 warrants = $20 and $11 — 10 shares = $110; $20 + $110 = $130, versus $140 to purchase 10 shares at $14). The investor has saved money, and you have made $10 from your initial $10 investment, effectively giving you a 100-percent profit.\n\nOf course, if the price of XYZ Company stock never rises above $11 per share, you've just bought a dog with fleas. Welcome to the wonderful world of investing.\n\nAlso, it should be noted that XYZ Company is not issuing warrants for the sake of being nice. As noted in the previous example, companies typically issue stock because they are relatively young and/or may have a difficult time otherwise\nattracting\nnew investors. Since warrants are almost always issued at a higher purchase price than what the stock is currently selling for, the company and the recipients of those warrants are all\nbetting\nthat the price of the stock will rise. Many times, those recipients are other companies or are brokerage houses, because companies often will pay each other off through the transfer of warrants. As in the example when no actual stock changed hands, these brokerage\nhouses\nand companies will then sell the warrants to individual investors in order to raise cash without having to make a capital investment of their own, or with only a minimal one. In addition, this action effectively launches the warrants onto the common market for everyone to buy and sell."

      "text": "Futures\n\nThe futures market is an exciting and diverse market that allows you to trade futures contracts on everything from corn and wheat to interest rates and stock indices. You are not limited to just one sector of the global economy or to strong economic periods. As a futures trader, you can make money on either market direction.\n\nFutures Contracts\n\nThe basic building block of the futures market is the futures contract.\n\nA futures contract is a contract between a buyer and a seller where the seller agrees to deliver a commodity/underlying instrument to the buyer on a specified date for a specified price.\n\nFutures traders who are in a trade and want to get out of it have to create a new contract to offset the first one.\n\nAs a futures trader, you want to know not only how many contracts have been created, but also how many of those contracts remain active. High volume and high open interest are signs of good liquidity in the market, which means it should be quite easy for you to quickly enter and exit your trades at a good price.\n\nTrading Futures Contracts\n\nWhen you buy or sell a futures contract you do not pay for the full value of the underlying commodity up front, as you would if you were buying a stock. Instead, you post margin, or a performance bond, with your futures broker showing you have enough money to cover any losses you may incur from the trade.\n\nThe margin you set aside when you enter a trade is called your initial margin. Once you are in a trade, however, you may not need to maintain the same level of margin, but only to meet what is called your maintenance margin requirement – which, depending on the exchange, is typically lower. Maintenance margin is the amount of money you must set aside to remain in a trade.\n\nCommodity Futures and Financial Futures\n\nWe broadly divide available futures contracts into two categories:\n\nCommodity futures are futures contracts based on a physical commodity that you can grow/raise/mine and transport from place to place.\n\nFinancial futures are futures contracts that are based on financial products likes bonds and stock indices.\n\nBid Price and Ask Price\n\nWhen a futures contract has high trading volume, the spread between the bid and the ask will be quite small. As a futures trader, you want the spread to be as small as possible.\n\nIntermarket Analysis\n\nThe futures market is the most diverse of the global financial markets. While no other financial market can compare to the diversity of the futures market, others do impact on it. For instance, the U.S. Bond market can affect the value of the U.S. Dollar Index futures contract, just as the Japanese yen can affect the value of the Nikkei 225 Index futures contract.\n\nTo become a successful futures trader you will need to recognize the relationships that exist among the world's financial markets and comprehend how these relationships may affect the futures contracts you are trading.\n\nBuyers and Sellers\n\nWhile futures contract prices fluctuate from day to day, various futures exchanges limit the distance some of the contracts can move in one trading period. Futures contracts with maximum price fluctuation rules will stop trading if they move too far in any direction.\n\nThe contract may:\n\nstop trading for a few minutes and then begin trading again with a new price limit; or\n\nstop trading for a few minutes and then begin trading again with the same price limit; or\n\nstop trading for the day.\n\nFutures contracts also have what are known as limit up and limit down thresholds. If the price of a futures contract moves too high or too low, trading on that contract will stop for a few minutes to allow the exchange directors to determine whether trading should continue that day or if it should be halted to preserve order and prevent panic on the exchange floor.\n\nSUB CATEGORY\n\nSpecified Date and Price\n\nEvery futures contract has a specified date on which it expires and a specified price at which the seller must provide the commodity and the buyer must pay for the commodity.\n\nFutures contracts have three key dates of which you need to be aware:\n\nThe noticedate is the first day the seller of a futures contract can give the buyer of the contract notice to expect delivery of the underlying commodity.\n\nThe expirydate is the day that the futures contract expires. It is also the last trading day for the futures contract.\n\nEvery futures contract has a unique ticker symbol that tells you what the underlying commodity is and when the contract expires. Each symbol is comprised of three parts: the instrument identification, the month of expiration, and the year of expiration.\n\nThe deliverydate is the last date by which the underlying commodity must be delivered from the seller to the buyer. The delivery date is also known as the settlementdate. The seller need not wait until the delivery date to deliver the underlying commodity, but can deliver at any time during the deliveryperiod – the period between the first notice date and the delivery date."

As a rule, a trend line is drawn through the major top (resistance) and major bottom (support) points. Then the vertical distance between these two points is divided by Fibonacci Ratios: 23.6%, 38.2%, 50.0%, 61.8% and 76.4%. Next, the \"Fan\" lines are draw from the base point (the left point of the trend line) through the points that represent Fibonacci Ratios on the right side of the trend line.\n\nAs with most Fibonacci drawings in technical analysis, the Fan is used to identify potential support and resistance levels in the near future. The main principle of this analysis is the assumption that the price trend is vulnerable to a change in its trend when it moves close to the Fan's lines. If the price drops below, or moves above, a Fan's line, then the price is expected to trend to the next Fan's line where it will become vulnerable to a change in its trend again.\n\nThe Fibonacci Fan is also used to predict short-term price movements, by assuming that price tends to move in the short term between 38.2% and 61.8% of Fan's line by occasionally bouncing from the 50% line. In technical analysis, the Fibonacci Fan also is often used in junction with other Fibonacci drawings, such as Fibonacci Arcs, Retracements and Timelines.\n\nThe chart below of the NASDAQ 100 index gives an example of a Fibonacci Fan:"

      "text": "Futures For You\n\nwith Carley Garner\n\nInside The\nFutbutterfly vs. condor\n\nWhat is the difference between an iron butterfly and a condor?\n\nBefore examining the discrepancies between these strategies along with their advantages and disadvantages, let me note that option terminology differs depending on where you are. The two US financial hubs, New York and Chicago, have their own language when it comes to option strategies. A broker on the Cme floor may have a slightly different view on what exactly a condor is relative to someone standing in a Nymex option trading pit. That said, you should be familiar with the details of the strategies as well as the name. Knowledge could avoid costly communication errors between yourself and your broker.\n\nIn literal terms, both butterflies and condors have wings, and this is likely where the option terms stem from. In reference to option strategies, these approaches involve limited risk and profit potential. However, the similarities end there. An iron butterfly trader and a condor trader will have vastly different goals in the market.\n\nThe most prominent difference in strategy is the cash flow that occurs upon entry and exit. A condor trader is most interested in collecting premium in hopes that the market trades sideways, while an iron butterfly trader is willing to pay premium in anticipation of the market moving in the desired direction.\n\nWhether a trader receives or pays a premium for the spread is based on the value of each of the option legs involved. If it requires more premium to be paid for the long options than is collected for the short, the trader is buying the spread. Similarly, if the trader collects more for the short options than is paid for the long options, the trader is selling the spread. That said, conventional wisdom suggests that butterflies should be executed during times of low volatility and low option premium, and condors should be executed in the opposite scenario.\n\nAn iron butterfly is a four-legged spread involving three different strike prices in the same commodity and month. If you are familiar with options, you may realize that this strategy is simply the combination of a bull call spread and a bear call spread. Specifically, a call iron butterfly trader may buy an at-the-money call option, sell two out-of-the-money calls, and then purchase an equidistant call option to limit the risk of the spread. An iron butterfly can be sold but is typically used as a long option strategy, whereas the cost of the long calls outweighs the premium collected for the short calls.\n\nThe result is a limited risk option spread in which the trade pays off something to the trader at expiration as long as the price of the corresponding futures market is trading between the strike prices of each long call option. The profit potential of an iron butterfly is limited to the distance between the strike prices of the long and short calls minus the premium paid. The maximum profit occurs if the futures market is trading at the strike price of the short calls.\n\nA condor strategy includes a credit spread on both sides of the futures market; for those of you familiar with options, you may recognize this as simultaneously holding a bull put spread and a bear call spread. A condor trader is hoping that both spreads expire worthless. If this is the case, he gets to keep the original premium collected upon entering the trade.\n\nAn example of a condor would be to buy a March S&P 550 put and sell a 600 put while also buying a March S&P 1150 call and selling an 1100 call. Hypothetically, such a trade may collect about $12.50 in premium or $3,125 for the seller. This is calculated by multiplying the premium collected by the S&P futures point value of $250.\n\nLike an iron butterfly, the condor strategy entails limited risk and limited profit potential. The most money that a condor trader can make is the original net credit of $3,125 minus the commissions and fees paid. With four legs per spread, the transaction costs can add up, so they shouldn't be overlooked. The maximum profit occurs if both sides of the condor expire worthless. Keep in mind that it is only possible to lose on one side of the spread at expiration, not both.\n\nThe benefit of a condor over a simple short option strategy is the peace of mind that comes with knowing the worst-case scenario. The world could come to an end, yet the losses incurred in a condor strategy will be limited to the difference between the strike prices of the long and short options minus the net credit received upon entry. In this example, the total risk would be 37.50 or $9,375 ((50 - 12.50) x $250). While this is a steep figure, at least it is known.\n\nOptions can be a versatile trading tool in which traders are able to adjust their strategy based on desired risk and reward prospects. In addition, a trader can speculate on a large market move or a stagnant market through the use of condors and butterflies. Perhaps volatile market conditions warrant the use of limited risk option spreads such as these."

The answer is a resounding no.\n\nMalkiel himself claims not to know a single chartist who has become rich because of his investing technique, but he knows many who have gone broke. On the other hand, he knows many who have done well, not because of their technique, but because they have managed to convince others to churn their portfolios and therefore generate brokerage fees.\n\nAnecdotal evidence aside, Malkiel cites numerous studies that have shown that while technical analysis can work some of the time (as all stock market strategies do), they do not beat buy-and-hold strategies over time. He discusses some of the more popular and elaborate charting techniques including stock price momentum, The Filter System, Dow Theory, Relative-Strength Theory, and price-volume systems. In each case, computer simulations were able to refute the claims that these patterns were anything more than random occurrences with unpredictable future results that could not beat a buy-and-hold strategy.\n\nDespite the evidence to the contrary, why do people continue to profess to be able to tell future stock prices using past stock prices? Malkiel's answer is that humans find it hard to accept randomness. They look for patterns, even when there aren't any. Furthermore, brokerages employ technical analysts because they help speed up the churn rate in client accounts: followers of technical analysis generate far higher commissions for their brokers than do buy-and-hold investors!\n\nFinally, Malkiel discusses some of the famous technical analysts that have come and gone including Joseph Granville, Robert Prechter, and Elaine Garzelli. The familiar pattern to each of these stories, however, is that while a technical analyst can make a name for himself with a few correct calls in a row (also likely random, as with so many people trying, there will be some successes by chance), the successful predictions are never sustained."

      "text": "\"I have been observing StockTwits and Twitter as it relates to trading for about a year and a half now and I would like to relay some of my observations, perhaps very obvious to some. I think it is crucial to first off describe the differences of investing vs. trading vs. gambling. The investor is someone who typically seeks out an edge through value with a longer time frame. An investor might invest in diversified ETFs or mutual funds and such stocks as BAC, JPM, GE, XOM, and PG. The trader is someone who typically seeks out an edge through growth with a shorter time frame (note that the goal of many traders is to be in a strong growth stock for a longer time frame as huge gains can be made, but in general the time frame is shorter). A trader might trade such stocks as AAPL, ALXN, PCLN, MA, and SBUX. A gambler is someone who has no edge who relies on luck in the short-term while in a longer time frame will always lose money. Though some believe that investing is a more of a gamble, like Jesse Livermore who states that investors \"make a bet, stay with it, and if it goes wrong, they lose it all,\" I believe investing has its place, such as investing in diversified low-cost ETFs in retirement accounts which require peace of mind and inherent longer time frames. Clearly it is possible to trade in one account and invest in another (and even gamble in a third!). Regardless, a trade that is made without an edge (such as beyond a pivot point or clear breakout on poor quality stocks or even top quality stocks in a poor acting market or without increased volume) is a gamble. I believe this unique commitment and patience required for succesful trading makes investing better for 90% of individuals.\n\nSo how does this apply to StockTwits and Twitter? What I have observed are naive users who seek out tips on these services (and even CNBC which routinely features unaccountables who provide advice with no indication of their own strategy) on when to buy and sell stocks not knowing the other user's time frame, risk tolerance, entry point, sell rules, goals, overall strategy etc. It seems that these lemmings desire some sort of human confirmation before acting. These users who are clearly blindly following others and high-flying extended stocks show up in droves in an uptrend but disappear when the overall market changes, probably along with their portfolio. These users do not understand the behavior of the stocks they are entering and do not have their own clear strategy. A study of INVN on StockTwits is a fascinating study as many users were clearly following others who were making purchases on a pure guess that a low was set and then selling at a lose as it fell through its 50-day moving average. The fact that these users sold reveals that they are traders, albeit gambling traders. A simple study of INVN's volume showed a purchase at this second bounce from the 50-day moving average lacked any sort of trader's edge and therefore was and still remains a gamble for the trader. It remains debatable on whether INVN currently has an investor's edge.\n\nLong story short, obviously someone who partakes in the market must clearly understand their own strategy (write it down!). My suggestion for those who use StockTwits and Twitter for market purposes is to seek out other user's who clearly have the same methodology and ignore the lemmings. It is the investor or trader who avoids gambling by remaining true to a strategy, whether that is the methodology of Livermore, Darvis, or O'Neil or not, that is most succesful.\"\n\nI once wrote a blog post about Gambling vs. Investing. Basically its about comparing Gambling and Investing and the belief that Investing is based on skill and not luck. I say this because I don't know of a famous gambler who won all the time. I do know investors who know what they're doing and make a living at investing. I don't believe in the news. If you're using the news to figure out when to buy and sell stocks then your already too too late. The stock has already moved on that piece of information. Plus everyone has an agenda even the news.\n\nI don't like labels because anyone labeling is usually bias towards the superiority of \"investors\" (not to say you are). I personally think most people are hybrids. Like you said, you can have 3 different accounts, using different strategies for each. You can invest in any volatile stock as I'm sure there are original investors that bought aapl on day 1 and never sold to this day. I do believe in following a strategy but it doesn't have to be much. Economies have tended to grow from the dawn of civilization so this will likely continue to happen until war or some galactic event happens. Also, I do believe that markets are volatile and think people need to employ more conservative investments/trades/gambles if they want to ensure long term success. (i.e., don't make huge initial bets). Finally, I believe experience is important and you get a lot of experience points stomaching losses in investments that you believe in.\n\nMany markets have been compared to gambling. More specifically, the most volatile market (aka forex) - it's very risky but there are some very important differences. I will list my source at the end if you want to read up on them."

Much has been made of high-frequency trading,4 dark pools,5 and various other technological innovations designed to empower institutions with computerized market access that would have been unimaginable not long ago.

      "text": "3 Simple yet Highly Effective Candlestick Patterns\n\nNow we know everything about Japanese candlesticks, but still we have to learn as how to trade and benefit from them. In today's times, candlestick charts is the best technique for analyzing the forex market because not only we get to see a beautiful graphical illustration of the currency pair, but they are itself an important tool for speculating the future price moment, and this is possible with the help of various different types of candlestick patterns.\n\nWhat is the Meaning of Candlestick Patterns?\n\nA single candlestick provides the market information as according to the selected timeframe and this information help us in analyzing the current market scenario of a currency pair, but when a series is used for analyzing the currency pair, a trader is able to see a bigger picture of the current market situation, as a result, it becomes easier to speculate the future price movement and make a trading decision.\n\nA repeated and combined use of multiple candlesticks for analyzing the market as per every different scenario is known as \"Candlestick Pattern Analysis\" and also \"Candlestick Trading Strategy\".\n\nToday, we will learn all the top 3 basic, simple yet highly effective candlestick patterns and more advanced will be learned in the later lessons.\n\nTop 3 Simple and Fundamentally Important Candlestick Patterns\n\n1. Marubozu\n\nMarubozu are the real bodies without any hands and legs i.e. these are the candlesticks with almost 100% real body without any shadows. A marubozu is a long solid candle, and it is formed when the market shows a strong move in any direction i.e. the candlestick's opening price is the lowest/highest price and the closing price is the highest/lowest price as according to the trending direction.\n\nMarubozu Candlestick Pattern at the times of decrease in demand resulting into an intense selling pressure even at a continuous declining price. A bearish marubozu is often seen at the start and/or continuation of a bearish trend and also at times of immediate bearish reversals.\n\nExample of a Marubozu Candlestick Pattern\n\nIn the above USDJPY, 1 hour chart, you will see the domination of bulls by a strong breakout from a support level resulting in the formation of a long bullish marubozu and after a couple of days you will see the domination of bears by a strong bounce back from a resistance level resulting in the formation of a long bearish marubozu.\n\n2. Spinning Tops\n\nYes, you guessed correctly; these are the candles looking similar to the spinning tops by which we used to play many years ago these are the candles which keeps on spinning at the tops and bottoms of the price swings i.e. these are the candlesticks which has a small real body with the upper shadow and a lower shadow.\n\nSpinning Tops Candlestick Pattern\n\nA spinning top is formed after the huge fight between the bulls and bears with nobody having the upper hand and finally resulting into a draw i.e. the small real body with the upper and lower shadow reflects the price action information that it was very active and volatile during the day, both bulls and bears had a huge fight for gaining the upper hand but despite all their efforts resulted into a draw by closing near the opening price and leaving the significant highest and lowest traded price action in the form of shadows. The color of spinning tops is not important because any spinning top has a very small real body with the closing price very near to the opening price.\n\nTwo or more small real body candlesticks having the same high or low at a particular price level are called Tweezers. Whenever tweezers are formed at the peaks or troughs of the price swings, it reflects a high probability that the current trend is losing its momentum and might result into a sideways direction and/or reverse into an opposite direction.\n\nIf a spinning top is formed at the demand level, then the probability of the future price movement bouncing back from the demand level increases because a spinning top at a support level means the bears are losing their strength as they are not able to decline price any further resulting into a huge possibility that the price might bounce back i.e. start appreciating from the demand level.\n\nIf a spinning top is formed at the supply level, then the probability of the future price movement bouncing back from the supply level increases because a spinning top at a resistance level means the bulls are losing their strength as they are not able to appreciate the price any further resulting into a huge possibility that the price might bounce back i.e. start declining from the supply level.\n\nExample of a Spinning Tops Candlestick Pattern\n\nIn the above USDCHF, daily chart, you will see that whenever a spinning top and/or tweezers are formed at the resistance and support levels, the probability of price bouncing back i.e. reversing from the demand and supply levels increases very highly.\n\n3. Doji\n\nDoji are extremely zero size skinny candlesticks i.e. they do not have any real body and/or the size of their real body is so slim that it almost appears like a straight line. A doji is formed after a fight more intense than a spinning top between the bulls and bears. In a spinning top, there is at least a small real body, but here in doji the real body is smaller than the spinning top or almost completely zero size.\n\nDoji's are of 4 types and due to their zero size real body; they look like a Straight Horizontal Line, Plus, Cross and/or like an Inverted Cross Sign. The 4 different types of dojis are as following\n\n4 Different Types of Doji Candlestick Patterns\n\nA Doji is the result of an intense fight between the bulls and bears with nobody having the upper hand and finally resulting into a tie i.e. the zero size real body with the upper and lower shadow reflects the price action information that it was very active and volatile during the day, both bulls and bears had an intense fight for gaining the upper hand but despite all their efforts resulted into a tie by equally closing at the opening price and leaving the significant highest and lowest traded price action in the form of shadows.\n\nDoji's play a very important role while analyzing the forex market because it is a key candlestick that gives us a cautionary signal for staying alert at the times of price action being traded at an extreme peak or trough price levels.\n\nDoji Forex Trading Strategy after a Bullish Candlestick\n\nIf a doji is formed after the long bearish candles at a demand level, then the probability of the future price movement bouncing back from the demand level increases because a doji at a support level means the bears are exhausted and has lost their strength as they are not able to decline price any further resulting into a huge possibility that the price might bounce back i.e. start appreciating from the demand level.\n\nDoji Forex Trading Strategy after a Bearish Candlestick\n\nIf a doji is formed after the long bullish candles at a supply level, then the probability of the future price movement bouncing back from the supply level increases because a doji at a resistance level means the bulls are exhausted and has lost their strength as they are not able to appreciate the price any further resulting into a huge possibility that the price might bounce back i.e. start declining from the supply level.\n\nExample of a Doji Candlestick Pattern\n\nIn the above USDCHF, 4 hours chart, you will see a doji and also it has retested twice at a resistance level and after that the price started declining very beautifully from the resistance level without any difficulties, however, after 3 big bearish candlesticks, a spinning top was formed at the previous support level, but as there was still power left with the bears they pierced a little more in the demand level and finally after a doji was formed at the demand level, the price showed appreciation and not only the price advanced but even broke the resistance level, further price was retested by a couple of tweezers and continued to trend upwards.\n\nWarning\n\nDo not trade every candlestick pattern, when you see it at the chart because they are tools meant to be used for trading in context i.e. any candlestick pattern, for example, if a doji is formed in the middle of a price swing, then it has to be ignored because it has formed in the middle, it might be a pause for getting refreshed because it is not at a demand level or a supply level, as a result, the probability is a very low for a reversal and the price might continue its original trend.\n\nConclusion\n\nKindly remember, a single and all candlestick patterns are very useful and should be used as a tool for confirmation of a trade setup with your personal trading strategy, because they provide the best possible probabilities for speculating the future price movement and also we are able to achieve miraculous rewards while trading forex if they are properly used in context i.e. if any single candlestick and/or all candlestick patterns is formed at a support and resistance levels; we get a double confirmation and hence we are able to profit from a low risk trading opportunity to reap huge profits.time"

      "text": "4 Keys To Improving Your Trading Process reach, but neither too hard, nor too easy. Ideally, this is setup so you are achieving an 80% success rate at whatever you are practicing. The reason for this is when something becomes too easy, you get bored, while when something becomes too hard, you get frustrated. Neither are ideal for the learning process. Video game manufacturers invest millions in testing just to make sure the level of challenge always lies in that sweet spot - neither too easy, nor too hard.\n\nSince we are talking about trading, getting an 80% accuracy or success rate is not easy. It takes years and hundreds, if not thousands of trades along with thousands of hours behind the charts. But what if your still in the learning process and do not have hundreds of trades or thousands of hours behind the charts? What then?\n\nThis is where higher time frames come in, such as the 1hr, 4hr and daily time frames. By starting off on these, you increase the probability of getting cleaner signals, while also not having to rush to make a decision as you would say in a 5min time frame. In the beginning, things can seem overwhelming in terms of all the information you have to process, so overburdening yourself with a task too difficult can and often is frustrating which stunts the learning process and can affect one's confidence. So this is why I recommend starting with the higher time frames as you have more time to process the information, read the price action, all while making a relaxed decision.\n\nStatistically, I have tested now over three dozen price action patterns, systems, formations, etc., and go figure, all of them perform much better with greater accuracy on these higher time frames whereas on a 5min chart they perform no better than a coin flip. This does not mean you cannot trade them on those time frames, but they require more information, more moving parts and more things to amplify the signal. But on the higher time frames, they perform statistically better as is, which makes it easier to trade.\n\nSo to make sure you are in the Zone of Proximal Development with your trading, stick to the higher time frames to start, get your accuracy and confidence up which accelerates the learning process, then decide if you want to stay there or go to the lower time frames. But nothing is more crucial in the beginning or developing stages then this.\n\nKey #2: Deliberate Practice\n\nMany of you have heard me recently talk about Anders Ericsson, the famous Cognitive Psychologist (the expert on expertise) who is famous for the 10,000 hour rule. Everyone has been talking about this lately, especially in trading, but not many of you have heard about his lesser known pre-requisite to the 10,000 hr rule and to becoming an expert. This is the rule of 'Deliberate Practice'\n\nWhat this describes is a constant sense of self-evaluation and consistent focus on one's weaknesses rather than playing to one's strengths. In fact, the practice of targeting your specific weaknesses is known as....The Zone of Proximal Development.\n\nMany people have something they are really good at, perhaps doing Sudoku puzzles, playing Tetris or various cognitive exercises. But the problem is once you get really good at them, you've built up the neural connections to perform the task well so there is lesser growth in continually repeating these tasks. But where you are weakest at is where you need to spend the most time as that is where all the growth is.\n\nThe height of your success is limited by your weakest link, so first is to find out what that is. Perhaps its focus and concentration, or money management, or keeping a trading journal, or following your system. Whatever your weakest area is in trading, first find it, then spend most of your efforts trying to develop that as its most likely the one thing which is separating you from losing money/barely breaking even, to making money week in-week out.\n\nHaving a trading journal, filling this out constantly and reviewing it weekly is one way to make sure you are engaging in deliberate practice.\n\nKey #3: Believe in the Learning Process\n\nDid you know that having a fixed mindset neurologically affects your intelligence and neural connections? Brains of people with fixed mindsets actually act differently than those with an open mindset. If you believe you will not be able to trade successfully, then it is unlikely you will ever learn from your mistakes. But if you believe in the ability to learn how to trade successfully, that you can do this, then your brain will actually wire itself differently from the mistakes you make.\n\nThe stronger the belief in your ability to learn, the more pronounced the brain activity lends itself to more adaptive responses to mistakes, both behaviorally, but also neurally. Thus, if you really believe in the learning process, even after you have made a silly, ridiculous or just bad mistake, what will happen is your brain will produce a larger amplitude in the signals at that moment which reflects a conscious allocation of attention to mistakes.\n\nThe larger the neural signal, the better the performance. So its very critical to be relaxed and aware after you've made a mistake because how you think and feel energetically in that moment will determine how your brain and central nervous system wires itself in that moment. It is also critical to remove any limiting or unconscious beliefs as they could actually be sabotaging your learning process and how your brain wires itself when trading.\n\nSo having an open mindset, not just in trading, but in life will actually help wire your brain to build better neural connections in the learning process. Hence the great Hamlet quote and how insightful it was;\n\n\"Why then 'tis none for you; for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.\" - Hamlet\n\nOur beliefs and construals can actually alter our reality. What we believe can, quite literally, be what becomes true.\n\nKey #4: Maintain a Healthy Brain\n\nThere are many ways to maintain an healthy brain, but we will limit it to 4 crucial things;\n\n1) Get Proper Amounts of Sleep - one of the most damaging things to brain performance is not having enough sleep. It actually reduces and affects your neurotransmitters which are crucial for brain signals completing their process and sending information from brain cell to brain cell. It can also make you more emotional which is the last thing you want to be during trading.\n\nIf your tired and did not sleep properly, don't trade that day. Your likely competing against people who have slept better, or even worse, a computer which does not need sleep and will execute just as good in the 8th hour of trading as in the 1st, so make sure your properly rested and if not - don't trade. There will be another day and another trade, the market isn't going anywhere.\n\n2) Have a Healthy Diet - drinking massive amounts of coffee overstimulates the adrenals and causes hyperactivity in the brain, which can cause increased emotional responses, too much analytical thinking and overstress the thinking process. Drinking alcohol conversely surpresses the adrenals, then while you sleep, your body being dehydrated and having lesser adrenaline, will overcompensate by producing larger amounts then normal so if you've hit the pints or bottle too much the previous night, take a day off and get your mind right for trading. It is likely dehydrated which is what actually causes the 'hangover' feeling.\n\nAlso, avoid eating wheat or sugar which affects both IQ, along with being toxic and damaging to the brain. Wheat has WGA (Wheat Germ Agglutinin) which is a neuro-toxin that passes through the blood-brain barrier, attaches itself to the myelin sheath (protective coating around neurons) which both injures the growth and affects the health of brain cells. A 2011 study actually demonstrated how Japanese schoolchildren who ate wheat everyday had a lower IQ by 4pts on average than non-wheat eaters so lay off the pan (spanish for bread).\n\nSugar in higher levels has been known to damage the hippocampus (region largely responsible for memory and learning). It is also considered to be as toxic, addictive and dangerous as tobacco and alcohol so lay off the krispy kreme's.\n\nLastly, Omega-3 fatty acids in particular have shown to be associated with improved mood and cognition. You can find a lot of Omega-3 in grass-fed meat, eggs, fish, and nuts. Another important feature of a healthy diet is protective antioxidants, which can be found in many fruits, vegetables, and green tea. Blueberries and strawberries, for example, have shown to improve memory and cognition by cleaning out toxins in the brain that cause age-related memory loss and mental decline.\n\nSo have a healthy diet to give your brain every edge it can get when trading.\n\n3) Exercise also really helps to lubricate the brain and help keep the brain fit, healthy and strong so exercising regularly is critical to maintaining a healthy brain. It will help replenish oxygen levels to your brain along with stimulating the growth of new cells so step away from the charts at some point to get some exercise.\n\n4) Challenge Your Brain - your brain needs exercise too and there are many ways to challenge your brain to build new connections, such as:\n\nLearning a new hobby Reading books Yoga or Meditation Using brain training programs such as Brain Workshop or Lumosity Being more creative, such as playing music, painting, writing, or cooking Solving puzzles, such as crosswords or Sudokus Play strategy-based video games (my favorite :-) Learning a new language\n\nAll of these will build new connections and increase your grey matter in the brain which is critical for clear thinking, being creative, having a strong working memory along with good pattern recognition (key for traders).\n\nSo there you have it. Those are 4 keys to help improve your trading process which will give you a natural edge as you learn to trade profitably. Don't forget to share your comments as I always appreciate hearing from you.\n\na very good article. especially pointing out that one must focus on their weakest link( after identifying it). the only thing i don t like is the emphasis on being right. the idea is to be profitable, you can make as much money being right 40 % of the time as you can being right 80 % of the time. just my opinion ( because i am me ) and no disrespect intended.\n\nTis a good point regarding the accuracy. Although consider if one is 40% accurate and just as profitable as the 80% accurate trader, then they are doing so by finding opportunities with larger targets or R:R ratios which likely means less of them and also a harder task for a developing trader, let alone a really good trader.\n\nBut in the beginning of one's trading career - confidence is key because one's psychology is not as robust since they have lesser experience to draw upon, so by being more accurate, this is used as a mechanism to help build confidence. Most beginning traders would have a hard time winning 4 out of 10 trades psychologically, let alone being less accurate then a coin flip, so to build the confidence and experience, i tend to learn towards more successes and wins.\n\nTotally agree with you there Chris - we know we can never be perfect and 100% accurate - but to aim for 80% and achieve over 70% accuracy is all achievable- and boosts your confidence and psychology. That then helps with your trading performance and your financial results. - regards Peter\n\nHi chris that clears it up. Philosophical difference of opinion as to what better boosts confidence I suppose. I use your buddy trading the aus USd a while back . Not many trades and a win percent around 60 with a very good track record. I don't doubt there are those who can achieve 80 percent win with 2:1 or better return but I would think they would be quite rare. You start doing the mAth on those figures and it's pretty incredible."

      "text": "I was thinking about two types of parameters one can use in a model. Open-ended parameters like SMAs or percentage-based filters, where the value used can be anything from zero to infinite and those like percent, where the value can only be within a certain range, like 0% to 100%.\n\nAre either of these two types more susceptible to curve-fitting? It would seem that you could say the first type is because the ability to calibrate the value of the parameter to historical data is nearly infinite, so someone could come to the conclusion that the 53-day SMA with a 13.2% volatility filter were the optimal values for an entry strategy, whereas with the second type, your ability to fit to a curve is limited by the range the variable can take on, meaning you'd be better off basing a model on the second type, to the extent that you can.\n\nI'm just thinking out loud a bit, so if this simple comparison and conclusion is flawed, I'm happy to hear why. I realize that you'd kind of have to ignore the potential for infinite subdividing of the range-constrained parameter, so that you don't end up with a value like 15.898798798% as your model input.\n\nOpen-ended parameters are contrained by maxbarsback. If you have 4,000 bars in a file it does not make any sense to use a 4001 bars sma. So there goes you otherwise nice try.\n\nOK, so there is a practical difficulty, in some cases.\n\nDoes that mean that the distinction is invalid and that there really aren't two types of parameter here?\n\nI suppose on the most macro level, if a market has been traded for 50,000 days, it can't make sense to use the 50,001 SMA, so not only would there be data limitations on the parameter values, there would be historical limitations as well.\n\nIt still seems intuitive (which isn't always correct, obviously) that the fewer values a parameter can take on, the less susceptible to curve-fitting the model would be, which would mean that binary parameters would be the least likely to be curve fit, which seems correct had me until you mentioned needing to look at it as a function of time.\n\nSounds like you are saying the less sensitive, the better, unless you want to use polynomials. Personally, I do not use them, with one exception.\n\nI know relatively little about advanced statistics and the science of modeling. However, I have worked with Neuroshell for a number of years ( a neural networking program for the market). I have found that range limited items work better for longer modeling periods. If I look at the change in the Close over a period of years, as the price of an instrument climbs, the network sees a $1 change in a $50 stock as different than a $2 change in the same stock when it is at $100. However, if I look at the percent change in the close (2%), the net sees the same value. Thus, range limited info, for longer-term models, seems to get more robust results. Short-term modeling does not suffer to the same extent. At least this is true in the models I can develop. More sophisticated modelers might not find this to be true in their models. This might not apply to instruments, which by their nature are more range-bound, like short-bonds. But I've never tried modeling them.\n.\nJack"

      "text": "How to create market indicators using the composite function - Part 2\n\nUpdated on 2010-08-24\n\nAfter introducing the \"Count\" and \"Sum\" calculation methods and how to use them in order to create market indicators (Market Indicators), we will continue our presentation with a new type in the composite function.\n\nThe \"Avg\" calculation method calculates the average number of the different values of the provided time series or indicator. Internally, this method simply calculates the sum of the time series values that occurred on the same date and also keeps track of the number of these values. At the end, the function divides the sum that was calculated first by the number of values.\nThe \"Avg\" function is very powerful and it can be used in different ways to calculate composites and indices. Almost any kind of market indices can be created by applying the composite function with the \"Avg\" calculation method; this includes capitalization-weighted indices (such as the S&P 500 or Russell 2000), equal-weighted indices, fundamental-weighted indices and volume-weighted indices.\n\nHere are some market indicator examples:\n\nComp(rsi(14), \"avg\")\nThis trading indicator calculates the average RSI or relative strength index value of all stocks or securities included in the analysis. You can then compare this composite to the oversold or overbought threshold levels and determine whether the market is bullish or bearish based on the relative strength index interpretation.\n\nComp(sma(30), \"avg\")\nThe above indicator returns the average 30-bar simple moving average of all your stocks. This can be used for example by calculating another composite that returns the average 60-Bar simple moving average and then comparing both values. The signal the market generates is bullish if the first moving average is higher than the second one -> Comp(sma(30), \"avg\") > Comp(sma(60), \"avg\")\n\nComp(close > ref(close, 1), \"avg\")\nUsed with the \"sum\" function, this formula would have returned the number of advancing stocks. However, with the \"avg\" function, the formula returns the percentage of advancing stocks or the proportion of stocks that are advancing among stocks included in the analysis (Backtesting, Screening, Rules analyzing...)\n\nThe next trading indicator assumes you have a fundamental database that contains the market capitalization data for all of your stocks. Note that you can also use this function if you only have the number of outstanding shares data; this is because the market capitalization of a stock is equal to its share price multiplied by the number of outstanding shares.\n\nComp(GetData(\"fund\", \"mkcap\") * close, \"avg\")\nHere is how to create a capitalization-weighted market index. Take the time-series that corresponds to the market capitalization data of your stock and then multiply that value with the close price. Applying the composite's average method to this formula produces our custom capitalization-weighted index.\n\nIn composite calculations, the \"Avg\" function is one of the most powerful tools to create different and various market indices or composites. The composite plug-in still has many other calculation methods; we will see that in a future post."

However the level of transparency and format of data currently available to investors varies tremendously from fund-to-fund and from strategy-to-strategy.\n\nThe Open Protocol is a pragmatic response to this challenge. Managers could use it to streamline their reporting requirements, ensuring that all clients are treated equally and, ideally attracting more stable institutional capital.\n\nWhy should Investors ask for Open Protocol Reports?\n\nIf available, investors have to ask for transparency. If investors receive it, they have to view and monitor it. However the problem is that right now there are:\n\nMultiple sources of data\n\nInconsistent calculation methodologies\n\nDifferent reporting formats.\n\nInvestors are entering a perilous twilight zone: more information means more responsibility, however, that information is not currently harnessed in a way that best facilitates monitoring.\n\nTransparency is meaningful if it is:\n\nBased on a uniform framework\n\nDerived from consistent data inputs\n\nCalculated by following standard methodologies\n\nReported in a consistent format\n\nReceived regularly in a timely fashion.\n\nThe Open Protocol is a pragmatic response to this challenge and has the potential to be the most significant gain for investors to come out of this period.

      "text": "Measures of Upside/Downside separate the volumes for rising markets from those in falling markets. Since volume is independent of price, it makes a valuable tool for measuring the quality of a price trend.\n\nThere are two common measures for Upside/Downside:\n\nThe Upside/Downside Ratio, and\n\nUpside/Downside Volume Line Index\n\nOverview\n\nThe Upside/Downside Ratio is calculated by dividing the daily volume of advancing stocks on a particular exchange by the daily volume of declining stocks. The NYSE Upside/Downside Ratio, for example, shows the relationship between rising and falling volume on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nA U/D Ratio greater than 1 shows there is more volume with rising price stocks than with falling price stocks.\n\nSignals\n\nThe higher the U/D ratio, the more bullish the signal: high readings above 4 are considered bullish signals, and low readings below .75 are considered bearish signals.\n\nMartin Zweig wrote in Winning on Wall Street, \"Every bull market in history, and many good intermediate advances, have been launched with a buying stampede that included one or more 9-to-1 days\" (\"9-to-1\" refers to a day were the Upside/Downside Ratio is greater than nine). He goes on to say, \"the 9-to-1 up day is a most encouraging sign, and having two of them within a reasonably short span is very bullish. I call it a \"double 9-to-1\" when two such days occur with three months of one another.\"\n\nOverview\n\nThe Upside/Downside Volume (U/DV) Line is constructed by keeping a running total for the difference between the daily volume in advancing and declining issues.\n\nSince the indicator starts with an arbitrary number, it is usually wise to choose a relatively large number (five thousand works well).\n\nA moving average can be constructed from weekly and monthly figures and plotted alongside the U/DV line.\n\nSignals\n\nNormally, the U/DV line will move up and down with the price, and trend lines drawn on the U/DV and price lines will correspond.\n\nWhen the U/DV line doesn't confirm a price move (divergence), a signal is given for a possible trend reversal. For example, upside volume may fail to expand to support increased prices.\n\nSignals are also provided when the U/DV line crosses its moving average."

      "text": "&nbsp There is a concept I do not understand and I cannot find a sample response in the Q&A section. If a stock is in an uptrend, will the average value for the 200 day Moving Average (MA) be greater or lesser than the 50 MA and will the same principle hold when the stock is trending down or decreasing in price?\n(January 3, 2001)\n\n&nbsp Trends are powerful. Trendlines and moving averages map out a stocks' direction, and until broken, they are powerful indicators of direction. Trendlines and short term moving averages (e.g., 10 day moving average) are very strict measures of stock direction. A stock can break a short term moving average but recover. Conservative investors will sell on a break of that MVA, while others who are riding a long term position tend to hang on.\n\nWhen a stock is trending up for awhile, the short term moving averages will stack up on top of the longer term MVA's, e.g., 10 on 18 on 50 on 200. When stocks are in uptrends they often use the 10 or 18 day moving averages as support, and we can enter positions on tests of those levels. That has not been the case for tech stocks, though we saw that in stocks such as UNH up through the end of 200 as it moved in a strong uptrend from March 2000.\n\nWhen a stock is trending down, the MVA's will flip with the 200 on top, then the 50, the 18 and the 10. Just as when a stock is trending up and tests the 10 and 18 day MVA's on pullbacks, a downtrending stock will rise up to the 10 and 18 day MVA's and fall back."

This creates arbitrage opportunities. I have not yet gotten round to tote-only markets like the US or HK, but know that things there are more complicated by the absence of tradable updating prices. In the stock market, I'm sure it's also insiders or big money that triggers the herding and I hope to get around to this next year. Meanwhile, see A. Schnytzer and A.

      "text": "Technical analysis (TA) is the interpretation of data present in stock charts. Although the basic assumption of future price movements being dependent on past price movement is never certain, many traders use TA as their primary means of making tactical buy and sell decisions.\n\nUsing Daily Moving Average\n\nThe daily moving average is a popular technical indicator. Many readers wrote in about their use of moving averages. Here is a good example, sent in by Mark T.\n\nFor the big picture, I look at earnings momentum as well as sales. If the company looks solid (and I DO rely on the recommendations of major brokerages houses and Briefing.com), I look at its technicals--price more than volume. If a solid company has dropped well below its 50-day moving average (like 20-25%), and it appears to be forming a base there, I buy it. If there is no base evident, then I probably would wait until it breaks above the 50 dma. If a stock is below the 200 dma, I do not buy. For the exact day to buy, I may use stochastics.\n\nThis methodology works best for stocks that are stuck in trading ranges. For a stock that is headed straight down, it obviously will not work. This is the reason that Mark T. avoids stocks that are below the 200-day moving average.\n\nBroken Downtrends and Support Lines\n\nAnother popular technical analysis method is to look for broken downtrends. There are numerous ways to \"see\" a broken downtrend, but all are based upon the assumption that the stock has fallen more than it should have. If you can develop a reliable method of determining when the downtrend has truly been broken, this tactic can be very effective.\n\nMichael B. sent in an example of how he uses support lines to determine when to buy.\n\nI always trade on technicals and invest on fundamentals. While sound fundamentals are open for interpretation, technicals are not. My favorite technical strategies:\n\n1: Buying when a downtrend is broken on high volume. This is usually the start of a bigger move. You will also get some great bull flags off of this situation, and that is my favorite pattern.\n\n2: Support/Resistance Lines. I rarely lose when buying against support, or selling when the support is lost. The 2 things to watch when using an S/R Line is a Bull Flag pattern and the 50 DMA. If the 50 dma turns up as the stock moves towards the resistance, then there is a good chance it will break through and go higher. Many times, it will bump its head on the resistance line and form a bull flag pattern. (a few days vertical, followed by a sideways trend) Ideally, the bottom of the flag will touch the rising 50 dma, hold, then blow through resistance. When resistance clearly becomes support, I like to buy more stock. I'll sell if the new support is broken.\n\nDetermining when \"support is broken\" is another technical analysis technique that varies by practitioner.\n\n(Actually, you might get an argument from us about \"fundamentals are open for interpretation, but technicals are not,\" but differing opinions are what make a market.)\n\nShort-Term MA Crossing Long-Term MA\n\nAnother technical tactic is looking at moving averages of differing duration, and making a buy decision, based upon the interaction of the two lines, as suggested by Steven Groom.\n\nI focus on the best companies in the leading industries and industry groups moving up through the ranks. This information I find from Investor Business Daily and their online service Daily Graphs. I download the databases and filter and sort until I have stocks with RS [Editor note: Relative Strength] and EPS greater than 90 in the top ten industry groups. Then the stocks are further filtered based on EPS and Sales growth rates, Market Caps greater than $500M, average daily volume greater than 100,000 shares. Stocks are placed on watch lists using\neSignal with high/low prices and volume alerts placed on each. By this time I have approximately 100 stocks. Trading is completely based upon simple TA indicators, 5/15/50/200 EMA and volume. Buying is based upon the 5 EMA moving up through the 15 and 50 EMA, with at least 25% increase in daily volume. The alerts in\neSignal normally indicate these price moves. Selling is based upon the reverse and I always sell a stock if it falls 7% below my purchase price.\n\nSelling a stock that falls 7% is a serious mistake, if buying on an investment premise, but on a trading premise, as above, it's simply \"admitting a mistake.\"\n\nFinal Comments\n\nThere is no such thing as a \"certain\" method of making money.\n\nIf there were, all the money would migrate to the person who possessed that knowledge.\n\nNevertheless, it is often worth considering the tactics of your fellow traders, particularly if you are a TA trader, as all of us can always learn something new."

      "text": "Candlestick Patterns Explained\n\nOne of the most powerful tools a binary options trader can possess is the ability to read a chart pattern for purposes of identifying and successfully profiting from price trends and market volatility. While fundamental analysis can be useful and beneficial for investors with a relatively long time horizon, the efficiency and lightning fast information flow of modern financial markets supersedes the ability of traders to capitalize on fundamentals in the short term. The goal for binary options traders is simply to identify the potential for the underlying asset to reach or surpass the designated strike price at expiration. Therefore, by its very nature, fundamental analysis falls short in providing the necessary tools for traders to evaluate the likelihood of favorable price movements during the specified time interval before the option's expiration. Binary options traders can benefit by using technical analysis to inform their decisions over these short-term time intervals. Specifically, candlestick patterns are a powerful analytical method for traders to utilize in understanding what direction a particular market is likely to trend. In fact, candlestick patterns are so powerful that they have remained popular analytical tools among traders for the past three centuries.\n\nCandlestick patterns originated from Japanese rice traders in the 18th century and gained mainstream popularity with technical analysts throughout the world during the technological transformation of the financial industry. Candlestick patterns are effective instruments for identifying price trends over all time intervals from minutes, hours, months and years. The primary benefit candlestick patterns offer technical analysts and traders is the unique ability to signal market pivot points on a chart which can reveal new directions for price trends. This is powerful information for binary options traders who are searching for market trend reversals on underlying securities when they are formulating their trading decisions to determine the best strike price. For instance, if a trader can quickly pinpoint a market top on a given security it simply follows that the appropriate trade should be a put purchase instead of buying a call. Likewise, a determination of a market bottom would entail a call purchase and avoid buying any puts. These infrequent, yet highly powerful, turning points in a market are where binary options traders can reap tremendous profits and minimize risks. Most markets typically trade within a specific range or follow an easily identifiable price trend. The unique ability for candlestick patterns to signal the top or bottom of the price range, or warn of a reversal in a trending market for a given security, makes these tools one of the most useful to a trader who is utilizing the power of technical analysis.\n\nThis method of displaying price information on a chart comes from the fact that the components being expressed often look like the form of a candlestick with a body that resembles a \"candle\" and \"sticks\" that can take the appearance of a wick or tail. Specifically, each \"candlestick\" represents a time interval on the chart that can be selected and defined by the trader according to the trading strategy that is being used, whether minutes, hours, days, or weeks. Within each interval, there are four primary components that give each candlestick its appearance. The body of the \"candle\" is illustrated by the difference between the opening and closing prices of the underlying security during the specific time period. The \"stick\" – either a \"wick\" or a \"tail\", and sometimes both – represents the high and low prices for the time period. There is a final element that is a key to understanding candlesticks, and that is its color, which signifies whether the security closed higher or lower than its opening price. Typically, these colors are either white or green for a higher close, or black or red for a lower closing price. A trader is given a total of five vital elements regarding the price action of a given security in each candlestick, yet when combined on a chart with consecutive time intervals, these provide a clearer view of the market for binary options traders.\n\nGenerally speaking, a long solid body on a candlestick indicates a strong directional price trend for that interval. These are known as marubozu candles and can be useful in identifying a trending market and capturing a momentum trade. It is the candlesticks with long wicks or tails that create some of the best trading opportunities for binary options traders because they often signal market turning points. Candlesticks with small bodies and larger sticks are categorized as hammers, dojis, shooting stars, inverted hammers, and hanging men. These often represent indecisiveness and lack of market conviction in the prevailing trend. These patterns are especially useful for binary options traders, and when combined with other analytical tools such as volume and relative strength indicators, can result in executing precision trades. In technical analysis, each chart tells a story about the underlying security, understanding the power of candlestick patterns is an essential element to becoming a knowledgeable and successful binary options trader."

As buying put options provides you with the right to sell your stock at a set price, you are able to lock in a sell price in a falling market to either profit from this move or protect existing positions.\n\nThe conventional approach to investing in stock markets is to buy in a rising market and to stay out of a falling market. Put options, however, give you an opportunity to profit from a falling market. The value of an in-the-money put option increases as the price of the underlying stock falls. The further the market falls, the more your put option increases in value."

      "text": "Learn Forex: Can Trading Be As Easy As ABCD?\n\nArticle Summary: Once you've spent a little time in the markets, you become familiar with the fact that markets are quick to consolidate after a trend. However, knowing when to jump back in the trend can be difficult to answer. The ABCD pattern takes the shape of a lightning bolt and is comprised of 3 distinct moves within specific Fibonacci relationships that can help you spot potential reversal zones so you can jump back in the direction of the overall trend.\n\nThe AB=CD pattern is simple once you know how to spot it and draw the proper Fibonacci retracements. The AB=CD pattern is a price structure that is adapted from another pattern known as the Gartley Pattern and can be applied to all markets in all time frames. Because a picture is worth a thousand words, let's get started with a recent set up:\n\nLearn Forex: AB=CD Pattern on GBPJPY, H4 Chart\n\nCreated with FXCM's Marketscope/Trading Station\n\nThere are three legs to this structure that will appear on the chart:\n\nA to B\n\nB to C\n\nC to D\n\nEach part has a Fibonacci sequence that will confirm the move and the completion of the short term consolidation against the overall trend. Here are the Fibonacci ratios to determine the completion of the AB=CD pattern.\n\nC will be a .382 (less common), .500, .618 or .764 retracement of the AB Leg\n\nD will be a 1.27 or 1.618 Fibonacci extension of the AB Leg and will complete the pattern\n\nNaturally, there is a Bullish (meaning Buy at point D) and Bearish (meaning Sell at point D) Pattern. Here are the patterns absent from a current chart so you can see the Fibonacci ratios on clear lines:\n\nLearn Forex: Classic AB=CD Patterns\n\nOne important note is that for the pattern to be valid, the C leg cannot extend or break the beginning of the pattern. Of course, we're looking for the BC leg to finish at the possible Fibonacci retracement levels. Once that level is confirmed, we now look for the completion of D.\n\nThe completion of the CD leg will be measured as a Fibonacci extension of 1.27 or 1.618 of the BC leg. You can also take the distance of the AB leg to see how far the CD leg will travel as the AB=CD pattern gets its name because the two legs often mirror each other in distance and time.\n\nHere is the same chart as above, GBPJPY, with the Fibonacci relationships explained.\n\nOnce the pattern has played out to the above ratios, you want to set your stop below or above the completion of D. Once you've done that, you can look for price to retrace back to point A or at least you can set a profit target for half or two thirds of the entire AB=CD move.\n\nThe AB=CD is a simple but powerful pattern. As you can see there many moving parts but when you learn how to spot and measure them they can be a powerful way to jump back into a trend after consolidation.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe two takeaway's when trading this pattern is that it is best used in the direction of the overall trend. To help you identify the overall trend, you can use the Ichimoku Cloud or a Moving Average . Also, do not try and anticipate the pattern as it is forming. In other words, you are better served in finding a completed AB=CD pattern rather than trying to trade and guess the completion of an AB=CD patternAre you new to the FX market?\n\nSave hours in figuring out what FOREX trading for your trading."

The downside to a covered call...\n\n*Updated November 15th 2012* For a modern day example of this, see the stock MNST.\nA covered call is an option combination trade which involves buying the stock, and selling a call against that stock.\n[Article is a reprint of the original.........\n\nCovered call strategies can be useful for generating profits in flat markets and, in some scenarios, they can provide higher returns with lower risk than their underlying investments. In this article, you'll learn how to apply leverage...\n\nA Covered Call is a financial position in which you own an underlying asset, and write, or short a call option on the underlying. In other words, you have sold to the buyer the right to purchase an asset from you, but you also own the asset in the event that they exercise the call option. A quick example would help illustrate the point. You short a call option on 100 shares of Company Z, but you also currently own 100 shares of Company Z. If the call is exercised, you deliver the 100 shares and receive the strike price. Conversely, if it is not exercised, you keep the shares of the company, and you also earn the price you charged for selling the call (often times referred to as the call premium).\n\nCovered call writers should be aware of volatility's effect on their short option position. An increase in implied volatility will make it more expensive in the event that the investor wishes to \"buy back\" the option prior to expiration.\n\nCovered Call Strategies\n\nThere are two common ways to use covered calls:\n\nBuy-write: A buy-write (or buy-and-write) is the purchase of the stock and immediate sale of the call option. It is the immediate sale of the call that sets this tactic apart from the legging-in strategy. Most retail brokerage platforms offer the trader the ability to enter both orders (long stock/short option) all at once. The index that charts this strategy for the S&P 500 is BXY (see image at bottom).\n\nLeg-in: Legging in to the covered call means purchasing the stock and in a later transaction selling the call. This tactic implies that the trader can time his/her way into the short option position sometime in the future for a higher profit than if they simply did a buy-write.\n\nThe covered call trade has always been known as an income strategy as you receive premium for selling calls against your stock. This is the most popular rationale for implementing this type of tradings. However, there are many more dimensions that can be coupled with covered call trading to further enhance the potential for profits. Here is a list of 8 ways to profit from covered calls:\n\n1. Selling the classic covered call against stock you own. You make money with the time decay of the short call. usually you sell the near month or next month out so you can continue to compound your money.\n\n2. You can use LEAPs as stock replacement to leverage a covered call trade which will increase potential profit returns. Click here for a recent article on this topic.\n\n3. You can sell out-of-the-money (OTM) calls as your short call. Here you get the call premium and potential for a capital gain as the OTM call offers some upside profits for the stock price to increase.\n\n4. You can make more money on a short call when volatility collaspse early in the trade and you close the trade. We have all been in covered call trades when after a few days the call option loses value and you find yourself in a very profitable trade. You can close this short call to lock in profits.\n\n5. You can trade the short call as the stock price changes. For example, if the stock price decreases, you can close the short option early for a profit. Then, the call can be written again when the stock prices snaps back to higher levels. This is similar to channeling stocks by trading the short call against stock price changes.\n\n6. You can roll up or roll out the short calls to a higher strike price or to a later expiration month. This allows you to squeeze extra profits out of a stock price rise.\n\n7. You can add option legs to a short call to create spread positions such as a bull or bear call spread. This is good to take profits from a rising covered call trade or a falling stock price.\n\n8. You can add a long protective put to the covered call position as it will increase in value as the stock price decreases. This is usually utilized as protection against stock declines but can create more income when a stock price declines while you are holding a covered call position.\n\nThere are two types of volatility used in security analysis: historical volatility measures the past price movements and implied volatility that indicates the potential level of future volatility a security is implying.\n\nHistorical volatility (HV) is the price changes of a security over a period of time so it is really a standard deviation calculation. This means it is how much a stock price has moved over time usually expressed as a 10-day or 30-day volatility. For example, a stock with a volatility of 70% is high and should be considered quite volatile. This is not the type of stock to write a covered call on. In contrast, a stock with a volatility of 20% is a low volatility stock and selectable for a covered call.\n\nThe stock's volatility can help us forecast short-term price ranges and the relative value for an option price. The option premiums of highly volatile stocks will have a high value while a low volatility stock will have a much lower premium. An options premium will be influenced by the probability the stock price will move above or below the various strike prices. Of course, the excitement of high premiums leads to some investors falling into the premium trap by chasing highly volatile stocks that impose a significant risk to loss of capital.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is the stock volatility as a confirmation of the stock chart. Suppose you are looking at a stock chart that seems to be in a trading price range that is stable. The 30-day historical volatility is 72%. Is this a good stock candidate for a covered write? The correct answer is no if you are seeking a conservative covered call investment. Compare the 72% volatility to a stock with a 30 day HV of 25% which is lower than the S&P 500 at the same time. I would select the stock with a 25% 30 day volatility for a more conservative covered call investment.\n\nThe bottom line is that adding volatiliy to your covered call selection process will increase your chances of morw winning trades and a more consistant income stream. There will be several more posts about volatility in covered call investing in the coming days.\n\nWhat are the uses of covered calls?\n\nBecause an investor who takes a covered call position has the underlying asset, in the event the buyer of the call option exercises he can deliver with certainty. Therefore, investors sell short-term call contracts (usually monthly) against their underlying securities as a means of generating income while owning the shares. This allows them to earn money even if the asset value does not increase. For instance, suppose you bought 100 shares of Company X at $10 per share. You then sell a call option for $1 against those 100 shares with a strike price of $12. As long as the price of the stock remains below $12, you get to keep the shares as well as the $1. If the price of Company X stock stays at $10 all the way until the call option expires, then you have generated $1, yet you still own the stock. However, if the stock price rises to $14, then the stock is called away, and you earn only the $12 strike price and the $1 premium for selling the call.\n\nPotential pitfalls of covered calls\n\nA major pitfall of covered calls involves writing the call with a strike price below the cost basis (cost basis means the cost to you of acquiring the shares). If your shares are called away, and the premium plus cost basis is not equal to or greater than the strike, you are guaranteed a loss on the position. For example, you paid $1000 in total for 100 shares of Company X ($10 per share), and you sold a call option on these 100 shares with a strike price of $9 per share. If you do not charge more than $1 for the call option, you are guaranteed a loss in the event they are called away since they pay only $9 per share ($900 total), and you are earning less than $100 for selling the call. If the shares fall below $9, you will suffer a loss since in total you will receive less than $1000, which is the price you paid for the shares."

      "text": "Counter trend trading is affected by market cycles and more sensitive to the bar period than trend trading. Bob has told Alice that bar periods that are in sync with the worldwide markets - such as 4 or 8 hours - are especially profitable with this type of trading. Therefore she has set the bar period to a fixed value of 4 hours, or 240 minutes:\n\nBarPeriod = 240;\n\nThe counter trend trade rules are contained in the following lines that calculate the buy/sell signal:\n\nThe first line sets up a price series just as in the last workshop. The next one calculates the dominant period. That's the most significant cycle in a price curve which is normally a superposition of many cycles. If prices would oscillate up and down every two weeks, the dominant period would be 60 - that's the length of two weeks, resp. 10 trade days, counted in 4-hour-bars. Alice uses the DominantPeriod() analysis function with a cutoff period of 30 bars for finding the main price oscillation cycle in the range below 100 bars. The result DomPeriod is a series of dominant periods.\n\nBecause the dominant period fluctuates a lot, the next line passes the series through a lowpass filter, just like the price curve of the last workshop. The result is stored in a variable (not a series, thus no '*') LowPeriod that is the lowpass filtered dominant period of the current price curve.\n\nIn the next line, a highpass filter is fed with the price curve and its cutoff frequency is set to the dominant period. This removes the trend and all cycles that are lower than the dominant period from the price curve. The HighPass() function is similar to the LowPass function, it just does the opposite, and leaves only high frequencies, i.e. short cycles, in the price curve. The result is a modified price curve that consists mostly of the dominant cycle. It's stored in a new series named HP (for HighPass).\n\nAlice is not finished yet. The HP series is now compressed into a Gaussian distribution by applying the Fisher Transformation. This is an operation used to transform an arbitrary curve into a range where most values are in the middle - around 0 - and only few values are outside the +1...-1 range. For this transformation she calls the Fisher() function. It compresses the last 500 bars from the HP series into the Gaussian distributed Signal series. This method of trading with highpass filters, cycle detectors, and Fisher transform was developed by John Ehlers, an engineer who used signal processing methods for trading.\n\nThe next two lines define a new variable Threshold with a value of 1.0, and place a stop loss at an adaptive distance from the price, just as in Alice's trend trading script from some lessons ago. The ATR function is again used to determine the stop loss.\n\nWhen the Signal curve cosses the negative threshold from above - meaning when Signal falls below -1 - the price is supposedly at the bottom of the dominant cycle, so we expect the price to rise and buy long. When the threshold is crossed from below - meaning Signal rises above 1 - the price is at a peak and we buy short. This is just the opposite of what we did in trend trading. For identifying the threshold crossing we're using the crossOver() and crossUnder() functions.\n\n- Obviously, these trade rules are somewhat more complicated than the simple lowpass function of the previous lesson. So Alice needs to see how the various series look, for checking if everything works as supposed. The next line (at the end of the script)\n\nplot(\"DominantPeriod\", LowPeriod, NEW, BLUE);\n\ngenerates a plot of the LowPeriod variable in a NEW chart window with color BLUE. We can use this function to plot anything into the chart, either in the main chart with the price and equity curve, or below the main chart in a new window. The Signal curve and the upper and lower Threshold are plotted in another new chart window:\n\nThe first statement plots the Signal[0] value as a red curve (as we remember, adding a [0] to a series name gives its most recent value). The next two statements plot the positive and negative Threshold with two black lines in the same chart window. Note that the plot function always expects a value, not a series - that's why we needed to add the [0] to the Signal name.\n\nPlotWidth = 1000;\nPlotHeight1 = 300;\n\nThis just sets the width and height of the chart window. Below is the resulting chart. Load the script workshop5_1 and make sure that EUR/USD is selected. Click [Test], then click [Result]:\n\nThe blue curve in the middle window is the plot of LowPeriod. It moves mostly between 25 and 40 bars, corresponding to a 4..7 days dominant cycle. The bottom window shows the Signal series. The black lines are the thresholds that trigger buy and sell signals when Signal crosses over or under them. Plotting variables and series in the chart greatly helps to understand and improve the trade rules. For examining a part of the chart in details, the StartDate and NumDays variables can be used to limit the number of bars to plot and 'zoom into' a part of the chart.\n\nWe can see that the script generates 139% annual return. This is already better than the simple trend trading script from the last workshop; but the equity curve is still not satisfying. Alice has to do more for her fee and improve this strategy further. We'll do that tomorrow.\n\nAre the functions you referenced (fisher, lowpass, highpass, dominantcycle) already included with Zorro?\n\nIf so, are they open source?Today we'll learn how to improve a strategy's performance with optimization. That basically means that some essential strategy parameters are optimized to achieve the maximum profit for a certain bar period, asset, and market situation. That's why all better trade platforms have an optimizer, usually with an extra window or program outside the script. With Zorro, the script controls anything, and thus also determines which parameters are optimized in which way.\n\nAlice's has added some commands to the strategy for parameter optimization (select Workshop5_2):\n\nParameter optimization requires some additional settings at the begin of the script:\n\nset(PARAMETERS);\nBarPeriod = 240;\nLookBack = 500;\n\nPARAMETERS is a \"switch\" that, when set, tells Zorro to generate and use optimized parameters. LookBack must be set to the 'worst case' lookback time of the strategy. The lookback time is required by the strategy for calculating its initial values before it can start trading. It's usually identical to the maximum time period of functions such as HighPass() or Fisher(). If the lookback time depends on an optimized parameter, Zorro can not know it in advance; so we should make it a habit to set it directly through the LookBack variable when we optimize a strategy. In this case we set it at 500 bars to be on the safe side.\n\nSome parameters have now been replaced by optimize function calls. We also notice that the line with the Threshold variable has now moved to the begin of the code. This is because more important parameters should be optimized first, and the most important is Threshold which determines the sensitivity of the strategy and has the largest influence on its profit. It is now set to the return value of the optimize function. optimize is called with 3 numbers; the first is the parameter default value, which is 1 - just the value that Threshold had before. The next two numbers, 0.5 and 2, are the parameter range, i.e. the lower and upper limit of the Threshold variable. So Threshold can now have any value from 0.5 to 2. During the optimization process, Zorro will try to find the best value within this range.\n\nAlice has selected two more parameters to be replaced by optimize calls: a factor for the HighPass time period, and a factor for the stop loss distance. The default values are just the values used in the first version of the counter trading script. Theoretically, there could be even more parameters to optimize - for instance the DominantPeriod cutoff value, or the number of bars for the ATR function. But the more parameters we have, and the larger their range is, the higher is the danger of overfitting the strategy. Overfitted strategies perform well in the simulation, but poor in real trading. Therefore only few essential parameters should be optimized, and only within reasonable parameter ranges.\n\nFor training the strategy, click [Train] and observe what the optimize calls do. During the training phase, which can take about one minute depending on the PC speed, you'll see the following charts pop up:\n\nParameter 1 (Threshold)\n\nParameter 2 (LowPeriod factor)\n\nParameter 3 (Stop factor)\n\nThe parameter charts show how the parameter values affect the performance of the strategy. The red bars are the profit factor of the training period - that is the total win divided by the total loss. The dark blue bars are the number of losing trades and the light blue bars are the number of winning trades. We can see that Threshold has two profit maxima at 1.10 and 1.50; the LowPeriod factor has a maximum slightly above 1. The Stop factor - the 3rd parameter - has a maximum at about 7. We can also see that a distant stop, although it increases the risk, also increases the number of profitable trades, the 'accuracy' of the strategy.\n\nThe 3 optimized parameters are stored in the file Data/Workshop5_2_EURUSD.par. Different parameter sets could be generated for other assets. A click on [Test], then on [Result] displays the equity chart of the optimized strategy:\n\nWe can see how training has improved the script. The annual return now exceeds 200%, meaning that the invested capital doubles every 6 months. The new Sharpe Ratio is well above 1, meaning that this strategy is really tradable. Or is it? Well, in fact it's too good to be true. If Alice would deliver the strategy with this test result, she would have made a severe mistake and Bob would probably not get as rich as expected. What's the problem?\n\nAlice has used the price data from the last 4 years for optimizing the parameters, and has used the same price data for testing the result. This always generates a too optimistic result due to curve fitting bias. It also has a second problem. In 4 years, markets change and trading strategies can become unprofitable. It is not recommended to trade an optimized strategy unchanged for 4 years. Normally the strategy parameters should be re-optimized in regular intervals for adapting them to the current market situation. Zorro can do that automatically while life trading, but how can we simulate this in a test and get some realistic prediction of the real trading behavior?\n\nThe answer is Walk-Forward Optimization. That will be our topic for tomorrow.\n\nOf course, I'm assuming that the user jcl there is the same user as jcl here Anyway, this is a great thread, thank you jcl. Had it not been for you, I would never have known about the Zorro project. I'm looking forward to your insights.that's fine I have the source code for dominant cycle laying around here somewhere...actually spoke to ehlers some years ago and have the source codes for his functions deep in the bowels of one of my computers. if I'm not mistaken I believe it's all included in Rocket Science for Traders for those looking for his indicators source codes. thx. great thread"

      "text": "Before we go any further, there are a few basic terms that you must understand when first getting started in the Forex market.\n\nSpreads\nFor every currency pair in the Forex market, there are two prices. One is what is known as a bid or sell price and the other is an ask or buy price. The bid price is the price at which the currency is sold and the ask price is the price at which the currency is purchased. Prices are listed as Bid/Ask.\n\nLet's take a look at a quick example. Let's say there is a price quote for a Euro/U.S. dollar pair. You would see this as: EUR/USD and price is listed as 1.2883/1.2885. This means that the bid is 1.2883 and the ask is 1.2885. What does this mean to you as a trader? All it means is that traders interested in selling will need to sell at 1.2883 and those interested in purchasing will buy at 1.2885.\n\nYou might have noticed there is a difference between the two prices. That difference is referred to as the spread. The spread is the cost for conducting a trade. Every type of trade, whether it is a stock, bond, currency or whatever has a spread. So, using this example, if you purchased at 1.2885 and then immediately turned around and sold at 1.2883 you would incur a 2-point loss. As a smart trader, you would instead need to wait until the market moved sufficiently for you to at least break even before you sold. If you waited until the market moved 3 points in your favor, you would make a 1-point profit. Now, that's not so hard to understand, right?\n\nBasically, the spread is just your expenses involved in conducting the trade. It's the cost of the trade. This is where the Forex trading company makes their profit. While a spread might at first glance appear to be relatively small, when you take into consideration the cost of all of the trades made, you see that it can add up very quickly. One of the first rules you need to understand about successful Forex trading is the importance of checking the spread before you make any trade decision. Always make sure you know the spread.\n\nPips\nYou might have seen the term 'pips' used in relation to Forex trading. What on earth is a pip and why do you need to be concerned about it? Pip refers to percentage in points. It is the smallest price increment. In the example above, you might have noticed that prices for currencies are actually quoted out to the 4th decimal point. As a result, a spread is actually 3 pips wide. The only time you will see an exception to this is in regards to the Japanese Yen, which is only quoted out to the 2nd decimal point.\n\nThe reason why pips are important to you as a trader is that the spread can vary quite a bit based on the parties involved and the executing firm. For instance, inter-bank foreign exchanges can frequently be seen with spreads that are extremely tight; perhaps only one to two pips. On the other hand, it is possible for a bank to elect to widen a spread; even as much as 40 pips. In exchange shops located near tourist hot spots, it is not unusual for spreads to reach as much as 600 pips.\n\nIn the last few years, Forex trading in general has become much tighter. This is due, in large degree, to the increase in market competition. Traders always need to be on the lookout for the tightest spreads they can find. At the same time, it is always important to be wary of anything that is quite a bit lower than what would be constituted by a typical spread. The reason is that the spread is the main source of income for Forex trading companies.\n\nIf you see an extremely tight spread, which would indicate the company probably isn't going to earn much from the spread, you would definitely have good reason to suspect that there might be some other type of hidden fee somewhere in that transaction. Market conditions can also affect the degree of a spread. For instance, when market conditions are volatile, it is not unusual to see spreads widen. This increases the cost of trading.\n\nAdd your commentNow that you know a little bit about the ways that the Forex market can be traded, it's time to delve a little bit deeper and take a look into how the market is analyzed to make the best trades. After all, the entire purpose of trading is to make a profit, right? And in"

When they are not trending they are said to be consolidating or congesting, i.e prices are confined by a range and not directional.\n\nObviously time frame is an important consideration. A market might be trending up on a one minute chart, trending down on a 20 minute chart and consolidating on a daily chart simultaneously. In this way the market is fractal."

      "text": "Don't Gamble: Spread Betting and Gambling\n\nSpread betting might be taxed as a gambling activity, but that doesn't mean you should treat it like one. The difference between trading and gambling is quite significant, and it is an important one to bear in mind for the would-be successful trader. While the urges towards pushing the boundaries and going for that larger win are the same, the rules of engagement need to be totally different if you are to expect different results.\n\nBear in mind that the gambling industry generates multiple billions every single year, which is made up almost exclusively from the difference between the winnings paid out to gamblers and the stakes paid in to the bookmaker or casino - hardly a ringing endorsement of gambling as a way to make money.\n\nLikewise, when it comes to trading the markets some will gamble and take decisions that just 'feel' right, sometimes even with very little or no research to back them up. It could be jumping in to an unknown position, backing up more heavily than you should behind a 50/50 position or just taking a wild stab in the dark. While you might hit it lucky and actually win that particular trade, the moment you start taking uninformed gambles over researched, logical positions is the moment that your trading career is in trouble.\n\nThe Difference Between Gambling And Trading\n\nThe main difference between gambling and trading is manifest in the risk each strategy poses. A gambler knowingly takes on risk and is prepared to stake his money on a chance outcome. The FTSE might finish up on the day in 62 days time, or it might be down on February 22nd at 3.22pm, but without thorough and detailed research there's no valid reason that you should be taking this risk. OK, you might be rewarded with long odds from a bookmaker, but the chances are that a decision like this could easily go one way or the other. Worse still, if you don't know what you're talking about you could be backing an extremely unlikely result. Ignorance can and will cost you money.\n\nTrading on the other hand is a much more reasoned and logical practice. You're not staking money and crossing your fingers - the idea with sensible spread trading is to research the markets, and gain an understanding of the factors that come to bear on their movements in either direction. This process of researching your markets helps stack the odds more so in your favour, and helps reduce your exposure to risk down to the bear minimum.\n\nHow to Know When You're Gambling\n\nThe difference between gambling and spread betting lies almost squarely in method. When spread betting, there are broadly three decisions you can take, each requiring its own justification. Firstly, to open a position - ask yourself the reasons why a position will make you money before you enter it. If the logic is weak, or doesn't have any rationale underpinning it, you're probably taking a gamble and an unnecessary risk. Secondly, you can close a position - could this position run on and make you more money, or has it peaked? Don't just close out on a whim or because you get nervous - base your decision solely on the data. Thirdly, you can do nothing - again this needs its own justification. Are you doing nothing because you can't think what else to do, or is there a valid reason for holding on to your position?\n\nIf you find yourself unable to link up a thought process in your decision making, you're almost certainly taking a gamble that could work against you. The more gambles you take, the greater chance there is of a large, damaging failure. Make sure you're trading on reason and on the strength of your research work for best effect."

      "text": "Though the SEC compared the stock and stock futures markets, there's no discussion of fixed income markets' behavior that day.\n\nGayed argues that there may have been something else contributing, particularly a delayed response to bond investor skittishness. He cites the following chart.\n\nThe chart on top is a 1 minute price chart on the S&P 500 ETF (Symbol: SPY), while the bottom chart shows what the price action of the SPDR High Yield Junk Debt ETF (Symbol: JNK) was during the exact same time period. In a span of 10 minutes, JNK dropped from peak to trough about 6% (a substantial decline given the volatility characteristics of Junk Debt on average). The SPY ETF in a span of 10 minutes dropped roughly 7%. But this was NOT during the same 10 minutes.\n\nWhat caused this fast movement down and up in debt yields?\n\nAre these events related?\n\nIn an interconnected financial world, those seem like important questions.\n\nEspecially since the SEC's explanation has drawn some criticism — most notably from data firm Nanex that mapped Waddell's trades looking for evidence of its role and found less connection to the market's overall moves than would be expected. (Waddell supplied that data, though it was confirmed by another party, Barclays, which also has business dealings with Waddell.)\n\nAccording to Nanex:\n\nthe W&R trades do not appear to be near the point we believe is the ignition point at 14:42:44:075. Furthermore, the W&R trades are practically absent during the torrential sell-off that began at 14:44:20. The bulk of the W&R trades occurred after the market bottomed and was rocketing higher — a point in time that the SEC report tells us the market was out of liquidity.\n\nLike this:\n\n2 Responses\n\na few reports also mention a way out of the money put purchase in the S & P 500 (50,000 options) prior to the large emini sale. Why isn't this mentioned in most discussions? Better yet, evidently the purchaser was anticipating a large drop within a month, as the put strike was equivalent to the S$P trading 800. What did the purchaser know??? For sure there is way more to the story than what the SEC is focusing on, as you point out in the JNK chart.\n\nSean,\nThe firm you're referring to makes bets on \"Black Swan\" events, i.e. low probability, high impact events. While there are theories that argue that the put options could have also triggered the crash, the trade was put on because yields were exploding higher before equities collapsed. The decline in Junk debt was substantial adjusted for historical volatility and a significant event, and yet there seems to be no focus on that asset class"

And in Times Square, is none other than Nasdaq itself. Well, I took a tour of Nasdaq and while I was in there I was thinking to myself, \"What if ROBLOX had its own Stock Market?\" (Yes, I think of ROBLOX on vacation too). I was thinking about it and I came up with my own ways of how ROBLOX's stock market would work (my version).\n\nTable of Contents:\n\n1. How it would work\n2. How to create one\n3. Shares\n4. Win/Fail Day\n5. How this will affect the ROBLOX econ.\n6.TL;DR Version\n\n1. How it would work\n\nImagine Trade Currency (I will be referring to this as TC throughout this article). Now imagine ROBLOX's groups system. Now combine those. That's how I was thinking this would work. It would be like the TC, but it would be user-owned. A user could create their own Stock Market (I'll go into more details about this in the \"How to create one\" section) and investors would put their money into it, and depending on the day (I'll also go into more detail in the \"Win/Fail Day\" section) you would lose money or gain money. The owner of the Stock and people working at the Stock would earn shares of what people invest.\n\n2. How to create one\n\nIt would be just as easy as creating a group. Groups>Create New>[Fill in Information]>Emblem>R$>Purchase. But a stock being 100R$, it would have to be more expensive (to make it so that there aren't as many stocks in ROBLOX (i.e. 1000R$). Now, the BIG difference in a Stock is that you can't just join a stock. You can't apply for one either. You have to be hired by the creator. This way, the owner of the stock won't be bombarded with applications of people trying to get into good stocks.\n\n3. Shares\n\nThis would be more of ROBLOX's choice. I can't really decide what the shares would be but obviously the higher rank you are in the stock, the more money you would earn. And obviously there would be a capacity limit for each stock (i.e. 50 ROBLOXians per stock). But this is just my example. Depending on the day (again, I will get into more detail of this in the \"Win/Fail Day\" section), each person in the stock would also earn or lose money. Obviously the investor would gain more of the share because he is the one investing. This is my list of shares:\nInvestor: 55%\nOwner: 25%\nAdmin: 12.5%\nWorker: 5%\n(Lower Rank): 2.5%\n\n4. Win/Fail Day\n\nEach day would act as a win/fail day. Only ROBLOX could determine whether it is a win/fail day. If it was a win day, that would mean ROBLOX released a good item and it either sold quickly or made a huge profit. It would also be a win day if the many limiteds' graph rose. A fail day would work like this: 1) ROBLOX released a item that sold very slowly, or with no profit. 2) Many limiteds' graph fell dramatically. 3) An item was projected (this is when someone buys many copies of items and deletes them making the amount of them in existence lower but making the price higher, DON'T BUY THESE). There are also days that wouldn't fail or win. For example, if ROBLOX released an item like the Lord of the Federation, that hat sold quickly and made a profit, but many people won't buy it.\n\n5. How this will affect the ROBLOX econ.\n\nI thought that this would be a great addition to ROBLOX (if it was added) because it would stimulated the econ and it would also stimulate the inflation rate so that it wouldn't really raise or lower. Nuff said.\n\n6. TL;DR version\n\nSomeone makes a stock. You invest money. Depending on the day, you gain or lose money. The owner and workers of the stock earn shares of your money. Details above.\n\nThis has been a site suggestion by alexkylerock.\nWanna hear more about my posts? Follow me @alexkylerock.\n\n10 comments:\n\nA few suggestions and reminders. 1. There was a site that had a ROBLOX stock market not affiliated with ROBLOX but made by clockwork I believe. 2. If you had to be hired, people would only hire their friends. It should be like normal and you should purchase them. 3. The stocks should be based on game types. So if horror games were recieving a lot of visits that day, the horror stock would go up. Allowing ROBLOX to create the stocks as well as making not too many.\n\nThis is a good comment. If I could promote comments I would promote this one. Only 1 thing. IF Roblox would be to make a Stock Market, I could see them putting the \"Create\" price at 10k, that way, people with many many friends can't only have friends in their stock. There should also be a price to get into the stock. A small price. My only problem with my idea, however, is that it might make the rich richer, and the poor, poorer. Great comment though!"

      "text": "Retail Forex Brokers\n\nThe forex (FOReign EXchange) markets are very popular day trading markets. The forex markets are cash markets where one currency is traded against another currency, such as the EURUSD (Euro to US Dollar) market or the EURGBP (Euro to British Pound) market.\n\nThe forex markets are based upon the exchange rates of the different currencies, and are available for all of the major currencies. Some of the most actively traded forex markets are the EURUSD, the GBPUSD (also known as cable), and the USDJPY (US Dollar to Japanese Yen). The forex markets are traded 24 hours per day from Monday morning in New Zealand until Friday night in the US.\n\nForex Market Pitfalls\n\nIn theory, the forex markets are traded just like any other market, but there are some significant differences that need to be considered. Some of these differences are negligible, but some will make a big difference to your profit and loss, and need to be understood before the forex markets are traded.\n\nThe forex markets are not offered by any exchange (such as the CME in the US, or the DTB is Europe). They are decentralized markets, where each transaction is conducted directly between the traders involved. This would normally be fine, but without an exchange to regulate the markets, the forex markets are more vulnerable to manipulation by market makers.\n\nMarket makers are usually retail forex brokers, but in reality they are traders that set their own prices for a particular market. Market makers make their profit from the difference between the prices that they receive and the prices that they offer. This means that traders that trade with the market makers are not receiving the best available price for their trades.\n\nRetail Forex Brokers\n\nRetail forex brokers are brokerages that cater specifically to individual traders. Retail forex brokers often advertise their services as commission free, and will sometimes try and explain why their being a market maker is an advantage for you. This is completely incorrect, and these types of brokerages (which they really are not) should be avoided.\n\nRetail forex brokers make their profit by making their own market (hence the name market maker). For example, if the actual bid and ask prices of the EURUSD market are 1.2567 and 1.2568, a retail forex broker might offer 1.2566 and 1.2569 to their customers. This allows them to keep the two pips difference as profit for themselves.\n\nIn addition to fixing the prices, retail forex brokers also trade against their customers. For example, if a trader is long the GBPUSD market at 1.5674, and the market has moved against their trade to 1.5628, a retail forex broker might offer a lower price of 1.5624 to the trader. If the trader then exits their trade, there is a four pip difference between the actual price and the trader's price, which the retail forex broker keeps as their profit.\n\nAnother problem with retail forex brokers is that they have access to all of their customers orders, including entries, targets, and stop losses. This means that they can make their own trades specifically to take advantage of the trader's orders. For example, if a trader is long the EURGBP market at 0.6712, and has a target order at 0.6812, a retail forex broker might keep the prices artifically low, so that when the market reaches the trader's target order, there is a five pip difference between the actual price and the trader's price. The retail forex broker would then go short at the real price of 0.6815, while filling the trader's target order at 0.6812, and keep the five pips difference as their own profit.\n\nThese are just some of the ways that retail forex brokers manipulate the forex markets to take profit away from individual traders.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe forex markets can be traded by individual traders, just not through retail forex brokers. Day traders that are interested in trading the forex markets need to make sure that they are using a reputable brokerage that makes their profit from commissions rather than unscrupulous trades. All of the brokerages that are listed in the day trading site's brokerage profiles are decent brokerages, and can be used to trade the forex markets without the additional risks associated with retail forex brokers."

      "text": "What are CFDs?\n\nA Contract For Difference (CFD) is an agreement between two parties to pay the difference in price (of the contract) between the time it was opened and the time it was closed. A CFD is a derivative product that mirrors or reflects the price of the financial instrument it is based on which may include shares (equities), sectors, an index or a currency pair (FX pair).\n\nA CFD is a derivative trading instrument that allows you to trade the price movements (when you enter and exit a trade), without owning the underlying instrument, in most cases shares or equities. Compared to share trading when you trade a CFD you don't own the actual share. When\n\nCFDs are a leveraged product, unlike conventional trading. You trade on margin and only a small deposit is required, which gives you access to a larger portion of the market. It is important that before trading you fully understand the risks involved, as CFDs may not be suitable for everyone. So be risk aware, losses can exceed your initial deposit.\n\nThe most common type of CFD is a share CFD, but there are also other CFDs for Sectors, Indices and other financial instruments such as commodities and treasuries. See below under \"Types of CFDs\"\n\nThe TradingLounge is ready to take your Trading Strategies to the next level – test drive our CFD Trading Strategies Service Free for 72 hours»HERE\n\nASPECTS OF CFDs TRADING\n\nIt has been mentioned that CFD trading is very similar to share trading and in most aspects they are almost the same. However, CFDs have some distinct features that differentiate it from shares. Some of these features are what make CFDs very attractive to traders and investors alike.\n\nLeverage\n\nIn the financial market leverage means the use of borrowed money to invest in other investment products such as property, shares, artwork, property trusts or managed funds. A very common form of the use of leverage is when people borrow money (from a bank or a financial institution) to invest in a residential or investment property. This is when you end up with a mortgage for a home loan or an investment loan. Other people may also borrow money to buy shares. This is commonly known as taking a margin loan to invest in a share portfolio.\nTrading CFDs is similar to taking a margin loan because when you trade a CFD you are only paying a small portion or percentage of the whole amount upfront and the rest of the amount is being loaned to you by the CFD provider.\nCFDs are tradable on margin which means you only need a small percentage of your trading capital to open up larger or more positions that you can normally open. Some CFDs require only as little at 1% margin, some 3% and others 5-10% margin depending on the share CFD and the CFD provider.\nFor many investors and traders being able to trade on margin (using leverage) is the biggest attraction of CFDs because it increases the opportunity to make profit using a small capital. However, you must remember that the ability to trade on margin can be a two-edged sword, in that it both magnifies potential profit and losses. However, when used wisely and appropriately, trading on margin can be a big boost to profitability and capital building.\n\nCan be traded short or long\n\nWhen you buy (go long) a CFD, you are expecting its price to go up so that you can sell it later at a higher price (with a profit).\nWhen you sell (go short) a CFD, you are expecting its price to go down so that you can buy it back at a lower price (with a profit).\nBeing able to trade it long or short is one of the most attractive features of CFDs because it means you can trade long and make money on a rising market or trade short and make money when the market is falling.\nShort selling physical shares is a much complex and more costly procedure compared to short selling CFDs.\n\nDividends and corporate action\n\nFor many long-term investors dividends remain one of the deciding factors whether they will invest in a particular share or not. This shows the importance people place on dividends when deciding which stock to buy.\nWhen you trade share CFDs on dividend paying shares you will also automatically be paid the dividend when you have a long position. The dividend payment is usually reflected on your trading account on the day of its announcement. On the other hand, if you have a short CFD position during the announcement of the dividend, the amount of the dividend will be deducted from your trading account.\nOther corporate actions such as bonus issues and share splitting are also automatically reflected on your CFD trading account as soon as they are implemented.\n\nReporting season\n\nThe reporting season refers to the time when publicly listed companies update the market (investors including mums and dads as well as large institutions such as fund managers) about their yearly and half yearly performance. The reporting season is usually the time when companies announce whether their profit forecasts are on target or not.\nDepending on a company's performance and projected profit, the reporting season could translate to some volatility in the market. For example, if a company issues a forecast that its earnings will be lower in the next half year the share price may fall the next day as investors may be disappointed with this result. On the other hand, if a company doubles its income and profit expectation for the coming year, the share price may jump higher as investors and traders take advantage of this good news.\nAs CFDs mirror the price of the underlying share, any movement in price of shares during the reporting season will also be reflected on the CFD price. This means as a trader or investor, you have to be aware of the possible impact of the reporting season on your CFD positions\n\nProduct trading times\n\nThe advent of the internet and online trading means that traders and investors now have access to international markets almost 24-hours a day and not only during market hours in Australia.\nWith its global network that spans four continents, CFD Providers enables traders and investors to trade the Australian, Asia, US, UK and European markets using a follow-the-sun model.\nAnother aspect of CFD trading involves expiry date or the length of holding time. Unlike other derivatives that have expiry date and that become worthless upon expiry, CFDs don't have an expiry date. This means you can hold CFDs for as long or as short a period as you like.\nSome short-term traders trade CFDs for a few days while medium to long-term investors and traders may trade them over a few weeks or months.\n\nLower brokerage costs\n\nCompared to the brokerage fee you pay when you trade with your regular stock broker, commission charges when trading CFDs are relatively cheap. charges from $10 for trades of up to $10,000? Any trade more than $10,000 may be charged 0.01% of the total trade amount.\n\nHow do CFDs stack up against other derivatives and shares?\n\nAs a financial instrument, CFDs possess some features that make them attractive to traders and investors alike.\n\nTrade the market with added features\n\nCFD trading has often been described as share trading with bells and whistles. This is because everything you know about shares and share trading applies and can be used to trade CFDs because the price of CFDs moves as the actual share price moves. For example, if share ABC is worth $5.00, a share CFD on ABC is also $5.00.\nAbility to trade international markets – CFDs open up a whole new world of financial markets including those in the US, UK, Europe and Asia which were not accessible to Australian traders before. Many CFD providers offer CFDs on international shares, indices and sectors.\nAll financial instruments – from the simplest to the most complex – have their own individual features that make them attractive or not attractive to investors. Though there is a misconception that derivatives are all about high risks, but if considered properly and traded according to your personal risk profile, derivatives – including CFDs – may play an important part in growing your investment portfolio.\nWhere do they fit in your investment portfolio?\n\nAfter learning more about CFDs and its features, you must be wondering where these financial instruments fit in your investment portfolio. You may already have a healthy share portfolio that you want to keep growing. While CFDs may not be the ideal vehicle for the long term buy-and-hold investing, it definitely has a place in any investor's portfolio.\n\nPortfolio diversification\n\nWhether you're a long-term buy and hold investor, To introduce diversification in their investment portfolios, some people prefer to maintain their share/equity portfolio for capital gains and ongoing dividend income while also maintaining a CFD portfolio for short to medium-term investment or trading.\nCheap entry into trading\nBecause\nFor\n\nTypes of CFDs\n\nAs mentioned earlier there are various types of CFDs including share CFDs, Index CFDs, Sector CFDs, FX CFDs, CFDs on commodities and CFDs on international shares.\nIn Australia, CFDs are available in more than 500 of the listed shares. This list is still expanding and being updated, so you may want to check with your CFD Provider for the most updated list of tradable CFDs they offer. The list is regularly updated to reflect additional CFDs.\n\nAside from Australian shares, CFD Providers also offers CFDs on international shares including US, European, UK and Asian shares. This means you can trade share CFDs on Google, Amazon, Wal-Mart, Honda, Toyota, Vodafone, BMW, Porsche and other big brands that are not available in the Australian market.\nTrading share CFDs on international shares offers many advantages including:\n• access to bigger and more liquid markets that offer more trading opportunities than what is available locally\n• low brokerage fee because you don't have to pay the extra administrative charges that you pay to trade physical shares in overseas companies\n• Australia's time zone makes it user friendly if you want to capture some trading action in the UK, US or Asian markets.\n\nASX top 200 CFDS\n\nMost providers offer a version of the SPI and/or the ASX 200 and they are perfect for practicing and developing your day trading skills, because owning one contract is equal to one dollar per point. And once you have a good understanding and feel of where the market is expected to move in a session and have your keyboard skills down pat you'll be on your way.\nASX top 200 CFDs products are based on the Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) Share Price Index (SPI) futures contract, known as the SPI. In turn the SPI is based off the S&P ASX 200 also known as the Cash Market. Some CFD Providers also base their ASX top 200 CFDs off the XJO.\n\nReview\n\nYou can trade CFDs as you trade shares because the price of a CFD mirrors the price of the actual share – as Direct Market Access (DMA) CFD providers do, while the Market Makers (MM) operate roughly around the real price. Be sure to read their PDS.\nCFDs offer leveraged trading to new traders as an alternative to other derivatives such as options and warrants which can be quite complex to understand.\nConsider CFD as a tool to diversify your existing investment portfolio\n\nSelf-assessment\n\nWhat does CFD stand for? What are you actually trading when you trade CFDs?\nWhen trading CFDs you are actually trading the margin of price change or the difference in price from when you open the position until the time you close the position\n\nWhat are the main advantages of trading CFDs\nYou can trade short and long, cheap entry into trading, lower brokerage costs, CFDs are traded on margin\n\nWill you get a share certificate when you trade a share CFD?\nNo, you're not actually buying stock in that company but you are only trying to capture the price movement between the time you open a CFD trade until the time you close it\n\nHow many CFD products are available to trade with your CFD Provider?\nYou will need to check with your CFD Provider, but many CFD Providers have CFDs for Shares covering many different countries. Plus, Forex, Commodities, Treasuries / Interest Rates, Bonds etc.\n\nAre stop loss orders applicable to CFDs?\nYes, unlike shares, options or warrants you can place a stop loss order with a CFD trade\n\nAre there time limits for holding a position with a CFD??\nNo, unlike options or warrants you can hold a CFD trade for as long or short a time as you choose.\n\nWhat is the approximate percentage outlay of trading with a CFD compared to the outlay when a share trade?\nYou only need approximately 3%-5% of the price plus brokerage"

      "text": "PAYMENT OPTIONS\n\nForex Signals\n\nReceive New Content In Your E-mail\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nWhat is technical analysis\n\nThere are two main approaches used to decide when to buy or sell in the market. These methodologies are called technical analysis and fundamental analysis and each one are based in radically differente principles. In this section we are going to discuss mainly about technical analysis but at the same time we are going to present an introduction about fundamental analysis to introduce visitors.\n\nFundamental analysis.\n\nIn the forex market, fundamental analysis examines in depth the political, social or economic events and how and why these events have historically affected the prices of currencies. So it comes to understanding the current state and likely evolution of the prices according to the socioeconomic circumstances that are currently being developed or planned to be developed.\n\nIn the case of stock market analysis for example, the fundamental analysis examines the financial reports published by the company, audit, quarterly and annual balance sheets, market trends, product quality, dividends, sales, position against competitors, news, etc… Ultimately determines whether the stock price is below, above or match the price at which such action is quoted at the time. If, for example, the result of fundamental analysis shows that the share price should be higher than what is listed at that time, the recommendation is buy it and wait for the market's true value.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nUnlike previous approach, technical analysis is based on the premise that the price of an instrument is inexorably determined by supply and demand. In fact, according to this approach, an instrument like a share or a currency for example, is not bought or sold due to its real value, but by what people think it's worth. Under this premise, all the information required is in the same price of the instrument and its evolution over time. Instead of an extensive analysis of business and economic fundamentals, it would be sufficient to observe the movement of the instrument price. An increase in investor interest in a specific instrument, whatever the reason (in fact no matter what the reason), will result in an increase in the price of such instrument. Part of the work of the Technical Analysis is to determine whether the increase in price will be so significant that worth purchasing that instrument.\n\nIn the case of chart patterns analysis, the term Technical Analysis is perhaps not the most appropriate for this type of analysis because it really is based on interpretation of graphs but traditionally is referred to that name. The Art of Technical Analysis is to identify changes in trends in time and to acquire or hold a trade or investment until the trader identify evidence of a change in the trend. Technical Analysis in such \"evidence\" are identified by a number of indicators and principles such as price patterns, trends, moving averages, stochastic, and many others.\n\nA basic principle of technical analysis is as follows: when a new trend emerge, this trend remains until enough indicators or signals of change appear. Always assume that the trend will remain intact until proven otherwise. Technical analysis does not promise that you can identify the top and bottom of a trend but the area around the top and around the bottom.\n\nThe technical analyst uses various methods to analize the market like the study of the patterns and figures presented in the charts of prices to determine which is the current trend of a particular instrument or the next market trend change. This approach is known as chartist analysis. They also study various types of technical indicators of trend, oscillators, indicators of market volume and others. The most frequently used technical indicators by market analysts are:"

      "text": "The Meaning of the Dow Jones Industrial Average\n\nIn the last week, the Dow Jones Industrial average closed at a thirteen month high and, at the same time, unemployment hit double digits for the first time since the early eighties. I thought that the Dow Jones was supposed to represent how the economy was doing, but that's not the case. What does it mean? What is the point of reporting it if it doesn't mean anything?\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (often called \"the Dow\" for short) is an incredibly common piece of news, yet the purpose of it is often really unclear to newswatchers. Is it an indication of the state of the economy? Not really. Is it an indication of the state of the stock market? Not really.\n\nWell, then, what is it? And why does it get reported so often?\n\nWhat Is the Dow?\nThe \"Dow\" usually refers to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It was invented by Charles Dow, a co-founder of Dow Jones & Company, which is a publishing and information company.\n\nThe \"Dow\" is simply an average of the value of one share each of thirty of the largest companies in the United States. It does not include any of the thousands of other publicly traded companies.\n\nOf course, a bit of math checking would reveal that if you added up the current market value of a share of each of the thirty companies in the Dow and divided by thirty, you would not get a number anywhere close to the current value of the Dow. There are several reasons for this, but the most important reason is that companies sometimes choose to split their stocks, basically exchanging two new shares for one old share (or some similar exchange). In order to make sure that such an exchange doesn't wreck the value of the Dow (because that would effectively mean one of the thirty companies just had a single share of their stock drop by half), Dow Jones & Company accounts for it by using a scaled average, in which they effectively keep track of past splits and multiply the values of each share accordingly. Thus, even when a company splits their stock, it doesn't affect the Dow average at all.\n\nSo, basically, the Dow is just a quick summary of the current value of shares of thirty large companies.\n\nThe Value of a Share\nBut what is the current value of a share?\n\nIn simplest terms, it's all about supply and demand, just like buying and selling anything. The stock market is basically no different than a giant flea market, with many, many people buying and selling thousands of items, all trying to make a profit. Depending on the news (and the behavior of others), the price of individual items goes up and down.\n\nIn simplest terms, if there are more people buying than selling, the price of a share goes up. If there are more people selling than buying, the price of a share goes down.\n\nWhat causes this shift? Information about a given company or about the economy in general. Predictions about what the future holds. The behaviors of others. All of these affect whether people are buying at the moment or selling at the moment.\n\nThe Value of the Dow\nIn effect, the Dow is just an average of thirty items from this giant flea market. What information can we get from that?\n\nGenerally, it's not ruled by news from one specific company. One company's bad news can affect it a little, but not enough to make a huge difference.\n\nIt's also not affected too much by how things are going right now. It's important to remember that when people buy and sell stocks, they're doing it based on what they think the future price holds. Thus, the value of the Dow will often go down well before real economic news (like the unemployment rate) turns bad, and the value of the Dow will often go up well before real economic news turns good.\n\nTo put it simply, at the first sign the economy is slowing at all – or that one sector is seeing real problems – the Dow will begin to drop, and often rapidly. At the first sign that a recession is slowing even a bit, the Dow will begin to go up, and often rapidly (and that's what's happening right now).\n\nSo, look at the Dow as a predictor, nothing more, nothing less. It's a predictor of the general direction of the economy over the next year or so. If the stock market is going up – as it is right now – the economy will generally improve from its current state over the next year"

      "text": "Share Dealing Guide\n\nTrading shares can seem like a terrifying prospect for the uninitiated, and the relatively introspective, elitist world of professional trading does little to encourage newcomers. While trading is no doubt a complicated subject, and one that requires hours of research time and pre-trade learning, that's not to say it's completely off-limits for 'ordinary' people, and indeed many individuals from all walks of life are turning to trading the markets as a supplement to or in place of the regular 9-5.\n\nShare trading at a basic level is relatively straightforward - you buy shares when you think the price is going to rise, only to sell when it does and lock in your profits (and vice versa when shorting stocks). Unfortunately, the markets are seldom so simple, and indeed if they were truly as predictable as we would like, all traders would be millionaires.\n\nBut because of the dynamism and the human element to trading, not to mention the vast array of variables that factor in to calculating a share's price, moving with the markets is a seriously difficult task that carries appropriate rewards for those that manage to get it right.\n\nAs a new trader starting out, there's very little you can do to stem the tides of the markets when they move against you, and it is inevitable that you will open losing positions from time to time. However, by ensuring you invest both your time and energies in preparation for trading, including researching and learning about the markets in which you wish you trade, and take adequate steps to preserve capital and minimize your losses when they do occur, you're working towards building more stable foundations on which to base your future trading success."

Your overall answer is right, of course, but to clarify, a change in demand does not imply actual buying or selling.

The demand and supply of these commodities decide the price of the commodities being traded.\n\nWhen commodities are traded, the process is known as futures trading. The future trading is different from stock trading in the sense that in the former case, you do not actually own or buy anything as in stock trading.\n\nAt times, it has been seen that futures trading is confused with options trading. Options trading is defined as the contract to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price before a fixed date in the future.\n\nThe assets that are traded under options trading are generally stocks, currencies and stock indices whereas in futures trading commodities like food grains and metals are traded.\n\nLatest blogosphere posts tagged \"commodities\"\"Success is not to be measured by the position someone has reached in life, but the obstacles he has overcome while trying to succeed.\" Booker T.

      "text": "Options In Focus: Credit for the Debit Spread\n\nThe fascination with credit spreads compared to debit spreads can't be denied or can it? The fact is if there were a systematic advantage, it would be exploited, arbed out and non-existent. Case in point, did you know an out-of-the-money bull put spread initiated for a credit is the same as buying an in-the-money bull call spread for a debit when dealing with identical strikes and the same contract month? Well, if you didn't, you should.\n\nAside from out of the money puts sometimes having better liquidity provision, the risk and reward of the two verticals are identical, as well as what needs to be put up in the trading account. What? You didn't think that credit was really for free or at an advantage over the call vertical did you? For instance, on a vertical such as a two-and-a-half point bull put spread, if you take in a credit of $0.50 your broker will demand you have capital on hand to sufficiently cover the risk of two points before backing in the credit. The net result is $200 per spread of buying power has been removed from the account until proven differently.\n\nAt the same time, if and in most instances the same strike call vertical can be negotiated in the open market for a debit of $2.00, this likeminded bullish investor is also tying up two points of capital, though in a more straightforward manner as the debit paid is simply subtracted from the account's buying power. At the end of the day or umm, at expiration, if the credit spread shows a profit, the debit spread will, barring slippage, reflect the same dollar gain. Likewise, if there's a loss in one type of spread, rest assured their credit or debit-munching brethren are feeling the same amount of limited risk pain.\n\nThat all said, one real benefit of the put spread is the opportunity on occasion to close out just the short put and maintain the further away long put for the longshot payoff with no real extra risk involved if it's far enough away from being in the money. In this situation, the trader with the bull call spread would need to exit their position in full or otherwise face large delta risk which could wipe out their paper profits and turn into a loss.\n\nOn the plus side, an early assignment for the bull call spread would allow that trader to maximize his or her profit potential before expiration or maintain a synthetic long put with no risk. Admittedly this type event is unlikely, especially compared to the potential perk of buying in the short put cheaply. Nonetheless, it can happen on occasion and could provide a nice quicker-than-expected gain or an even nicer windfall if all goes, not according to plan, for the other call trader unwisely exercising their right to stock ownership prematurely"

If it moves about 60 pips against the trend, it opens a 2nd position, same currency always. If it continues to move against the trend, it will open a 3rd position.

When there are more than 1 position open, same currency always, it will close as soon as their sum is in profit or is close to zero. As far as i know it will not trade on Fridays.

      "text": "another thread it was mentioned that the DOW is not really going anywhere but up for the foreseeable future, because the big financial firms are \"gaming the system\" using High Frequency Trading algorithms to trade in the stock market. There has been quit a lot about that particular issue in the non-mainstream / non-traditional press lately.\n\nTo the point: I have seen statements to the effect that High Frequency Trading (HFT) is about 70% of the activity in the stock markets today. Trading volume is low. It is painfully obvious to the most casual of observers that the DOW does not reflect current economic conditions.\n\nSo, how does a non-professional determine how much of the current market volume is HFT trades? The follow on question is where is the money used for HFT coming from? Another is: Is this legal?\n\nI have this ugly suspicion that the big financial houses are using taxpayer money borrowed at ridiculously low rates to game the stock market by skimming fractions of a cent from each trade over millions of trades; putting a \"sanitized\" profit into several someone's private pockets. How can you document that?\n\nI__________________\nSkilter\nNative Texan\n\nIllegitimi Non Carborundum\n--------------------------------------------\nM 7:7-14 tells you all you need to know.\n\nOriginally posted by Skilter ISorry, the cat is trying to help me type this, so it may have spelling and grammar errors in it...\n\nI agree that something is massively failing the smell test. But what? I don't subscribe to the accident hypothesis (yet), but you would be a voice in the wilderness at best. Speaking truth to power does not always result in accidents, especially when \"being sent to Coventry\" actually works better, leaves less of a trail and costs less in time and effort.\n\nAnother hypothesis that I have a hard time subscribing to is the NWO theory. I have worked in the belly of the beast as a contractor for several years and on several projects. Displays of bureaucratic competency are best described as random and infrequent. If there is a NWO, they need to attend some remedial project management and organizational efficiency classes.\n\nBut I digress... My understanding is that a stock market was originally intended to allow businesses to raise capitol on the open market. Companies offered a slice of the pie in return for a capitol investment. The value of that pie slice was determined by investor's estimates of how well the company would perform over some varying period of time that was unique to each investor. If only 30% of the volume in the market still uses that as a guidance, and I am skeptical that the number is that high, then the market has essentially failed and no longer operates to form capitol. Welcome to the casino!\n\nWhere does business acquire capitol then? The bond market? Borrow from the banks? Private lending sources? Profit?\n\nI think that capitalism has fractured into two distinct paths. Let's call them large Capitalism and small capitalism. They do not have the same rules, by any means.\n\nCapitalism, represented by the FED, the House of Saud, the Swiss, the Big Financial Institutions far and wide, Government in all it's forms, Multinational Companies, and a fair number of other Companies listed on various stock exchanges play by an entirely new set of rules that have evolved and have been refined over the last 40 or 50 years. They can manipulate the game to achieve success, hence they succeed.\n\n\"capitalism\", practiced by everyone else in the world, has basically the same set of rules that it has always had, with local variations for regulation and culture. Small capitalism is dying, strangled by current circumstances. Because of the sheer volume of capitalism, no one notices that capitalism is being strangled.\n\nCapitalism thinks that it controls and leads because it has access to the media, financial resources and government. Capitalism thinks that is is doing reasonably well. Capitalism is no longer capitalism, it is Corporate Feudalism.\n\nHence, it may not even matter that you could prove that 70% of trading activity is HFT activity. The feudal lords and barons of the financial kingdom have determined that this is a profitable activity, and that is enough.\n\nMy instinct tells me that this is the case in auto's, aircraft, military technology, computers, government services (bureaucracy, the hired grunts) and a whole bunch of other industries.\n\nThis is a complex issue - well beyond my full understanding - however Denninger has written a TON on this topic in his free \"Ticker\" area of the Ticker Forum - basically, the big firms use these trading programs to do a couple of things, skim fractions of a cent off of millions and millions of transactions - the second and more serious action - according to Denninger - is to move the prices of stocks and the indices by trading the shares back and forth with other firms \"black boxes\" AND place shadow bids to lure real buyers into buying at higher and higher prices - the CONSEQUENCES of all this are these - it provides the ILLUSION of mkt liquidity when one looks at the volume - when serious selling shows up the mkt goes NO BID because there was no REAL liquidity and we get the FLASH CRASH - it happened before and it WILL happen again.\n\noff...\nI agree with your post above. Problem is, I am in little capitalism. Little capitalism is the American Way... It is what drives GDP and jobs. The current administration does not believe in \"little capitalism\". Yeah, it may create bubbles from time to time, but that is what the free market does...\n\nYou can see the trading programs kick in when the bad news spooks\n'investers' in the morning and the markets head south, by 2 o'clock\nthe programs will usually pare the losses to around 20 pts or even\ngo positive by a few.\n\n__________________\n\"Owning a Firearm doesn't make you Armed any more than owning a Guitar makes you a Musician\"\n\nI saw that... I don't even get all worked up about it any longer. Well not much anyway. Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean that someone isn't out to get you, and just because it's a conspiracy theory doesn't mean it's not a conspiracy...\n\nI guess that I'll keep working on capitalism and organizing myself so the Capitalists can't mess with me more than absolutely necessary.\n\nLike the F117 pilots say: \"I'd rather be invisible, than bulletproof.\"\n\nOf course, posting on the interweb makes you rather less than invisible, doesn't it?"

But it doesn't take a student of Nassim Taleb's Fooled by Randomness to know that \"researching patterns\" is a mug's game. What's more, there's a world of difference between financial literacy, which is a good thing, and teaching kids how to trade stocks, which is a stunningly bad idea doomed to result in vast amounts of wealth evaporating needlessly. As for the \"state-of-the-art financial-markets software\", does anybody think that's a good thing any more?\n\nI thought some of the technical stuff worked, but only because people thought it worked. For example, if enough people think pattern X is followed by an increase in price, they\\'ll buy the stock when pattern X appears, causing the price to go up.\n\nComing from an engineering background, such positive-feedback loops give me the shivers, but they seem to be built into the whole financial system.\n\nGrowing up in small-town North Carolina, I created a model portfolio of stocks for a class project in third grade.

The early introduction to the market didn't prompt me to day trade my allowance; rather, it instilled a healthy skepticism of prognostication that has left me more careful with my investments than I might otherwise have been.\n\nI think it's a bit foolhardy to latch on to the word \"patterns\" in the article and decry a useful example of financial literacy. There are a number of lessons to be learned from the absence of patterns in price trends, as well as their presence. Namely, there's a great deal of research in behavioral economics about the creation and deflation of asset price bubbles in artificial trading environments. Software that can accurately simulate a trading environment ought to demonstrate very quickly how easy it is to lose your shirt; how exactly is that a bad thing?\n\nOne could argue that the more the kids learn about how the markets actually work, the better their decisions will be. Hopefully running their own market will tip them off to \"hey, there's no reason this racket will just print money!\"\n\nWhy when people talk about markets, they are almost exclusively talking about exchanges where financial instruments take place.

      "text": "Event-Based Option Trading: Put Spreads vs. Long Calls\n\nA company's fundamental backdrop, including anticipated news events like earnings, FDA meetings, or product announcements, typically plays a prominent role in any trader's research. This tends to be true whether one is primarily investing in stocks or in options.\n\nThe excitement of event-based trading and the enduring importance of earnings results converge once every quarter as earnings season plays out. Earnings season has the potential to be especially exciting for those option traders looking to take advantage of implied-volatility shifts. One bullish options strategy traders might employ ahead of an earnings report is a bull put spread (selling a higher-strike put and buying a lower-strike put to collect a net credit).\n\nIf and when implied volatility is unusually high on the underlying's options, traders might be tempted to sell put spreads in lieu of buying calls. High implieds mean that options are naturally pricier, making premium-selling strategies potentially more attractive than premium-buying ones. There are, of course, important differences between bullishly configured strategies such as long calls and short put spreads.\n\nHypothetical Example – Selling a Put Spread Ahead of Earnings:\n\nImagine stock XYZ is days away from its earnings report. The consensus estimate for earnings is 20 cents but a bullish trader believes the actual earnings number will exceed expectations, causing the stock to move higher.\n\nBut implied volatility is high, making call options pricey for the option buyer. It would cost $4.50 to buy a short-term, at-the-money XYZ call that might cost closer to $3.00 outside of earnings season.\n\nInstead, the trader decides to sell an at-the-money, 50-strike put with the same expiration month for $3.00 and simultaneously buy an out-of-the-money, 45-strike put for $0.75. This put spread yields a net credit of $2.25.\n\nThe goal is for the underlying stock to rise on earnings and for implied volatility to fall, making the put spread cheaper for the investor to buy it to close (at which point he would keep the difference as profit). The maximum profit for selling a put spread is equal to the net premium received. That means no matter how high the underlying stock rises, the most this trade can profit is $2.25. This distinction is important to consider versus the long-call strategy.\n\nIf the trader is wrong, and earnings are worse than expectations, the stock price could decline, maybe a lot. In that case, the put spread could end up a loser, if the short put gains in value. With a short put spread, the maximum loss is limited to the difference between the strike prices minus the net credit. In this example, the maximum possible loss is $2.75 per contract. Breakeven is the short put less the credit collected, or $47.75. The maximum loss for a long call is limited to 100% of the premium paid.\n\nIf implied volatility does come in after earnings, the value of the call could decline even if XYZ itself moves higher! In this scenario, the put spread could have an advantage over a long call because a drop in implied volatility makes the spread theoretically less expensive to buy it back to close.\n\nChanges in implied volatility and stock price can dramatically impact option pricing, as can the gradual deterioration in time until expiration. The illustration above shows the profit/loss picture of this XYZ spread at expiration. By using tools in a virtual trading account, investors can experiment with how a gain (or loss) in the underlying stock might affect a put spread. Sharp changes in volatility – one way or another – can be plugged in as well in order to gauge how far and how fast an options position might change"

The net cost was $126.\n\nNote: none of the figures in this post accounts for commissions.\n\nThis is an example of a bull call spread ñ buying one call option and selling another at a higher strike.\n\nSelling the higher strike option reduces the cost of the spread, but it also caps the potential return. Buying a 140 call and selling a 150 call for the same month means the spread can never be worth more than $1,000 ñ the difference between the two strike prices.\n\nRisk 1 to make 7Ö\n\nBobís spread is an out-of-the-money (OTM) call spread because both strikes are higher than the stock price of 126.64.\n\nIf the stock does rise, Bob could conceivably make $874 ñ the $1,000 the spread might be worth minus the $126 he paid for the spread, which is his maximum risk.\n\nSo Bob is risking $126 to make $874, roughly the same as ìrisking 1 to make 7.î\n\nÖor risk 8 to make 2?\n\nAs for me, I was thinking about another call spread: Buy the 110 call for $1,850 and sell the 120 call for a $1,045 credit for a net cost of $805.\n\nThis is an example of an in-the-money (ITM) call spread because both strikes are lower than the current price of the stock.\n\nSo Iíd be paying $805 on a spread that canít be worth more than $1,000. My maximum net profit would just under $200 ñ so Iíd be risking 8 to make 2.\n\nI know what you might be thinking thatís a fairly poor risk/reward profile. You might even have a point.\n\nBut would it change your mind if I pointed out that unless the stock price changes, time decay works against Bobís position while it works in favor of mine?\n\nTheta: Headwind or tailwind\n\nHereís the theoretical value of these two call spreads at various times until expiration. The purple arrow shows the price of the stock when the trade is established.\n\nNote how Bobís OTM call spread seems to lose value if the stock doesnít rise. He needs to see the stock move up ñ the sooner the better. My position, however, gains value even if the stock just drifts around its current price.\n\nThe chart also shows that at least in theory, if Amazon falls, even fairly late in the expiration cycle, I could conceivably close my position for a loss of perhaps $300. Thereís no guarantee, of course, but that would turn my trade into more of a ìrisk 3 to make 2î scenario.\n\nThis difference in time decay is because ITM and OTM call spreads each have different levels of theta.\n\nTheta is the option Greek that measures the theoretical impact of time decay on an option position. If youíre long an option with a theta of -0.025, for example, in theory (all other things being equal), the position will lose $2.50 per day from time decay. If youíre short the option, you theoretically gain $2.50 per day.\n\nTheta does change based on time and stock movement. Hereís another chart that shows the ITM and OTM call spreads along with the theoretical theta of these positions at various stock prices.\n\nGood theta vs. bad theta\n\nWhy would these option spreads have different time decay patterns?\n\nBy definition, any bull call spread means being long one option, where theta works against you and short another, where theta works with you. But each spread offers different amounts of each.\n\nHereís a chart that shows the theta of these options at the time the spread is first established. With the OTM call spread, the bad theta (in red) outweighs the good theta (in green) providing negative net theta (in yellow). The ITM spread has an opposite profile.\n\nAn even better choice: A bull put spread\n\nIíve compared these two spreads to demonstrate how the strike prices you select impacts the theta of your position. But I probably wouldnít consider the 110/120 ITM call spread just to take advantage of theta.\n\nThatís because thereís a better choice, at least in my opinion.\n\nYou see, for almost any bull call spread, thereís an equal and opposite bull put spread you can establish that offers a similar risk/reward ratio. So letís look at those option prices again, this time showing the puts and the calls.\n\nInstead of risking $805 for the 110/120 bull call spread with a maximum profit of $195, I could switch these strikes over to the put side.\n\nBy selling the 120 put for $400 and buying the 110 put for $191, Iíd collect a credit of $209. This is an example of an OTM bull put spread.\n\nThis provides basically the same deal at the ITM bull call spread. If all goes well and the stock stays above 120, I keep the $209 net credit I received. If all doesnít go well, the 110 put I bought caps my loss at $791 (the difference between the $1,000 Iíd have to pay to buy back the spread less the $209 I collected).\n\nThe theoretical profit chart shows that these two positions are virtually identical. Although not shown on the chart, they do have similar time decay properties.\n\nBut the put spread does offer a couple of advantages.\n\nFirst, the out-of-the-money puts tend to have much narrower bid/ask spreads than the in-the-money calls. Second, if all goes well, Iíd have to pay another set of commissions to close the call spread, but with the put spread I could just let both options expire worthless and keep the credit I collected.\n\nI should point out that a bull put spread like this requires keeping $1,000 in margin available, but thatís not much different than paying $805 for the bull call spread (and in fairness, Bobís OTM call spread costs far less and the position requires no margin).\n\nKey takeaways? Regardless of your view on the movement of a stock, you can have theta working for you or against you. And with spreads like these, the options market usually offers equivalent risk/reward profiles whether you use calls or puts.\n\nImportant Note The Greeks represent the consensus of the marketplace as to the how the option will react to changes in certain variables associated with the pricing of an option contract. There is no guarantee that these forecasts will be correct.\n\nWhile Theta represents the consensus of the marketplace as to the amount a theoretical optionís price will change for a corresponding one-unit (day) change in the days to expiration of the option contract"

      "text": "How To Survive The Trading Game\n\nIn the complex world of trading systems, there are two types of people: programmers and traders. Designing a trading system is a challenge, requiring complex programming experience and skill. But designing a system that actually makes money requires an excellent understanding of the markets, technical indicators, investor sentiment and a whole array of complex data interrelationships.\n\nSo where does the programmer without trading experience get instructions? From a trader, but the success of the system depends on how well the trader can communicate to the programmer what the system should do, and then on how skilled the programmer is at translating the desired actions into programming code.\n\nThe programmer/trader hybrid is a breed apart. This is someone who, having traded with real money, knows what is needed to develop a winning trading system and also has the programming skills to put the strategy into code. Such a person suffers no misunderstandings or translation challenges. Robert James Deadman, president of Trading Systems Analysis Group (TSAGroup), is such an individual.\n\nAs a trader who designs systems, Deadman, who has 12 years of trading experience, takes a different approach to trading than most who play the markets. Not only does he have to create strategies that work in the trading arena, but he must also be able to translate them into program code so that his clients can trade them. This means he must test his strategies exhaustively to ensure they work.\n\nTrader's Advice What is the most important criterion in a trading system, according to Deadman?\n\n\"Most traders consider profitability to be top priority; but to professional traders and money managers, capital preservation or limiting losses is penultimate,\" he says.\n\nCandidates must exhibit a number of conditions before they are considered.\n\nDeadman continues, \"In finding robust systems, we use a parameter called trade efficiency. How does the system perform when it is in the market against a buy and hold strategy? For this we need trading systems that outperform the buy and hold strategy. Then we look for trades that preserve capital. What is the trade's stop-loss? Lastly, we look at profitability.\"\n\n\"The major difference between the professional and non-professional is that the latter is looking to hit the home run while ignoring the cumulative effects of losses. What good is having a system that makes 50% but then loses 15 to 20% per trade in the next five trades? If the pro did this he or she would be out of business in short order,\" says Deadman.\n\nTrading Examples Here is an example of what he means. When TSA's latest product, called Trade Oracle™, was used to scan a group of stocks, Zix Corporation (ZIXI), a secure e-mailing message service, came up in the search. It showed an impressive four-year return of 900% in a total of 26 trades, 21 of which were winners, a historical success rate of more than 80% and a risk/reward, measured by maximum wins to losses, of 102 to 19 or more than 5:1. It certainly had all the markings of a winner.\n\nBut this was not a trade that Deadman would consider and the reason is simple: An examination of the trading history (see figure 2) showed a projected stop-loss of 63%.\n\n\"Even though the system has made a ton of money hypothetically in the past, I am not going to consider a trade in which the stop-loss or risk represents 10%, let alone 63%,\" he says. \"Two bad trades, my money is gone and it's back to square one.\"\n\nWhat sort of trades does Deadman like? Here is a trade he actually took around the same time. Medco Health (MHS) came up in a scan of more than 7,000 stocks that he performs daily using end-of-day data and then scanning for candidates using Trade Oracle. The system that found the stock was the 10-day breakout. The historical success rate was 58% with a total of 34 trades, 14 of which were losers and a risk/reward of 7.4 to 2.7 or slightly less than 3:1. This looked anemic compared to ZIXI, but Deadman's most important parameter was met: the maximum stop-loss was just 1.6%.\n\nEmotional Rescue \"I use Reuters end-of-day and I want a system that I don't have to watch all the time while I'm in a trade, since I'm not a day trader. If I lose 1.6%, it's no big deal; I exit the following day and then look for my next trade,\" Deadman says.\n\n\"The biggest problem facing most traders is their emotions. Once I know my maximum downside, I can forget about it and just follow the signals. I'm not tempted to watch every dip and jump intraday, since that only causes unnecessary stress. The odds are in my favor and if it goes against me, my money is protected and I will still have money to trade another day.\"\n\nFor Deadman, it's a strategy that takes all the \"unnecessary emotion\" out of the equation.\n\nFigure 3 – Daily chart of MHS showing equity curve in percent in the upper window and buy, sell and exit signals in main window. Chart provided by Metastock and trading system signals by Trade OracleTM.\n\n\"Don't get me wrong, I like to cash in on the big winners as much as anyone else,\" says Deadman. \"But unlike most retail traders, profitability is not first but third on my list of priorities. What good is a home run if by the time it comes along I'm not in the game? By choosing trades that preserve capital, if a big win comes along it's a bonus, not essential to making money in the markets.\"\n\nStay Alive by Preserving Capital Deadman says that designing systems has forced him not only to be more disciplined in his own trading, but also to incorporate his money management philosophies into his programs. If his systems work for him in trading real money in the markets, he knows they will work for his clients.\n\nHowever, he stresses that it is important to find a system that suits each individual's risk tolerance and personality. Any good system should have the flexibility to work regardless of the trader's goals, and it is important to not lose sight of your priorities.\n\nIf preservation of capital is not the most important consideration in your system, chances are you will end up a casualty of a high-stakes market roller coaster"

      "text": "The first element of any trading plan is the amount of capital you intend to invest. This is up to you, but you should understand that there is a direct relationship between the amount of capital you commit and your probability of success. The more you invest, the greater is the likelihood that you will make money.\n\nWhat is the minimum advisable amount to start with? Most professionals agree that it takes a minimum of $10,000. If you try to trade with anything less, what happens to you will be luck. You won't have the capital necessary to apply proper risk management principles.\n\nAn important thing to keep in mind when deciding how much to commit initially to commodity trading is that the amount you invest must be \"risk capital.\" Risk capital is defined as money you can afford to lose without affecting your standard of living. It should also be money that you feel comfortable risking. Think of your commodity account as an investment in a business. Many businesses fail. That's life. Make sure you won't be so afraid of losing money that it will affect your ability to make correct trading decisions.\n\nThe next part of your trading plan involves how you will make your actual buying and selling decisions. Under what conditions will you enter trades? When will you exit your trades? What markets will you trade?\n\nThere are four cardinal principles which should be part of every trading strategy. They are: 1) Trade with the trend, 2) Cut losses short, 3) Let profits run, and 4) Manage risk. These building blocks are so basic and important that I have written a whole book about them. You should make sure your strategy includes each of these requirements for success."

      "text": "A question came up during the webinar last week regarding stop hunting. One of the attendees was curious about it, no doubt having heard the term bandied about among retail traders. This gets brought up on a fairly regular basis, mostly by folks who saw their stop get hit in a market that quickly reverses back in the direction of their trade (see Stop-hunting is NOT the problem some people say). Let me try to clarify things.\n\nBasically, what we're talking about here is one or more market participants attempting to manipulate prices such that the market reaches a level where preset orders are believed to reside in order to trigger those orders. Notice I didn't specifically say \"stop\" orders there. They could be stops or limits. It doesn't really matter. Those attempting to hunt those orders are just looking to get them triggered for their own purposes.\n\nWhy stop hunt?\nSo what are those purposes?\n\nImagine there are a bunch of buy orders residing at 100. What is likely to happen if the market hits 100 and triggers those orders? The market will probably go higher, right? If you know (or think) those orders are there and have the ability to push the market in that direction, can you see how you might want to trip those buy orders and then sell into the subsequent market move either to take profits on a long position or to sell at a better price?\n\nThis sort of thing has been going on for many, many years. Stories have come out of the futures trading pits (and probably from stock exchange floors too) for ages. It also happens in the inter-bank market where the primary pricing of forex rates is done.\n\nWhere retail forex is concerned, stop hunting is generally talked about more in terms of brokers manipulating prices. The fact that some retail brokers act as counter-party to their customers trades (market-making or dealing desk brokers) rather than acting as middle men (ECN or Straight Pass Through brokers) is seen as incentivizing said brokers to move prices against their customers to trigger their stop loss orders so the broker can profit from customer losses.\n\nThe reality\nBack in the early days of retail forex there probably were unsavory brokers who manipulated prices to their advantage, and may still be in certain corners of the globe. Things have gotten much tighter in recent years, though, so if you stick with a reputable firm you'll be free of that sort of abuse. In fact, as much as some like to bad-mouth the new regulations put in place in the US by the NFA and CFTC, part of what they have done is to put brokers under a spotlight to ensure these sorts of things don't happen, and are punished if they do. In fact, one forex forum member put it to the test and found no evidence of stop hunting by retail forex brokers.\n\nIn other words, if you get stopped out on a price spike, it's not your broker stop-hunting you. They get their prices from the inter-bank market, so if there was stop hunting being done it was almost certainly happening at that level.\n\nStop hunting will continue to go on in the markets, but it's not something you should worry about. If you trade for any length of time you will inevitably fall victim to an adverse price move that takes you out of a trade only to see it reverse. There are any number of things that can make that happen. Where you are concerned, it's either bad luck or bad stop location. A lot of those who claim they were stop-hunted just placed their stop too close to the market and either don't realize it or don't want to take the blame for poor decision-making"

      "text": "Why Trade Forex?\n\nOnline forex trading has become very popular in the past decade because it offers traders several advantages:\n\nForex never sleeps\n\nTrading goes on all around the world during different countries' business hours. You can, therefore, trade major currencies at any time, 24 hours per day. Since there are no set exchange hours, it means that there is also something happening at almost any time of the day or night.1\n\nGo long or short\n\nUnlike many other financial markets, where it can be difficult to sell short, there are no limitations on shorting currencies. If you think a currency will go up, buy it. If you think it will fall, sell it. This means there is no such thing as a \"bear market\" in forex - you can make (or lose) money any time.\n\nLow trading costs\n\nMost forex accounts trade without a commission and there are no expensive exchange fees or data licenses. The cost of trading is the spread between the buy price and the sell price, which is always displayed on your trading screen.\n\nUnmatched liquidity\n\nBecause forex is a $4 trillion a day market, with most trading concentrated in only a few currencies, there are always a lot of people trading. This makes it typically very easy to get in to and out of trades at any time, even in large sizes.\n\nAvailable leverage\n\nBecause of the deep liquidity available in the forex market, you can trade forex with considerable leverage (up to 50:1). This can allow you to take advantage of even the smallest moves in the market. Leverage is a double-edged sword, of course, as it can significantly increase your losses as well as your gains.\n\nInternational exposure\n\nAs the world becomes more and more global, investors hunt for opportunities anywhere they can. If you want to take a broad opinion and invest in another country (or sell it short!), forex is an easy way to gain exposure while avoiding vagaries such as foreign securities laws and financial statements in other languages.\n\n1 Subject to available liquidity, FXCM's trading desk is open from 5:15 pm (ET) sunday afternoon to 4:55 pm (ET) on fridays.

It's still just another way to make money.\n\nI don't actually trade stocks (yet) I trade forex and commodities, however stock investing has the added benefit of providing capital to the companies which if they are good and profitable provide a benefit to society.\n\nI like Aelle's explanations a lot. The companies that directly interface with the end consumers all rely on wholesale products and services from B2B companies and things like commodity prices and currency exchange rates.\n\nAsk yourself this - how many of the companies that you use for your day to day existence are tradeable on the stock exchange? Would they be in a position to provide the value they do to you had they not floated and allowed investors and traders to inject capital into them to finance their operations? How about the B2B companies they rely on to provide you with value (take your internet connection for example) - do they have tradable shares that are providing them with the capital needed to function efficiently and stay in business?\n\nQuote:\n\nAnyway, the main motivation for a career usually has nothing to do with either of these things - it's more about what you enjoy doing day after day. You're probably going to have a longer career as an apple farmer if you enjoy spending your days outdoors and learn about plants than if you just believe deep down that the world would be a better place with more apples. Similarly, I suppose traders are in it primarily for the pleasure of solving mathematical problems, or for the thrill of handling large sums of money, or for the people they get to meet in the industry, or for the unusual work hours. Mundane stuff, like the rest of us.\n\nI love trading, I'm learning more about myself than in any other field.

These are all the necessary steps you need to do in order to perform your time series statistical analysis.\nBut these are just the basics; you can create much more advanced studies with the help of custom outputs and custom metrics.\n\nLet us start with the basics.\nFirst of all you need a pattern or a trading rule (or many). It could be indicators crossing or anything else. Letís take the moving average crossing for example: sma(close, 20) > sma(close, 50).\nChoose the symbols to include in the analysis and set the start and end period. You can select an index, a stock, a list of stocks, a currency or any other time series.\nFinally select an output. The simplest output would be the symbols return after a fixed period; that is, calculating the returns of the symbols from the bar where the pattern occurs to a fixed future bar.\nYou can choose between a long and a short output, where the long output will simulate a buy at open on the pattern bar+1 and a sell at open on the pattern bar + a fixed number of bars and the opposite for the short output.\n\nA bit more advanced output, would be to set the output as the symbols return with the use of a trailing stop.\nYou also need to know that the output is not limited to analyzing symbols return; it can analyze everything, from future volatility to the likelihood of an event to occur in the future.\nExamples of custom outputs:\nFuture volatility: Analyze and measure the market or securities future volatility (the time-horizon could be defined in the output) after a defined pattern.\nEarning surprise: Analyze the stocks future movement after an earnings release.\nFuture liquidity: Study the change in liquidity that could happen in any security after a specific pattern.\nOptions: Simulate an option strategy (the output will be the option strategy return).\nLevels: Calculate and estimate the likelihood that a security crosses one or many levels after a specific pattern.\nAs you can see, you can define any kind of output and the possibilities are limitless.\n\nAfter running the analyzer, the software will compile a list of statistical metrics for each trading signal or pattern and displays the result in a grid.\n\nHere is a small list of available statistical metrics:\nNumber of output: the number of the occurrence of the pattern in the time series.\nAverage output: The average output of this statistical study.\nPP: The percentage of positive outputs.\nSDV: The standard deviation of the output values.\nIn addition to these statistical metrics and some other pre-calculated ones, you can create any metric from the scripting language or you can download the ones created by other users.\nNote also that when analyzing the data, you have the possibility to select more than one output.\n\nIn a future post, we will discuss how to create custom metrics and how to optimize patterns in this statistical data analysis tool."

Let's say, for instance, that you enter a digital option at $20 that will pay $250 if it closes at $20 or more. You will get paid a flat rate of $250 if it closes at $21 or if it closes at $2,021.

Zulutrade is an example of such a site and I though I'd take the time to try and explain to people how much is 1 pip.\n\nI took one of the leading signal providers on Zulutrade. The photos shows one of their top 20 strategies there. I looked at the summary of that strategy.\n\nAs you can see, this strategy made 296 pips and has executed 141 trades. This means that if you pay 1 pip for every trade, you would have made only 155 pips on this strategy (296 minus the 141 pips that would have paid for per trade). That is about 50% of the reported performance. So in this specific example, 1 pip equates to 50% of the gain you could have made. I would say that's pretty expensive, not to mention the same 144 pips would have been paid if the strategy had lost you money.\n\nThe big problem of charging traders with a spread increase is that you are not only defining a pricing structure that is not properly defined, but you are also creating a motivation of the signal provider to trade more often as opposed to incentivize them for successful (and profitable) trading"

Of course all spreadbet companies are Arthur Daleys, but only a few make money out of bins,so it seems to be a more level playing field.\nPS Never try and day trade ftse with a spreadbet allowing only a stop of 12 ticks- forget the tax, go with IB."

This would have merely made your broker richer, not to mention unnecessarily giving away 40 to 50 pips of your profits, and as you can see price returned precisely to where it was before.\nI'll concede that not having a stop could mean that price could keep going down for days and result into a margin call. But if that is the case you are overleveraged, or rather, your lot size is too big because a leverage of 1:500 on a lot of 100 dollars isn't going to get you into a margin call on a large enough account, but on a lot of 200,000, that's a whole different story.\nThat is a demo account, looking at it, you can also see how averaging down combined with using known correlations would work for hedging.

      "text": "Frequently Asked Question\n\nHow does somebody make money short selling?\n\nShort selling is a fairly simple concept: you borrow a stock, sell the stock and then buy the stock back to return it to the lender.\n\nShort sellers make money by betting that the stock they sell will drop in price. If the stock drops, the short seller buys it back at a lower price and returns it to the lender.\n\nFor example, if an investor thinks Ben's Brewing Business (BBB) is overvalued at $25 and is going to drop in price, he or she may borrow the stock and sell it for $25. If the stock goes down to $20, the investor, after buying it back and returning it, would make $5 per share. However, if the stock goes up to $30, the investor would lose $5 per share.\n\nIf you can't see the amplified risk right now, let's make it obvious: when you buy a stock (or go long) you can lose only the money that you've invested. So, if you bought one BBB share at $25, the maximum you could lose is $25 because the stock cannot drop to less than $0. However, when you short sell, you can theoretically lose an infinite amount of money, because a stock's price can keep rising forever. So, for example, if you had a short position in BBB (or short sold it) and BBB ended up rising past $60 before you exited your position, you would lose $35 per share ($60-$25) - even more than the stock's original price.\n\nWhile short selling does present investors with an opportunity to make profits in a declining or neutral market, it should only be attempted by sophisticated investors and advanced traders"

      "text": "Friday, February 03, 2012\n\nThoughts on commerce II\n\nWhen you learn about financial markets, you get to hear some everyday words used in incomprehensible ways. Like credit or short or stock or derivative. There are two terms that you don't hear too much unless you work with \"the markets\", but are very integral and precious to anyone in the markets - market making and price discovery.\n\nMarket making\nI didn't quite understand the term when I first heard it in class. It only sank in when a trader told me \"this bond is not very liquid, but I'm trying to make a market in it\". He was literally \"making\" a market, by calling up a lot of people and asking if they want to buy or sell that bond.\n\nWe are of course used to market makers - the bhajiwaala who buys off the farmer/other middle man and asks people if they want to buy off him. The broker who connects house buyers and sellers. Shop keepers, malls, etc. Even the advertising agency that informs you of products that are available - thus introducing the sellers with the buyers.\n\nThe costs of a market maker are the time spent in this activity, the risk of not being able to sell his stock at the right price (if he buys outright without assurance that someone will buy from him) and other incidentals like renting a physical space convenient to buyers and sellers, transportation costs of bringing things from the seller to the buyer. Payment for this takes many forms - brokerage, commission, agency fees, etc. This cost has to be covered by the value created. In other words, it is only worth creating a market, if the additional value creation is higher than the costs of creating that market. For instance, if a basket of oranges gets a price of 20 rupees in the village and 80 rupees in the city, it is worth bringing it to the city if the transport cost + your opportunity cost (of doing something else with the time) is less than 60 rupees.\n\nMiddle men are a much maligned lot. Sometimes justly. But if it was not for the middle man, value would never be created. Supposedly, Bill Gates bought DOS from Seattle Computer Products for $50,000 (at least, that is what the movie Pirates of Silicon Valley said) and made millions of it. Did Seattle Computer get cheated? Did IBM and other companies that bought DOS? They all made money from it, including the end users of those computers - and they made money because Microsoft made it possible.\n\nPrice discovery\nPrice gets confused with worth often. But while the worth of something may differ from person to person, the price is the same all across the market. Theoretically, the price is that point at which you can match the most number of buyers and sellers - because that is when you also maximise value. In other words, if 3 buyers think a basket of oranges is worth 60, 50 and 40 respectively and 4 sellers think the basket is worth 30, 40, 50 and 60 - the price will be set somewhere between 40 and 50. A price of 60 will get you one buyer and 4 sellers - which is only one transaction and maximum value of 30 (the seller valuing the basket at 30 sells to the buyer valuing at 60). A price of 30 gets you 3 buyers but only one seller -and again, the maximum value created is 30, in one transaction. But a price of 40 or 50 gets you 2 buyers and 2 sellers each. Maximum value created: 60 + 50 - 30 - 40 = 40.\n\nGetting the price right is very important to every market and every market maker. The best markets are the most responsive ones, that can adjust the price as soon as they realise that there are most sellers or more buyers. When prices are wrong, a lot of value is destroyed and the markets can also become dysfunctional. When food gets subsidised, for instance, there are more buyers than sellers in the market. Suppose the price of oranges was fixed at 30, in the previous instance. Only one seller but three buyers - which means 2 buyers have to go empty handed in spite being willing to pay higher than the market price. There is no incentive to the other sellers to sell their oranges, even though there are buyers willing to pay their price.\n\nPrice is even more important to people who \"take risk on their books\". In other words - people who buy the products before re-selling them. For them, guessing what they will be able to re-sell at is what determines if they will be making any money that day. Or eating a lot of oranges instead.\n\n5 comments:\n\nThere are people, entities which make or try to make market out of nothing. Best example is how Goldman Sach's made a market of what was termed as most riskiest and dirtiest asset (or loan classes) of sub-prime products. Once the market is created and product has volume, interest and buzz they make commisions out of each selling they make out of it. Here is the market makers clog the real value(worth) using series of complex products. We all know what happen the Market of an illiquid product is made and flourishes, the market maker makes money, anyone and everyone remotely involved in this market got tanked, shaking the economies and sending jitters accross the planet. So much to do with Finance, commerce and economics.\n\nA bit like the traditional used car-salesman? Or the marketer of junk food? Creating a market out of nothing which in the end destroys value?\n\nI've seen a little of the world you are talking about (sales guys of complex financial products) and I know that they are not willfully out to ruin the world for their personal gain. What they are is ignorant and arrogant. Not much better than outright wickedness of course, but I like to blame people for the right crime.\n\nAlso, what a lot of people forget is that the buyers of these products were also supposedly smart guys who should have understood the complex financial products they were buying. If a fruit seller gave you a closed basket and assured you that it was a product you liked, would you buy it? If you don't know what you are buying - stay away. Don't take a loan when you don't understand interest rates, don't buy mutual funds or invest in shares when you don't understand risk and return.\n\nAnyway, the broader intent of these blog posts is to talk myself through all the things I've learnt in the last few years and try to distill them down to their first principles. I stayed away from financial markets on purpose because they are a lot more complicated. I'm talking of commerce (as opposed finance) - which is the everyday trade of goods and services.\n\nA lot of what you spoke of is part of what I mean to write in the part - liquidity, mistaken valuations and the concept of risk as a liability.\n\nOne clarification (before someone else points it out) - when I say I'm not talking of financial markets, I mean to say that is not the bulk of the subject. I worked in financial markets and that is where I draw most of my learning from. But I'm trying to look at the broader principles than just financial markets.\n\nYaa true and false. Sales push a product and make up a need of that product overwhelmingly necessary than the actual need. So when I see those sales calls asking for personal loans or a credit card or any other product every other day, one day or the other ignoring of the risk they do purchase it. The same does happen in the bigger market, the crowd follows each other as it grows and smart stop using brains just to keep up with the market. Funny but the human psychology plays a bigger part than smartness to say off.\n\nInteresting thought that - are people buying a credit card, or buying peace from a pesky telemarketer? That is part of the purpose of this exercise too - understand that the value you derive may not be what it seems. Once you identify what the value is, then you can compare it with the cost and see if it is worth it."

This annual cycle of extreme oversupplies and subsequent undersupplies created inefficient price discovery and led to hardships for both producers and consumers.\n\nThe feast-or-famine cycle created circumstances in which farmers were forced to sell their goods at a large discount when supplies were high, but consumers were required to pay a large premium during times of tight supplies. Luckily, a few of the grain traders put their heads and resources together to develop a solution…an organized exchange now known as the Chicago Board of Trade.\n\nToday there are much more advanced and in-depth methods to trade commodities, but the idea stays the same.\n\nWhereas stock trading relies on the performance of individual companies, commodity trading is based on the status of specific items. Essentially traders buy contracts that represent an amount of the given quantity.\n\nFor example, the Chicago Board of Trade says one wheat contract is worth 5,000 bushels. If the supply of wheat looks to be decreasing, then that could raise the price of those contracts. Demand must still be there.\n\nObviously the above is just a simple example of what to expect in commodity trading. There are several other benefits and methods to taking advantage of this type of trading. Even if you are not trading commodities, understanding what contracts are being bought and sold can help you determine the status of a certain commodity which could ultimately effect individual stocks.\n\nThe author of this book, Carley Garner, draws on her extensive experience teaching traders, shows how to calculate profit, loss, and risk in commodities, and choose the best brokerage firm, service level, data sources, and market access for your needs.\n\nYou will find specific guidance on accessing commodity markets cost-effectively, avoiding common beginners' mistakes, and improving the odds of successful, profitable trades.\n\nGarner demystifies the industry's colorful language, helps you clearly understand what you're buying and selling, and walks you through the entire trading process.

      "text": "Money and Risk management\n\nGood money and risk management is more important than the correct application of technical analysis! With good money management you survive much longer in the stock market, even with a number of trading failures in a row. With good risk management you also make sure that the risk/reward ratio is in your favor at least with a ratio 1 to 3.\n\nGood money and risk management limits as much as possible losses in losing trades and makes as much as possible profit in the winning trades. Assume you are trading based on daily charts, you buy a stock and sell it when the stock drops more than 3% below the buying price. Unfortunately limiting losses is not that easy! In this example, the result will most probably be too many losing trades and losing all of your money at the end.\n\nHow much loss you need to accept will be proportional to how much profit you want to make in a certain period of time. Only accepting 2% loss and a 5% profit target could be possible when using hourly charts. Looking at the medium term and using daily charts however, loss will be more in the range of 10% with a profit target in the order of 25%.\n\nAlso do not forget that behind every stock there is a company that can go broke! So, you may lose all your money investing it in one stock only.\n\nGood money management means:\n\nOnly use money you do not need for living expenses.\n\nDo not put more money at risk than what you have.\n\nInvesting and using a credit line or a leverage (Futures, Options) should only be done with money you can afford to lose in full.\n\nDepending of the starting capital you must spread the money among more stocks.\n\nYou must limit the loss in a single trade from 1% to maximum 2% of your total portfolio value.\n\nYou must limit the loss in one trade to about 15% maximum of the trade value.\n\nIf your starting capital is too low to invest in more stocks, you can use an ETF tracker (Exchange Traded Fund) of a stock index. The index than takes care of the necessary stock risk spread.\n\nSearch the Internet\n\nGood risk management means: Keep an initial stop based on:\n\nThe maximum allowed loss in a trade.\n\nThe maximum allowed loss in relation to the total portfolio value.\n\nThe use of an initial stop based on technical analysis.\n\nA risk/reward ratio of minimum 1 to 3.\n\nKeep a trailing stop for maximum profit based on:\n\nUse a trailing stop based on the volatility of the stock.\n\nApply a method for distributing profits or losses between stocks in your portfolio.\n\nMoney management and buying power\n\nArbitrary number of stocks\n\nA first money management method would be to trade in a limited number of stocks out of an unlimited list of stocks.\nA second method, we will discuss later on, would be to trade a fixed, limited number of stocks.\n\nA $25,000 starting capital, could be used to invest in 10 stocks any moment in time, limiting the capital per stock to $2,500.\n\nKeeping an average loss per stock of 10% or $250 would only be a 1% loss in relation to the total capital.\n\nOf course you would have to calculate your buying power with each purchase in relation to your cash value and the value of the stocks in the portfolio. You could use the following spread sheet for this:\n\nLook in the \"Capturing Profit with Technical Analysis\" book for this spread sheet...\n\nIs this setup sufficiently crash resistant?\n\nLet's apply this system and calculate each time the maximum allowed buying value for each contract. Next, we assume the most negative scenario. Each of the 10 contracts ends up as a losing trade with a 10% loss. This even happens 10 times in a row. A total of 100 consecutive losing trades\n\nCrash resistant?\n\n10 contracts investment\n\n10 contracts losing trades\n\nRemaining amount\n\nStarting value\n\n25000\n\nTrade_1\n\n23904\n\n2390\n\n22610\n\nTrade_2\n\n21618\n\n2162\n\n20448\n\nTrade_3\n\n19552\n\n1955\n\n18493\n\nTrade_4\n\n17682\n\n1768\n\n16725\n\nTrade_5\n\n15994\n\n1599\n\n15126\n\nTrade_6\n\n14464\n\n1446\n\n13680\n\nTrade_7\n\n13080\n\n1308\n\n12372\n\nTrade_8\n\n11830\n\n1183\n\n11189\n\nTrade_9\n\n10699\n\n1070\n\n10119\n\nTrade_10\n\n9676\n\n968\n\n9151\n\nStill there is a remaining capital of $9,151.

      "text": "Long Condor (aka Iron Condor, Bull Call Spread Bear Put Spread)\n\nDescription\n\nLong one call and short another call with a higher strike; also long one put and short another put with a lower strike. Typically, the call strikes are above and the put strikes below the current level of underlying stock, and the distance between the call strikes equals the distance between the put strikes. All the options must be of the same expiration. An alternative way to think about this strategy is long a strangle and short an even wider strangle. It could also be considered as a bull call spread and a bear put spread.\n\nOutlook\n\nLooking for sharp move either up or down in underlying stock during the life of the options.\n\nSummary\n\nThis strategy profits if the underlying stock is outside the outer wings at expiration.\n\nMAXIMUM LOSS\n\nMotivation\n\nVariations\n\nInstead of a body and two wings, the body has been split into two different strikes so that there are two shoulders in the middle and two wingtips outside the shoulders.\n\nMax Loss\n\nThe maximum loss would occur should the underlying stock be between the lower call strike and upper put strike at expiration. In that case all the options would expire worthless, and the premium paid to initiate the position would have been lost.\n\nMax Gain\n\nThe maximum gain would occur should the underlying stock be above the upper call strike or below the lower put strike at expiration. In that case either both calls or both puts would be in-the-money. The profit would be the difference between either the call strikes or the put strikes (whichever are in-the-money), less the premium paid to initiate the position.\n\nProfit/Loss\n\nThe potential profit and loss are both very limited. In essence, a condor at expiration has a minimum value of zero and a maximum value equal to the span of either wing. An investor who buys a condor pays a premium somewhere between the minimum and maximum value, and profits if the condor's value moves toward the maximum as expiration approaches.\n\nBreakeven\n\nThis strategy breaks even if at expiration the underlying stock is either above the lower call strike or below the upper put strike by the amount of the premium paid to initiate the position.\n\nUpside breakeven = call strike + premiums paid\n\nDownside breakeven = put strike - premiums paid\n\nVolatility\n\nAn increase in implied volatility, all other things equal, would have a positive impact on this strategy.\n\nTime Decay\n\nThe passage of time, all other things equal, will have a negative effect on this strategy.\n\nAssignment Risk\n\nYes. The short options that form the wingtips of the condor are subject to exercise at any time, while the investor decides if and when to exercise the shoulders of the wings. If an early exercise occurs at a wingtip, the investor can exercise their option from the appropriate shoulder to lock in the maximum gain and continue to hold the other half of the position, which might still have value. So early exercise might be a good thing, although it would require borrowing stock or financing stock for one business day.\n\nAnd be aware, any situation where a stock is involved in a restructuring or capitalization event, such as for example a merger, takeover, spin-off or special dividend, could completely upset typical expectations regarding early exercise of options on the stock.\n\nExpiration Risk\n\nYes. If at expiration the stock is trading right at either wingtip the investor would face uncertainty as to whether or not they would be assigned on that wingtip. Should the investor not be assigned on the wingtip, they could be unexpectedly long or short the stock on the Monday following expiration and hence subject to an adverse move over the weekend"

      "text": "Economic forecasting\n\n\"...the amount of knowledge we have in a certain area will not help us predict what will happen if the events are inherently unpredictable.\" --Thomas Kida\n\nEconomic forecasting predicts the rise and fall of stock prices, or such things as the gross national product and the inflation rate. Forecasters employ a variety of methods and formulas. Some forecasters, some of the time, make apparently successful predictions on the basis of their methods. They appear to have identified real patterns in the market. The reality, however, is that all forms of successful economic forecasting are illusory because the economy is a complex system significantly affected by irrational forces (Kida 2006). In short, there is no logical system that can predict the market because the market isn't logical. Anyone who thinks he has discovered a system that can \"beat\" the market is deceiving himself. (Note: \"beating the market\" means doing better than an index of funds, such as Standard and Poor's 500, over some period of time.)\n\nOne fact hinders acceptance of the claim that markets are unpredictable: some people have correctly predicted that the market would rise or fall and some have made a killing from time to time by following their unique and special method of prediction. Yes, and a broken clock is right twice a day and some people do win the lottery using special methods of selecting their numbers. Even though some people have made correct predictions about the market, those predictions should not be taken as evidence of the power of any particular method of economic forecasting. Psychics make correct predictions from time to time. Does that mean they're really psychic?\n\nTwo popular systems for predicting the rise and fall of stock prices are technical analysis (TA) and fundamental analysis (FA). Technical analysts are also called chartists. They are fond of collecting stock price charts like the one below.\n\nA typical price chart for a stock will show the price of the stock over time. A chartist looks for patterns in charts, patterns he believes are predictive. Is there any scientific evidence that there are some truly predictive patterns in stock price charts? No, but there is scientific evidence that chartists see patterns in random processes (Malkiel 2007). According to Thomas Kida, there is a wealth of scientific research going back nearly half a century demonstrating that \"charting is useless.\" \"Technical analysis can't beat the market\" (Kida 2003: p. 122). The long and the short of it is: past prices of stocks are extremely poor predictors of future prices. Why are there so many technical analysts working for brokerage firms, then? Because they recommend a lot of trades and trades generate commissions (Malkiel 2007).\n\nDoes the fact that the scientific evidence shows that technical analysis is no better than chance in predicting the price of stocks mean that nobody ever makes any money buying and selling stocks following the advice of a technical analyst? Of course not. By chance alone many brokers are going to make recommendations that make money for their clients. The illusion is in thinking that technical analysis provides a magic formula that will continue to bring success forever and ever. No, in the long run, there will be some big winners and some big losers, but the average among most of the investors will be no better than what you would get if you let a monkey throw darts at a list of all the stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nIs fundamental analysis any better than technical analysis? Fundamental analysis \"attempts to determine the intrinsic (true) value of a stock based on a firm's underlying economic variables.\" The technique assumes that when the market price is below the intrinsic value, the stock is undervalued and the price will rise when the market properly adjusts\" (Kida: p.146; Sherden 1999). Despite its popularity, the scientific evidence shows that fundamental analysis is no better than technical analysis at predicting the price of stocks (Kida 2003; Malkiel 2007).\n\nThink about it. If stock analysts could really beat the market consistently, wouldn't they be stinking rich? Do you really think they are a clan of benevolent elves whose only goal is to help people like you get rich from their technical advice? Their cousins appear in infomercials all the time, telling stories about unfathomable riches that await you if you invest in their program. That's how they make their money, folks. Not by using their program, but by selling it to others!\n\nWhat about the superstars? Aren't there freelancers and top mutual fund managers who consistently beat the market because of their special expertise? Aren't there investment managers from pension funds, insurance companies, and foundations that consistently beat the market because of their genius? No. It's easy to pick a person or a fund and show its superiority to the market, as long as you are very selective about what time period you evaluate. Over the long haul, however, no one person and no fund does better than chance at beating the market (Sherden 1999; Kida 2003). It is true that some fund managers do better than others over certain periods of time. The few examples of consistently superior performance over a period of, say, four or five years, however, are what one would expect by chance (Malkiel 2007). \"Analyses of the Forbes honor role funds over the period 1973 to 1998 indicate that they underperformed the S&P 500 stock index (Kida 2003: p. 142; Malkiel 2007). In short, there's no scientific evidence that professionally managed funds, as a group, perform any better than a randomly selected group of stocks (Kida 2003: p. 143; Malkiel 2007).\n\nWhat about the geniuses at the Fed, the Council of Economic Advisers, the Congressional Budget Office, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the National Bureau of Economic Research? Surely these top economic advisers with their large budgets and sophisticated tools of analysis are able to consistently make accurate predictions about such things as the gross national product and inflation. Wrong! \"A review of twelve studies on forecasting accuracy, covering the periods 1970 to 1995, concluded that economists can't even predict the major turning points in our economy. The top economic institutions listed above were wrong in their predictions of forty-six out of forty-eight turning points in our economy (Kida 148). That's about a 4 percent success rate. Not too impressive.\n\nNineteenth century historian Thomas Carlyle called economics the \"dismal science.\" Much attention has been paid to what Carlyle meant by 'dismal.' It seems apparent that the problem with economic prediction is not with its dismalness, but with the fact that\n\n...economics typically does not use the scientific method, where hypotheses are tested by observing what goes on in the economy. Instead, economists often develop elaborate theories that may be logically consistent, but are often based upon unrealistic concepts. For example, a basic assumption of economics is that people are consistently rational in their behaviors. (Kida 2003: p. 149)\n\nThe scientific evidence, however, strongly suggests that our behavior is often irrational and therefore unpredictable. Even so, I predict that economists will continue to make economic predictions, providing society with mostly useless information at great cost. I also predict that economists will have as many satisfied customers as the psychics who claim to be able to see into the future. I predict that it will be not only economists and stockbrokers who will reject the idea that the market is essentially unpredictable. I predict that many customers, even those who have lost bundles of money in the stock market following the advice of their brokers, will refuse to believe that the market is unpredictable. They know from personal experience that it works. Personal experience is not a very good guide, however, when the one evaluating it is not an unbiased observer. The defenders of the predictability of the market will point to their successes and rationalize their failures as flukes or some such thing.\n\nI predict that stockbrokers and financial advisers will not go out of business in the near future. There will always be plenty of customers for them who will not accept William Sherden's dismal view:\n\nThe stock market is a psychological soup of fear, greed, hope, superstition, and a host of other emotions and motives.\n\nA few will look at the evidence and conclude that, so far, the only consistent economic fact is that the market rises over time despite recessions and other problems. Thus, the only \"sure-fire\" investment strategy for those who want to invest in the stock market is to invest in an index fund and keep it there for a long time.\n\nAnother strategy, of course, would be to buy one of those books by a stock analyst or a professional gambler that reveals a \"secret\" method of beating the odds.\n\nRe: Economic forecasting\n\nMarket is about demand and supply, is not different with stock exchange market\n\nWhat do affect the prices then? People's decisions. It is right that the markets are not rational because people are not.\n\nThis is why I think the stock exchange market is a game where the psychological component is the most important one, no matter what type of analysis you use.\n\nBoth technical analysis and fundamental analysis work when some conditions are present, but statistically if you use them to make same decisions in all kind of stocks , then it will obviously fail far more...\n\nThere are funds that have beaten the market for decades, obviously they are not going to tell everybody their method ;)"

(The reason being that the OTMoptions have less Vega than the ATM options.) So in addition to pricemovement, we are hoping for an increase in volatility. Well, thatimplies that we would put this position on in a low volatilityenvironment. Isn't that the same contradiction we had with theStraddle? We want a low volatility environment, but large movement inthe stock! Yes and no; at expiration the volatility doesn't matteranymore. The stock price will be whatever it is, and that willdetermine the amount of profit or loss for the position. Prior toexpiration, the volatility can have a great impact on the value of theStrangle.\n\nTHETA ñ Once again, we're still dealing with only long options, andlong options have negative theta, so the position is losing value everyday. Making matters worse, the rate of loss is constantly accelerating.So what can we do to mitigate this situation? We generally don't buynear term Strangles. Like the Straddle, a rule of thumb is thatStrangle buys should be 3 months or more to expiration. I said\"generally\" for a reason.\n\nAs you can see, the long Strangle can be a very effective tool and canring in some large profits, but more than anything else you needmovement in the stock price. Since the maximum risk is defined, Iconsider this a low risk, low probability trade, but with a highpercentage return when it is profitable. Experts will continue todebate the advantages and disadvantages of the Strangle relative to theStraddle but most traders will come to feel comfortable with one or theother. For what it's worth, since I am basically a volatility trader Itend to do many more Straddles than Strangles. But then again, each oneof you will have to develop your own style.

      "text": "Lessons from the Pros - Commodities\n\nContinuous and Nearest Charts: Are They the Same?\n\nSubscribe to the Weekly Newsletter published by Online Trading Academy. Receive the full newsletter with charts!\n\nAnother variation of charting the Commodity Futures markets is using a continuous or nearest Futures contract type of chart. To many they might seem to be the same type of chart, but we will examine these two charts and see the differences.\n\nWhen trading Futures we have to be able to plot the data on charts just like we do in the Stock or Forex markets. This allows us to make informed decisions of where to place our buy and sell orders. However, unlike the Stock and Forex markets, the Futures markets have to deal with contracts that expire. This means a different type of chart must be used to include the expiration of these markets.\n\nIn earlier articles I had mentioned contract specific charts. These charts simply plot the life of the contract. Data is collected on these charts from the First Trading Day of the contract all the way up to the Last Trading Day. These charts do a good job of giving accurate price levels because there are no adjustments made to the chart nor are there any expirations to deal with. Unfortunately these charts can have some limitations also.\n\nWhen viewing these contract specific charts you first notice that there is a contract high and low. If the supply/demand balance of this market gets out of balance enough it will force prices through these highs/lows. Once this occurs we have no reference points for creating potential trading opportunities because this particular contract has never traded at these levels before.\n\nAnother problem you may encounter is the lack of liquidity before the market becomes a front month contract (highest volume and Open Interest). Before the market has good liquidity your chart may not have adequate candles to create market decisions.\n\nTo overcome this issue chartists have come up with Futures charts that are spliced onto one another as each contract expires and the next contract month begins to have the majority of volume in it. There are two styles of these charts:\n\nContinuous Charting\n\nNearby Charting\n\nThe charts most Futures traders are familiar with are the nearby charts. As the Futures market that is being charted gets close to expiration the contract is rolled over (volume leaves one contract month and goes to the next contract month out). In the case of the Soybean Meal market the majority of the volume and open interest is currently in the July contract (making this the front month). On June 29 we will have a First Notice day and all speculators will be required to exit their July Soybean Meal positions and if they feel the market will continue in a certain direction then they can enter the August contract (the new front month) by entering a new position in August Soybean Meal.\n\nThis rollover affects the charts we use to trade with. Once the First Notice Day occurs on June 29 and the majority of volume leaves the July Soybean Meal contract for the August Soybean Meal contract, the July contract still trades for another 10 days before expiration. This lack of liquidity in July Soybean Meal will start to show up on our charts as dots and dashes instead of full bodied candles like we are accustomed to seeing.\n\nCharting software is aware of this rollover issue and to compensate for it they will start plotting the August Soybean Meal contract prices onto the old July Soybean Meal data 10 days before the July contract expires.\n\n(These charts were obtained from Moore Research Center ( I wish to thank them for allowing us to use their charts to illustrate different charting styles.)\n\nNow we can view a Futures contract almost as though it had never expired. With continuous charts we can go back for many years, 40 years in some cases, to find extreme moves of a particular Commodity Futures market.\n\nThe other type of Futures chart is called a continuous chart. The big difference between a continuous and a nearby Futures chart is instead of attaching the next month on to the chart we will only connect the particular month we are interested in seeing.\n\nConfused yet? Hang in there, I will explain this.\n\nFigure 2 is going to show us a continuous chart using just the December Soybean Meal prices.\n\nFigure 2 illustrates how splicing just the past December contracts only to a chart can paint a different picture. Had this been an August weekly continuous contract then all we would see on the chart are all the past August contracts. Unlike the nearby who adds all the contracts that trade during the year to a chart the continuous only applies a specific month of the Commodity. Every January the contract month chosen begins plotting for that year. Then come December the following year's contract month starts plotting, all the same contract month just different years.\n\nI like looking at these continuous contracts to see how a particular market is trading compared to its previous years contract. By looking at just the December contract as in Figure 2, we are comparing apples to apples. Since Commodities are so cyclical it makes sense to see what a specific month is trading like compared to its previous year of the same contract month.\n\nI placed some lines on these charts just to give you some samples of some of the different ways these charts can appear. Notice in Figure 1 how the 2011 high has been decisively broken. While Figure 2 is showing how the December Soybean Meal is struggling to get through its December 2011 contract high.\n\nThe all time high in Figure 1 (nearby) was approximately $455.00 which could have been made during a different month than a December contract. Figure 2 (continuous) shows us that the all time high for \"any\" December contract is about $430. As prices approach these all time highs it is nice to know if the new high is simply a case of a nearby chart being spliced together with so many different months or is the high an actual lifetime high for a particular month of a Commodity.\n\nUnfortunately not all charting software will have the capability to splice the continuous charts together using specific contract months only.\n\nEither of these charts will work for selecting supply/demand levels because there are no adjustments made at rollovers. For most traders the nearby will work fine, but if you have access to the continuous charts you might pick up a little more information about how far out on the curve a particular contract really is in terms of life of contract.

However, the answers presented referred to the\ngaps in modified durations. Choices were in the millions (correct: 700 million) while DV01-gap was in the\nthousands (770,000)\n\n@Option pricing using binomial tree ==>Inconsenstency by GARP\nThey sated in the beginning that any calculations are done using continously discounting. That was not true.\nThere was one question which asked to calculate the value of a bond call option using risk-neutral probabilities.\nWith continously compounding this yielded 0.53 USD, with annual compounding 0.52 USD (which was one of the choices)\n\n@Question with formula for probability of default:\n\npd = e^x/(e^x + 1) and x = a + b/LTR + g*DSCR\n\nAsked for range of b and g; correct answer was (a): b < 0 and g < 0.\n\nCould have been derived analytically or by the given choices: Since LTR and DSCR both influence PDs any choices\nwith b>=0 or b<=0 or g>=0 or g<=0 could not work. This left only (a)\n\n@Question with LVaR and Constant Spread Approach:\nChoices were VaRs with different confidence level. Asked for which of those Liquidity ADJUSTMENT will be highest.\nThis is the case for the LOWEST VaR value, since Liquidity Cost are CONSTANT:\nI think this was option (a): 90% + 5 day horizon\n\n@Question with Barrier Options: Correct answer was 40; Explanation was given above@Volatility smile + asked for which option is undervalued: the ONLY correct answer was out-of-the-money-calls,\nbecause for those the quoted volatility is higher than that for at-the-money options.\n\n@Question with Senior + Equity tranche and pool of 2 bonds with notional of 100 each and equal PDs p. Notional of Senior Tranche was 100. Asked for default probability of equity/senior tranche:\n\nYou had to note that the equity tranche already defaults, when the first\nbond defaults, because than there is only monies left to serve the senior tranche.

What is the most plausible explanation for this inconsistency?\n==> Answered: Different model assumptions; However, it could have been data problems as well. In my opinion both choices are possible; But even if you would have perfect data, you will have differences,\ne.g. because Delta-Normal does not account for non-linearities, assumption of parametric distribution does not need to match the historical distribution@Some question regarding which bond to use to collateralize a financial innovation?\n==> I selected the bond with the LOWEST correlation with the financial innovation, even though it had 3rd highest volatility. Any opinions?I did 700M but how can DV01 could be so high and 100's of millions. I think GARP screwed up again.\n2. Surprisingly there was no question related to Merton Model. Just one straight forward question from KMV model (not quant question) only. The short term debt and long term debt are given. Then the question asks with model uses information related to such captial structure.

      "text": "Speed in the world of trading is everything. In the beginning, floor traders would be huddled together shouting orders inside the major exchanges. On average, these orders would take about 11 seconds to execute a trade. Nowadays, 50 to 70% are now executed by an algorithm at a speed rate and scale beyond our comprehension. Do yourself a favor and take 20 minutes to watch the video above. Then stumble into our trading courses page to arm yourself with strategies that work for regular, retail trader like yourself.\n\nAt first, you'll visit a small New Jersey trading firm. Trading time, at the most precise level, is often measured in microseconds (millionths of a second). By finding the number of microseconds since midnight of the previous day, you have a highly precise scale to occur when price movements occur. Using this scale, a high frequency trader might do 1000 trades each minute in quick bursts. Depending on the high frequency trading algorithm, a number of buy and sell orders will be blasted out to see if there's any response. When another computer bites on one, the original computer will cancel the ones that didn't \"stick.\" A perfect example of algorithmic trading occurred recently with Kraft (KRFT). An algorithm bought a bunch of Kraft and effectively jammed the other robots. The algorithm was then able to sell at much higher prices to other algorithms, netting a gain of over a half million dollars in a matter of seconds.\n\n\"There's always an advantage to getting information faster than the other guy.\" Take the case of news events. If you're aware of positive news regarding a company that hasn't yet hit the wire, you can make a lot of money on the buy low, sell high principle. With electronic markets, this \"get there first\" idea created a race of who can get their orders to the exchange first. Yes, your physical distance to the exchange matters when you're trading robotically. The speed of light is about a foot per nanosecond (one billionth of a second). If you can get in and out of trades very fast, millisecond after millisecond, you can game the system in your favor. Serious algorithmic traders began buying up real estate next to the exchange for the quickest connection possible. Eventually, regulators stepped in and allowed servers (for executing trades) to be hosted inside the mothership (exchange). To make it fair, every single computer in the NYSE server room in the NYSE has EXACTLY the same network cable length. Consider the amount of vertically stacked computers in this room that is the size of three football fields. This ensures competitive fairness to all the computers in the room placing algorithmic trades. These computers are owned or rented by banks, hedge funds, brokers, and financial institutions.\n\nIs the race for the fastest connection over at this point? No. There are 13 regulated exchanges and roughly 50 non-public dark pools. You can imagine the amount of complexity created by those who need to use trading data from one exchange for strategy purposes in another exchange. For example, say Chicago is known for its commodities (basic goods like oil, soy beans, corn, etc.). Let's say the price of oil goes up in Chicago. You can pretty much bet a company like Exxon will also go up in New York, although the time between the two is not instantaneous. This actually created a race to lay the straightest fiber line from Chicago to New York. Some reports say a company spent eight figures to lay a line with a 13ms connection through a mountain. Right now, a product is underway to create a series of towers to beam signals between the two exchanges, as light travels faster through air than fiber optics cable. For the big high frequency trading players, this arms race is a huge drain on resources. If you don't adopt a new connection technology and your competitors do, you'll miss out. This is actually great for the little guy traders like us – trading has become cheaper. In 1992, it would have been $100 to trade 1000 shares. Now it will cost around 10 bucks.\n\nOn May 6, 2010 at 2:42 in the afternoon, the flash crash occurred. At 2:25 p.m., an emergency \"circuit breaker\" stopped the market after it fell 1000 points. In two and a half minutes, several hundred billion dollars vanished. When the market came back on five seconds later, the markets bounced right back up. Two and a half minutes later, the market was 600 points higher. Still, 2.5 years later, we still don't know exactly what happened. The official U.S. regulators investigated and said it was the result of one trader in New York's overly aggressive algorithm going haywire. This claim is still disputed among experts. The scary part is that hundreds of billions of dollars can be lost in the blink of an eye, and years later, we still don't know exactly what happened. Within the last decade, we've entered an era where complexity, speed and volume is no longer human readable – we don't know until it's too late.\n\nWatch this video to learn a great forecasting technique. It will help you determine whether the day will be trending (heading in one direction for the most part) or whipsaw (full of choppy, difficult to trade, back and forth activity).\n\nThe E-mini S&P 500 (ES) experienced a trending day on February 27, 2013. At 1:17 in the video, you can see how price slowly climbed throughout the day. If you can know in advance whether the day will trend or not, your trading can greatly improve. The technique in this video works for many market opens, but the 9:30 a.m. US/Eastern market open is used. John Paul demonstrates how to split the trading day into three separate sections (A, B and C) at distinct times. Each section has its own characteristics as discussed at 3:40. The method – what to do with the A, B and C sections, is explained at around 5:20. In short, section A can tell you with reasonable certainty whether or not the day will trend. Using the ATR, you can position your profit target and stop loss. You will need to wait for price to prove where it wants to go – either two consecutive closes above or below the previous range. At 9:28 in the video, see what the Atlas Line produced for orders.

The Get Started Day Trading Guide is entirely free. In just a few pages, you'll be up and running with the NinjaTrader 7 platform, see live candles plot on your chart, and understand the basics of trading. We highly recommend that you read this, as it covers the most common questions about day trading that we're asked at Day Trade To Win.\n\nHere's what's included:\n• NinjaTrader download link and demo license key\n• How to set up a paper trading account with NinjaTrader\n• Requirements for day trading (computer speed, broker account size, fees, etc.)\n• Setting up your charts the way we recommend\n• Navigating charts, scrolling through history and the axis\n• Understanding price bars and tick increments\n• Saving your trading setup\n• The best way to begin trading for profitWant to know if the major U.S. indices will be higher at the end of this year than they are now? With the January Effect, you can figure out the overall trend of U.S. indices with decent accuracy. Watch the video to learn how to take advantage of the expected upward movement. The January Effect has been used by traders for many years to accurately determine long term strategies and optimum buy and sell points. All you need to do is look at the first month of the year, January, and see how price behaved. If price was up at the end of the January compared to the start, the same will hold true for the year.\n\nYou can see our 2012 January Effect post to see how this proved correct. The January 2012 E-mini opened at around 1310 and closed nearly 100 points higher at 1434.\n\nNow that January 2013 is over, we have an idea of where price will be at the end of December, 2013.\n\nAgain, another up year! What can you do with this information? Consider buying the market when price is at its lowest point with an expectation of an upward move later in the year. Watch out for pullbacks! John Paul will recommend an opportune buying time soon – keep checking back. Note that the January Effect is not a guarantee, but has historically been very accurate.\n\nJim Cramer, made popular through his CNBC show Mad Money, discusses manipulation in this video. With as little as $5 million from his hedge fund, Jim confesses that he was able to influence futures markets in order to make profit more easily. By creating a level of activity with the proper funding, you can drive futures in a favorable direction. Regarding manipulation tactics, Jim says, \"It's a fun game. It's a lucrative game. You can move it up and then fade it. That often creates a very negative feel.\" When you boost a market up and then the real market comes in, a negative view is created. For anyone in a hedge fund, Jim believes this is a strategy very worth doing. \"It's legal, fast and satisfying,\" he says. \"No one else in the world would ever admit that.\" As you're probably well aware, the U.S. experiences a major economic crash in 2008. This video of Jim was recorded in 2008. Government oversight has since increased to prevent some forms of manipulation.\n\nAt about 3:40 in the video, Jim gives an example of how a hedge trader can spread rumors in order to paint the picture they want of a specific stock. In the example, he shorts Apple (AAPL) and wants to keep the stock down by creating an image that the latest Apple idea is not ready for prime time. Through bluffing and his contacts at the trading desk and phone service providers, Jim believes he can keep the stock down. He says that this is all what's really going on under the market that you don't see. \"What's important when you're in that hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful. The truth is so against your view that it's important to create a new truth to develop a fiction.\" Watch the rest of the video to gain more insight into the extent of manipulation.\n\nWith John Paul's experience as a floor trader and knowing the techniques manipulators use first-hand, you can learn to trade consistently. Our price action methods are only based on current price conditions; not projections, not news stories, not trends or market behavior of the last year, months or days. By learning to recognize specific patterns in the market as they occur, you can become a successful price action trader. Take part in the Mentorship training where you can learn more in depth on how to trade through the manipulation.\n\nBabak took part in our Mentorship Program in August, 2012. Before he was an income trader, Babak was a teacher and network engineer for over 20 years. An unsteady career led him to create his own business as a professional trader. As a professional trader, he first began buying and selling stocks. For three years, he day traded stocks but found the results to be inconsistent; nothing he could count on as an income. Through research, he realized trading futures was more cost effective than trading stocks. On other day trading websites, he participated in classes and seminars that focused on watching indicators and broad market conditions as a gauging factor on his trades. However, these strategies did not provide him with enough confidence. He found his timing to enter and exit to be way off due to following lagging indicators.\n\nBy finding Day Trade to Win's price action methods, Babak became successful. He was able to pinpoint entry and exit strategies and stay on the \"green side\" for a change. He realized indicators are always lagging to interpret the current condition of the market.\n\n\"The funny thing is John's method is so simple to follow. Having live webinar sessions recorded make it so easy to go back and reinforce the lessons. I can still access the recorded sessions that I attended and review them as many times as I need. They're still there. After eight weeks of Mentorship Training and practicing with paper money, I became consistent with the number of my winning trades as opposed to the losing trades. I know every morning how to set up my charts, what to look for, and most importantly, how to keep emotion out of every trade I make. To me, that is a blessing and the empowerment I got from John Paul and Day Trade to Win.\"\n\nOn January 23, 2013 trading the E-mini S&P 500, the Atlas Line produced a successful Long trade at 1488. This first trade was good for one point according to the market's ATR (Average True Range). Profit targets are always based on the ATR. This type of dynamic stop reduces risk and makes your profit target match was the market is expected to be able to produce. John Paul has his \"BarsBack\" Atlas Line parameter set quite high, so you see the entry signals a few bars to the left of the entry candle / signal. You can see how this setting applies with the Short trade at 1486.50. This video shows the trade occurring live, with a profit target of 1.25 points. The best time to trade the Atlas Line is the morning (US/Eastern), but you can trade it on nearly and market that trades 24 hours a day with reasonable volatility. Trading is simple and objective when you have your profit targets and stops known in advance.\n\n1. Have an entry and exit plan Knowing when to get in, when to get out, and what to do if the trade fails is extremely important. In other words, have an entry strategy, profit target and stop loss.\n\n2. Avoid the first 15 minutes when a market opens This period of time is usually highly volatile – automated systems, premarket trades and unfounded trades produce choppy price action. You are better off waiting until it levels out and using the ATO (At the Open) Strategy taught in the Mentorship Program.\n\n3. Understand market orders vs. limit orders Market orders tell your broker to buy or sell at the best available price. Limit orders let you control the maximum and minimum prices at which you will buy and sell. Limit orders are better because you have more control and can be used more easily with strategies.\n\n4. Avoid margin risk The whole point of trading using a margin is to increase the amount of potential returns on each trade. Leveraging more money puts you at risk so keep your margins in check. Trade with a 4:1 intraday margin, if possible.\n\n5. Don't guess or follow instincts Always have a strategy. You need to know objectively what conditions will trigger your entry. And these conditions have to be consistently successful.\n\n6. Keep a log of your trading activity Your trading software can keep track of your profit and loss performance. You should keep track of your personal development as a trader – improve upon your mistakes. The paper remembers better than the mind.\n\n7. Paper / sim trade first Practice makes perfect. Paper trading with a live data feed will simulate the experience of live trading as closely as possible without spending real money. Paper trade for as long as you need to before going live.\n\n8. Be wary of where your trading advice comes from The markets are inherently unpredictable for the most part. In the business of trading, there are many who are a little too confident. Do your research before putting anyone's advice to the test.\n\n9. Control your losses When trading with real funds, only trade with money you can afford to lose. If trading ever gets you into financial trouble, take a break and refine your strategy by paper trading with live data.\n\n10. Allow yourself enough time to learn A baby needs to crawl before being able to walk. Don't panic at the first hint of loss and throw your strategies out the window. Trading is emotional. Know that you will have losing trades. Being consistent requires discipline with the right, objective trading methods. See our courses to find out more"

      "text": "Forex\n\nHow do you select your choice form a list of regulated Forex brokers? Here are four tips. Forex stands for foreign exchange market, and is the trading of currencies worldwide. It has become increasingly popular over the past several years because it is such a large market – the currency market is actually the largest in the world by volume, with over $1 trillion traded every day.\n\nMany individuals also like investing in the Forex market because it involves leverage. Typically, brokerages trade with 100:1 leverage, but it can be higher. That means with as little as a $100 investment, you can have a $10,000 currency position.A trader without a trading plan is the same as a driver not knowing where he is going. If you do not know where you are going, how do you expect to get to your destination?\n\nHaving a trading plan is as important as London Taxi driver having the \"A-Z!!!!\" (a road atlas in the UK). It is a very important part of the puzzle to get you on, and keep you on the road to becoming a consistently profitable trader.\n\nUp until recently we all were led to believe that only 5% of people make it in the Forex trading world. Since the new laws by the CFTC, brokers have had to come clean about the percentage of their clients that wins.\n\nMost have a winning percentage of around 25% to 30% with some up to 50%. So the \"only 5% make it\" is a myth! Now I am not 100% convinced on the figures they released but they are better than previously thought. This led me to question why still 70%+ fail at this business.\n\nTraders who speculate in financial markets generally employ one of two types of market analysis. The first is fundamental analysis. Fundamental analysis is the analysis of economic and financial conditions that directly affect the price of a financial product (stock, commodity, or currency). Then, traders take positions in the market based on this analysis.\n\nThe Current Account deficit for the US is at this moment $123 billion per quarter and 3.3% of GDP. This is less than the 6% in 2006 but still at a level that most economists consider to be unsustainable in the long term. The decline is probably caused by the economic situation and could be temporary. So, what does this mean and what is ahead for the US?\n\nIn this article we focus on what the consequences could be for the US given its large Current Account deficit and the factors that are driving this deficit.\n\nThe question on why the Japanese Yen is now so strong against the U.S. Dollar is asked repeatedly the last few weeks, months and years.\n\nThe Yen reached recently a 15-year high against the Dollar. Was this in line with expectations? What is happening and what is causing this? Here are the analysis and conclusions on why the Yen is so strongThis chart for the EUR/USD exchange rate and trend shows a 20 year history. Since the Euro exists only for about 10 years we had to make some calculations. You will see later below. 20 years provides a unique historic perspective.\n\nTrends in currency exchange rates are important for investors who invest outside their home currency zone. A foreign stock market index could move up but the currency for that market could devalue compared to your home currency. In that case, your gains measured in your home currency would reduce or could even turn negative.\n\nThere is a recent trend that non-professional investors step into the currency trading. The major shifts that the US dollar has made versus the Euro during the last year are probably the reasons for this. Why should you be very, very careful before starting to trade in currencies and what can be the impact of currency fluctuations on investors in stocks and funds.\n\nThe exchange rate between currencies is developing 24 hours per day. This exchange rate is the price you need to pay in one currency for another. For example, at the time of writing, one needs to pay 1.37 US dollar for every 1 Euro.\n\nSelect a Blog Topic\n\nWhat Our Members Say..."

This database will contain calendar events for several currency pairs as well as the actual, the forecast and the previous value for each event.\n\nThis indicator requires this data in order to calculate the percentage of better than expected events for a given country (for each trading day (bar period)). That is, the number of events where the actual value is higher than the expected value divided by the total number of economic events during the bar period.\n\nThe Forex trading indicator name is \"PerBetterExpectedEvents\".\nFor example on April 2, 2010, there were five economic events related to the United States.\n\nAverage Hourly Earnings (Month over Month): The actual value is -0.1 and the forecast value is 0.2.\nNonfarm Payrolls: The actual value is 230 and the forecast value is 187.\nAverage Hourly Earnings (Year over Year): The actual value is 1.8. There is no forecast value.\nUnemployment Rate: In line with expectations (9.7).\nAverage weekly Hours: The actual value is 34. There is no forecast value.\n\nAmong these five economic releases, the only one that has a higher than expected value is the \"Nonfarm Payrolls\". The \"Average weekly Hours\" and \"Average Hourly Earnings (YoY)\" have no forecast values.\nTherefore, the value that is returned by the PerBetterExpectedEvents(\"United States\") Forex indicator is equal to 20%.\n\nHere is how to calculate the moving average of this better than expected economic releases indicator:\nmoving_average = SMA(PerBetterExpectedEvents(\"United States\"), 10);\n\nAnd here is how to create a trading rule that compares the economic releases of a Forex pair:\nFor the GBPUSD currency pair (U.S. Dollar / British Pound)\nforex_diff = PerBetterExpectedEvents(\"United Kingdom\") > PerBetterExpectedEvents(\"United States\");\n\nThe variable \"forex_diff\" of this trading rule returns one when the percentage of better than expected economic releases in United Kingdom is higher than the one of the United States."

Notice how the price is propped up by this support.\n\nSlide 19\n\nThis type of trendline helps traders to anticipate the point at which a stock's price will begin moving upwards again.\n\nSlide 20\n\nSimilarly, a downward trendline is drawn at the highs of the downward trend\n\nSlide 21\n\nThis line represents the resistance level that a stock faces every time the price moves from a low to a high.\n\nSlide 22\n\nThe Importance of Trend\n\nSlide 23\n\nIt is important to be able to understand and identify trends so that you can trade with rather than against them.\n\nSlide 24\n\nTwo important sayings in technical analysis are \"the trend is your friend\" and \"don't buck the trend,\" illustrating how important trend analysis is for technical traders.\n\nSlide 25\n\nTechnical Analysis:\nSupport And Resistance\n\nSlide 26\n\nOnce you understand the concept of a trend, the next major concept is that of support and resistance.\n\nSlide 27\n\nYou'll often hear technical analysts talk about the ongoing battle between the bulls and the bears, or the struggle between buyers (demand) and sellers (supply).\n\nSlide 28\n\nThis is revealed by the prices a security seldom moves above (resistance) or below (support).\n\nSlide 29\n\nThe Importance of\nSupport and Resistance\n\nSlide 30\n\nSupport and resistance analysis is an important part of trends because it can be used to make trading decisions and identify when a trend is reversing.\n\nSlide 31\n\nFor example, if a trader identifies an important level of resistance that has been tested several times but never broken, he or she may decide to take profits as the security moves toward this point because it is unlikely that it will move past this level.\n\nSlide 32\n\nBeing aware of these important support and resistance points should affect the way that you trade a stock.\n\nSlide 33\n\nTraders should avoid placing orders at these major points, as the area around them is usually marked by a lot of volatility.\n\nSlide 34\n\nIf you feel confident about making a trade near a support or resistance level, it is important that you follow this simple rule: do not place orders directly at the support or resistance level.\n\nSlide 35\n\nThis is because in many cases, the price never actually reaches the whole number, but flirts with it instead. So if you're bullish on a stock that is moving toward an important support level, do not place the trade at the support level.\n\nSlide 36\n\nInstead, place it above the support level, but within a few points. On the other hand, if you are placing stops or short selling, set up your trade price at or below the level of support.\n\nSlide 37\n\nTechnical Analysis:\nThe Importance Of Volume\n\nSlide 38\n\nWhat is Volume?\n\nSlide 39\n\nVolume is simply the number of shares or contracts that trade over a given period of time, usually a day.\n\nSlide 40\n\nThe higher the volume, the more active the security.\nTo determine the movement of the volume (up or down), chartists look at the volume bars that can usually be found at the bottom of any chart.\n\nSlide 41\n\nVolume bars illustrate how many shares have traded per period and show trends in the same way that prices do.\n\nSlide 42\n\nVolume and Chart Patterns\nThe other use of volume is to confirm chart patterns.\n\nSlide 43\n\nPatterns such as head and shoulders, triangles, flags and other price patterns can be confirmed with volume, a process which we'll describe in more detail later in this tutorial. In most chart patterns, there are several pivotal points that are vital to what the chart is able to convey to chartists.\n\nSlide 44\n\nBasically, if the volume is not there to confirm the pivotal moments of a chart pattern, the quality of the signal formed by the pattern is weakened.\n\nSlide 45\n\nVolume Precedes Price\nAnother important idea in technical analysis is that price is preceded by volume.\n\nSlide 46\n\nVolume is closely monitored by technicians and chartists to form ideas on upcoming trend reversals.\nIf volume is starting to decrease in an uptrend, it is usually a sign that the upward run is about to end.\n\nSummary: Technical analysis is a method of evaluating securities by analyzing the statistics generated by market activity, such as past prices and volume. Technical analysts do not attempt to measure a security's intrinsic value, but instead use charts and other tools to identify patterns that can suggest future activity"

This back and forth price movement between extremes generates a trading range. Trading ranges are formed when neither bulls nor bears are in control. There is no way to know that a stock will enter a trading range until it has already begun.\n\nFor the Nifty, a trading range developed after the Low on feb 11 was made around 5175. The range was broadly between 5400 and 5600. This range seems to have broken down on Friday when the Nifty closed below 5400, for the first time since feb 28. A move out of the trading range (up or down) is the point of maximum risk. Traders take a position on the breakout/breakdown. In case of a false move out of the range, there is no escape from a loss. That is the cost of trading.\n\nWhat are the signs that the breakdown may work out? (a) The Nifty was making a series of lower highs. (b) On the daily charts, the RSI remained below 50, suggesting that the recent up move did not have enough momentum.(c) The Primary trend is down, therefore, moves in the direction of the primary are more likely to succeed.\n\nFor short term traders, the mid point of the range should act as a stop loss. For Position traders, a close above 5600 will be the point of exit from short positions. For day traders, take one ay at a time.\n\nWednesday, March 9, 2011\n\nNirav asks: \"As you have said that Moving Avg. is a laggin indicator as it uses past price data. So does it mean that all the indicators are ladding indicator as they use past prices? And if they are lagging indicator than which are leading indicators or what can be used as a leading indicator or to forecast the trend? Are price patterns or candelstick formation are the leading indicators? \"\n\nMy Notes:\nTechnical indicators are derivatives of price action. This is good and bad, both. It is good because the indicator will more or less reflect what price does. It will not go its own way. It is bad because, they are likely to lag price action. This means that while indicators tend to be correct, they also tend to be late.\n\nIndicators can be divided in two parts. Trend indicators like moving averages, MACD, identify the direction of the market, the trend. These are almost always lagging, meaning that the trend has already started when the indicator gives a signal. When there is a long trend, this does not matter much, since the indicator will capture a good part of it, inspite of being late. But, when the trend is short, the indicator gets in late and gets out late causing whipsaws.\n\nMomentum indicators like, ROC, stochastics, RSI are leading indicators. Rather than measure price directly, momentum indicators measure the ratio between buying and selling strength. They alert traders on overbought/oversold, divergences and crossing of middle lines, all of which are leading signals. The alert is given before the actual event. As most traders know, many of these signals do not work out, while those that do let you sell at the very top and buy at the very bottom.\n\nCandlesticks are also leading indicators.\n\nIt is the task of the trader to understand the nuances of trend, momentum and candlesticks patterns in different trading environments.

The downtrend should normally end at (1) previous support, which comes at 120, OR, (2) Some fibonacci retracement.\n\nSaturday, March 5, 2011\n\nMoving averages are one of the most popular and easy to use tools available to the technical analyst. They smooth a data series and make it easier to spot trends, something that is especially helpful in volatile markets. They also form the building blocks for many other technical indicators and overlays.\nMoving averages smooth out a data series and make it easier to identify the direction of the trend. Because past price data is used to form moving averages, they are considered lagging, or trend following, indicators. Moving averages will not predict a change in trend, but rather follow behind the current trend. Therefore, they are best suited for trend identification and trend following purposes, not for prediction.\nDon't expect to get out at the top and in at the bottom using moving averages. As with most tools of technical analysis, moving averages should not be used on their own, but in conjunction with other tools that complement them. Using moving averages to confirm other indicators and analysis can greatly enhance technical analysis.\n\nPrimary Trend\nOn a daily chart, apply a simple moving average with 200 days as the period. The 200 day MA gives a rough idea of the primary trend. A bull market exists when the closing price is above the 200 day average. A bear market exists when the closing price is below the 200 day average.\n\nIntermediate Trend\nOn a daily chart, apply a simple moving average with 50 days as the period. The 50 day MA gives a rough idea of the intermediate trend. The intermediate trend is up when the closing price is above the 50 day average. The intermediate trend is down when the closing price is below the 50 day average.\n\nFriday, March 4, 2011\n\n1. Good consolidation before the breakout Good consolidation can come as a tight trading range with well-defined support and resistance,a good consolidation near its high and a bullish pattern is a situation where buying the initial breakout often makes sense. 2. High relative volume at the breakout When a stock breaks out above the consolidation high the supply and demand picture often becomes clear. If the breakout occurs with an increase in volume it is confirmation that the demand for the stock was not satisfied during the consolidation phase and bulls are willing not only to pay higher prices but also to buy an increasing amount of stock at higher prices. 3. A clean breakout followed by bullish price action A clean breakout followed by bullish price action provides two forms of confirmation that the breakout will stay above the high. First, the quick and pronounced nature of the breakout demonstrates that the high was a significant price point, and second, the stock's ability to continue trading above the breakout point shows that the bulls have the upper hand. 4. A bullish big picture Here are two simple conditions to consider in order to increase your success in buying breakouts with follow-through.\n1. The daily trend should be positive.\n2. The stock is trading above the prior day's high.\n\nThursday, March 3, 2011\n\nStocks will often pull back or retrace a percentage of the previous move before reversing. These Fibonacci retracements often occur at five levels: 23%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8% and 78%. After a stock makes a move to the upside , it can then retrace a part of that move down , before moving on again in the desired up direction . These retracements or pullbacks are what you as a swing trader want to watch for when initiating long or short positions.\n\nOnce the stock begins to pull back (retrace), then you can plot these retracement levels on a chart to look for signs of a reversal. You do not automatically buy the stock just because it is at a common retracement level! Wait, and look for candlestick patterns to develop at the 38.2% area. If you do not see any signs of a reversal, then it may go down to the 50% area and so on. Look for a reversal there. You do not know if or when the stock will reverse at a Fibonacci level! You just mark these areas on a chart and wait for signal to go long or short.\n\nWednesday, March 2, 2011\n\nTo check out that how your support and resistance levels are significant or strong, below are the some factors you always keep in mind:\n\n1. Time. The more time a stock trades at a price level the more significant that level becomes. This may not occur in the form of multiple clearly defined swings, but rather in a consolidation period where many of the lows of the consolidation area are at the same price level forming support. 2. Number of occurrences. This is another way of looking at how much time a stock has traded at a particular level. If a stock has created multiple swing lows at the same price level over time, then that price level will be significant support in the future. 3. Volume. The higher the relative volume is at a particular price level, the more likely it is that the price level will become significant support or resistance. This should make sense. If support, for example, is a function of the number of buyers willing to purchase the stock at a certain price, then a price level which has attracted high volume in the past is more likely to act as support than the price level that has not attracted volume in the past. 4. How recently it was formed. Support and resistance are created by the fact that there is real demand (creating support) or a big supply of stock (creating resistance) at certain price levels. Support and resistance levels that have been created recently are likely to be more significant than those that were formed weeks or months ago. It is for this reason that the day trader should always know the prior day's high and low. These points represent the most recent support and resistance on the daily chart."

      "text": "An Intro to Moving Averages: Popular Technical Indicators\n\nOver the last few articles, we have covered many of the basics of technical analysis, mainly chart types and pattern recognition. Having laid the foundation, it is time to move on to a more involved discussion and delve into the core of technical analysis—indicators—and how they are used in the analysis process and in the development of systematic trading strategies. To get things started, we will begin with one of the more basic, yet quite popular, indicators—moving averages.\n\nAbout the author\n\nMoving averages\n\nMoving averages are among the oldest and most widely used technical analysis tools. Due to the relative ease with which they are calculated, moving averages are the preferred tools of newcomers to technical analysis. They have also found favor among some fundamental analysts who make decisions on fundamental factors such as earnings and sales but use moving averages to time buy and sell decisions. With the wide availability of computers and their increased use in financial analysis, you can now create moving averages covering several decades worth of data in a matter of seconds.\n\nA moving average is defined as the average price of a security over a set time period. In essence, moving averages are \"bending trendlines.\" Remember that a trendline is typically drawn between two or more peaks highs or troughs lows in the price movement of a security. Over time, both trendlines and moving averages can be used to establish points of resistance or support for the price. However, moving averages overcome some of the criticisms of trendlines—mainly that they are subjective in their construction. While moving averages can be customized to meet individual needs, they are still based on cold, hard mathematical calculations. In addition, whereas straight-line trendlines are static in nature, moving averages portray dynamic levels of support or resistance as prices move.\n\nMoving averages, by their very nature, smooth data. In other words, they tend to eliminate—or at least lesson the impact of—\"blips\" or outliers in price data. Moving averages show trends in price, but their nature is to represent the trend in a smoothed fashion.\n\nWe've been helping investors for over 30 years.

As such, it does not have technical indicators such as moving averages. Furthermore, the program only has monthly pricing, so moving averages would not be as dynamic as they would be with daily or weekly prices. Wayne A.

Payne had an interesting article in the October 1989 \"Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities.\" The moving average calculation he advocated in that article is one in which the most recent and last data points are weighted once, the next two data points (next to most recent and next to last) are double weighted, and so on until you reach the mid-point of the data points. All of these weighted data point values are then, of course, summed together and then divided by the sum of the weightings themselves. The results seemed to provide cleaner trend lines at virtually all moving average lengths -- with greater clarity being achieved at longer lengths. Have you or any of the members played with this?

      "text": "How to Build a Trading Strategy – Part 2 MrMatt has co-authored several quantified strategy guidebooks including ETF Trading with Bollinger Bands, Options Trading with ConnorsRSI, Trading Leveraged ETFs with ConnorsRSI, and ETF Scale-In Trading.\n\nMr\nCentral Thesis\n\nAt a high level, there are a handful of major strategic themes for traders of stocks and ETFs, including but not limited to:\n\nTrend Following: assumes that once a security begins moving in one direction, the overall movement will continue in that direction for some time. The goal is to enter the trade near the start of the trend, and exit soon after the end of it.\n\nMomentum Trading: similar to trend following, in that the trader is trying to take advantage of the current direction of the price movement. However, momentum trading strategies emphasize the size and strength of the move in addition to the direction.\n\nMean Reversion: assumes that when a security makes a strong, short-term move in one direction that it is likely to reverse direction (revert to the mean) in the near future.\n\nEvent Trading: predicts larger-than-usual price moves based on events such as company earnings announcements, government reports on spending and employment, Federal Reserve actions, etc.\n\nFor illustrative purposes, let's assume that you want to build a mean reversion strategy. Long mean reversion strategies usually try to identify a pullback: a sharp drop in price that is likely to be followed by a price increase. Conversely, short mean reversion strategies try to identify a surge: a sudden rise in price that is likely to be followed by a price decrease. Our research has shown that various mean reversion strategies have performed quite consistently over most periods during the past 12-15 years.\n\nClick here to register for a sneak-preview of The Swing Trading College in a special, live presentation with Larry Connors. Take advantage of this opportunity to learn a professional, systematic approach to swing trading.\n\nIn and of itself, \"mean reversion\" is not specific enough to qualify as a central thesis. What we're looking for is a quantifiable idea that we can test for accuracy. Since mean reversion is strongly linked to the concepts of pullbacks and surges, our central thesis should probably focus on the identification of those states.\n\nThere are many ways to identify pullbacks. A few of the more popular ones include:\n\nA momentum oscillator such as Wilder's RSI or ConnorsRSI falls below a threshold value\n\nThe price closes near the lower Bollinger Band®\n\nThe price of the security closes X% lower than the previous day's low price or closing price\n\nThe price of the security closes lower than the previous day for Y days in a row\n\nThe price of the security falls below a short-term moving average, but stays above a longer-term moving average\n\nThe price of the security gaps down, i.e. it opens at a price lower than the previous day's lowest price\n\nIn many cases, we can identify a surge just by reversing the general pullback rule:\n\nA momentum oscillator such as Wilder's RSI or ConnorsRSI rises above a threshold value\n\n• The price closes near the upper Bollinger Band®\n\nThe price of the security closes X% higher than the previous day's high price or closing price\n\nThe price of the security closes higher than the previous day for Y days in a row\n\nThe price of the security rises above a short-term moving average, but stays below a longer-term moving average\n\nThe price of the security gaps up, i.e. it opens at a price higher than the previous day's highest price\n\nIt should be noted that although you can often use the same indicator for long and short strategies, the inverse of the best indicator value for a long strategy may not be the best value for a short strategy. For example, you may find that RSI(2) < 10 is the best long entry criteria, but that RSI(2) > 90 is not the best short entry criteria.\n\nLet's say that you believe that when a stock gaps up or down on the open, there's a higher than average likelihood that the stock will reverse direction and \"fill the gap\". Thus, stocks that gap down make good long trade candidates, and stocks that gap up make good short trade candidates. That's a good subjective description of a central thesis, but it still needs to be quantified.\n\nTo quantify the central thesis, we just need to express it in terms that can be objectively tested. For the remainder of this series, we will use the following central thesis for long and short trades:\n\nCentral Thesis\n\nLong Trades: Buy a stock that opens X% lower than the previous day's lowest price.\n\nShort Trades: Short a stock that opens X% higher than the previous day's highest price.\n\nNote that we have not yet defined X, the size of the gap as a percentage. When we start testing, we can look at a broad range of values for X, and then refine that range based on our results. Before we can do any testing, however, we need to decide on a universe to test against, and we'll discuss that next time in Part 3 should"

      "text": "INTRO TO OPTIONS Options are much like futures, with one important difference: An option gives its owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific item at a specific price (the \"strike price\") over a specific span of time. The owner can choose when to exercise an option, or he or she can choose not to exercise the option at all. The option then expires worthless, and the investor's only loss is what he or she paid for the option. Thus, options have less downside risk than futures.\n\nThere are two types of publicly traded options: calls and puts.\n\nA call option gives you the right (but not the obligation) to buy an underlying contract at a specified price; you would buy calls if you think the underlying contract's price will rise. A call option is in the money if the price of the underlying contract is above the strike price.\n\nA put option gives you the right (but not the obligation) to sell an underlying contract at a specified price; you would buy puts if you think the underlying contract's price will go down. A put option is in the money if the price of the underlying contract underlying the option is below the strike price.\n\nThe term \"right\" refers to one of the primary differences between futures and options. In futures, an obligation is created for both the buyer and seller. The buyer must take, and the seller must make, delivery unless the position is offset prior to delivery. In the case of options, unilateral obligation is placed on the \"writer\" or seller of the options, that is, only the option writer is obligated to perform.\n\nThe buyer of the option may exercise the option, but may also decide to abandon it and let the option expire. In the event the option is exercised, the option writer must deliver the underlying futures position. Once the writer has received notice from the buyer that the option will be exercised, the writer cannot offset his option position.\n\nThe price paid for a call or put option is called the premium, which is established in open, competitive trading at one of the major exchanges trading options.\n\nIn return for assuming the obligation, the writer of the option receives payment of a premium from the buyer. The premium is paid in full, in cash, when the option is purchased. The buyer is paying for the specific rights. The seller agrees to grant those rights and is paid for assuming the risks of offering options. To the writer, the premium is the maximum profit available in a trade.\n\nThe two basic components of premium are intrinsic value and time value, where\n\nPremium = Intrinsic Value + Time Value\n\nThe intrinsic value is the amount an option would be worth if it were to expire immediately. The intrinsic value of a call option declines to zero when the price of the underlying futures contract falls to the strike price or below. For the put option, the intrinsic value will decline to zero when the price of the underlying futures contract rises above the strike prices.\n\nA call option with a strike price less than the market price is said to be \"in-the-money\". A put option is \"in-the-money\" when a strike price is above the market price.\n\nA call option with a strike price above the current market price is said to be \"\"out-of-the-money\". When the strike price of a put option is below the current market price, it is also \"out-of-the-money\".\n\nWhen the strike price of an option, put or call, is exactly at the current market price, it is said to be \"at-the-money\".\n\nThe second component that makes up the option premium is time value. It is based entirely on the future expectations of price movements. In general, the more time until expiration, the greater the time value.\n\nCalls and puts may not be as risky as futures — because you're not obligated to do anything, your greatest loss will be the loss of the cost of the call or put. But options are leveraged on the upside. For example, buying call options requires far less money than the margin requirements of buying the futures contract would.\n\nPerhaps the most salient difference between options and futures is staying power or the ability to withstand adverse market moves. With futures, both the buyer's and the seller's risk is theoretically unlimited, and each party is in jeopardy of the market moving against the position. Options, on the other hand, possess a mechanism of defined risk. The premium paid represents the total amount the buyer has at risk. If he forfeits the premium, he has no further financial obligation. Due to this unique situation, the buyer is not required to provide margin or face the potential of margin calls regardless of where the underlying futures prices moves during the life of the option. No matter how far the trade moves against the position, the buyer can hold the option in anticipation of an eventual turn around in the market that will make his position profitable"

      "text": "The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with the United States and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject. Please improve this article and discuss the issue on the talk page.(January 2013)\n\nA stock symbol or ticker symbol is an tape of a ticker tape machine.\n\nStock symbols are unique identifiers assigned to each security traded on a particular market. For Example, AAPL is for Apple Inc; OODH is for ORION DHC, Inc and HD is for Home Depot, Inc . A stock symbol can consist of letters, numbers or a combination of both and is a way to uniquely identify that stock. The symbols were kept as short as possible to reduce the number of characters that had to be printed on the ticker tape and to make it easy to recognize by traders and investors.\n\nThe allocation of symbols and formatting convention is specific to each stock exchange. In the US for example stock tickers are typically between 1 and 4 letters and represent the company name where possible. For example US based computer company stock Apple Inc. traded on the NASDAQ exchange has the symbol AAPL, while the motor company Ford's stock that is traded on the New York Stock Exchange has the single letter ticker F. In Europe most exchanges use three letter codes, for example Dutch consumer goods company Unilever traded on the Amsterdam Euronext exchange has the symbol UNA. While in Asia numbers are often used as stock tickers to avoid issues for international investors when using non Latin-scripts. For example the bank HSBC's stocks traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange have the ticker symbol 0005. Symbols are sometimes reused, in the US the single letter symbols are particularly sought after as vanity symbols. For example since Mar 2008 Visa Inc. has used the symbol V that had previously been used by Vivendi which had delisted and given up the symbol. [1]\n\nTo fully qualify a stock, both the ticker and the exchange or country of listing needs to be known. On many systems both most be specified to uniquely identify the security. This is often done by appending the location or exchange code to the ticker for example, separated by a colon or dot.\n\nAlthough stock tickers identify a security, they are exchange dependent, generally limited to stocks and can change. These limitation has led to the development of other codes in financial markets to identify securities for settlement purposes. The most prevalent of these is the International Securities Identifying Number (ISIN). An ISIN uniquely identifies a security and its structure is defined in ISO 6166. Securities for which ISINs are issued include bonds, commercial paper, equities and warrants. The ISIN code is a 12-character alpha-numerical code that does not contain information characterizing financial instruments but serves for uniform identification of a security at trading and settlement.\n\nThe ISIN identifies the security, not the exchange (if any) on which it trades; it is therefore not a replacement for the ticker symbol. For instance, Daimler AG stock trades on twenty-two different stock exchanges worldwide, and is priced in five different currencies; it has the same ISIN on each, though not the same ticker symbol. ISIN cannot specify a particular trade in this case, and another identifier, typically the three-letter exchange code, will have to be specified in addition to the ISIN.\n\nIn the United States, modern letter-only ticker symbols were developed by Standard & Poor's (S&P) to bring a national standard to investing. Previously, a single company could have many different ticker symbols as they varied between the dozens of individual stock markets. The term ticker refers to the noise made by the ticker tape machines once widely used by stock exchanges.\n\nThe S&P system was later standardized by the securities industry and modified as years passed. Stock symbols for preferred stock have not been standardized.[3]\n\nWhile most symbols come from the company's name, sometimes it happens the other way around. Tricon Global, owner of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, adopted the symbol \"YUM\" to represent its corporate mission when the company was spun out of PepsiCo in 1997. In 2002, the company changed its name to match its symbol, adopting the name Yum! Brands.[4] After Hewlett-Packard merged with Compaq, the new firm took on the ticker symbol \"HPQ\". (The former symbols were HWP and CPQ.) AT&T's ticker symbol is simply \"T\"; accordingly, the company is referred to simply as \"Telephone\" on Wall Street (the T symbol is so well known that when the company was purchased by SBC, it took the AT&T name, capitalizing on its history and keeping the desired single letter symbol).\n\nFormerly, a glance at a U.S. stock symbol and its appended codes would allow an investor to determine where a stock trades; however in July 2007, the SEC approved a rule change allowing companies moving from the New York Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq to retain their three letter symbols; DirecTV was one of the first companies to make this move. When first implemented, the rule change did not apply to companies with one or two letter symbols,[5] but subsequently any stock was able to move from the NYSE to the Nasdaq without changing its symbol. CA, Inc., which trades under the symbol CA, moved from the NYSE to the Nasdaq in April 2008 and kept its two-letter symbol.[6]\n\nNYSE \"behind the dot\" or Nasdaq fifth-letter codes and other special codes\n\nIn countries where Arabic script is used, and in East Asia, transliterated Latin-script versions of company names may be confusing to an unpracticed Western reader; stock symbols provide a simple means of clear communication in the workplace. Many Asian countries use numerical or alphanumerical ticker symbols instead of characters to facilitate international trade.\n\nThe decision to change the ticker symbol was as a result of the change of the name of the company from \"Preferred Voice, Inc.\" to \"Aly Energy Services, Inc.,\" which occurred when Preferred Voice acquired Aly Energy Services Inc., now Aly Operating, Inc ...\n\n\"This change will better align the Bank First brand and name with the ticker symbol.

      "text": "This question is the subject of many debates but it really shouldn't be so disputed. The answer is yes, charts absolutely work and do exactly what they're supposed to do, but the reason so many people argue this fact is because their idea of what they're supposed to do is skewed. Charts don't tell you the future, when to buy, when to sell, etc. What they do is reflect everything that has happened and everything that is known about the security (stock, stock option, future, bond, fund, or any other financial asset) being charted, and it is the job of the trader to take any clues they may see in that chart to make educated guesses, then translate those guesses into trades. If one hundred traders all looked at the same chart and all of them decided to go long (buy) and none of them decided to go short (sell), you may assume that the chart is predicting a move up. Then, if the stock happens to crash, would you say that the chart was wrong? Nope. The traders were wrong, the chart did exactly what it was supposed to do, reflect the action. As soon as your expectations of what charts are supposed to do become realistic, then you can start to take advantage of them. I can't tell you how many times I've heard people say things like \"Charts are meaningless on this stock because it's a news play\" or some other excuse. Then you have chartists who add more confusion to the situation by saying things like \"This stock is moving because of the chart\". Again, a chart is never meaningless because it will always reflect exactly what is happening, and stocks don't move because of charts, but they may give you clues as to when they're going to move.\n\nBeing a successful trader is all about playing the odds, and though a chart will never give you a definitive, guaranteed to work buy or sell signal, when used properly they can help you identify trades where the odds are in your favor. That's all it comes down to, if you can identify the setups where the odds are better than 50% in your favor, over time you will be profitable if you only take those trades. That's also assuming that you practice proper money and risk management, but that's beyond the scope of this article. Here's an example of how I may use a chart to identify a possible trade with limited risk and where the odds are better than 50% in my favor: Say the stock GOOG (Google) has been hit with some heavy selling and the price has been severely beaten down for a few days. Based on the chart, I identify an area of potentially strong support at 350, and the price is starting to fall to that range. In this article I won't get into what to look for to identify support and resistance, but what they represent is areas where in the past have been met with heavy buying or selling, and therefore it's reasonable to assume it may happen again. Eventually the price makes it's way down to the 350 range and now I start to see an increase in volume, as well as the price start to level off, even going up a little. How do I know this? Well the volume is easy to see on the chart and so is the rising price. So here's what I know: GOOG had been declining in value at a rapid pace, there is potential support around 350, the volume has picked up since the price got to the the 350 range, and the price has even slightly rebounded from it's lowest point. Those are all facts and they are all reflected in the chart, now it's my job to take those facts and decide whether or not I see a potential trade, and what that trade should be. Based on all that is reflected in the chart, I decide that the stock is currently oversold, at least temporarily, and that the market is starting to find buyers in this 350 range, so there's a good chance that the sellers are exhausted and therefore GOOG could see a nice bounce soon. Should this bounce materialize, it's not the chart that was right, it was my prediction based on what I saw in the chart. So I end up buying GOOG at 352, but then a new wave of sellers come in and quickly drop the price to 340. My prediction was wrong, the sellers weren't exhausted and the buyers that came in at the 350 support were only enough to slow the free fall temporarily. Again, the chart wasn't wrong, just my prediction. The good news is that charts can also help you limit your risk on a trade too. Since I identified the support range at 350, I knew to bail when I saw the sellers bring the price below it, and I was stopped out at 345, for roughly a 2% loss.\n\nI think so many people are skeptical of charts and the possible benefits they offer because they have unrealistic expectations from them, they aren't willing to put in the time it takes to learn to read them and then properly use them, and they've heard from so many other people that they're useless. I forget where I read this, but I remember an article that supposedly debunked the use of chart technical analysis and it's effectiveness, and it did so by implementing and testing some sort of simplistic method based on moving average crossovers. If you're not familiar with what that is, it's basically one of the most simple buy or sell signals that I know of. Though it can be useful in the right context, without other indicators or confirming criteria, it's a method that is destined for failure. People are often looking for the holy grail when it comes to charts and buy/sell signals. Just like the person who supposedly debunked the effectiveness of charts, they want some sort of simple to follow signal that makes them money every time or nearly every time. If it were that simple, everyone would know about it and everyone would be rich.\n\nSo do charts work? If by 'work' you mean provide you with easy to read buy and sell signals that will instantly make you a great trader, then no they don't work. If by 'work' you mean reflect everything that is known by the market about that security, then yes, they work every single time. Are there people out there that use the clues from charts to develop sound trading strategies and an in depth perspective into how a security trades? Absolutely, and that's a fact.\n\nIn my last article I stated that charts completely reflect everything that is known about a particular security, but what exactly can you learn from them and how can you use it to your advantage? Charts may not be able to predict the future like Ms. Cleo, but certain information they reveal can definitely help you make better educated guesses as to what is going to happen. I think possibly the most important bit of information a chart can very easily tell you is whether the trend is up, down, or flat. There are always multiple trends at work, depending on what time frame you look at. A stock may be in a short term uptrend, meaning it's been going up recently, but if you pull back to a longer term time frame, it may be in a downtrend. If I was looking to invest in a company, I would want that stock to be in a long term uptrend, but the short term trend isn't nearly as important, in fact I may want to be a buyer when the short term trend is down. If I'm looking to make a quick trade, say maybe a couple of days, the longer term trend isn't too much of a concern, just the short term trend (since I'm trying to profit from a short term move) and possibly the mid term trend. Being able to identify what direction the trends are will almost instantly make you a better trader and can even help out your long term investments. Once you become more comfortable with identifying the different trends, you can start to base your trades off of multiple time frames. The longer term time frames hold more weight than the shorter term trends, but doesn't it make sense to combine them so multiple time frames are working with your trade? You can break the different time frames down into three basic categories, short term, mid term, and long term. There is no one way to do this, but here is an example of one stock viewed through three different time frames.\n\nThe first is the short term time frame, and for this one I'll use a daily, three month chart. Every candle here represents one day and the entire chart goes back three months.\n\nHere is the same chart, only now the time frame is a bit longer term, so it goes back a full year. Each candle still only represents one day.\n\nFinally, here is the same chart, but viewed through a longer term time frame. This one not only goes back three years, but each candle now represents a week's worth of trading.\n\nIt's important to understand that time frames are completely relative. For a daytrader who's trades last minutes on average, a long term time frame may be a sixty minute chart (each candle represents an hour) that goes back five days and a short term chart may be a one minute chart that goes back five hours. The examples I gave you above would probably be for a swing trader that held anywhere from overnight to a few months, depending on which of the three time frames they're using. For a long term investor, a short term chart may be the swing trader's long term chart. It's critical that the time frames you trade off of suite your style and time frame for trading. If you're trying to daytrade off of a swing trader's time frame, even the short term, you're going to have major problems.\n\nOther than the different trends at work, charts can tell you other important things. The price action on a chart can give you a lot of insight as to what the market considers a fair value. If you heard that a stock finished the day up 5%, you'd probably assume that it had a good day and overall it was bullish. What if at one point in the day the stock was up 35%, but it only could manage to hold a 5% gain on the day? To me, that shows that the market felt that the price was overvalued when it was up 35%, and the fact that it closed so much lower tells me that the higher prices were essentially rejected. Price tug of wars like this are very obvious when you look at them through a candlestick chart, which I'll be going over more in depth in the future.\n\nIn addition to the different trends at work and the price action, the last thing I want to mention is support and resistance. Support is basically a price range on a chart where historically there have been enough buyers to keep the price above a certain point, and resistance is the opposite, a price range where sellers have prevented the price from moving above a certain point. Once support has been successfully broken, that old support is now new resistance. The same goes for when resistance is broken, it then becomes support. Don't look at support and resistance as specific prices, but as general ranges. If I said there is support at 375 for GOOG, that doesn't mean the second it hits 374.99 that support has been broken. The price could dip well below the support range, but if it quickly recovers and establishes it's self back above it, that is a successful hold for support. Support and resistance, just like most aspects of chart analysis are not exact sciences. I actually would consider chart reading in general more of an art form than a science, though it has it's scientific elements too.\n\nThe point of this article wasn't to go into detail about how to identify support and resistance, the current trends, or how to analyze price action. I just wanted to point out the key things I look for in a chart, and probably the most revealing. If you know what the trends are, how to spot price rejection and acceptance, and where the major support and resistance lies at, you're in a position to make an informed and educated guess about how to execute your trade. This is true from the daytrading scalpers up to the long term buy and holders. Will this guarantee that every trade is a profitable one? Absolutely not, but it not only swings the odds into your favor but it will limit your risk on each trade. This is the difference between someone who is able to consistently make profits and someone who is trading on whims, which to me is essentially gambling, and a professional trader is not a gambler.\n\nThere are a number of different chart types, and the difference between them is how they display the data. All charts plot the data by individual periods, and each period can represent as much or as little time as you want. One chart may have each period set to five minute intervals and another may be set to weekly intervals. The three most popular types of charts that are used are probably the line chart, bar chart, and the candlestick chart. On a line chart, the only thing that is plotted is the closing price of each period. Regardless of what the period is, whatever the last price of that period happens to be, that's what you'll see. Basically you're drawing a dot for each period's closing price, then connecting them to form a line. Here's an example of what one looks like.\n\nA line chart is better than no chart, but the information it reveals is extremely limited. You have no idea what the security opened at, or what the high and low were for that period. A bar chart, other wise known as an OHLC chart (Open, High, Low, Close), gives you that information. On a bar chart, each period is represented by a vertical line with a horizontal line sticking out from each side. The line sticking out on the left side is where the price opened at for that period, the top of the vertical line is the high of that period, the bottom of the vertical line is the low, and the line sticking out of the right side is the closing price for that period. Here's an example of a bar chart.\n\nClearly, the bar chart is much more revealing and helpful to traders, but the problem with them is you really have to zoom in to see each period's action. If you look at a daily chart with a year's worth of bars, you're basically just going to see a bunch of vertical lines, and if you squint hard enough you may be able to notice that there are lines sticking out of the side. It's still not easily recognizable whether each period finished even, positive, or negative. This is where candlestick charts really shine. Technically, they reveal the exact same information as a bar chart (open, high, low, and closing prices), but they do this in a way that is much easier to quickly identify. All candles will fall into one of these three categories; candles that open and close at the same price, candles that close higher than they opened at, and candles that close lower than they opened at. Here is a chart that breaks down a couple of candles, one that represents a negative day (left, red candle) and one that represents a positive day (right, white candle).\n\nThis chart was zoomed in to show only three candles for simplicity, but even on a chart with hundreds of candles, it's still pretty obvious what each one is saying. First off, they're color coded. Without the different colors, you wouldn't be able to tell where it opened or closed at. Most charts will have a red candle to represent down days and either a white or green candle for up days. Some charting platforms will have a different color (usually black) for candles that closed lower than they opened, but still higher than the previous candle, or closed higher than they opened, but still lower than the previous candle. Each candle is made up of two basic parts, the body and the wicks. The body encompasses the opening and closing points and everything in between. If the open and close are identical or close to it, you'll have basically a horizontal line for a body. The wicks represent the trading that took place outside of the range of the open to close. If you see a candle with a very long upper wick, you know that at one point the price was much higher than it finished. If you have a real time charting platform, you can watch as each candle will change depending on the price action.\n\nThanks to the color coding and the contrast between the wicks and the body, it's easy to get a good idea of what took place during that period, even with just a glance. A long white candle means the price went up from the start to finish, a long red candle means the price went down from the start to finish, and any long wicks will inform you that there was a struggle between the buyers and sellers. This isn't to say that each candle will tell you exactly what happened during each period. If you had a long white candle that formed on a daily chart, you may assume that the price had risen all day, when in reality it may have been flat all day up until the last five minutes when it went crazy. So it may not tell you exactly how it played out, but it gives you a very good idea, and to see more detail you can always break the candles down to a shorter time frame. On a daily chart, each candle represents one day. Like I said, you don't know exactly how that candle got to where it's at, but if you break your chart down from a daily chart to an intraday chart (like an hourly chart), then you can see the price action from that day more in depth. So in my example where the stock was flat all day but ended up running in the final minutes, an intraday chart would be able to tell you that.\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg for using candlesticks. Besides telling you the basic info about a trading period, there are much more advanced methods to using them. Candlestick patterns are at minimum an incredible compliment to most trading strategies, and for some traders they are the backbone of their methodologies. I'll identify and break down some of the more popular and commonly seen patterns in a future article, but for now you need to be able to fully absorb the basic information that each candle is telling you. If you don't already use candlestick charts, I highly recommend you start now. If you feel like you're trading in the dark, candlesticks will certainly help add some light for your path.\n\nIf someone says to you that the market is in an uptrend, do you know what they mean by that? Obviously they mean the market is going up, but specifically what are they referring to? It's been going up for a day? A week? A year? Uptrend and downtrend are two terms that are thrown around a lot, but often people don't really have a clear cut definition of what that exactly means. Many people define an uptrend by saying it's where the chart makes higher lows and higher highs. The problem with this is which lows and highs do you look at? Maybe for the past week it's made higher lows and higher highs, but if you go back and look at the last three months the highs have gotten lower. Then go back and look at the last year and it may be different as well.\n\nLook at this chart and tell me if the trend is up, down, or flat.\n\nYou could have said any one of the three and been correct because there are many trends at work here. In the last month or so the highs and lows have gotten lower, so one person might say it's in a downtrend. Another might say it's clearly in an uptrend since the highs and lows have gotten higher since the December low, and they'd be correct as well. Then the longer term trader comes in and points out that ever since the August 08 high, we've failed to even come close to making a higher high, so it's undoubtedly in a downtrend. Since the first and third person both would agree that it's in a downtrend, you'd think they were on the same page, but they're talking about two very different time frames. Finally, you may have someone that says the stock is uptrending because all they are thinking about is the last couple of weeks where price has gone from 400 to 425, not even looking at the highs or lows. Confusing, isn't it? So you've heard the cliche before that the trend is your friend and that you should trade with it, not against it, but how do we do that if we're not even sure how to figure out what the trend is? Unfortunately, there is no official explanation to determine what the trends are, and that's why there's so much ambiguity when people speak of them. The method of looking at the lows and highs is better than nothing, but as I pointed out it can be very subjective.\n\nBefore I show you the method that I use to determine the trends on a chart, I want to give complete credit to the trader who I learned it from. Dr. Barry Burns is a market veteran who has a great set of instructional videos, I'd highly recommend that you at least check out his blog. I have a lot of respect for him as a trader, not only because he has some good methods, but because he preaches about aspects that a lot of teachers seem to ignore, like the psychology of trading, money management, risk management, etc. As far as his trend identifying method, it's extremely simple, but I've found that a lot of traders like to make things more complicated than they need to. What's good for me isn't necessarily going to be good for you, but in my experience taking a simple approach has often been the most effective.\n\nTo start, the one indicator that you'll need for this trend identifying method is the moving average. The moving average is a line that represents the average price of a security for any set amount of time at any specific point. If I said the 50 day moving average for GOOG is currently at 412, that means over the past 50 days the average price has been 412. Since the price is always changing, the moving averages will always move as well, and if the price has been increasing, the moving averages will move up as well. The shorter the moving average time period is, the quicker it will react. A 5 period moving average will quickly react to any price movement, whereas the 200 MA will hardly blink at short term moves. Here is the GOOG chart again, only this time I added the 50 period moving average.\n\nThe basis for this method is simple, use a short term moving average to determine the short term trend, mid term moving average for the mid term trend, and long term moving average for the long term trend. This isn't a science, so there is no right or wrong one to use, but I use what Dr. Burns suggests because they make sense to me. He recommends using the 15 EMA (exponential moving average, puts more weight on the most recent periods so it's quicker to react) for the short term, 50 MA for the mid term, and the 200 MA for the long term trend indicator. I tend to focus on the mid term trend indicator, the 50 MA. I really like using this one because it's not too short or too long of a time period, it's right in between and really it's relevant to both the short and long term trends. The thing to look for is the angle of the line, if the angle is up the trend is up, a flat line is a flat trend, and a descending line is a down trend. It's also good to note where the price is in relation to the line. If the 50 MA is angling down but the price is trading above it, that may be an indication that the mid term trend is trying to turn around. Right at the beginning of 09, the price started to trade above the 50 MA, even though the 50 MA was angling down very sharply. It didn't happen right away, but that was the start of the trend reversing. The longer the trend, the longer it takes to reverse. The run that GOOG went on from the end of January to the beginning of March was impressive, and by the middle of it the 50 MA had started to angle up. From mid February to mid March GOOG corrected and went straight down, and obviously the short term moving average would have been angling down with it (confirming the short term down trend), but the 50 MA was still up. For those who recognized that the mid term trend was up, they may have been buying into that dip, and they would have been able to ride the wave up in what turned out to be a very impressive rally. Now let's look at GOOG with all three moving averages applied to it.\n\nIt should be clear as day that the long term trend (200 MA, red line) has been down for pretty much the entire chart, though now it's started to level off since the price has been trading above it. See how long it takes for that line to react to the price movement? The short term trend has done what we'd expect it to do, pretty much follow the general price movement pretty closely. GOOG wouldn't have gone from 300 to 440 in such a short period of time without the short term trend being up the majority of the way. Ever since the peak in June though, you can see the 15 EMA (green line) has either been flat or down, so that would indicate that the short term trend has at least stalled, if not started to reverse. The mid term trend (blue line) is still up at the moment, though the weakness in the short term trend may be a precursor to the mid term trend turning around. I don't want to do any speculating, just make observations as to what the current trends are.\n\nLike I said, this isn't the official way to determine what the trends are because there isn't one. This is just a simple to use method to quickly sum up a chart and give you a better perspective on the current market conditions. If I'm looking to play a chart setup, I better know if the trend is working with me or against me. If I'm looking to buy into the market's pullback, which many people like to do, I'd really like to know if I'm buying into an uptrend or downtrend, and what time frame those trends are on. Trend identifying alone isn't enough to turn you into a profitable trader, but it's about as solid of a foundation as I can think of to start from.\n\nBefore I tell you how I identify support and resistance, I'll briefly explain what they are. Support is generally thought of as a price range or level where the security (stock, future, etc.) has historically had difficulty falling below, and resistance is the same principle except it's a price range where the security has had trouble getting above. If a security's price is going down and reaches a certain point that brings in enough buyers to make the price bounce, that general range would be an area of support. As long as the price stayed above that point, you can consider that area support, but once a support range is broken, it becomes resistance (and vice versa). It's important to remember a couple of things about support and resistance. One, they're not specific price points, but general ranges. If someone says that support is at $100 and the price hits $99.99, that doesn't mean that support has been broken. Even if the price temporarily breaks well below it but quickly recovers to get back above it, that would still be considered a successful test of support. The second thing to remember is that no matter how strong you think support or resistance may be, they can always be broken. If someone says that support is at $100 and it falls through that range, that doesn't necessarily mean that they were wrong about it being support, it just means that the selling was strong enough to wipe out the buyers at that support range.\n\nThe main types of support and resistance are horizontal price levels and diagonal trendlines, but there are others too, such as moving averages and fibonacci retracement and extension levels. This article is going to focus on how to spot trendlines and horizontal lines. At first, these may be difficult to spot, but after you've looked at so many charts they start to jump out at you. In essence, every high and low on a chart is a horizontal support or resistance level, but if you drew a horizontal line for every one of those your chart would be a mess and it would only hurt your trading. The key is to find the price levels that correspond with multiple pivot highs or lows, the more the better. Here's a 6 month chart of GOOG with one obvious area of support that I see. The red arrows point to where the level acted as resistance and the green arrows point to where it acted as support.\n\nIdentifying support and resistance is not an exact science, it's more of a rough estimation. A helpful tip I've heard is to pretend you're drawing your support and resistance lines with a big crayon, that way you're not pinpointing one specific price line but more of a zone. Notice on that horizontal line I drew that the price doesn't always hit precisely on the line, but it comes close enough. I could've even drawn the line a little higher or made it wider to include a larger range. I'd actually say that the whole 390 – 400 area is the support or resistance zone (depending on if the price is above or below it). One question that comes up a lot is whether the lines should be drawn at the tops/bottoms of the wicks or the actual candle bodies. Again, this isn't a science so the answer could be either one, but the candle bodies hold more weight than the wicks so I like to focus on those. I actually like it when wicks are formed under a support line or over a resistance line because that shows that the market is rejecting the attempt to break through and further confirms the support or resistance. Spotting horizontal support/resistance lines will become second nature to you after you start to look for them in every chart.\n\nDiagonal trendlines are similar to horizontal support/resistance lines in that they connect pivot highs and lows, but they are either ascending or descending to show the direction as well as the speed of the price movement. They generally connect a series of higher lows (uptrend) or lower highs (downtrend). Some may be very obvious on the chart and some may not be as noticeable. I've found that trendlines tend to be more subjective (depending on the trader drawing them) than horizontal support/resistance lines. Here is an example of a trendline on GOOG's chart.\n\nBack from March through May, GOOG was riding this steep trendline for the entire rally. Any time prior to May that the price came back down to that trendline would have been a good time to pick up some shares. A trendline that steep isn't going to be able to sustain itself for too long, and in May it finally ended up breaking below it. That wasn't the end of the party though as the price still pushed it's way considerably higher after that. The trendline still existed though, but at this point it was acting as resistance since the price was below it. In early June the price ran right into that trendline and that marked the top of that particular move.\n\nThere are going to be many trendlines and horizontal support/resistance lines on a chart, your job is to identify the ones that look the most obvious or stand out the most. The more times the line has been tested, the more it confirms it as a critical area of support or resistance. You could also say the more it's been tested the stronger it is, but when you start to see a line get tested multiple times in a short period of time, that's very often a clue it's going to be broken soon. The best way to become proficient at identifying support and resistance lines is to look for them on every chart, draw them where you think you see them, then follow the action to see if the lines you drew get a reaction from the price. If you've correctly identified strong support or resistance, most of the time the price will have some sort of reaction to it, either by completely bouncing or at minimum stalling and consolidating (trading in a tight range). Consolidation right near support or resistance is also often a sign that the price is getting ready to break through, but it needs to rest first. Just like being able to identify trends, spotting support/resistance alone won't make you a successful trader, but it is one of the most important pieces to the puzzle. Once you can properly identify the trends and support/resistance, you then have a solid foundation to build your methods off of. When you start to apply these things to aspects of your everyday life, like \"My love life is in a downtrend\" or \"My bank account just broke it's support\", you'll know you're on the right path.\n\nMy last article went over how to spot support and resistance, but how exactly do you work that into your trades? This article will go over the basic methods of incorporating support and resistance into your trading. The first and most obvious method is to buy at support or short at resistance. For those that aren't familiar with shorting or short selling, it's where you sell shares/contracts that you don't own (your broker lends them to you), then buy them back later (also known as covering), ideally at a lower price than you sold them for. With shorting you are profiting when the security goes down in price.\n\nHere's a chart of GOOG, and I've identified the most obvious support and resistance lines I see.\n\nSo the plan here is simple, if the price comes into the resistance zone, you go short. If the price comes down to support, you go long (buy). What's nice about trading support and resistance is that it generally offers a good reward to risk ratio. If you short at resistance and the price breaks right through it to the upside, you exit the trade for a small or moderate loss. If it bounces off of resistance and comes back down, you should have a nice profit on the trade. The tricky part can be figuring out where exactly your stop loss should be at in relation to support or resistance. You have to give the trade a buffer to move around, you can't set your stops one tick above resistance or one tick below support. The price can penetrate through support/resistance, hit your stop price, then turn right back around and go in the direction you thought it would, leaving you behind to watch. So your stops should be far enough away to account for normal market fluctuations and volatility, but not so far that you're going to eat too large of a loss should it get hit. One other thing you can do is wait to enter the trade until the price has actually pierced support or resistance a little, in anticipation that it's going to bounce back still. Using the above chart as an example, the resistance looks to be a little above 440, we'll say 442. A lot of traders may look to go short at 442 on the nose, then maybe they'll set their stops at 444. Let's say that the market is extra volatile and it busts through the 442 resistance and ends up hitting 445, triggering your stop at 444, but then it comes back down and ends up crashing. Had you waited until the resistance was pierced a little and entered the trade at 444, you wouldn't have been stopped out. Another advantage to this method is that you can keep a tighter stop because you're entering on the far edge of support or resistance. There is a drawback to this though, and that is you'll end up missing out on some trades since they don't all hit the far end of support or resistance. For very conservative traders who don't mind missing out on some trades, it's a good fit.\n\nBuying support and selling resistance is the most obvious way to play them, but it's not the only way. Playing breakouts is a great trading method, and the basic concept of this strategy is waiting until resistance has been broken then going long (buy), or wait until support has been broken and going short. In the previous paragraph I mentioned that a conservative way to buy support or short resistance was to wait for the price to start to pierce through the respective zone, but that's exactly the opposite of what the principle is behind trading a breakout. In a breakout, you want to be a buyer when resistance is broken and a seller when support is broken, so how do you tell when you should be buying support/ shorting resistance or playing them as breakouts? There is no perfect answer to this, a huge part of trading is just making educated guesses and going with it, and if your guess was wrong get out of the trade. Here are some things to look at and consider when making your decisions.\n\nThe first thing I'd look at is the recent price action. How has the price arrived at this support or resistance area? Has it slowly and methodically made it's way into position or did it arrive there by making a sharp, violent move? If a stock is testing resistance right after it's already made a huge run, I would not initially be looking to play it as a breakout because I know that there are a lot of people who are looking to sell after making good profits in such a short amount of time. Another thing to look for is consolidation, which is basically where the price starts to trade in a narrow range for a while. If a stock has moved up to an area of resistance (or moved down to support) and starts to consolidate, that can often be a precursor to a breakout. Think of it as the price is resting and forming a base to take off from. Once the price starts to breakout and trade on the other side of support or resistance, normally you'd like for the volume to start to increase to show that others are seeing and trading the same thing you are. Without volume to confirm the breakout, you may be buying into a bull trap or shorting into a bear trap.\n\nThere is an alternate way to play a break of support or resistance, and this method is not only more conservative but in my experience it has a greater chance of success. The key is to wait for the price to clearly break through the support or resistance, then wait and watch for it to come back and test that area again. Old resistance will be new support and old support will be new resistance. The longer a trendline or horizontal line has been acting as support or resistance, the more likely it is to be tested. When you buy or short the test, it offers you an incredible reward to risk ratio. The drawback here is that the breakout points don't always get tested, so you will miss out on some trades by going this route. Here's an example of a breakout and then a test of support.\n\nLooking at the chart above, you can see that in February the price made a pivot high then came down. That previous peak is going to act as resistance, and when the price bounced straight back up to the range of that peak's price level, the resistance was also further reinforced by the fact that the 200 day moving average was right there as well. I mentioned in a previous article that moving averages can also act as support and resistance. Considering the price went almost straight up from 290 to that resistance zone around 380, my initial thought would be to go short when the price tested it. Had I done that, I would have been stopped out as soon as I saw the price start to blast through resistance, and not only that but the volume had an incredible surge which should tip you off as well. So I get stopped out for a small loss, but now I'm looking to go long if I see an opportunity. As luck would have it, the price does end up coming back down and tests the old resistance for new support. Remember, not only is that horizontal line support, but you also have the 200 MA acting as support as well. This is the perfect time to take a chance and go long, buying anywhere in that general support zone and your stop loss would be somewhere below it.\n\nThe methods I've gone over have all been in terms of entries, but you can easily use them as exit strategies as well. If you are in a long position and looking to sell, you would just use the short selling strategies since shorting is really just selling. If you're in a short position and looking to close it (cover/buy), you would just use the long (buying) strategies since covering a short is essentially just buying. Since I've now gone over the concept behind identifying trends and support/resistance, you can now combine the two for hopefully better odds of success. If the the mid term trend is down on the time frame you're trading and the short term trend is up, it may be a good idea to look for strong resistance to short into. Likewise, if the mid term trend is up but the short term trend is down, you might want to identify some solid support to but into. If I'm looking to play a breakout to the upside, I almost always want the mid term trend to be up. At this point you have more than a solid foundation to work with, you actually have enough to put together a legitimate method. There are still ways to add to and refine your strategy, but this should be the meat and potatoes of it, everything else will just be gravy. Just remember not to overdo it on the gravy, otherwise you'll ruin a perfectly good meal.\n\nThere are a ton of candlestick patterns out there, and some of them have very specific rules and real funny names. While it doesn't hurt to know all of them, I don't think it's necessary (at least not right away), to spend countless hours learning every last one as well as all of the very specific rules that apply to them. There are some basic principles to learn that I think are more important than any specific rule or pattern. Candles help you quickly identify where a security opened and closed at, as well as the high and low for that period. To oversimplify what these candles are essentially telling us is, if the it closes near it's high, that's bullish, near it's low is bearish, and in the middle is a sign of indecisiveness. Without learning one specific candle pattern, I think one of the most revealing things to look for is long wicks. When a candle forms a long upper wick, that means that the price finished well off of it's high point. If the bulls were in command, they would have been able to finish the period closer to the high point, but the fact that it didn't shows that the bears started to gain control late in the period. The opposite is true for candle's with long lower wicks. That shows you that the bears were able to knock the price down initially, but then the bulls came in and started to buy up the lower prices and they successfully closed the period well off of it's low point. Here is a weekly chart with the majority of the long wicks identified.\n\nFirst off, each long wick doesn't have to imply that a major reversal is coming. It may be the precursor for a major reversal, a small reversal, a stall in direction, or it could mean none of the above. On this chart, almost every single long wick came before either some sort of reversal or stall in price. The only real obvious time it failed was in September of 08 when the price formed back to back long lower wicks around 420. The price ended up breaking below that point, but a failed setup can often be a buy or sell signal in itself because as you can see the drop after the price failed to react to the long lower wicks was very sharp. Another thing to keep in mind that many traders overlook is the context of where the candles are being formed. If the price is chopping around in tight channel, a long wicks are just probably indicating a struggle between the bears and bulls and it's hard to take much meaning from it other than that. On the other hand, if the price has made an extended move in one direction and is clearly becoming overbought or oversold, long wicks can have very strong implications that the move is coming to an end. Try and remember that the candle itself means a lot less when the context around it doesn't make it clear what's going on. Also, a long wick doesn't have to mean the end of a move, but at minimum it means the opposing team is starting to put up a fight.\n\nNow I'm going to break down some of the specific patterns to look for. They won't be in any particular order as I don't necessarily have one favorite or any that work that much better than the rest. Like I said, it comes down to the context. The more the context is telling me to look for a reversal, the more I like that particular reversal pattern that is forming, no matter what pattern it happens to be.\n\nThe first pattern I am going to go over is the hammer or hanging man. They look identical, but the key is a hammer is formed after a downtrend and a hanging man is formed after an uptrend. These are formed when the price moves significantly lower than the opening price, but by the end of the period is has gotten back up to the range of the opening price, forming a long lower wick. Technically speaking, a hammer/ hanging man shouldn't have an upper wick to it, but that's being too picky in my opinion. If there is a slight upper wick, it may not be classified as a hammer, but it's still just about as valid. This is where the rules for some of these candle patterns become unnecessarily complicated. The important thing to note is the rejection of the lows for a hammer, and for the hanging man the rejection of the lows isn't the key, the fact that it traded below it's opening price all day is. Here is an example of a hanging man that was formed after an incredibly sharp uptrend.\n\nNext up on the list is the doji. Dojis can have many different appearances, such as long upper or lower wicks, short upper or lower wicks, and any combination of these. The main attributes that make them dojis are: The open and close have to be the same or very close (close enough that the body looks like a horizontal line) and there needs to be some sort of lower or upper wick, or both. Most dojis have both the upper and lower wicks, but a doji that closes at the low of the period (which would mean it also opened there) is a gravestone doji and a dragonfly doji is where it closes at the high of the period. The main thing to take from a doji is the indecision it's conveying. Again, if this is formed in a channel or anywhere without a major move to reverse/ correct, than it's not nearly as helpful as one that forms after an extended move that is overbought or oversold. Here is an example of one that is formed after a nice downtrend.\n\nRegarding the above chart, there are some other things to note. First off, you can see that the price doesn't immediately respond to the reversal candle. The next candle was a down day that even tested the lows of the doji again. You can't expect the price to immediately react all of the time. In this case, the market was still testing out what it wanted to do, and the candle following the doji ended up forming a long lower wick as well. Back to back long wicks are a pattern in themselves, known as tweezers (either tops of bottoms). Basically, the second one is just confirming the first, making it more of a reliable signal. You may even end up getting more than two long wicks, that just shows a major battle but the wicks continue to imply that the price continues to be rejected when it enters that range.\n\nAnother reversal pattern to be aware of is bullish and bearish engulfings. Whether or not it's formed after an uptrend or downtrend determines whether it's bullish or bearish. The characteristics to look for is one large candle that completely engulfs at least the previous day's candle, if not more. The chart I posted above that has the hanging man is actually an example of a bearish engulfing as well (look at the candle after the hanging man), though a truly ideal engulfing pattern completely engulfs the entire previous candle, not just the body of it like in that example. Here is an example of a bullish engulfing that formed after a downtrend. The price may not have instantly reversed after it was formed, but it did end up marking the bottom.\n\nThe last pattern I'm going to cover is a three candle setup that I've found to be reliable as well, but once again the key is that it needs to be formed after an extended move to be truly significant. This pattern is called either an evening star or morning star, depending on where it's formed at. An evening star is formed after an uptrend and is bearish, a morning star forms after a downtrend and is bullish. The characteristics of an evening star pattern is a long white candle that continues the uptrend, followed by a small candle that gaps up but finishes lower (than it opened), then the last candle gaps down and finishes down. Basically the middle candle needs to be isolated from the surrounding two. A morning star is the exact opposite, a long red candle followed by a small candle that forms after a gap down, followed by a candle that gaps up and closes up. Just like the middle candle on an evening star should close down a little, the middle candle on a morning star pattern should close up a little. If the middle candle is a doji, then the pattern is still essentially the same but it's now called an abandoned baby pattern. Depending on whether you consider this middle candle a doji or not, here is an example of either an abandoned baby or an evening star reversal pattern. Whatever you want to call it, the key thing to note is the isolated, indecisive candle that forms in the middle.\n\nAll of the candle patterns I went over today are considered reversal patterns. There are setups that are known as continuation patterns, but I haven't found them to be nearly as useful as reversals. If I'm buying into support on a pullback or selling into resistance during a rally, I'm looking for reversal candles/ patterns. If I'm selling on a break below support or buying on a break above resistance, I'm not looking for reversal patterns (since I'm not looking for a reversal), but I don't really look for specific continuation patterns either. It's basically a matter of making sure there is consolidation in the range of the support or resistance, then waiting for one of the candles to close either below support or above resistance. Since buying can mean covering a short position and selling can mean short selling, that pretty much covers all of the possibilities, and none of those possibilities really require the use of continuation patterns. Others may disagree with me, but the good thing about how I've presented the material in my articles is that by implementing what I've gone over, you won't be painting yourself into a corner so to speak. I believe that the things I've covered are pretty much universal, and they leave open the possibility to add whatever touch of TA you'd like use in addition. If you want to add continuation patterns, that's no problem. If you want to add RSI, MACD, Stochastics, or any other indicator for additional and confirmational buy or sell signals, awesome. Everything I've gone over so far is just the framework for my method of chart analysis. Though it may be just the foundation, it probably is more than three quarters of what I actually use in my trading.\n\nCandles alone are limited in what they can do, but when you use them to time your trades based on the trend and support and resistance, you have a very powerful, yet still simple, method for trading.\n\nNow it's time to combine the basic concepts I've already gone over in my previous articles and give you an example of how to use them together. You should have a good idea of how to determine the trend on a chart, spot support and resistance, and identify candle patterns that are hinting at a possible reversal. If you're still uncertain about these concepts, go back and reread the articles. Let me start off by giving you the chart I'm looking to trade as well as the time frame. This is a weekly chart for GOOG, and I'm approaching it as a longer term swing trader. I plan on using the 50 week moving average to identify the mid term trend on this time frame, and if all goes well a trade on this time period should take at bare minimum a few weeks, but should end up taking much longer. The only exception would be if the trade went against me and I got stopped out prematurely. Here is the chart.\n\nRight off the bat, you should notice that the stock has had a serious fall in price since it's peak. Hopefully you also noticed that the last two candles are reversal candles, specifically spinning tops, but even without knowing that (since I didn't specifically go over spinning tops), the long wicks should have tipped you off. Two long lower wicks side by side are their own reversal pattern in themselves, called a tweezers bottom (which I did go over). I don't want to base my trade on the candles alone though, so I'm going to apply the 50 MA to this chart and get a feel for what the mid term trend is.\n\nLooking at the chart now with the 50 MA applied, you can see that for the first three quarters of it, the stock was in an uptrend and the price was trading above the 50. The 50 MA can act like a magnet, and if the price gets too far away from it, expect it to correct itself (or at least trade sideways to let the 50 MA catch up). You can see that when the price peaked, it was the furthest it had been from the 50 in a long time. Now the 50 MA is leveling off and the price is trading well below it. Based on this, I'd say that the mid term trend on this has now flattened and even looks to be starting a downtrend, but like I just mentioned, the price has strayed very far away from the 50 MA and it looks like it's going to revert to the mean sometime soon. While I would be expecting a bounce here in the near future, the fact that the mid term trend is flattening after a long uptrend indicates that this won't be a trade where I ride a trend for a while. I'm mainly looking at playing the correction from this sharp drop in price. So I know what the trend is, and though it's not totally in my favor, there is an opportunity for a shorter term trade. I already pointed out the two reversal candles that have formed a reversal pattern, the last thing to do is spot support and resistance. Normally, you'd probably identify support and resistance first, then wait for the reversal candles to form. It just depends where the price is at when you start following the stock. Now here's a chart with what I see as the major areas of support and resistance. Remember, you can draw a ton of lines on the chart, but you really want to limit it to the ones with the most touches and reactions from the price.\n\nFirst off, the ascending trendline which held up for over two years is very critical considering how long it was in play. In early 08, the price ended up breaking below it, then it tried to bounce off of the support line around 500. It was support back then, now that the price is below it, it's resistance. You can see where the price had a reaction to it, I circled it in red. It broke below it, then climbed back above to form a hammer, which is a reversal candle. There was a mild bounce, but when that area was broken below for the second time, that was a failed bounce attempt and the bulls knew to give up and the bears were then clearly in control. Fast forward a couple more months and now we have the two spinning tops/ tweezers bottom forming, and you can see that there is definitely support in that general area. The first attempt to bounce at 500 was a failure, so that makes the current conditions even move oversold and a sharp bounce even more likely. Like I said in the previous paragraph, since the mid term trend is flat to down, I don't plan on buying this here for a long term hold, but the conditions are perfect for a sharp, shorter term bounce. I am going to look at those previous areas of support turned resistance for possible profit targets. First up will be the horizontal line at 500. Considering the magnitude of the drop, I think that target is fairly conservative, and next up after that would be the 50 MA. Remember, the major moving averages (50 MA, 200 MA, etc.) can often act as support and resistance, and since the price is below the 50, that would make it resistance at the moment. Finally, that trendline which held the price up for so long is going to be major resistance. The stronger something acted previously as support, the stronger it will act as resistance. The opposite is obviously true as well for resistance turned support. Should the price make it's way back up to that trendline, the chances of it knocking down the price are incredibly high. Even if the price eventually gets back over it, the initial contact with it will almost certainly get a very large reaction. Let me fast forward a few months to show you how this played out.\n\nYou can see that the stock did end up rallying very hard after it tipped it's hand with those reversal candles. Remember, the stock didn't move because of the chart, the chart just reflected what was going on. You can see that the rally took the price right through the resistance lines and through the 50 MA, but once it hit it's head on that trendline, that was it. The price tried to consolidate and regroup for an attempt to break back above it, but when it broke below that consolidation range, the bears quickly stepped in and took over.\n\nThis was just one example of how to possibly use these three aspects (trends, support/resistance, and price action/candles) of chart technical analysis. Not every trade has to have all three working perfectly in your favor, in fact this example didn't even have the trend on our side. If you really wanted to have everything working for you, you'd wait for a fresh uptrend (50 MA angling up after it's flattened), wait for the price to break over the 50 MA and make it's initial move, wait for the first major pullback, identify support, then time your entry. An example of that would be the first test of the trendline I drew on the chart, right around March 06. You wouldn't have known that was the start of the trendline since it was the first test, but you would have known that the 50 MA had just started to angle up and the price was pulling back to test it for support. If you look closely, you can see that there was also a nice reversal candle right at that point, giving you a perfect entry. Imagine if you'd have bought in then and rode the wave all the way up. Remember, this all applies to shorting as well, but instead you'd want a fresh downtrend (50 MA to start to angle down after it had flattened), wait for the first major move below the 50, wait for the first correction after that, identify resistance, then time your entry. That is just an example of the typical, ideal setup where everything is working in your favor, but there are many possibilities.\n\nThis example I gave you today was on a weekly chart, which is much longer term than most traders I know use. This method applies to any chart time frame you want, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc. I could trade exclusively using just setups like the one I posted, but this may only be the beginning for you. The longer you watch charts in action and are actually aware of the trends at play, support and resistance, and candles that form and where, you'll start to develop a sense for how stocks move. There is only so much I can actually tell you, eventually it becomes up to you to absorb these things first hand. So get out there, be aware of the trends at work, where support and resistance are at, and what the candles are hinting at. Once you can start to spot these things without much effort, the puzzle will really start to come together and the rest of the pieces will just fall right into place.\n\nAnd to top it off..\n\nProper Position Sizing\n\nHow large or how small should your position be in any given trade? Before I get into the answer to that, there is one prerequisite that supersedes everything, the liquidity of what you're looking to trade. You need to keep your position size to as small of a percentage as the average daily money volume. You can estimate the average money volume by taking the price and multiplying it by the average amount of shares traded daily. If a stock that is trading at $1 averages in between 10,000 and 30,000 shares, the average money volume is probably in the ballpark of $20,000. How much of the average money volume do you want to be? The less the better, but there is no official threshold to stay under. I'd say staying under 2% is pretty safe, but if you know what you're doing you can push that somewhat. This really only applies to penny stocks and other thinly traded stocks, but I figured I should cover that base just to be sure. If you're trading highly liquid securities like blue chip stocks, commodity futures, forex, etc. then this won't be an issue.\n\nAs long as you have the liquidity issue covered, here is how I determine my position size. To start with, I need to know a few things to figure out what my position size should be. Those are; how much I'm willing to lose on this trade, where my entry is, and where my stop loss is at. For example, say I'm watching a stock that is an uptrend, but it's currently falling back to support at $10. Since the longer term trend is up, I'm looking to buy into the support at $10, but if that support fails to hold, I'm going to bail. The most I want to risk losing on the trade is $200. That doesn't mean my position size will be $200 worth of shares, that means that should my stop loss get triggered I only want to lose $200. So my entry is at $10, and my stop loss will be enough below that to allow for normal market fluctuations, we'll say at $9.50. So now I know all the factors to determine my position size. My maximum risk is going to be $200, the entry is at $10, and the stop loss is at $9.50. Based on that, my position size would be 400 shares. 400 shares multiplied by $10 is $4000, and 5% of that (which is what my stop loss is set at) is $200. An easy way to figure this out is by dividing your maximum risk amount by the percentage of the stop loss. In this case, it would be $200/ 5%, which would give the $4,000 figure. You then just need to factor how many shares you can buy with that amount.\n\nIf you always risked the same amount on every trade and kept an arbitrary percentage for your stop losses, your position size would always be the same (in dollars). My problem with this is that an arbitrary percentage doesn't make sense to me since all stocks and charts are different. The stock (or whatever you're trading) and the chart should dictate your stop loss. A 5% stop may work great on one stock, but on another much more volatile oneit may get triggered way too easily. If you feel that on a certain trade you need a 10% – 20% stop loss because of either the volatility, where the closest, most relevant support/resistance is at, or both, then use that wider stop, but adjust your position size accordingly. That way, you're still allowing the proper amount of buffer room for price fluctuations, but you're still risking the same amount if your stop gets hit."

      "text": "THE following are some buy/sell strategies based on Tuesday's trading in the derivatives segment at the NSE:\n\nEquity options: Calls on Tata Engg ended lower, with the July 160 calls clocking the highest volumes on the stock. The immediate outlook on Tata Engg appears negative. You can consider buying puts than selling calls, because the stock's volatility (vols) has increased in the last few days; increase in stock vols is good for long calls and puts, and works against short positions. Consider buying the July 155 puts. Your long puts will not lose heavily due to passage of time, as the option's theta is low. Note, however, that the option's delta is also low. This means that the put value will rise slowly for every point decline in the stock price. Incidentally, the open interest in the July 160 puts increased sharply on Tuesday, which suggests that the traders are taking a negative view on the stock. You have to buy a minimum of 3,300 puts to create the long position.\n\nThe immediate outlook on ACC appears negative. Consider buying the July 160 puts. You will benefit from the option's low implied vols. This means that the puts will rise in value if the traders re-price the options based on higher vols, and this may happen even if the stock price moves up. Your long put position will not lose heavily due to passage of time, as the option's theta is low. Incidentally, based on the closing prices, you can theoretically make money by buying the July 160 calls and selling the 160 puts. But given the negative outlook on the stock, such a position will lose money because, typically, calls fall in value, while puts rise in value when the stock moves down.\n\nIndex options: The Nifty calls ended lower, even though the spot index remained range-bound. The outlook on the market still appears uncertain. You can buy the July 1090 calls and the July 1060 puts. The advantage of such a position is that you can benefit from the calls if the market moves up, while the maximum loss you will incur on your puts is the premium paid. Similarly, your puts will fetch you money if the market moves down, while calls will incur losses. This position will make money if the spot index moves sharply in either direction before the expiry of the July contracts. The combination (called Strangle) carries high vega. This means that the Strangle's value will increase sharply for every point increase in the options' implied vols."

You know the type; the guy with 20 pencils and pens in his pocket with a pocket protector or maybe the classic nerd wearing taped together glasses. Looks great in the movies, but your typical technical analyst can be anyone from your next door neighbor to the soccer mom at all the soccer games.\nLet's get into exactly what kind of information can be gleaned by performing technical analysis of stocks.\n\nWhat is a Technical Analysis?\n\nTechnical analysts believe that a stock's price already reflects all the relevant information needed and that investors collectively are prone to repeating past investor behavior. Your typical technical analyst uses price charts to look for those repeating patterns in prices to identify trends in financial markets. When a trend is identified, analysts attempt to exploit those trends. The technical analysis bases projected volume and price off of moving averages, lines of support, resistance, balance days, and even flags and pennants. These items and other indicators, which are typically mathematical formulations of price or volume, help to determine if an asset is trending and if so, the direction; up or down.\n\nWhat are the Objectives?\n\nThe objective of a technical analysis is to forecast trends in price and volume by recognizing and identifying chart patterns, thus reducing risk when buying or selling stocks. Fundamental analysis, on the other hand, analyzes financial data on the company, market, currency or commodity and is based more on the standing of the company. It's common for traders, financial professionals, market makers, pit traders and active day traders to use technical analysis.\n\nAlthough many academics dismiss technical analysis as pseudoscience, people who use technical analysis believe that it is an aid in identifying trading opportunities. Technical analysts believe that strong data and numbers are a more accurate predictor of future movement in markets.\n\nThere are good arguments for both types of market analysis. If you're a number cruncher and like to deal with data, then you might enjoy technical analysis. Learning how to read and understand a technical analysis is beneficial to learning how to invest wisely in the stock market. Arm yourself with as much information as possible in order to relax and have fun with your investment."

Attendees to our regularly held seminars and webinars come not necessarily to hear why they should use spread betting or how to trade online, but they want to be told the winning formula that'll make them a millionaire in the shortest space of time possible. Unfortunately, in answer to the original question, Capital Spreads is an execution only broker so we cannot offer advice, however we can educate new or experienced investors by informing them about what strategies are popular and most importantly, where clients continually make the most errors.\n\nAs the title to this article suggests making money via any form of investing is not easy - otherwise everyone would do it. One of the most common mistakes that people make, in particular beginners, is that they have unrealistic expectations believing that all they have to do is place a few £10 bets and they'll spend the rest of their lives trading via a laptop from a beach in the sun. So the first thing to appreciate is that trading is tough, you're not going to become an expert overnight and those who do master it are generally in the minority.\n\nIn fact the failure rate tends to be much higher the shorter your time horizon. Most people who start spread betting fall straight into the trap of choosing the shortest time frame and the most unpredictable markets to trade. It's no wonder so many first time traders fail so quickly when they jump into the deep end only to realise shortly after they don't know how to swim.\n\nNot long ago I met someone who said it took them about five years to learn the hard way before becoming a profitable trader. They started by making most of the common errors beginners suffer from and then spent lots of money on various courses before losing more money until eventually after years of practice they found a technique that worked. The key was finding suitable a risk management strategy which helped to control the emotional side of trading. Controlling one's emotions is a very important part of any type of trading or investing and so once you've cracked this then a lot of the other things fall into place because decision making can become so much more rational.\n\nOften it can help by going back to basics and going over those first steps taken when starting out, for example ensure that you are trading a market that suits you. It can take people a long time to realise that they may actually be trading a market that doesn't suit their risk management style, it's too volatile or they simply don't understand it.\n\nCIO, CTO & Developer Resources\n\nOne thing is for certain though - a profitable trader isn't one who is prone to running their losses. This tends to be one of the most common mistakes and the main contributing factor to the good old 80/20 rule (80% of retail clients who trade on margin lose money). Some traders allow losses to build as the market moves further and further against them, in the hope that the market will turn and the trade will eventually come back into profit. This is a strategy that losing clients employ as it's in human nature not to want to incur a loss. Even those in the know are often still guilty of doing it.\n\nTo become a profitable trader takes hard work and effort.

Thus, \"extinguishing\" their open interest in the expiry month while creating new open interest in the later delivery month. Because they always defer delivery, Index Speculators never take possession of physical inventories and do not operate in the commodity markets with concern for supply and demand- only price movement.\n\nOption spread, between the price of two option contracts on the same underlying stock or commodity\n\nCalendar spread, between the price of an option or commodity with different expiration/delivery dates.\n\nThe margin requirement for a futures spread trade is usually less than the sum of the margin requirements for the two individual futures contracts.

That means that more volume has been transacted at the market bid (sellers aggressive) than at the offer--unusual when the index is up on the day.\n\nAccompanying this relative weakness of sentiment is the fact that the NASDAQ 100 and Russell 2000 Indexes have not made bull highs today and five of the eight S&P 500 Index sectors that I track weekly are actually down today from their opening prices. Overall, only 266 more stocks are advancing than declining on the day.\n\nIn short, it's a rally, but one with narrowing participation going into tomorrow's economic releases. .\n\n2 comments:\n\nI have a question that I've been meaning to ask you for a while. Sorry that it is off-topic.\n\nIt concerns edge in the markets, and what separates the profitable traders from the many unprofitable ones.\n\nSchool of thought #1. The profitable traders have some secret system that no one else has figured out. They're doing something no one else is doing. Information that is readily available in the public domain is of very little value, because that is information that everyone else already has. You can't stay ahead of everyone else if you are using the same information that they are using - there is no edge in that. The US military doesn't share secrets with other countries, and as such great traders shouldn't share their secrets with their competitors.\n\nSchool of thought #2. There is no holy grail such as the one implied on the first school of thought. Trading success is no different that success in any other field. The best MMA fighters aren't so good because they have some top-secret way of throwing punches, they are just more highly skilled. The best professional gamers aren't so good because they are using cheats or have secret power-ups, they are more highly skilled. Just like any other performance field, trading success is down a combination of work ethic, intelligence, innate aptitude, positive attitude, and so forth. (Yes, I know, there are the Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa's who break records by cheating, but you get the idea.)\n\nSo Dr. Brett, since you have worked with many different kinds of traders in many different settings, what is your opinion on this? Which school of thought is right, or is the truth somewhere in the middle"

The Stochastic Oscillator is displayed as two lines. The main line is called %K. The second line, called %D, is a Moving Average of %K. The %K line is usually displayed as a solid line and the %D line is usually displayed as a dotted line.\n\nThere are several ways to interpret a Stochastic Oscillator. Three popular methods include:\n\nBuy when the Oscillator (either %K or %D) falls below a specific level (for example, 20) and then rises above that level. Sell when the Oscillator rises above a specific level (for example, 80) and then falls below that level;\n\nBuy when the %K line rises above the %D line and sell when the %K line falls below the %D line;\n\nLook for divergences. For instance: where prices are making a series of new highs and the Stochastic Oscillator is failing to surpass its previous highs.\n\nCalculation\n\nThe Stochastic Oscillator has four variables:\n\n%K periods. This is the number of time periods used in the stochastic calculation;\n\n%K Slowing Periods. This value controls the internal smoothing of %K. A value of 1 is considered a fast stochastic; a value of 3 is considered a slow stochastic;\n\n%D periods. his is the number of time periods used when calculating a moving average of %K;\n\n%D method. The method (i.e., Exponential, Simple, Smoothed, or Weighted) that is used to calculate %D.\n\nThe formula for %K is: %K = (CLOSE-LOW(%K))/(HIGH(%K)-LOW(%K))*100\n\nWhere:\nCLOSE — is today's closing price;\nLOW(%K) — is the lowest low in %K periods;\nHIGH(%K) — is the highest high in %K periods.\n\nThe %D moving average is calculated according to the formula: %D = SMA(%K, N)"

It is far better have some variety of a system in place that'll be used before EACH trade. Here's a straightforward five Step formula to help get you moving.\n\n5 Steps to Investing Online:\n\n1. Find a stock This is the most evident and hardest step in securities dealing. With well over ten thousand stocks to trade a good rough rule to think about is time of the year. For instance, as I write this, it's the start of spring. It might seem sensible to consider stocks that historically make runs, or slide if you're bearish, in this time of the year.\n\n2. Fundamental research Many short term traders might not agree with the necessity to do ANY fundamental analysing, however knowing the chart patterns from past times and the news relating to the stock is important. An example would be takings season. If you're planning on playing a stock to the upside which has missed its revenues target the last three quarters, caution might be in order.\n\n3. Technical Analysis This is the part where indicators come in. Stochastics, the MACD, volume, moving averages, RSI, CCI, support levels, resistance levels and all the rest. The batch of indicators you choose, whether lagging or leading, may depend on where you get your education.Keep it simple when first starting out, using too many indicators in the beginning is a ticket to the land of big losses. Get very comfortable using one or two indicators first. Learn their intricacies and you'll be sure to make better trades.\n\n4. Follow your picks After you have placed one or two stock trades you ought to be handling them correctly. If the trade is designed to be a short term trade watch it closely for your exit signal. If it is a swing trade, watch for the signals that tell you the trend is shifting. If it is a long-term trade don't forget to set monthly or weekly checkups on the stock. Use this time to keep up with the news, define your price targets, set stop losses, and keep an eye on other stocks that you may wish to own too.\n\n5.The huge picture As the proverb goes, all ships rise and fall with the tide. Knowing which sectors are warming up stacks the chips in your favour. For instance, if you're long ( expecting price to go up ) on an oil stock and almost all of the oil sector is rising then much more likely than not you are on the right side of the trade. Several dealing systems will give you access to sector-wide info in order that you can get the education you want."

Since I'm going to play the ES for short term trades and M6E for longer term trades I need to understand the risks of the short term ES trades as it's unfamiliar territory for me.\n\nWhat I'm curious about is how fast and by how much the ES can move against you when things get crazy volatile. I've heard of some big moves happening very fast in the ES afterhours catching people by surprise.\n\nWhat is the biggest and fastest move that someone has seen trading the ES during US market or after market hours? Some people have told me they've seen 40 point moves afterhours in a matter of minutes.\n\nIf these kinds of things happen often where they would blow past stops, I might reconsider how much capital I'm planning on putting towards my ES trades.\n\nlike the man said, \"The markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\"\n\nI'm not looking to hold on to a losing position with an irrational market. I never let a position go past a stop I set before I enter a trade.\n\nWhat I am worried about is things out of my control. Fed announcements (although I can avoid those), natural disasters, terrorist attacks, etc. I'm just wondering worse case scenarios what could happen in the ES."

      "text": "Parabolic SAR\n\nParabolic SAR for Ebay during 2002.\n\nIn the field of technical analysis, Parabolic SAR (SAR - stop and reverse) is a method devised by J. Welles Wilder, Jr, to find trends in market prices or securities. It may be used as a trailing stop loss based on prices tending to stay within a parabolic curve during a strong trend.\n\nThe concept draws on the idea that time is an enemy, and unless a security can continue to generate more profits over time, it should be liquidated. The indicator generally works well in trending markets, but provides \"whipsaws\" during non-trending, sideways phases; as such, Wilder recommended establishing the strength and direction of the trend first through the use of things such as the Average Directional Index, and then using the Parabolic SAR to trade that trend.\n\nA parabola below the price is generally bullish, while a parabola above is generally bearish.\n\nConstruction\n\nThe Parabolic SAR is calculated almost independently for each trend in the price. When the price is in an uptrend, the SAR appears below the price and converges upwards towards it. Similarly, on a downtrend, the SAR appears above the price and converges downwards.\n\nAt each step within a trend, the SAR is calculated ahead of time. That is, tomorrow's SAR value is built using data available today. The general formula used for this is:\n\nThe extreme point, EP, is a record kept during each trend that represents the highest value reached by the price during the current uptrend — or lowest value during a downtrend. On each period, if a new maximum (or minimum) is observed, the EP is updated with that value.\n\nThe α value represents the acceleration factor. Usually, this is set to a value of 0.02 initially. This factor is increased by 0.02 each time a new EP is recorded. In other words, each time a new EP is observed, it will increase the acceleration factor. This will then quicken the rate at which the SAR converges towards the price. To keep it from getting too large, a maximum value for the acceleration factor is normally set at 0.20, so that it never goes beyond that. For stocks trading, it is preferable to set the acceleration factor to 0.01, in order to be less sensitive to local decreases. For commodity or currency trading, it is preferable to use a value of 0.02.\n\nThe SAR is recursively calculated in this manner for each new period. There are, however, two special cases that will modify the SAR value:\n\nIf tomorrow's SAR value lies within (or beyond) today's or yesterday's price range, the SAR must be set to the closest price bound. For example, if in an uptrend, the new SAR value is calculated and it results to be greater than today's or yesterday's lowest price, the SAR must be set equal to that lower boundary.\n\nIf tomorrow's SAR value lies within (or beyond) tomorrow's price range, a new trend direction is then signaled, and the SAR must \"switch sides.\"\n\nUpon a trend switch, several things happen. The first SAR value for this new trend is set to the last EP recorded on the previous trend. The EP is then reset accordingly to this period's maximum. The acceleration factor is reset to its initial value of 0.02"

      "text": "Stop-loss orders are often recommended to investors of all types, especially those who aren't always watching the market. For value investors, however, the benefits of stop-loss orders are not as high as they are for other market players, yet value investors still fully suffer from the drawbacks of stop-loss orders. The question therefore becomes: should value investors use stop-loss orders?\n\nOn the one hand, stop-loss orders can still serve a purpose. For example, if bad news for a company gets released during market hours and the stock goes into free-fall, a stop-loss could get an investor, still unaware of the news, out of the stock just minutes later.\n\nOn the other hand, value investors tend to understand what they are buying (lowering the risk of an unexpected impairment), prefer companies with low debt to capital levels (lowering the risk that a company will have some sort of negative credit event), and prefer to take advantage of volatility (rather than fall victim to momentum trading). As such, they are less likely to benefit from the protections offered by a stop-loss.\n\nSo while the benefits to stop-loss orders may not be as large for value investors, they still suffer from the negative effects of stop losses: when the market panics unjustifiably, stop loss orders kick in and investors are exited from their positions at prices far inferior to what they may have been willing to sell for!\n\nConsider what happened just a couple of years ago to the parent company of United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAUA). Panic swept the market after a false rumour of bankruptcy spread throughout, causing the stock to drop 99.92% (from $12 to one penny!). Following news that the rumour was false, the stock returned near its original level. Those with stop-losses got exited at terrible prices, as the stock dropped like a rock. Even if an investor had a stop loss at $10, it would have been filled at a much lower price, since there were no buyers at $10 during this panic.\n\n1 comments\n\nThere are some very real risks where you might be on vacation and something catastrophic happens, and without stop loss orders, you could get in a lot of trouble. In reality though, I'm willing to bet it's not a major problem that warrants stop-loss orders.\n\n1) Most of the year, you're probably available during market hours if you're an investor. Keep some email alerts going and you should be fine. Let's be safe and say this covers 85% of the market's hours.\n\n2) The odds of something catastrophic happening are very slim, so 99% of the time you should be fine\n\n3) If the position is limited to a portion of your portfolio, again, you'll be fine.\n\nIf you understand all of your risks with an investment, even the catastrophic events should be something you're aware of. I'm not too surprised when Ben Graham talks about the risk of nuclear war - he's clearly thought through it. I think it's Charlie Munger that says something like, \"Show me where I'll die so I never go there.\" These investors really study where the mistakes could be made so they can avoid them - if we know there is some kind of likely catastrophic event, it should really be taken into consideration.\n\nI'd say that by the time you really study a business, you're well aware of the risks that they face and so you naturally limit your position because you understand the risks. At least for me, it's easier for me to make a large bet when I don't know enough about a company simply because I don't know all the risks. Only one of those has proven to work though."

      "text": "Explainer: what is short selling?…\n\nAre short sellers heroes or villains of financial markets?\nImage from  identify over-valued companies and help restore more accurate prices. They also provide liquidity to the market.\n\nRecent regulations that banned short selling have been shown to have a detrimental rather than beneficial impact on markets.\n\nWhat is short selling?\n\nShort selling means that you are selling something that you do not own. Most people struggle to understand how this is possible or why it is allowed. A short seller will sell a stock if they believe the price of the stock is going to decline in the future. Therefore, they sell at a high price in the hope of buying the stock back when the price declines.\n\nIn order to short sell, the seller must borrow the stock from someone who owns it. In return, the short seller pays a fee to the party lending them the stock. In addition, if the price of the stock rises after the short seller sells the stock, they will also be required to pay a margin to cover the potential loss of the short seller being required to buy the stock back at a higher price. When the short seller buys back the stock, the stock loan is terminated. The short seller's profit or loss is the difference between the sale price and the purchase price.\n\nShort selling is more risky than buying a stock because the potential losses are unlimited. When someone buys a stock, the maximum amount that they can lose is the price they paid for the stock. When someone short sells a stock, they lose more as the price of the stock rises.\n\nSince the financial crisis, the Australian regulators have introduced a comprehensive disclosure regime for short selling. This regime makes it easy for market participants to identify the outstanding short positions and the level of shorting activity in the market. Short positions must be reported to ASIC on a daily basis. ASIC aggregates this information and reports a daily aggregate level of short positions outstanding to the market. In addition, the level of short selling activity must be reported to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) on a daily basis. ASX aggregates this information and reports the aggregate daily level of short selling in each stock to the market.\n\nWhat can we learn from short sellers?\n\nHigh levels of short selling in a particular stock suggest that the market perceives that stock to be overvalued. Academic research in the US has shown that short sellers are informed investors. Heavily shorted stocks underperform lightly shorted stocks by approximately 15% per annum.\n\nThis evidence suggests that short sellers are skilled at identifying overvalued stocks and that on average they are able to profit from taking a short position in these stocks.\n\nDo short sellers provide any other benefits?\n\nShort sellers also offer additional liquidity to the market. Recent academic research in the US market has shown that some short sellers act as liquidity providers – stepping into the market to provide liquidity when the cost of liquidity is high. A study by an Australian fund manager suggests that short sellers are also significant liquidity providers in the Australian market. This study showed that the ban on short selling by Australian regulators during the financial crisis resulted in significant reductions in liquidity.\n\nBut can't short sellers manipulate the market?\n\nSome investors and companies raise concerns about short sellers manipulating stock prices down in order to profit on their short position. Oddly, people seem to be less concerned about the price of a stock being manipulated upwards by someone with a long position in a stock. Regulatory attention should focus on detecting and prosecuting manipulative trading regardless of whether the manipulator is pushing the price of the stock up or down or whether the manipulator is a long or a short seller… several years places someone firmly into the 'investor' category.\n\nAs the time horizon of share holding gets shorter, the applicable terms get closer to 'speculator' and 'speculation'. These are true names of the people and the activity. Using these, helps to keep the discussion objective. When investors lose their money, it is bad for everyone. When speculators lose their money, well, it is a risky business (in other words: who cares).\n\nAnd it goes further; when someone sells something he does not own (short selling and 'derivatives' in general) in the hope that the purchase price will drop, we are firmly on casino territory. What is the difference between betting on the drop (or rise, or whatever) of X shares and betting on the next number at the roulette wheel? I think the applicable terms are 'casino' and 'gambler'.\n\nI have no sympathy if a gambler loses a few million at the roulette wheel. I have even less sympathy if he first sneakily converted the equity market into a casino, so we do not notice when he bets our pension fund on some random stuff (the fall of honey price in Equador - or whatever).\n\nI think the questions we should ask are not like: \"does it provide liquidity to the market?\", but \"is it investment?, is it speculation?, is it gambling?\".… attached to these risky loans.\n\nShort-selling is a useful mechanism in the financial markets for the exact reasons the author of the article stipulated. Your analogies to casinos demonstrate your reluctance to learn something you don't understand and a perpetuation of ignorance the article is trying to circumvent.\n\nI don't believe anyone would dispute the potential for traders to manipulate stock prices but this is not only achieved through short-selling.\n\nYou may also want to look into what your superannuation fund is doing with your money when you get a chance to climb down off that horse.\n\nThere is nothing intrinsically wrong with gambling. Everything we do is to some extent a gamble. There is however a propensity for some, if not all, of us to cheat at gambling. Especially problematic when it comes to those who run and essentially self-regulate the markets.\n\nI would appreciate naked short selling and automated trading added to this article. As an engineer who understands the design of gambling systems, it is hard to see what difference there is when naked short selling and automated trading are added to a stock exchange. It appears to be deliberate effort to increase the \"gamble\" - by selling a naked stock it is hoped that the sell trigger can be achieved bringing about a fall in stock price and if this is large enough then the naked seller can generate quite a return.\n\nIt appears to be the ever increasing need for derivatives to drive the level of gambling on exchanges, is it just like the need for new plays on poker machines at the casino?… on the long side to order - and perhaps to some degree countervailing the glossy sales brochures company directors often pass off to the ASX as performance milestones. So yes, canny short sellers can serve to keep these smoke and mirrors players on their toes, whereas the average M&D investor hasn't a hope. Given that stock exchanges are the biggest shark tanks in the country.\n\nThe real problem in preserving a safe environment for M&D investors lies in curbing the hard core gamers - punters who use 21st century derivatives, and high frequency trading schemes to skim the market - Those few numerically, can wreak chaos, and this is what President Obama is addressing right now to revive American enterprise - since capital to make it happen has to come from somewhere - ie: Investors, not the banks, not the gamers - Investors who buy into what they think is a promising enterprise. Given time Australia will follow the US lead, opposed to addressing it with original expertise. Meanwhile Australians are deserting the stock market in droves, simply because it lacks oversight - Their tolerance of high profile gamers, and all that.\n\nLuckily Australia managed to avoid a fair chunk of the GFC with our slow banks failing to grasp some of the marvellous opportunities collateralised debt derivatives(CFD's) offered - then we also prospered by having all these assets the world wants - Mineral resources - Land - and now the food chain. So asset sales should keep us afloat for a while - Meanwhile the Dutch Disease is just taking hold, and as a result we have the worlds greatest treasurer whipping up some new and insidious ways to keep his coffers topped up.\n\nSpeaking of short selling - Did anyone notice the CEO of BHP has just sold $20m of his own shares - apparently to meet some of his personal tax obligations in the near term.But more recently the other forms have come to dominate the market\n3) selling businesses you do not own - short selling\n4) derivatives for their own sake where you hold no other interest in the underlying asset\n\nThere is more money being *invested* in the market now for items 3 and 4 than 1 and 2. And they are adding to the instability of the market.\n\nShort selling in particular is an absurdity. It creates a scenario in which one or more entities can own more than 100% of the stock. As to providing liquidity to the market, perhaps, but they also add extreme volatility. Shorted stocks vastly over shoot the market equilibrium and in a bear market add fuel to any fall in price.\n\nGreat quote. It is also a tautology. If stocks are heavily shorted then their price will be pushed down, so it hardly surprising that they under perform the market.\n\nWhile markets will naturally tend to ebb and flow based upon fundamentals, do we really need or want to inject volatility into the market? I think @Laszlo's differentiation between investor / speculator and gambler are spot on.\n\nStocks are heavily shorted for good reasons, often because of insider knowledge, done by savvy investors.\nTautologies involve saying the same thing twice. Short sales tend to be intelligently caused and causes tend to have expected effects.\n\nI should add that over a twenty year period I worked as a PI for attorneys and other clients investigating securities' fraud cases, sometimes having to represent the fraudsters, but mostly uncovering the details of the frauds. Pump and dump cases were a specialty. So my perspective is not from the academic or regulative outside, but from the inside view of the actual game players.… decline in the stock's value. 'Lenders' who 'lend' their stock and putting a speculator in the position to force down the value of the asset lent. In return, all they receive is a tiny percentage which logically must be less than the amount by which the short seller expects the stock to decline, because otherwise the short seller wouldn't do it. So is the 'lender' gambling that the short seller has got it wrong? The 'lender' cannot possibly know how much stock the short seller will 'borrow' from other holders, so the 'lender' is in no position to assess the risk.\nIf the 'lender' is really 'lending' his/her own stock, I suppose he/she can take the risk. But are super fund trustees and others still gambling in this way?\nIf somebody can explain why, contrary to the above, the 'lender' is being rational, then I would very much appreciate it. Otherwise, I'm with Laszlo on this. (And there is everything wrong with gambling - it permits people to acquire value where they have created none).\n\n(And there is everything wrong with gambling - it permits people to acquire value where they have created none).\nAll profits from our labors are acquired values, created by our more or less intelligent strategies. The wrongness would be in any cheating that was a part of the strategies. And cheating in the selfishly self regulated stock market is endemic.… who got burnt in the tech crash, and the more recent GFC as to what happens when things slide way too beyond there value and euphoria rules market at the absence of fundamental value.\n2. People seem to have a real issue with investors, speculators whatever you want to call it as (even traditional stock buying is to an extent speculating on the future of that company) when it comes to such people acting financially on the forecast that a company is overvalued and will drop. Why isn't there as much uproar about buying stock and potentially excessively overdoing the value of a financial instrument or worse yet adding onto andalready overdone value. I'm afraid viewing the financial market from a viewpoint that buying stocks is healthy in any context but doing anything which rings alarm bells about the overdone value of stock is something mischievous etc is immensely simplifying things, not to mention showing a lack of knowledge and a very naive approach.\nIn conclusion short selling didn't cause the GFC. It was caused by an overdone US housing market, where institutions had not established enough safeguards to notice and hence warn against the extremely lenient lending criterion which had become the culture of banks. As a result, some very witty speculators, and hedge funds made massive fortunes forecasting that the housing market was overdone and was about to blow up. So we should now curse such people because they had the foresight to see what was coming where as everyone else wanted to jump on the buy buy buy bandwagon? I'm afraid as PIMCO boss El-Erian put bluntly, the markets are in a new normal culture where the making an average of 10% annually by simply investing in blue chip companies are over. It's a much more fierce market where if your investing on your own, diligent active research etc is a must. I am for further regulation of the financial markets (more so in the US than here) as things like algorithmic trading, ridiculous trading limits on risky derivatives by big banks etc should be contained. However lets not blame short trading without being bothered to comprehend how markets operate and it's complexities and being upset because we want to make almost guaranteed healthy returns by investing in the BHPs, Woolworths, McDonald's etc of the worlds. For all those worried about the volatility and uncertainty a) either don't get involved because the markets are being reflective of a changing word, or b) feel safe in the fact that if something is fundamentally good value, you will make money from it no matter the short term swings. Ie; Apple.\n\nNowadays when one enters the equity market with the conventional academic view that market is where people mobilize their financial resources to where they are most needed and consequently most profitable in the economy then one would easily burn their hard earned money because of the short selling coupled with BOT high frequency trading activities. To make matter worse dinkum mom and dad investors who underestimate the virtual world of the internet but have to be extremely careful to avoid putting their hard earned cash into many listed companies which have nothing but flashy websites and glossy periodical reports containg professionally cut false information produced by \"clever but crooked accountants\" (CbCA) acting as CEO, CFO, GM...I think false manipulated information increases the inefficiency of the financial market and slows down industrial and business growth. It is time for market regulators to act for real entrepreneurs' and true investors' sake."

      "text": "Should We Legalize Insider Trading?\n\nWith the high-profile arrest of hedge-fund manager Raj Rajaratnam, insider trading is back into the spotlight. Everyone knows the problem with insider trading: \"[T]he average investor will get taken advantage of. If some players in a market have an advantage, then some have a disadvantage and that's not fair.\" But James Altucher, who provides that clear explanation, isn't \"sure it's so black and white.\" Why? Here are a few reasons he thinks society might benefit from legalizing insider trading:\n\n\"The more information in a market, any market, the more efficient prices become.\"\n\n\"Fraud will be exposed earlier ... Enron is an example where tens of thousands of investors got burned because they were piling into the stocks during the later stages of its fraud. If insiders were selling we would've seen a much swifter move down, and probable fraud exposed.\"\n\n\"Companies will either become more transparent, to keep the retail investor happy, or will themselves enforce secrecy rather than being complacent with the idea that the law somehow protects their secrets.\"\n\n\"More enforcement dollars will be used to uncover actual frauds such as the next Enron or Worldcom. Arguably, these frauds are a thousand times more dangerous for the retail investor than what is probably a victimless crime such as insider trading.\"\n\n\"Insider trading is almost impossible to prosecute and the government wastes countless dollars trying"

      "text": "Window2India -Send Gifts To India\n\nLooking for opportunities to invest your money? Want to see your money grow? Finding the right investment option is half the battle won! Bank deposits, postal savings, life insurance policies and investment in shares are traditional choices. But changing times have introduced new investment avenues – mutual funds, commodities, futures and so on.\n\nHere's a look at a new form of investment – commodity trading.\n\nA commodity is any physical item that can be bought or sold. Traditionally, commodities traded included agricultural produce like wheat, cotton, rice, etc. The commodity market today, however, includes livestock, minerals, and metals. Any item that has physical existence and a reasonable life can be traded as a commodity.\n\nJust like trading in shares is facilitated by a stock market, commodity markets have been developed for trading in commodities. Any commodity that can be produced on a large scale can be traded on a commodity exchange. Trading activity is based on the price mechanism; that means the market demand and supply decide the price. The actual commodity may not physically exist in the market. Only a contract is entered into for delivery at a later date. The New York Mercantile Exchange and London Metal Exchange are examples of regularized commodity markets.\n\nCommodities are categorized as soft commodities and hard commodities. Items like cotton, coffee, sugar, and meat that can be grown or produced are soft commodities. Hard commodities include items that are mined, like metals and precious stones. Commodity futures are also traded in commodity markets. These allow you to trade in a particular commodity at a pre-decided price and time. Futures contracts are mostly for soft commodities.\n\nStrictly speaking, the commodities market is not a new concept. It has been in existence for a long time. The bullish growth of the commodity markets in recent times has made it a lucrative investment option. A few years ago the prices of onions had soared and the merchants trading in them made huge profits. Similarly, if you had made investments in oil, gold, silver, uranium, and timber a few years ago you would reap good returns today (as prices are on the rise today). Gas prices have also been rising and are a high-paying commodity!\n\nFor long, commodity trading has been looked upon as an investment avenue for traders or other business entities. Do you think individuals can profit from investments in commodities? Give us your opinion"

      "text": "Parobolic Sar\n\nThe Parobolic sar is a method of technical analysis, devised by J. Welles Wilder Jr., in order to identify trends in the markets. The concept behind the parobolic sar is that time is not on your side, and if a security or market cannot generate more profits over a period of time, it ought to be liquidated. This indicator works very well with markets that are trending. A parabola that is below the price generally indicates a bullish or upward trend, while a parabola that is above the price indicates a bearish or downward trend.\n\nAn example of a Parobolic Sar Chart:\n\nInterestingly, the SAR is calculated for a future time period for each step in a trend. Tomorrow's SAR calculation is equated by using data that is available today. The formula for calculating the Sar is:\n\nThe EP or extreme point is kept during each trend; it represents the highest value that is reached during an uptrend, or the lowest value reached during a downtrend. The EP gets updated when new highs or lows are observed.\n\nThe α is the acceleration value. Normally, this is set to .02, and is increased by .02 each time a new EP is observed. This will accelerate the rate at which the SAR moves towards the price. A maximum amount is generally set for 0.20, to keep it from getting too big.\n\nThe SAR will continue to be calculated in this manner; however, there are some special cases that could modify the SAR value:\n\nIf tomorrow's SAR is within or above yesterday or today's price range, the SAR is set to the closest price.\n\nIf tomorrow's SAR is within or above tomorrow's price range, then a new trend direction is identified; the SAR then switches sides.\n\nIn the case of #2, the first SAR for the new trend is set to reflect the last EP that was recorded on the previous trend. This EP is reset to this period's maximum, and the acceleration factor will be reset to the original value of 0.02."

      "text": "ETF and Gamma Question\n\nSo I've been doing calendar spreads on volatile stocks like (GOOG), (PCLN), (AAPL) etc... Its been pretty crazy adjusting constantly due to the high volatility. I'm looking to try some ETF's for the first time. But when I pulled up some strategies with the ETF's in the P & L Graph I've noticed that the ETF's have a high amount of Gamma. I was under the impression that ETF options where less volatile than equity options. Yet due to the high Gamma, it seems the smallest move in the ETF spells disaster pretty quick.\n\nMy questions are: Why is this the case, or am I missing something? And can someone recommend some general tradeable ETF's?\n\n(for those who don't know; Gama is the incremental change of Delta for a one dollar move in the underlying)\n\nI'm not aware of any Gama difference if your underlying is stock, ETF or index. Gamma normally comes more into play closer to expiration. Are you selling the short side of your calenders close to expiration? (closer than 20 days) This might explain the Gamma.\n\nOn a different topic: You mentioned you were doing calenders on volatile stocks. That's perfectly fine, but calender spreads are hurt by decreasing volatility and helped by increasing IV. I use calender spreads when the relative IV is low and do credit spreads, butterflies and condors when the IV is high. These later positions are helped by falling volatility. I'm not saying you can't or shouldn't do calendars on high IV, but you can gain an edge if you're on the right side of the IV.\n\nDoogle, thanks for your response. So take this example: I pulled up a calendar spread in (ISRG): Selling front week April 27 580 call Buying the back month May 19 580 call Debit: 9.20 For this position, a 1-lot has -1.20 Gamma\n\nCompared to the ETF (QQQ): Selling front week April 27 66 call Buying back month May 19 66 call Debit: .63 For this position, a 1-lot has -9.81 Gamma.\n\nWhat am I missing from this discrepency? I do try to pick a position that is in a low range of its volatility, but it seems the gamma risk is pretty high with the weekly's which I understand. But it seems although the ETF's have a lower volatility than the equity options, the gamma seems crazier.\n\nI should start by saying I'm not aware of any gamma differences due to the type of underlying. So I'm sure we'd both welcome a more expert explanation.\n\nI would expect Gamma, with a week till expiration, to be high near the money. Highest near your short strike.\n\nLooking at your ISRG/QQQ example. One difference I notice is that ISRG options have low liquidity. The May ATM open interest is under 100 contracts. This might be messing with the price model that the P+L Calc uses due to wider bid/ask spreads. I think the QQQ, with May ATM open interest over 100,000, is probably a more accurate read.\n\nI plugged in a handful of stocks and ETFs to look for a trend, but didn't notice one.\n\nI'm sure you are just overlooking the definition of gamma. It the rate at which the option delta changes when the underlying asset changes by ONE POINT. For your high-priced stocks, one point is essentially nothing. Yet for the modestly priced options on ETFs, one point is a far more significant number.\n\nFor example, when trading SPY options, gamma seems to be much higher than that of SPX options. However, we know that a one-point move in SPY is equivalent to a 10-point move in SPX. The dollars earned from a 10-lot of SPY options is essentially the same as that earned from a one-lot (assuming the strikes are equivalent and the expiration is identical) SPX option.\n\nYou do not want to compare losses with an equal number of contracts. You want to compare an investment of an equal number of dollars. For example:\n\n· When SPX moves 10 points, that is equivalent to SPY moving by one point.\n\n· Ten SPY options (and all that gamma) still make or lose the same as one SPX option (assuming strikes are equivalent and expiration is identical) and it's much smaller gamma.\n\nOptionsWhile Delta represents the consensus of the marketplace as to the theoretical price movement of the option relative to the underlying security and Gamma represents the consensus of the marketplace as to the theoretical rate of change of Delta relative to the underlying security, thereHi Mark and thanks for your response. Not sure how you got that I dont know the definition of Gamma by reading my initial inquiry. Buy anyway I appreciate the response, and I understand your point. Its a proportinate thing.\n\nI was hoping you would chime in on this question with your knowledge and experience. I agree with your explanation, after all the stock price in squared in the denominator for gamma in the BS model. The more expensive the stock, lower gamma\n\nWhere I was struggling is that the question really is about calendar spreads, where gamma is the difference between two options, not individual options itself. The difference between two large numbers (QQQ options) can be a small number and vice vrsa. What is your take on it?"

      "text": "4 Answers\n\nThe precise origin of the phrases \"bull market\" and \"bear market\" are obscure. The Oxford English Dictionary cites an 1891 use of the term \"bull market\". In French \"bulle spéculative\" refers to a speculative market bubble. The Online Etymology Dictionary relates the word \"bull\" to \"inflate, swell\", and dates its stock market connotation to 1714.[14] The fighting styles of both animals may have a major impact on the names. When a bull fights it swipes its horns up; when a bear fights it swipes down on its opponents with its paws.[15] When the market is going up, it is similar to a bull swiping up with its horns. When the market is going down it is similar to a bear swinging its paws down.\n\nPerhaps because a bull is considered an aggressive animal, one that charges against its enemies, it has been connected to initiative and activity that marks an upward trend. On the other hand, bears spend a long time hybernating in winter, therefore being inactive, a trait that could have connected them to a downward trend in markets.\n\nSome suggestions as to possible etymologies are made here citing various characteristics of bulls and bears; I don't believe a word of it myself, and I'd think a far better answer is to be found here; for what it's worth, I'd bet on the estimable Mr Quinion.\n\nTo summarise (for bear):-\n\nA noble gentleman of this city, who has the honour of serving his country as major in the Train-bands, being at that general mart of stock jobbers called Jonathon's, endeavouring to raise himself (as all men of honour ought) to the degree of colonel at least; it happened that he bought the Bear of another officer.\n\nThe Tatler, 7 July 1709. This tongue-in-cheek tale is saying that the\nmajor, wanting to buy a promotion, speculated by selling some stock\nshort. When the transaction went wrong, the story goes on, the major\ndescribed his fellow officer as a bear-skin man, among other epithets,\nand called him out, satisfaction being achieved through a fist-fight,\nneither man being keen on firearms.\n\nOne argument that has been put forward for Bull vs Bear is that bearskin traders would sell bearskins they did not own, and hope to make a profit by later purchasing skins from trappers at a lower price. This would be an early form of short selling where the delivery of the skins to the ultimate end use would occur later. Because a bearskin trader made money in a falling market, a falling market became known as a \"bear market\".\n\nIf this explanation is correct then the term \"bull\" market comes from the idea that people bull and bear were mortal enemies and if a bear market meant a falling market, then a bull market must mean the opposite."

      "text": "Hmm.... I think they're legit as far as they have corporate papers and all, but you might want to read up on how the business operates. You could search for the past threads about local forex brokers and their money manager business model then judge for yourself. As even if they don't really have much of qualification requirements only few really become successful in it.\n\nTried it last year, programming's similar to metastock/amibroker but VT has no backtesting features.\n\ncramnhoj, are you a full time FX live player?. .i'm comportable using VT,\ntried oanda but don't like it..i'm still on a paper trade/demo\nfor about a month and hopefully go live if i can make 200% profit\nin my demo account.\n\nLet's put it this way, Buffett and Soros have records of around 30% profit per year in the span of their careers. This is a lot less than what a lot of people expect of instruments like forex or of the gains of daytraders a decade ago. But unlike those others who had more profit, Soros and Buffett haven't blown up (they have made a couple of bad calls of course). In short, the methods that give those very large gains are also very likely to have large losses. In my opinion, it's more or less just overleveraging a position to try to gain more out of a little volatility in the markets.\n\nCompared to a normal distribution, markets have lots of small upward movements and then fat tails on the negative side. These are the multitudes of market participants buying every now and then. And then liquidating at all costs at the onset of a crash. This is where the saying \"work on your downside, the profits will take care of themselves\" comes from.\n\nAlso, in my opinion, a person starting out can't just replicate their performance on a demo account on a live account. After learning on a demo, they'll be learning on a live accountand do you think using higher leverage(400:1) would\nprovide flexibility and advantage for the players?\n\nmy friend is using cmsfx.com but they had poor\nexecution on stop/closing the open positionThere are brokers that don't have this, but they exact a different type of \"price \" for it.\n\nFor you to open a position, someone else has to take it. With the practically uncountable number of participants in a market this usually isn't a problem, and you'll see this in whether an instrument is liquid or not. There are times though when market participants exhibit what behavioral finance calls \"herding\", wherein nearly everyone acts like lemmings and does the same thing as everyone else is doing. In forex, you see this when the spread widens, as no one is willing to take the other side of the trade at a certain price (they're only willing to do it at a farther price hence the widening of the spread).\n\nSo how come there are brokers that are able to offer spreads that don't widen/contract? Since someone has to take the other side for a trade to execute, it's the broker who takes the other side for you. Now since you opened the position, you believe it'll go the way you opened it, why would someone take the other side...meaning they'll lose so you can gain (the zero sum game wherein no wealth is created, merely transferred between losers and profiters). The answer is, like any other market participant, they're not doing it for someone else but for themselves to profit. How you might ask, well as much as the forex market is worldwide, each broker is usually only connected with one or a few market makers, meaning if they want to they can swamp their \"local market\" with so many orders in that the price moves where they want to. And where will they make the market move...to you stop, so you'll end up closing at a loss. Mind you they don't do this with each specific client of theirs but on the broad stops placed by the majority of clients, and since they are the brokers they can see your stops. I believe someone even hacked into oanda's network and have a program where you can see traders' stops. In short, you'll see your nice execution...only to see your position hit your stop then go the way you thought it would afterwards.\n\nAnother thing of slippage, it affects different trading strategies differently. Scalpers for example are trying to profit in say 10pips or so, while long term traders only look at opportunities in the range of hundreds of pips. Since it practically takes both types of traders the same time to open a position, they're open to the same amount of slippage. A slippage of 10pips is possible, to the scalper being off by 10pips means 100% loss in profits, however to the long term trader looking at say a 500pip opportunity, losing 10 pips is merely...a 2% loss. Add to that, a scalper looks into say a dozen positions in a day (each subject to that slippage costing 100% profit), while a long term trader looks into a position say once a week (and it'll only be a small percent of slippage he's looking into). The way I see it, given a problem you can either whine about it or work on it so it won't affect you. And that if you work on someone else's rules you're already screwed, as everyone makes rules to profit themselves. A lot of brokers are appealing to the scalping/dayrtading crowd, but the problem is with the way it's structured, those strategies end up like a casino..something rigged to profit the house.\n\nAs the saying goes \"If there's a will, there's a way\", one can add to that \"If there's no will, there's an excuse\". I see a lot of people whining on the net about spreads and slippage.\n\nand do you think using higher leverage(400:1) would\nprovide flexibility and advantage for the players?\n\nI for one consider the more leverage the better, but this would be open to a lot of misconstruing, so I'll explain. Since my position sizing isn't determined by how much my account can open, but on how much risk I can take on a position, adding more leverage simply means I'll give out a lower amount for margin and since I also carry trade the rollover isn't an issue either. Other people though might see the extra leverage as a chance to open bigger positions...wherein they end up taking more risk than they can take, leading to their downfall. And so these people end up avoding leverage like the plague, the same way people who can't control their spending avoid credit cards, and businessmen who can't control their finances avoid taking loans.\n\nNice thread. Just a quick question (especially to the active traders): do you have any audited track records to show how much money you've actually made over a certain period of time...say 5 years? The reason I ask is that it is very possible that the huge gains you say you've made were merely offset by huge losses....and once you average them out, the annualized returns may not look as spectacular some would like to suggest. Perhaps 5 to 7% annualized. This is just slightly better than putting your money in a stable money market account or bond fund. Yet, you achieved this with a lot of volatility, not to mention incurring lots of trading fees and taxes which reduce total returns. I think it is important when investing (whether in stocks, commodities, precious metals, currencies) to always look at the bottom line. What was the real after-tax, after-fees, risk-adjusted return? Was it all worth the frenetic trading? After all, if you reached the same final amount of money as the guy who simply parked his money in some money market account or safe T-bills, then what's the point of all the churning? I'm not saying that you failed this test; what I'm saying is, show us your audited returns and then we can talk. This is what I always require of any investment advisor or broker who approaches me supposedly to help me make money in the market: what is your track record? What is your net worth? If your track record and net worth are much less than mine, then why should I listen to your advice?\n\nAnother way to take advantage of currency movements if you are based in the US is to buy foreign stocks or stock funds that don't do any currency hedging of their portfolios. If the US dollar depreciates relative to, say, the euro, your European stocks will gain, even though in local currency (or euro terms), the stocks did not really move. One doesn't have to buy or sell the actual currencies to benefit from a weakening (or appreciating) dollar, as the case may be).\n\nWhen is Forex a gamble???\n\nLike any other business and invesment ventures, there will always be risks involved. Like in any other day-to-day activities, big or small risks will always exist. Thats life.\n\nBut why do people always relate to Forex Trading a gamble?\n\nThen let us analyze this issue shall we? There are only 2 directions in the Forex Market. Up or Down, Long or Short, Buy or Sell. By any means, you only get to have 1 position at a certain point in time. With this in mind, its either you go WITH or AGAINST the market. Go WITH the market and you make money, go AGAINST the market and you loose money. That being said, it gives us a pattern of a gamble.\n\nGambling (or betting) is any behavior involving risking money or valuables (making a wager or placing a stake) on the outcome of a game, contest, or other event in which the outcome of that activity depends partially or totally upon chance or upon one's ability to do something.\nsource : en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamble\n\nBased on the definition above, should we say that everything in business is partially or totally a gamble?\n\nI've been in Traditional Business and Forex Trading long enough to understand the differences of both in terms of risks and I say there is NONE. For the purpose of this discussion, let me lay down the facts so that I may shed some light on why people see Forex as a gamble.\n\nLets just say that you are the most incompetent trader in the whole universe, so i would rather suggest that you rely your chances on a toss-coin method. Your chances then would be 50-50. Go Long if its a head and go Short if its a tail. Now that is a gamble! But what if there is RISK MANAGEMENT? All businesses have one, why not in Forex Trading? If you limit your losses on a traditional business, why not in Forex Trading? Lets just say that RISK MANAGEMENT would comprise 10% of your business operation, add this up on your chances and this already favors the odds on your part. Now you're on a 60-40 chance of making it right. Now nobody goes into business without analysing the market place. Just like in traditional business also one makes fundamental and technical analysis of the business arena. Your fundamental analysis would cover the nations economy, competition, location, raw materials, products, by-products, suppliers and customers. Your technical analysis would cover your financial statements, receivables, payables, cashflow and balance sheets. On the other hand, in Forex, fundamental analysis would cover the study of news, current events, acts of wars, terrorism and the economic indicators (GDP, Interest Rates, Unemployment Rate, Imports and Exports, Housing reports, Manufacturing reports, etc) of a certain nation. Forex technical analysis would cover the price history of a certain currency applied with technical indicators and marking of significant tops and bottoms to get the picture of the existence of a trend. Now lets just say that fundamental analysis gives you a 10% chance and technical analysis another 10% chance in favor on your part. This would give you 80-20 chance of making it right. Surely this doesnt mean that you'll always profit from your trades, but in general, you made money on your invesment on the long run. In traditional business, these are the seasonal ups and downs of your returns and revenues (try selling jackets this summer against selling it during the rainy season).\n\nAs you can see, both traditional business and Forex Trading have nothing to differ when it comes to risks. The gambling part only comes in when:\n\nYou have no discipline in business/trading\n\nYou dont know how to analyze fundamentally\n\nYou dont know how to analyze technically\n\nThe market place (Traditional Business and/or Forex Trading) is in constant motion. Trends and fads appear, stay, and change in a certain period of time in which case no single entity can control nor influence. Successfull businessmen know this and they either ride this trends or forecast on it. Go opposite of a trend and surely you'll loose money both in a traditional business or Forex trading. Imagine yourself doing business by selling pagers at this time of age. Do you think you'll make it big? I think not! Just like also in Forex Trading, go against the market trend and your money goes bye bye.\n\nWhy people refer to it as a gamble? Because it is. IN the casinos, your money can double or disappear in seconds. The same goes with Forex. NO matter how good you are with fundamental or technical analysis, you can win or lose. It is the reason why mostly those who invest in Forex invest only with their excess funds.\n\nThinking of Investing in CurrenciesHow??\nbuy Euro, then save in a bank, or euro TD, or euro mutual funds...With what company are you trading currencies? I believe all are based abroad right? I have tried trading currencies using their different platforms, however, since the currency market is very very volatile, you cannot go negative in your capital right? If you go negative, they will just automatically buy/sell your position. Unlike stocks, which allow you to have a negative balance"

      "text": "DOW Trading System\n\nVerified results for recent 12 months: +5%\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average Description\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average History:\n\nWhen Charles H. Dow first unveiled his industrial stock average on May 26, 1896, the stock market was not highly regarded. Prudent investors bought bonds, which paid predictable amounts of interest and were backed by real machinery, factory buildings and other hard assets.\n\nToday, stocks are routinely considered as investment vehicles, even by conservative investors. The circle of investors has widened far beyond the Wall Street cliques of the past century to millions of everyday working men and women. These people are turning to stocks to help them amass capital for their children's college tuition bills and their own retirements. Information to guide them in their investment decisions is abundantly available.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average Index played a role in bringing about this tremendous change. One hundred years ago, even people on Wall Street found it difficult to discern from the daily jumble of up-a-quarter and down-an-eighth whether stocks generally were rising, falling or treading water. Charles Dow devised his stock average to make sense out of this confusion. He began in 1884 with 11 stocks, most of them railroads, which were the first great national corporations. He compared his average to placing sticks in the beach sand to determine, wave after successive wave, whether the tide was coming in or going out. If the average's peaks and troughs rose progressively higher, then a bull market prevailed; if the peaks and troughs dropped lower and lower, a bear market was on.\n\nIt seems simplistic nowadays with myriad market indicators, but late in the Nineteenth Century it was like turning on a powerful new beacon that cut through the fog. The average provided a convenient benchmark for comparing individual stocks to the course of the market, for comparing the market with other indicators of economic conditions, or simply for conversation at the corner of Wall and Broad Streets about the market's direction.\n\nThe mechanics of the first stock averages were dictated by the necessity of computing it with paper and pencil: Add up the prices and divide by the number of stocks. This application of grade-school arithmetic, while creative is hardly worthy of remembrance more than a century later. But the very idea of using an index to differentiate the stock market's long-term trends from short-term fluctuations deserves a salute. Without the means for the ordinary investor to follow the broad market, today's age of financial democracy (in which millions of employees are actively directing the investment of their own future pension money and as a result are substantial corporate shareholders) would be unimaginable.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the 12-stock industrial average in the spring of 1896, Mr. Dow, in the autumn of that year, dropped the last non-railroad stocks in his original index, making it the 20-stock railroad average. The utility average came along in 1929 (more than a quarter-century after Mr. Dow's death at age 51 in 1902) and the railroad average was renamed the transportation average in 1970.\n\nAt first, the average was published irregularly, but daily publication in The Wall Street Journal began on Oct. 7, 1896. In 1916, the industrial average expanded to 20 stocks; the number was raised again, in 1928, to 30, where it remains. Also in 1928, the Journal editors began calculating the average with a special divisor other than the number of stocks, to avoid distortions when constituent companies split their shares or when one stock was substituted for another. Through habit, this index was still identified as an \"average.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average Today:\n\nThe 30 stocks now in the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index are all major factors in their industries, and their stocks are widely held by individuals and institutional investors. At the end of 1999, these 30 stocks accounted for about 28 percent of the $12 trillion-plus market value of all U.S. stocks.\n\nUsing such large, frequently traded stocks provides an important feature of the Industrial Average: timeliness. At any moment during the trading day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is based on very recent transactions. This isn't always true with indexes that contain less-frequently traded stocks.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average Index is the most-quoted market indicator in newspapers, on TV and on the Internet. Because of its longevity, it became the first to be quoted by other publications. This practice became habit when Wall Street earned at least a mention in the general news each day, and habit became tradition when the post-World War II bull market galvanized the nation's attention. The Industrial Average became the indicator to cite if you were citing only one. Besides longevity, two other factors play a role in its widespread popularity: It is understandable to most people, and it reliably indicates the market's basic trend.\n\nI was one of the first to start taking your\nQQQQ-SPDRs-DIA signals and have been very impressed with your calls and have made\nmore money with your signals than any other signal I have ever subscribed to.

      "text": "Market Bubbles\n\nWhile there is a lot of evidence that stock markets are simply unpredictable, there are times when prices get a long way out of kilter with any sense of reasonable value. The term used is \"bubble\". Bubbles are harder to avoid than might appear. Herd instinct seems to be firmly embedded in the human psyche, and many studies have shown that quite bizarre behaviour can seem \"normal\" if enough people are doing it and accepting it as such. Also, abnormal market valuations can persist for very long periods of time, and even hardened sceptics can sometimes get worn down when their dire predictions fail to be realised for years on end.\n\nNevertheless, it is important to try to recognise the characteristics of a bubble in advance, because they invariably are very easy to recognise in hindsight when they burst, and clients can be unforgiving when they get caught.\n\nFamous Bubbles\n\nBubbles can sometimes be limited to a particular commodity or stock, but can also describe speculative behaviour across wide regions or investment areas. Many bubbles start in small areas and then spread. An example was the mining stock bubble which followed an announcement of a large nickel deposit by Poseiden NL in Australia in 1969. Prior to the announcement, Poseiden had been trading at .80c, and after the announcement the price moved to $12.30. A fifteen times price hike looks impressive, but the bubble had a lot more than that to come. With very scant information provided and considerable uncertainty about the grades and size of reserves, the price ultimately ran to $280 before finally collapsing. At least Poseiden did have a real find, albeit it dramatically over-valued, but as with a typical bubble, contagion soon followed, and companies with nothing more than a location close to Poseiden or deposits that existed only in the Directors' imaginations, took off. A rumour started that a company called Tasminex had made a discovery at Mount Venn (nothing ever was discovered there) which sent the share price from $2,80 to $3.30 on the day the rumour started, then to $16.80 on the next trading day and finally on to $96 overnight in London.\n\nTulip mania in Holland in the 17th century is often cited in discussions about bubbles, and it does serve as a great example of just how silly things can get. At the peak, a single tulip bulb traded for 6,700 guilders at a time when 150 guilders was an average annual income.\n\nCharacteristic of bubbles\n\nEssential to bubbles is the suspension of disbelief by most participants. There is a failure to recognize that traders are engaged in a speculative exercise in which people pay too much in the hope of passing the commodity quickly on to a greater fool. High turnover is a feature of bubbles which can look similar to a game of \"pass the parcel\".\n\nIn virtually all cases, a bubble is followed by a spectacular crash in prices. Bubbles burst, they do not slowly deflate. Frequently a lot of collateral damage is involved. When the 1980s Japanese bubble burst, a prolonged period of stagnation for the whole Japanese economy followed. Even now, 20 years after the stock market peak, the Japanese stock market index is only one quarter of its level then. Those who invested at the peak are still at a 75% loss, and are unlikely ever to see a return of the real value of their investments.\n\nOf course more recently, the damage caused by the bursting of the U.S. housing bubble was extensive and severe. Banks and financial institutions throughout the world held hundreds of billions of dollars worth of securities ultimately backed by toxic sub-prime loans, and by the first week of January, 2009, the 12 largest financial institutions in the world had lost half of their value, many businesses went bankrupt and the stability of whole countries and indeed the whole global economy was under threat.\n\nMinsky's Theory of Financial Instability\n\nEconomist Hyman Minsky was Professor of Economics at Washington University. Before his death in 1996, he proposed an unorthodox theory that the causes of financial instability \"Stabilizing an Unstable Economy\" (1986) centre on speculation and debt. Unsurprisingly, his work has attracted increased interest in recent times.\n\nFive Steps of a Bubble\n\nDisplacement: Something new occurs which excites people and captures the imagination. This might be a mining discovery, the introduction of new technology or even a collapse in interest rates that opens up the possibility of making large investments at little cost. In the USA, the rate on federal funds rate moved from 6.5% in May, 2000, to 1% in June, 2003. And the interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell by 2.5 percentage points to historic lows. The possibility of buying a home suddenly appeared real to many who previously could not have considered it, and the ide was seductive. This displacement effect laid the foundation for the housing bubble that followed.\n\nBoom: After displacement, prices rise; slowly at first, but then more quickly as more and more participants enter the market and participation is validated by the numbers and the early success stories. The boom phase gets underway accompanied by widespread media attention and success by the early players as the \"greater fools\" to whom increasingly over-priced assets must be passed are to be found in great abundance.The predominant emotion of those rushing in is the fear of missing out on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\nEuphoria: As prices sky-rocket and fortunes are made, abstainers look foolish and conservative. New valuation methods and measures are introduced to justify the relentless price increases. We've seen the extremes reached by Poseiden and tulips. In Japan in 1989, land in Tokyo changed hands for $139,000 per square foot; $14 million for an area the size of a small bedroom.\n\nProfit Taking: This period has been described as being like riding a tiger; exciting, dangerous and living in the hope that you can get off before you're eaten. The smart money starts selling down. But no-one can know exactly when a bubble will burst, and once confidence begins to fail and euphoria gives way to fear, the collapse is usually very quick.\n\nIn the single month of October 2008, weeks after Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy and Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG almost collapsed, global equity markets lost a staggering $9.3 trillion of 22% of their combined market capitalization.\n\nCase study\n\nThe web site \"Investopaedia\" relates the story of eToys in the USA, a classic illustration of how a bubble progresses through these stages. Here's what they say.\n\n\"In May, 1999, with the internet revolution in full swing, eToys had a very successful initial public offering, where shares at $20 each escalated to $78 on their first trading day. The company was less than three years old at that point, and had grown sales to $30 million for the year ended March 31, 1999, from $0.7 million in the preceding year. Investors were very enthusiastic about the stock's prospects, with the general thinking being that most toy buyers would buy toys online rather than at retail stores such as Toys \"R\" Us. This was the displacement phase of the bubble.\n\nAs the 8.3 million shares soared in its first day of trading on the Nasdaq, giving it a market value of $6.5 billion, investors were eager to buy the stock. While eToys had posted a net loss of $28.6 million on revenues of $30 million in its most recent fiscal year, investors were expecting for the financial situation of the firm to take a turn for the best. By the time markets closed on May 20, eToys sported a price/sales valuation that was largely exceeding that of rival Toys \"R\" Us, which had a stronger balance sheet. This marked the boom / euphoria stages of the bubble. Shortly afterwards, eToys fell 9% on concern that potential sales by company insiders could drag down the stock price, following the expiry of lockup agreements that placed restrictions on insider sales. Trading volume was exceptionally heavy that day, at nine-times the three-month daily average. The day's drop brought the stock's decline from its record high of $86 to 40%, identifying this as the profit-taking phase of the bubble.\n\nBy March, 2000, eToys had tumbled 81% from its October peak to about $16 on concerns about its spending. The company was spending an extraordinary $2.27 on advertising costs for every dollar of revenue generated. Although the investors were saying that this was the new economy of the future, such a business model simply is not sustainable.\n\nIn July 2000, eToys reported its fiscal first-quarter loss widened to $59.5 million from $20.8 million a year earlier, even as sales tripled over this period to $24.9 million. It added 219,000 new customers during the quarter, but the company was not able to show bottom-line profits. By this time, with the ongoing correction in technology shares, the stock was trading around $5.\n\nTowards the end of the year, with losses continuing to mount, eToys would not meet its fiscal third-quarter sales forecast and had just four months of cash left. The stock, which had already been caught up in the panic selling of internet-related stocks since March and was trading around at slightly over $1, fell 73% to 28 cents by February, 2001. Since the company failed to retain a stable stock price of at least $1, it was delisted from the Nasdaq.\n\nA month after it had reduced its workforce by 70%, eToys let go its remaining 300 workers and was forced to declare bankruptcy. By this time, eToys had lost $493 million over the previous three years, and had $274 million in outstanding debt.\"\n\nConclusion\n\nSpeculative bubbles appear to be unavoidable in market economies, but clients should be on the lookout for the tell-tale signs of a bubble. That means not only recognising the disconnect of prices from fundamental valuations, but also looking out for the psychology of greed and wishful thinking that accompanies the typical bubble."

      "text": "Winning Forex Trading...\n\nDay Trading Forex\n\nProfit Potential\n\nWhy would anyone want to day trade? Simple. To paraphrase Bill Clinton, \"It's the money, stupid. \" If you can make money at a modest rate swing trading, why not increase the rate money is made by trading intra-day. That's the attraction. Just remember that just like any kind of trading, however, the money doesn't just flow in. There are things that you will need to watch out for.\n\nPitfalls\n\nThere are three things that people considering day trading don't seem to consider. (I know I sure didn't.)\n\n1. Uneven equity curve. You will not steadily make money. I admit I get really sick of this \"Make $500 a day!\" nonsense. There is no such thing as steady money in trading. You will make some and then lose some. The idea is to make more than you lose. When you day trade, this is all taken to a new level. You lose and you make it so much faster.\n\nAs a side note, it's normal to have a larger trading account 5% of the time. In other words, only once a month will your bankroll set a new high. Most people don't know that.\n\n2. Losing days. Having an uneven equity curve means that you will have losing days. You could have a day where you lose $1000. Yes, it happens. The sooner you accept that as a day trader, the more likely you are to succeed. (And you'll have a lot less stress.)\n\n3. Days with no trades. The market does what it wants. There are days where no good trades materialize. So, that means that the winning day trader doesn't trade. Almost nothing is harder (at least for me) that sitting in front of the screen watching the price all day and taking no trade.\n\nMyths\n\nDay trading has taken on almost mystical proportions in some people's minds. I've heard some talking about how day traders make hundreds of trades daily. No day trader I've ever met does that. Try making one hundred trades a day and the spread with financially murder you. Day traders make from zero to maybe three trades in a day.\n\nAll of the hype advertising, purports that day trading is easy. Wrong! Anyone who has tried it can tell you that. However, then many of the people who tried it, and then failed, believe that it is impossible. It's not.\n\nSteps To Success\n\n<\n\nThat begs the question, how do you do it then? Here are the steps to success as a day trader as I see it.\n\n1. Success at trading. Don't try to day trade until you've proven to yourself that you can trade successfully at a much slower pace.\n\n2. Sufficient capital. If your trading account isn't in the high five figures, you shouldn't day trade (if that's going to be your only source of income).\n\n3. A winning system. Day trading is harder than any other kind of trading that I know of. You really need to make sure your system will hold up. A system that works in a slower time frame will not necessarily work for day trading. Make sure you're system has a positive expectation."

      "text": "Equal bottom versus double bottom\n\nWhen trading the hard right edge of the screen, we'll occasionally come across what some people regard as a double bottom. I was under the impression that it's improper (or at least not technically correct) to label such things as double bottoms until they're confirmed, and I say this despite the common definitions of the term \"double bottom\" that we may happen upon when doing a quick internet search.\n\nI was under the impression that such bottoms aren't double bottoms but instead equal bottoms. In other words, the correct term to use when reading the hard right edge of the screen is \"equal bottom\"—when we see them. It's not until later after confirmation that we look back and see whether it was or wasn't a 'true' double bottom.\n\nBasically, and according to my understanding, the term \"equal bottom\" doesn't imply knowledge whereas the term \"double bottom\" does. The knowledge I'm talking about is that of price action. The price either has or hasn't touched or passed through the previous cycle high (when going long). Only the benefit of hindsight should lead us to refer to an equal bottom as a double bottom—if my understanding is correct.\n\nThere can be a series of broken equal bottoms (sometimes improperly, I believe, referred to as double bottoms) until we finally reach a genuine double bottom. After all, if a double bottom is a reversal pattern, then referring to a bunch of failed equal bottoms as double bottoms seems to me to be improper. I could be misguided on that notion.\n\nTo put it another way, when trading, we know we're looking at an equal bottom when we see it, but we can't be sure it's a double bottom until after the fact.\n\nThis may seem like semantics, but there is genuine distinction to be made and communicated with others whether we use those terms or not. I've been thinking about possible counterarguments, and I can't rightly say that my views are solidified, but I thought I'd share my understanding (or perhaps misunderstanding) with others to see if they had any views on the subject—other than simple repeated references to definitions."

      "text": "Forex Trading Strategies\n\nForex Trading Strategies\n\nIn Forex, traders try to make profit by buying or selling currency pairs based on speculations regarding where the exchange rate is heading for. While speculations come from different sources, the final idea usually results from trading style which could be determined by the following aspects:\n\nExperience and knowledge\n\nRisk tolerance\n\nProfit targets\n\nTime horizon\n\nDiscipline and personal skills\n\nHowever, there are methods and techniques to increase your chance of success. They are usually referred as strategies and the name makes sense since they are really \"strategy\" to implement a plan for achieving specific goals: to maximize the chance of taking profit and limiting loss.\n\nThese strategies are usually categorized base on the main concept behind them. For example, strategies based on \"Fundamental Analysis\" use economic news and data to determine sources of supply and demand forces while strategies based on \"Technical Indicators\" or \"Chart Patterns\" are often useful to assess the strength of those forces.\n\nIt also worth noting that for implementing a plan there is no contradiction in using different strategies from different categories. For example, you may decide to buy a currency because:\n\nIts central bank is to raise the interest rate – (fundamental strategy)\n\nbut you prefer to wait in order to buy it at a support level – (chart pattern strategy)\n\nand when the RSI is below 30 – (technical strategy)\n\nFinally, remember that all these methods are designed and developed to provide a trader with a bigger \"chance\" of success. It means that none of them grant profit. You need to test strategies yourself and determine figure out which strategies suit your trading style and personality best."

It can also be used as a trigger line. EVWMA has the specificity that it is both symbol-independent and time-frame independent.\nThis is made by introducing what is called the volume period, i.e. the simple moving average of the volume multiplied by a coefficient. EVWMA can be viewed as an approximation of the average price paid per share.\n\nEVWMA interpretation is similar to all moving averages types. When prices jump up crossing their EVWMA from below, this is a sign for an up-trend, and a buy signal is generated; when they go down crossing their EVWMA from above, this a sign for a down-trend, and a sell signal is generated.\nDivergence between the EVWMA and the prices is a strong signal for either an overbought or an oversold market which forecasts a near end of the trend.\n\nThe elastic volume weighted moving average function you can get here is named 'elastic_volume_wma', and it takes 2 parameters as arguments. The first one is the time period of the simple moving average of the volume; the second is the coefficient by which this SMA will be multiplied to get the volume period."

      "text": "Options Education\n\nWho Really Makes Money?\n\nHave you ever wondered why the percentage of people who fail at trading is so high? I have heard that 90% or more of people who dive into the trading world end up losing their money. What about average investors, do they really do that much better? Consider for a moment, the average trader or investors returns to the average Wall Street firms returns. We would probably all agree it's a lopsided equation. But, what does the average trader or investor do? The average person \"buys stock.\" What is the primary business on Wall Street? If you said \"selling stocks,\" you're correct. So, one group is buying stocks and the other is selling and the sellers are making all the money. Understand that I am not suggesting we should all stop buying stocks and start selling them. I am, however, strongly suggesting that you start thinking and acting like the average Wall Street firm (or consistently profitable trader) who is laughing all the way to the bank, typically with your money.\n\nWhy is this profit equation so out-of-balance? Why do the masses lose and the few successful traders do so well? To answer that question, you need to think about how the average trader or investor is trained and conditioned to \"buy\" into market, a stock for that matter. This includes you, me and anyone else you know. Take yourself back to grade school, high school, collage, grad school and include just about any trading book you have ever read. I remember the lessons on how to buy into a market. When it's a stock, we are taught to make sure:\n\n1. It's a good company 2. It has strong management 3. It has a healthy balance sheet 4. It has very strong earnings, especially compared to competitors 5. The stock is in an uptrend\n\nWhen all these things are present with a stock, where do you think the price of the stock is? Do you think it's ever low? It can't be by definition. When all those items are true, the price of the stock (market) is always high and typically, at price levels where the average Wall Street firm or consistently profitable market speculator is selling. People don't realize that almost everyone from a young age is taught and conditioned to do this completely backwards. I mean, think about how you profit buying and selling anything else in life. We always try and buy things when they are cheap and sell when price is high. Why is it then when people put their hard-earned money in the market, they do the exact opposite? The core reason is because of a mass illusion which is this: People think that how you buy and sell things in other parts of your life is somehow different from how you properly buy and sell in trading markets. The truth is, there is no difference! This is the single most important edge the consistently profitable trader (or Wall Street firm) has.\n\nWho Really Makes Money?\n\nFigure 1\n\nConsider the two pictures above on the left and right. Ask yourself, who really makes consistent profits? Let's start on the left. Many traders load their charts with indicators and oscillators, so many that it becomes hard to see the candles on the chart. I have also listed a few of many conventional Technical Analysis items below the chart. Now, truly ask yourself this question: Do you really know anyone who makes a consistent living with the chart or items on the left? I already know the answer to this question which is no. This is because there is a major flaw with that school of thought. Everything you see there lags price and only gives buy signals after price has moved higher which guarantees you are not going to buy low and sell high. Instead, this school of thought has you buying high and selling low which is exactly what the consistently profitable trader wants people to do. What about the picture on the right, do they make consistent profits? You bet they do. Walmart makes more money than some countries print. How do they do it? What is their big secret? They buy at wholesale prices and sell at retail prices and people line up day and night to pay the retail prices they are offering. What a great trading company! What I pride myself on in trading is acting exactly like Walmart. It may not be fun, exciting or sexy to desire being like Walmart but trust me... In trading, you want to be Walmart because like the average Wall Street firm or consistently profitable trader, they are laughing all the way to the bank.\n\nGold Trade (GC)\n\nFigure 2\n\nThere are two very important components to consistently profitable trading. First, understand that how you make money in any other part of life, buying low and selling high, is exactly how you profit when speculating in trading markets. Second, learn to identify wholesale and retail prices on a chart. Once you can do this, just buy at wholesale prices (demand levels) and sell at retail prices (supply levels). Let me walk you through a trade I took in Gold Futures to help you begin to identify the buying and selling patterns of Walmart. First, look at the level identified as Supply (shaded yellow). We call this a supply level or \"retail\" price level because price could not stay at that level and declined from that level. This happens because supply exceeds demand at that level. Below, notice the area identified as Demand (shaded yellow). We call this demand or \"wholesale\" prices because price could not stay at that level and had to rally away. This can only happen because demand exceeds supply at that price level. The distance between the demand and supply level on the chart is the \"profit margin.\" Am I analyzing this market or product any different than Walmart would? Nope... The trade I took which is shown was simply selling short at predetermined retail prices (supply) to someone who was willing to buy at that price. Then taking profits by buying back the short position at predetermined wholesale prices (demand) from someone who was more than willing to sell at wholesale prices.\n\nHow is this any different than how Walmart profits each day? What I do may be boring because I am doing the same thing every day, buying at wholesale prices and selling at retail prices, but I am not in the trading and investing world for excitement. The main idea to take from this piece is to understand that how you make money buying and selling anything is exactly how you make money in trading. There is no difference. Also, if you're thinking that I should stop writing about this concept because too many people will catch on, and then the supply / demand strategy will not work for the rest of us anymore. Have no fear... There are an endless amount of people who will always be willing to buy at retail prices and sell at wholesale prices. Everyone is taught to do this backwards from a very young age; the conditioning is so strong. If you want more comfort, just go to the bookstore and read a trading book. Almost all of them have you buying after price has already rallied. Let go of dangerous conventional thought and embrace the opportunities that come with reality-based thinking.\n\nHope this was helpful. Have a great day.\n\n-"

I was one of the first people on the floors of the Chicago exchanges to understand what it meant, and why we needed to embrace it. It's been an extremely painful process to see pits go away, friends lose ways of making a living and seeing the transition.\n\nHigh Frequency Trading (HFT) didn't exist in the beginning of the transition, but it dominates today. When the subject of \"electronic trading\" entered the lexicon of finance, no one planned for HFT. No one could envision HFT. I doubt seriously that anyone can envision where or what the next revolution of electronic trading will be.\n\nBut I do know that we can't say that HFT is bad or good. It's neither. It's just HFT.\n\nHowever, just like when 5000 individuals congregated together on a floor, there were good people and bad people. But, a few bad eggs were easy to discipline on a trading floor. There was a rule book that had solid pit rules written down, and there was an unspoken code of pit etiquette that you had to adhere too. If you tried to go counter culture to the ways of the floor, you wouldn't make it. Those few bad guys couldn't screw up the good thing on the floor.\n\nIn the HFT world, there are good guys and bad guys. The problem is, unlike the floor, a few bad guys ruin it for everyone. There is no culture of discipline or code of conduct. There are no best practices. No rules. It's the wild west.\n\nThe wild west can be good because it brings unbridled creativity. But, the wild west can be harsh because it also has guys that wear black hats. The guys with the black hats are screwing it up for the entire industry.\n\nThe competition to drive profitability is so great, that some people can't help themselves. It's so easy to program an algo to front run to steal a few pennies here and there. Do it enough, you made a billion dollars.\n\nIn the pit, we had traders that ran stops. We had traders that would simply trade, try to hit stops and go the other way. There is an old comic I can't find anymore. It's two prisoners in a jail cell and one has his hands out explaining what he was in for. The caption of the cartoon is, \"and then we ran the stops.\". In many cases, the things going on in the screen based environment bear no resemblance of an orderly market. That's where HFT breaks \"bad\".\n\nSign-Up to receive Updates from TH\n\nIt would help if you explained what a predatory algorithm is and what is wrong or unethical about it.\n\nThe biggest traders are funds, banks and other institutions with billions to throw around. Are they using predatory algorithms, or are they victims of them? If they're using them, then aren't they equally matched? And if they're victims, why don't they use their power and influence to either counteract them or get the FTC or SEC to do it? It isn't that traders are less ethical today than in the past, by your own statements, they watched each other and maintained some level of control. There needs to be some system set up that effectively does the same thing today, no doubt computer based"

It takes time to get there, moving through the jungle of wanna be traders, cheats, and several dozen of useless trading books. Before you say that trading books are worth something think again. If someone is good, really good, he or she is not interested in writing a book, period. There is much greater reward awaiting good traders and lots of free time. What do you think, what's your experience before you finally reached that level, that you no longer look elsewhere?\n\nI'd say the biggest obstacle to overcome is one's mind and ego. Once a trader takes that aside, the sky is a limit. At least based on my experience. Out of curiosity I checked zulu performance a while back and was disappointed reading messages from some of the top (pun intended) traders. I understand, many would love to know how, but majority doesn't know how, hence they become followers. Nothing wrong with this, I go o a doctor when I'm sick, but reading some of those comments, from gurus like cruise control makes me think how naive the following crowd really is, and how desperate they want to make their equity grow. If they only knew that the real key is in psychology of a trade, they would perhaps gone places in forex. Looking back in time (for me) it was 50% know how and 50% ego...lol. Now it's more like this: 1. know how = 5% (every one knows how to click a mouse and chances are 50/50) 2. trading psychology (read mass psychology) = 60% 3. money management = 30% 4. lady luck 5% 5. ego = 0% (that was actually my biggest enemy in the past :-) )\n\nAnyways, I know what I am and what I'm capable of. I was more interested in what others do to make their trading 'wishes' come true...\n\nI've got few PMs asking about systems I use and tips. It would be a repetition since I over the years on forexfactory as raczekfx. Most of it is buried in James16 chart thread. It would simple take too much of my time to repost all of it here, but there are some good bits and pieces in a mentioned thread if you care to do some digging.\n\nI would say being in the green most of the time is irrelevant. What relevant is make more than you lose. You can be in green +1000 one week and the next two -100 each, and this is how real traders work. You don't need to be right. You need to be in money.\n\nI was fortunate enough to meet someone a couple of years ago who taught me a whole lot about the currency markets. Strangely enough the % of what it takes to be a successful trader matches up pretty closely to what racscave has said"

      "text": "Notes on Switching from Steidlmayer Updating to Aspen/DTN\n\nAspen has put a fix on their website to facilitate composite contracts\n(merged pit session with a night or electronic contract). Go to the Aspen\nsite to download the fix.\n\nAs of 8/20/2002 the Steidlmayer Servers no longer distribute data\nfor Capital Flow 32 or Capital Flow 3.7. THe servers can be still used for the\ntime being to fill in history up until that date.\n\nThis page will continue to be updated\nwith information about the changeover process.\n\nSome Answers to Obvious Questions:\n\nQ: Aspen/DTN seems to be able to bring up a lot of data in\na chart but Capital Flow doesn't seem to pull it in. Why is this?\n\nA: We are working on this, it is a Capital Flow restriction\nand not related to Aspen. At some point in the next month or so (July,\n2002) we should have a version on the server that will pull in up to 2\nyears of history from Aspen.\n\nQ: Why don't some contracts like Crude Oil and Australian\nDollar update from Aspen?\n\nA: This could be due to the Alternate\nSymbol having been entered in lower case letters. DTN assumes that\nthis indicates an exchange code and attempts to interpret the rest of the\nsymbol after the initial lower case letter as the symbol on that exchange.\nUnless you are interested in Sydney, Canadian, or other exchanges, it is\nprobably better to enter Alternate Symbols in upper case.\n\nQ: Why don't I get the last two periods when updating\nfrom Aspen?\n\nA: The Aspen/DTN servers are on Eastern time, Steidlmayer\nservers are on Central time, so there is an hour time difference between\nthe two. For this reason, it is probably not good to mix updating from\nAspen and Steidlmayer on the same day.\n\nQ: I signed up for delayed quotes on some exchanges, and\nthese contracts do not update. What's up?\n\nA: Aspen/DTN uses a symbol prefixed with \"d_\" for\ndelayed data. This is the symbol that must be used by Capital Flow. See\nthe page on Aspen/DTN Symbols for more\ninformation.\n\nA: The symbols for these contracts are different in Aspen.\nSee the Aspen/DTN Symbols page for more\ninformation.\n\nA: Users who update using CQG will still be able to use\nthis option. You may have to get an enablement from our server for CQG to\nappear as a feed option. Contact our office if you have any problems.\n\nQ: Who do I contact about getting Aspen/DTN as a feed\noption?\n\nA: Jim Miclot at 312-360-0619\n\nQ: Are there differences in symbols between Steidlmayer and\nAspen?\n\nA: Most stocks will use the same symbol. There are a number\nof futures contracts that require a different symbol be used to request\ndata from Aspen.

      "text": "Investors use exchange traded options to gain exposure to a particular share's, or sector's movement for a limited period of time. Options are flexible instruments because they allow you to tailor the exact exposure and risk you wish to adopt for an anticipated move in the share price.\n\nYou can use options in isolation, or to complement your share investing.\n\nThere are a number of different reasons to trade in options. You may trade options in order to:\n\nEarn extra income\n\nYou can earn income over and above dividends by writing call options against shares you own.\n\nAs the writer of a covered call, your view would usually be for the price of the underlying shares to remain steady or fall slightly. Writing call options in this situation gives you the opportunity to generate extra returns from your share portfolio.\n\nBy writing an option you receive the option premium upfront. While you get to keep the premium, there is a possibility you may be exercised against, and have to deliver your shares to the taker at the exercise price.\n\nNote that this strategy can also be employed with your shares bought on margin.\n\nProtect the value of your shares\n\nPut options allow you to hedge against a possible fall in the value of shares you own. By buying a put option, you guarantee the sale price of your shares for the life of the option, no matter how low the share price may go.\n\nWithout using put options, in a market downturn you can only watch your shares fall in value, or sell them.\n\nYou can consider the purchase of a put option as a form of insurance against a fall in the share price.\n\nWith any increase in the price of the underlying shares, the percentage return on the purchase of a call option will be greater than on the purchase of the underlying stock. Similarly, if the price of the underlying shares falls, the percentage return on the purchase of a put option will be greater than the percentage change in value of the shares.\n\nThis is because you gain exposure to the fluctuation of the underlying share price for a smaller monetary outlay than buying the shares outright.\n\nHowever, just as leverage provides the potential to make high percentage returns, it also involves the risk of making large percentage losses.\n\nGive yourself time to decide\n\nBy taking an option, you are effectively deferring the decision to buy (call option) or sell (put option) the underlying shares.\n\nBy taking a call option you lock in the purchase price for the shares. You pay the premium, which is only a fraction of the price of the underlying shares. You then have until the expiry day to decide whether or not to exercise the option and buy the shares.\n\nLikewise, by taking a put option you lock in a selling price, and give yourself time to decide whether or not to proceed with the sale of the shares.\n\nIn both cases, the most you can lose is the premium you have paid for the option in the first place."

It has nothing to do with a rescue\"\n– Luis de Guindos, Spanish Finance Minister\n\nClassical conditioning (also Pavlovian conditioning or respondent con- ditioning) is a form of learning in which one stimulus, the conditioned stimulus or CS, comes to signal the occurrence of a second stimulus, the unconditioned stimulus or US. The US is usually a biologically significant stimulus such as food or pain that elicits a response from the start; this is called the un- conditioned response or UR. The CS usually produces no particular response at first, but after conditioning it elicits the conditioned response or CR. Classical conditioning differs from operant or instrumental conditioning, in which behavior emitted by the organism is strengthened or weakened by its conse- quences (e.g. reward or punishment).\n\nConditioning is usually done by pairing the two stimuli, as in Pavlov's classic experi- ments. Pavlov presented dogs with a ringing bell (CS) followed by food (US). The food (US) elicited salivation (UR), and after repeated bell-food pairings the bell also caused the dogs to salivate (CR).\n\nIn short, by associating the sound of a ringing bell with the appearance of food, Pavlov condi- tioned dogs to salivate merely at the sound of the bell.\n\nFor many years, this classical conditioning has been prevalent across financial markets the world over but, while its prevalence cannot be doubted, it has remained unobtrusive for one reason and one reason only—it has worked al- most flawlessly. On Wall Street, however, no suc- cessful idea was ever an orphan and so classical conditioning's fruits were passed off as those of heightened intellect amongst the great and good of the financial world.

A day trader often doesn't really have any formal training, starting off as a hobbyist and graduating to high stakes over time. Others could be technicals based traders focussing on charting or quant strategies and still others could be doing fundamentals based trading, and each of these could be either on the buy or sell sides.\n\nStart by deciding what is it that you would like to be. It is not because there are specific programs for specific jobs but because specific employers look for specific qualifications and experience. Sell side entities are likely to ask for an MBA with buy side entities typically relying on home-grown talent. Some hedge funds may look for specific quant based trading skills and experience and no hard qualifications.\n\nUnfortunately I can't advise on institutes in California but what you may want to do is to is identify your goals and then look for specific programs. Look at the background of people you want to emmulate and that should help you identify what you need for your best chances of success."

However, their concept differed greatly from other companies. They wanted to prove that learning how to trade stocks and options was a skill that could be acquired by anyone given proper instruction. Even more important, they wanted others to understand that learning how to take control of their personal finances and investments was the best way to go.\n\nFreddie and Mitzi began to teach friends and acquaintances about finances and trading in their local area.

Depending on the time your transaction is usually lately, you need to choose a date to be compatible. In selecting the basic time chart, it is also important to choose a short or longer chart.

This article will examine three common investment strategies and their typical time frame chart.\n\nStock trading beginners' day trader \"typically holds shares already five to ten minutes, or up to several days. Since the games last only a short time, day traders need to chart a short period of time. chart shows in detail how every new bar or candle will appear more frequently. Good basic graph will be 15 - or 30-minute chart. You can even go on the hourly chart, if the transactions last up to several days. See important support and resistance levels, look to 3-hour period. Select the 1, 5, or 15-minute period until its input and output. You will be able to spot a quick change of direction is easier. Swing traders have time to anywhere between a few days to several weeks. This ride is more significant share price movements. This moderate time does not need as much detail as graphs of the trade show. There should be just as concerned about Blips day in share price.\n\nDaily chart would be ideal for business and trade in shares swing beginner at all. According to the same pattern as before, the weekly chart will identify important price levels, while the 1 - or 3-hour shopping period to help adjust the time and sales business. Long-term traders, traders, or position, are usually on time several months to several years. It is usually in retirement accounts and other long-term investment strategies ... not necessarily in stock trading beginners. Table receive a much longer time, this type of investment.\n\nExcellent basic scheme should be a weekly chart. Looking for long term month period shows significant levels of support and resistance. At the other end, daily chart is sufficiently short period to assist in identification of entry points and output.\n\nAs you can see, the graph is within easy, and important, charting your own piece of knowledge. This gives a great step in your Starter opportunities to trade in shares. Choosing too short a period for a longer period of trading introduces too many details and small, slight movements on the chart may cause too much worry about potentially ending ... rash in making decisions. Similarly, the opposite is true that already in the charts for a shorter period time jobs do not show enough detail to make an informed decision.

      "text": "8 Advantages of Financial Spread Betting\n\nFinancial spread bettingcan be a very effective way to trade the stock market, avoiding commissions and complexity, and making the most of your money. Here are some advantages of spread betting over regular financial trading.\n\n1. Say goodbye to broker commissions\n\nYou don't pay commission every time you buy and sell a spread bet contract. Those costs are very meaningful for frequent traders and for people with small accounts. Commission minimums are often charged by stockbrokers making small investors having to climb a mountain before making any profits. In spread betting you will face a bid-ask spread that is inclusive of commission but it is more transparent and normally much lower than what you would pay your stockbroker.\n\n2. Say goodbye to stamp duty\n\nIf you buy UK shares you have to pay a fee of 0.5%, called stamp duty. In spread betting this stamp duty is avoided, because the trade is classified by the government as a bet and not as a trade.\n\n3. Avoid capital gains tax\n\nSimilar to not paying stamp duty, your profits are free from capital gains tax in UK and most European countries. Other derivatives, including CFDs are not free from this tax. That is one of the best arguments in favour of financial spread betting. Why pay 10 or 20% tax, if you can avoid it?\n\n4. Easy to understand\n\nThe value of a spread bet is derived from the value of the underlying asset. But unlike other financial instruments like options, that are not easy to master, a spread bet is very straightforward. You choose what you want to bet on and place a stake per point movement. Your profit is simply the difference between your buy price and sell price multiplied by the stake per point.\n\n5. Get high returns on small investments\n\nFinancial spread betting gives you a powerful weapon called leverage. You only need to pay a percentage of the cost of your trade upfront. This is known as margin trading. Let's say the margin is 10% for a specific stock. This means that you can buy £50,000 in shares with just £5,000. If the share price rises 1%, you collect a profit of £500, a 10% return on your investment. In some cases the margin is as low as 1% for more liquid assets like the main shares indices.\n\n6. Profit from falling markets\n\nYou can either go long or short and profit not only from bull markets but also from bear markets. You can short sell with stockbrokers but it is not always easy, and often limited to larger trading institutions. Spread Betting levels the playing field and allows all investors big or small to profit from bear markets.\n\n7. Trade 24 hours a day\n\nMarket trading hours usually run from 8.00 am till 4.30 pm. Not for a spread betting trader. Most companies will offer you 24h a day trading, from Sunday night until Friday night. Basically, you can continue to deal after markets are closed, which can become very handy when important news roll out after markets close.\n\n8. Easily trade many markets in one account\n\nSpread betting companies offer their clients a wide range of trading markets. You can trade shares from across the globe, including from countries like UK, US, Australia, Portugal, Germany. At the same time you can also trade currencies, commodities, indices, bonds, options, and some exotic markets not available elsewhere. This allows you to diversify your trading strategies and portfolio, giving you trading opportunities across the financial trading world."

How do i spot the troughs?\n\nNo question is not worth asking You have to remember the entire concept behind the head and shoulders pattern to understand it more clearly\n\nIt contains three parts, two shoulders and a head, lets say for instance we are in an uptrend, price is making higher highs and higher lows, and then price picks up speed and shoots straight up past the previous high, after this huge move in price buyers are becoming exhausted and sellers take hold and pull price down to form a lower low (a trough) and a lower high (a shoulder)\n\nLooking at your chart you see the first shoulder is a higher high in the trend, and the very next low after the shoulder is the trough, then we have the large move in price that forms the head, and then when sellers pull price down to make a lower low (the second trough) and a lower high (the second shoulder) we have a complete formation, you want to draw the line between the troughs from the lowest point of the candle bodies of the troughs\n\nSomething to note though is that the setup you posted was not a very good head and shoulders pattern, ideally you want the second shoulder to be lower than the first shoulder in price, by having it be higher you cant know whether or not the up trend has broken and the sellers will continue to shoot price down\n\nIt's not really a head and shoulders pattern at all, but at best head and shoulder patterns are of limited value in themselves, I'd recommend concentrating on cadlestick reading, try reading Candlestick Trading for Dummies, it's very good, gives you the best grounding you can ask for."

      "text": "CFDs: What You Need to Know Before You Begin Trading\n\nCFD trading is a popular way of making money from predicting how shares will perform over time. Here's all you need to know about 'contract for difference trading'.\n\nContracts for Difference (CFDs) provide an exciting way of benefiting from movement in the stock market without actually purchasing any shares.\n\nThis involves forming an agreement with a broker and committing to exchange the difference in value of specified shares between the opening and closing of a CFD.\n\nThe contract amount on closing, or the amount you'll earn, is dependent on the number of shares included and the rise or fall in share price.\n\nWhat makes CFDs popular?\n\nThe popularity of CFDs is based on two distinguishing characteristics. The first being that CFDs can be used to predict decreases in share value as well as share increases. The second is that CFDs are based on margin trading.\n\nPredicting shares go up or down\n\nIf an investor buys a CFD based on the prediction that the value of this stock will rise, it is known as 'going long'.\n\nHowever, unlike traditional investments in the stock market, you are able to use CFD trading to benefit from a predicted decrease in stock value. This is known as 'going short' and involves the theoretical sale of shares that you don't actually own with the hope that the stock's value will decrease and you will be able to buy them back at a reduced price, making a profit from their fall in value.\n\nThis feature makes CFDs trading a more versatile form of growing your investment, especially as it is possible to use them to hedge against the decrease in value of shares you actually own.\n\nBecause of the dynamic nature CFD trading investors often use a CFD online trading platform to manage their contracts. Some of the best CFD brokers can be found on such trading platforms, so investments are immediate and amendable.\n\nWhat is margin trading?\n\nCFDs are based on margin trading which means that unlike traditional investments, you only have to deposit a percentage of the value of the contract (usually 10%), although you must be able to demonstrate to the broker that you have the funds in place to cover the rest of the contract, should the share movement go against your prediction.\n\nAs you haven't had to put down the whole contract amount you are able to take a bolder position, potentially resulting in a far greater growth in capital compared to your initial deposit.\n\nHowever, although the benefits of your investment can be multiplied using CFD margin trading, you are also at greater risk of losing more than your initial investment if your prediction is incorrect.\n\nDue to the nature of CFD trading your capital is not secure and it is a very real possibility that you will lose more than you put into the contract, making CFD trading a high risk form of investment only suitable for experienced investors.\n\nHow can you control the risk?\n\nMechanisms such as stop loss orders can be put in place to minimise the risk of a huge loss; these act to automatically end the contract if it moves below a specified loss making position.\n\nWhile there is often a charge imposed by the broker if a stop loss order is included in the contract it could prove invaluable in protecting your money against heavy losses.\n\nFinding the best CFD broker is often a compromise between the amount of risk / potential profit that you want, and the broker's fees and interest rates.\n\nWhat charges do you pay?\n\nThere are several different charges associated with investing in CFDs – to start with you are likely to be charged an arrangement fee by your broker.\n\nSecondly, if you hold a CFD overnight you are likely to be charged interest; for this reason CFDs tend to be more suitable as a very short term investment.\n\nWhen dealing with CFD brokers UK wide, you will also be liable to pay capital gains tax on your profits, although unlike regular shares you do not have to pay stamp duty on your transactions.\n\nAs Contracts for Difference use margin trading, enable you to profit from highs and lows in the stock market and give you access to a wide range of investment opportunities, they can make for fantastic profits.\n\nHowever, they can also result in large losses so you should only ever consider entering a CFD if you have other secure financial provisions in place, have money available to fulfil the rest of the contract if the share value moves in the opposite direction to your prediction and fully understand the implications and risks associated."

      "text": "In a down or flat market, it can be tough to invest or trade. One way to\nraise cash in a slow market, without selling positions, is to sell covered\ncalls. If you are right about the overall market trend and the trend of your\nparticular stocks, you can generate a modest return while waiting for overall\nconditions to recover.\n\nSelling Covered Calls In A Slow Or Down Market\n\nSelling covered calls is another way to take advantage of a slow or down market.\n\nThe tactic is particularly useful when you already have a position in a stock\nyou intend to hold for some time (at least longer than you expect the market\ndown trend to be). Selling covered calls can take the sting out of the paper\nlosses you must endure while continuing to hold the stock.\n\nThe upside of a covered call tactic is immediate cash in your account. The\ndownside is that it ties up your position (until you close the call position)\nand a possible assignment of your option, which means you must deliver the\nstock.\n\nHowever, if you feel that the market truly is headed down for a while, and you\nare right, selling covered calls can put cash into your account immediately\n(subject to clearing) without ever having to deliver the stock to the person who\nbuys the call option.\n\nMeanwhile, you can continue to hold your stock position until the market\nrecovers.\n\nCovered Calls - Definitions\n\nA call is an option that gives the holder the right to buy 100 shares of stock\nfrom the selling of the call-option-contract at a specified \"strike\" price.\n\nThe \"strike price\" is the amount that the holder of a call option will pay if he\ndecides to exercise the option. If the strike price is $50 and the option is\nexercised, then the holder will pay $5,000 ($50 times 100 shares) to the seller\nof the option.\n\nThe \"option price\" is the amount that a single option contract costs. Option\nprices are always quoted in per-share prices, but a single option contract\nalways covers 100 shares. The total cost of purchasing an option is always the\n\"option price\" times 100 shares.\n\nAn \"in-the-money\" option is one whose strike price is lower than the currently\ntrading price of the option. The total \"option price,\" however, is usually high\nenough to prevent the option from being exercised for an immediate profit. When\nthe stock price rises high enough so that the total strike price paid plus the\ntotal option price is lower than the total market value of the shares, there is\nan incentive to exercise the option. Often, option holders will simply sell the\noption for a profit rather than exercise it. Many times, the purchaser of the\noption in this case is someone who original sold the option, with the intent to\nprevent his actual shares from being called.\n\nA \"covered call\" is a term describing a call that is sold by a person who\nalready owns enough shares of the stock in question to deliver those shares, if\nthe option is assigned.\n\n\"Assigned\" means that the person holding a call option makes the decision to\nexercise it, pay the strike price for the shares and have the stock delivered to\nhim. The \"assignment\" occurs when the exchange tells the seller that someone has\nexercised the option and the shares must be delivered. Generally, no action\nneeds to be taken by the option seller; the sales proceeds appear and the stock\nis removed from your account.\n\nNote: You should probably not try this tactic as your first experience with\noptions, however. Start with simply purchasing options. As a purchaser, you\npotential loss is always limited to the amount you spend for the option itself.\n\nChoices\n\nWhen you decide to sell a covered call option, there are several chooses you\nneed to make:\n\n-Expiration date\n-Strike price\n-Number of shares\n\nFor expiration dates, there are usually several choices of varying length. The\nlonger the expiration date, the higher the premium for the option will be, but\nthe more risk you take that the stock might be called.\n\nThere are also usually numerous choices for a strike price. In general, the\nnumber of outstanding options at any time is higher for options that are\n\"in-the-money.\" Choosing an option contract with a higher number of outstanding\ncontracts means greater liquidity. Higher volume can provide better pricing, but\nalso \"fresher\" bid/ask data (which can sometimes be a problem).\n\nFor a \"covered call\" tactic, the number of contracts you can sell is limited by\nthe total number of shares you already own. You must have at least 100 shares to\nwrite a covered call contract. You can sell any number of contracts for which\nyou own 100 shares. For example, if you own 850 shares of a stock, you can sell\nup to 8 covered call contracts.\n\nAfter you have made these choices, you are ready to actually sell the covered\ncall. All you need to know is the ticker symbol for the call option.\n\nMost brokerages provide an \"options chain\" capability for easy lookup of the\nticker symbol. Although there is a standardized convention for option ticker\nsymbols, clicking on the \"options chain\" link at your online brokerage is a lot\neasier.\n\nSelling A Covered Call\n\nWhen you decide to sell a covered call option, you place an order with your\nbroker, just as with any sales order.\n\nThe actual steps to place the order vary by brokerage; check with your broker\nfor the exact procedure.\n\nPricing\n\nAs with any sales order, you have the choice of a market or limit order.\n\nPricing is determined by a bid/ask system, just as with stocks and the same\ncautions about marker orders exist with options.\n\nThe exact price offered for any option is set by the market. The theoretical\n\"correct\" pricing involves mathematics that is beyond the scope of this article.\n\nBefore placing an order, verify the date of the most recently traded option with\nthe same strike and expiration date. Sometimes, the bid/ask data shown for a\nparticular option can be quite old for a thinly traded contract. If so, do not\nplace a market order to sell the contract.\n\nReceipt of Proceeds\n\nWhen you sell a covered call, the proceeds from the sale appear in your account\nas cash. The amount earns interest or offsets your total margin balance, just as\na sale or other check deposit would (and unlike short sale proceeds).\n\nHowever, while the option contract is open, a restriction is placed on your\nshares. In general, the underlying shares for the stock behind a covered call\ncannot be sold unless the open call contract is first closed. If the shares were\nsold prior to the option position being closed, the call would become a \"naked\"\ncall. Generally, a brokerage firm will not allow an open option contract to\nconvert from covered to naked status while the position is still open.\n\nIn addition, the value of the shares behind your open covered call position will\nnot be used to determine your overall margin capability (generally). Selling a\ncovered call lowers you margin capability (in most cases).\n\nThe Upside\n\nSelling covered calls provides you with the following benefits in a down market:\n\n-Cash proceeds, which can offset the paper losses during a down market\n-The ability to \"set your price\" for selling the underlying stock\n-The holding period for the underlying stock is unaltered by selling the calls.\n(Important if you are close to the long-term capital gains period)\n\nIf all goes well with the \"selling covered call\" strategy, the option expires\nwithout you having to ever do anything. At that point, if you still think the\nmarket is headed down, you can sell new covered calls against the very same\nshares of stock.\n\nThe \"set your price\" concept involves picking a strike price at which you would\nhappy to sell the stock. For example, if you original envisioned selling the\nstock at $50 a share, but the current price is just $42 a share, it may be\nbeneficial to sell a covered call with a strike price of $50. This is what you\nwould have sold for anyway, but by selling the covered call, you increase the\ntotal proceeds from your sale.\n\nThe Risks\n\nThe risks associated with selling covered calls are largely related to the stock\nprice rising unexpectedly and include:\n\n-Having to close your call option position by buying the option at a higher\nprice than you sold it for\n-Having to deliver your shares as a result of the call option being assigned to\nyou\n-Limiting your ability to sell the underlying shares while the option is still\nopen\n\nThe last risk is probably minimal, as the covered call tactic is primarily\ndesigned for situations where you want to continue holding a stock during a down\nmarket period.\n\nBefore embarking on any covered call sales tactic, you should determine if you\nwould be comfortable actually selling the stock if the strike price were\nreached. If not, rethink your approach.\n\nMore Information On The Selling Covered Calls Tactic\n\nFor an excellent discussion on the covered call strategy, we recommend the\nfollowing book: \"The Short Book On Options, A Conservative Strategy for the Buy\nand Hold Investor \" by Mark D. Wolfinger"

      "text": "Speculation areas\n\nSpeculators are sometimes comically pictured as speculating in pork bellies (in which a real market and real speculators exist) and often losing their shirts or making a fortune upon small market changes. Speculation exists in many such commodities but, if measured by value, the most important markets are in financial futures and other derivatives which involve leverage that can transform a small market movement into a huge gain or loss.\n\nType of speculators\n\nMost non-professional traders lose money on speculation while those that do make money tend to become professional. Occasionally some dramatic event will occur such as the effort of the Hunt brothers to corner the silver market or the currency speculations of George Soros.\n\nMany \"investors\" in the stock market are actually speculators betting on a gain in price \"buy low sell high\".\n\nIn fact, it is hard to differentiate a speculator from an investor. The degree of leverage, the length of holding, the frequency of operations might be factors. But there is a degree of speculation in every investing decision, and even in every life action that supposes to anticipate the future. Speculation is one of the essential human traits.\n\nThe economic role of speculation\n\nThe roles of speculators in a market economy are to absorb risk and to add liquidity to the marketplace by risking their own capital for the chance of monetary reward.\n\nFor example, if there were no speculators in a certain market, say in pork bellies, the only participants in that market would be the producers (pig farmers) and consumers (butchers etc). With fewer players in the market, there would be a larger spread between the current bid and ask price of pork bellies. Any new entrant in the market who wants to either buy or sell pork bellies will be forced to accept an illiquid market and market prices that have a large bid-ask spread. A speculator (e.g. a pork dealer) will exploit the difference in the spread and, in competition with other speculators, reduce the spread thus creating a more efficient market.\n\nAnother example of the value of speculators is the ability of a pig farmer to sell his pork on the futures market at a known price ahead of its production.\n\nSome perverse effects\n\nSometimes speculative purchasing can cause particular prices to rise above their \"true worth\" simply because the speculative purchasing is artificially increasing the demand. Speculative selling can also cause prices to fall below \"true value\" in a similar fashion. In some situations price rises due to speculative purchasing cause further speculative purchasing in the hope that the price will continue to rise. This creates a positive feedback loop in which prices rise dramatically above the underlying \"value\" or \"worth\" of the items. This is known as an economic bubble (or sometimes a speculative bubble). Such a period of increasing speculative purchasing is very often followed by one of speculative selling in which the price falls in a crash (see stock market crash). This is very often even more dramatic than the period of rising prices"

      "text": "CFD Trading and Orders\n\nOrders are the way in which traders interact with CFDs, and make their trading intentions known. Suppose you want to buy a CFD position in oil, on the logic that reductions in supply will lead to higher prices. This goes from being a reasoned, researched concept into an actual trading position via an order, which is the instruction to buy placed with the broker by the trader. Orders can be made to build up a sophisticated structure of automated trading decisions, in addition to playing the primary role of interaction with the markets, and allow traders extensive flexibility to establish in-depth conditions to attach to each trade.\n\nThere are a number of different order types you'll come across during your time as a CFD trader, and knowing what each of them means and does is an important step towards being able to implement them in your trading. Remember that orders represent the only tools of the trade you have in terms of interacting directly with the markets, so understanding what they do and when you should be use them becomes a crucially important consideration.\n\nBuy\n\nBuy orders are, fairly obviously, used to execute buying decisions. They are arguably the most straightforward order on offer, because buy orders simply represent a positive endorsement of the relevant market. Traders buy CFDs in order to profit from the market when it rises, with the profit portion lying in the middle of the initial buy price and the final sell price. Buy orders, which are usually filled swiftly (particularly when dealing with brokers directly, as opposed to trading on exchange), are best deployed in situations where you feel the relevant asset or market is likely to rise in value over the short-term, whether as a result of some economic indicator or other market performance factor.\n\nSell\n\nSimilarly, sell orders are broadly the same as buy orders, but on the reverse side of the deal. Sell orders can be effected as a starting point and a conclusion to a trade, with a view to closing out on the difference. With CFDs, it makes no difference whether a market is moving up or down – you can still profit from that market by ensuring you adopt their right type of exposure. So, for markets that traders anticipate are likely to fall in value over the shorter period, selling with a view to buying back at a later stage enables traders to profit in much the same way as if they had foreseen growth and bought the market when they took their exposure. This has no impact on leverage or earnings whatsoever, and is all just part of the flexible offering from CFDs.\n\nStop Loss\n\nBeyond the basics of buying and selling, which is fairly obviously conducted through buy and sell orders directly, the stop loss is arguably the next most commonly implemented order, providing traders with a crucial mechanism through which they can manage their exposure to risk. The stop loss works by setting a floor price at which a position will be automatically closed. In essence, CFD positions carry the danger of unlimited losses, and in especially volatile markets, this can make CFDs a highly risky option. However, stop loss orders can be deployed to give a guarantee of an exit point, with a view to minimising liability and capping the risk faced by the position. Stop losses can be set at points below the market price, and can be varied according to how the market moves throughout the duration of the trade.\n\nStop Limit\n\nOn the flip side, stop limits provide the reverse functionality to the stop loss – capping losses on short positions, or indeed set an automatic profit-take level on long trades. When a trader takes a short position, he needs that position to perform poorly in order to make a return. If the position performs well, it will generate a loss, in much the same way as a long trade that underperforms. And as we know, CFDs have the capacity to deliver both unlimited earnings and losses with each transaction. The stop limit sets an automatic barrier price through which your position will be closed, and is set above the market value. This enables traders to commit to a more defined risk, while also enabling automatic closing to safeguard profits in long transactions.\n\nGood Till Cancelled (GTC)\n\nAlongside execution orders such as buying, selling and stops, there are also a number of more technical orders which specify how the trade itself will be conducted. These effectively automate the trading process to a large extent, by setting defined terms such as when a position should close and in what circumstances it might be cancelled. One of the main types of order that fall into this category is the Good Till Cancelled order (GTC). GTC means that a position will remain open indefinitely until such point as the trader agrees to close out. This means positions will be automatically held over night (with finance charges accruing) until you expressly cancel the transaction, allowing for an automation of trading intention that saves time and attention. GTC orders are best deployed with positions forecast over a period of more than one trading day, to give a degree of certainty to the trade."

      "text": "Price, Range and Volume Filters filters in this next lesson are fairly straightforward, but there are a few details I want to highlight.\nIn a previous lesson I showed you the formulas for the size of the weekly and monthly range, along with the price movement for these time periods. The intraday versions of these filters work in a similar way. The 15 minute range is the difference between the high and the low for the last 15 minutes. The 5 minute price movement is the difference between the price 5 minutes ago and the current price. These are all available as dollars or percent.\nIntraday volume is similar. We look at the total volume for the last 5, 10, 15, or 30 minutes. These are always listed in percent. 200 percent means that the stock has traded twice as much as it normally does in the same time frame.\nNow let's look at some special cases. First, what happens if I'm looking at the 10 minute price change when we are in the middle of a 10 minute candle? That's simple. We don't look at 10 minute candles. We always look at one minute candles. For the 10 minute filters, we always look at the last 10 complete candles. If a candle in in progress, then we also look at that candle. So the 10 minute filters actually look at a time frame of 9 to 10 minutes.\nThese examples only show a 10 minute filter, but the rules are the same for other time frames.\nNext, what happens if there is no trading at all during one or more candles? Different software packages handle this case in different ways. For these filters we fill in the missing time periods with very simple candles. Notice that these 10 minute filters will always look back 10 minutes, regardless of how much or little the stock traded in that time.\nFinally, what do these filters show in the morning, before we have a lot of candles? If necessary, we look at pre-market data. At 9:35, the 10 minute filters will look at data from 9:25, 5 minutes before the open. These filters never look at yesterday's data. If we do not have 10 minutes worth of data, then we'll look at all the data that we do have.\nSome of our filters use other rules for these special cases. I put this group of filters all into one lesson because they all follow the same rules."

Perhaps, there is a problem with requesting data for expired constracts in the \"continuous contract\" algorithm.\n\nIf you are relying on anybody's tick data to reconstruct bars then you are fooling yourself. I have used Bloomberg, IB, and several other data providers. They all have issues.\n\nIB takes the best approach in that they provider 300 ms bars as that tends to filter the outlyer data. And if you can deal with 5 sec intervals you trade their 5 second interval bars, which reconstruct perfectly to the historical.\n\nI agree there is no \"ideal world\". In particular, in an attempt to privide higher-quality historical data many providers \"scrub\" both historical \"tick\" and \"bar\" data in addition to filtering they do in real time.\n\nThe difference is just in how often there is a discrepancy... and with IB the problem is more severe than witha few other data providers:\n\n1) IB real-time data is \"sliced\". The last trade price is sent 3 times a second or so as opposed to every tick. So, bars constructed from real time data have incorrect high and lows very often.\n\n2) IB real-time data lack time stamp. As result, beginning/end of bar depends on how long it takes the data make way from IB to the trader's computer and on the trader's computer clock. So, open and close of a bar is off on most bars during periods of higher trading activity.\n\nIB made a reasonable trade-off to make sure they can deliver data that doesn't lag during spikes of market activity without investing in infrastructure required to deliver reliably every tick. Given the price you can't really complain."

      "text": "How to Trade in Stocks Online\n\nTrading in stocks online is not like shopping at your local major retailer, where prices are set. Because investments are priced in real time through active bidding between buyers and sellers, there are techniques to buying and selling. When dealing with investments, you have five main ways to buy or sell them online:\n\nMarket orders: This is the most common type of order. You tell your broker to sell your shares at the best price or to buy shares at the current price. Because these orders are executed almost immediately and are straightforward, they typically have the lowest commissions.\n\nLimitorders: With a limit order, you tell your online broker the price you're willing to take if you're selling stocks and the price you're willing to pay if you're buying. The order will execute only if your price is reached.\n\nImagine you own 100 shares of ABC Company, which are trading for $50 a share. The stock has been on a tear, but estimate it will fall to $30. You could sell the stock outright with a market order, but you don't want to miss out on any gains in case you're wrong. A limit order would let you instruct your broker to sell the stock if it fell to $45 a share.\n\nLimit orders are filled only at the price you set. If the stock falls further than the price you set, the broker might be able to sell only some of the shares, or none, at the price you set.\n\n*Stop marketorders: Similar to limit orders stop market orders let you set a price you want to buy or sell shares at. When a stock hits the price you designated, the order converts into a market order and executes immediately.\n\nImagine that you have 100 shares of ABC Company, which are trading for $50 a share. But this time, you enter a stop market order for $45. And again, you wake up to find the stock plunged instantly to $25. This time, though, all your stock would have been sold. But, your online broker will sell the shares at whatever the price was the moment your order converted to a market order, which in this case could have been $25.\n\nStop limit orders: Stop limit orders are customizable. First, you can set the activation price. When the that price is hit, the order turns into a limit order with the limit price you've set.\n\nOkay, ABC Company is trading for $50 a share when you enter a stop limit order with an activation price of $45 and a limit price of $35. It would work like this: Again, you wake up to find that the stock plunged instantly to $25. This time, your broker would turn your order into a limit order after it fell below $45.\n\nWhen the stock fell to $35, the broker would try to fill orders at that price if possible. But Unlike with the stop market order, you would not dump the shares when they fell as low as $25.\n\nTrailing stops: Regular limit orders are either executed or they expire. Trailing stop orders get around this problem by letting you tell your broker to sell a stock if it falls by a certain number of points or a percentage.\n\nIf you're buying and selling individual stocks, trailing stops can be a good idea. Even before you buy a stock, you should have an idea of how far you'll let it fall before you cut your losses. Some investment professionals suggest never letting a stock fall more than 10 percent below the price you paid. If this sounds like a good idea to you, a trailing stop could work for you.\n\nSome brokers charge extra for limit orders, so check the commission fees before you start trading. And some brokers, such as Buyandhold.com, don't offer limit orders.\n\nWhen you enter an order for a stock, you have a few other levers you can pull, including\n\nDesignating lots: Many people buy the same stock many times. Each time you buy, that bundle of stock is called a lot. When you sell, your broker will assume you'd like to sell the lot that you've held for the longest time for recordkeeping purposes. If, for tax reasons, you'd like to sell a specific lot that's not the oldest, you can tell your broker which lot you'd like to sell.\n\nSetting time frames: You can enter an order for a stock that is active only for the day you place the trade. If it's not filled the order expires. You can also enter orders and let them stay active until you cancel them.\n\nPlacing rules: When you issue an \"all or none\" restriction on your trade, your broker must completely fill the order or not fill it at all company"

      "text": "Blog\n\nQ&A: 10-Candle Strategy and Drawdown\n\nUnderstanding how CandlePro uses the 10-Candle Strategy and how drawdown is calculated within that system is key to really seeing through the system, and seeing through the system will ultimately help you utilize the tool better in your trading.\n\nI've put together this Q&A to help everyone benefit from the answers I've given in emails and chat posts about 10-Candle Strategy and drawdown. Here goes:\n\nQuestion #1 – Hey, I think the drawdown numbers are wrong in CP! When I look at the 10 candles after a signal it went down X pips and CP lists it as Y pips. What gives?\n\nAnswer: If you think there is a discrepancy then you should email me (support@piphut.com) so I can take a look but read this first: 99/100 times CP is functioning perfectly but you need to understand how the drawdown is calculated. The drawdown is the most the pair moved against your BEFORE hitting the 10 candle profit – anything after is discarded as the purpose is to know where to put our stop-loss to hit the 10-candle profit.\n\nQuestion #2 – Why is it set up that way?\n\nAnswer: It helps to think about what we are trying to know: ON AVERAGE, how much does the pair move AGAINST (drawdown) our position before hitting the highest AVERAGE point in 10 candles (10-candle profit). If we were to take all 10 candles into consideration for the drawdown it would no longer tell us where to put our stop-loss to get to the 10-candle High, it would tell us where to put our stop-loss to get through 10 candles, regardless of what the 10-candle high is. Which isn't very useful.\n\nQuestion #3 – I'm still confused. What if it moved in your favor 30 pips first 5 candles then down 60 pips last 5 candles for a loss of 30 pips, is the candle profit 30 and drawdown 30?\n\nAnswer: In your example your 10-candle profit = +30. Your drawdown would be the most the pair moved against you BEFORE that fifth candle.\n\nLet me see if I can draw this out with letters. Here is what I know from your example above:\n\nX X X X +30 X X X X -30\n\nThose 'X's represent the current profit of the pair. Let me add some values to that:\n\n5 -10 0 20 30 X X X X -30\n\nNow the drawdown is -10, because that is the most the pair moved against your BEFORE hitting the 10 candle profit (which it hit on the 5th candle '30′).\n\nQuestion #4: What if it moved up one pip the first candle then back down to entry and stays the the rest of first candle , then down 15 for the last 9 , since the first candle was the 10 candle profit level (1 pip) with out ever going against you, would that not make the drawdown 0 instead of -15?\n\nAnswer: Yes, that would make the drawdown 0 and the 10-candle profit +1. Not a very compelling candlestick setup!\n\nQuestion #5: Doesn't this skew the stats? Meaning that if this is the case if the price moves the right way just a little (before reaching any reasonable profit target) and then moves against you dramatically, CandlePro will NOT report any negative move that happens after the correct move, even if it's within the 10 candle. However, if it's the other way around, Candle Pro will report the dramatic correct move which went the correct way within 10 candle.\n\nAnswer: This would be true if we were only looking at one signal. The power of CP is that it gives us crunches the data on up to 50 previous signals and gives us all the averages/data which means that:\n\nIf a pair does this often then the RR ratio (both median and average are provided) will be bad because 10-candle profit will be small and the trade wouldn't be taken in the first place then\n\nThis is also why I recommend looking at \"past trades\" in the videos – to confirm the pair has healthy profit levels\n\nThis is also why I recommend using a SL for all trades (and as an experienced trader I'm sure I'm preaching to choir here) – because no trade is guaranteed and if it moves against you the max you should lose is your SL. Luckily CP analyzes the past signals to give you a good starting point of where to put your SL.\n\nQuestion#6: I get it now!\n\nAnswer: That's not a question, but great! Remember CP is great in that in crunches all of that historical data for you to make your trades smarter. As stated in all the launch material, user guide, etc., CP is not a strategy in and of itself – it is first a candlestick scanner and second a candlestick analyzer and the real power lies in its crunching of historical data. That historical data (i.e. the performance report) allows you to make smarter trades based off of candlesticks.\n\nThe 10-Candle Strategy in one sentence:\n\n10-Candle Strategy tells us this: ON AVERAGE, how much does the pair move AGAINST (drawdown) our position before hitting the highest AVERAGE point in 10 candles (10-candle profit). Knowing this and understanding this helps makes better trades based off CP data.\n\nhooman majidi\n\njohnamirtharaj\n\nhi mark ,\nyour candle pro signal report is great.i and my friends want like to join ur pro member.but here no one have credit card.so please allow any other option to send the money .(now i am apply to credit card for only buy ur pro). if u accept other money transfer method it s helpful for many my country traders. ur work is very great .thanks\n\nI have tried to ask in Chatroom, anyway just incase someone can clarify here.\n\nHow come in the performance chart in any signal, the Average drawback is a positive number and the Median drawback is a negative number? I would assume all drawback would be negative number, so the average of a lot of negative numbers should still be negative?\n\nHi Racheal, your time is perfect.

The following discussion will highlight some of those aspects and demonstrate how currency traders use them to their advantage.\n\nWhat Is Forex?\nTo understand the unique, sometimes complicated, nature of currency trading, it is important to know what the foreign exchange market entails. Global currency values are constantly in a state of fluctuating valuation. That combined with high liquidity provides a market environment that is highly volatile and allows for banks, investment firms and individual traders to use those market conditions to their benefit. Currencies can be traded on the foreign exchange market twenty four hours a day, every day except for weekends. Additionally, foreign exchange derivatives such as futures and options can be traded through Forex.\n\nWho Trades Forex?\nUpon the birth of the foreign exchange market in the 1970′s, the primary traders where large, private and central banks. Throughout the years, the availability for trading currencies in the global market place has expanded to include other financial institutions such as hedge funds and corporate investment firms. As technology has advanced, the individual trader has been able to trade the currency market through the use of a Forex trading platform. By opening and funding a Forex account with a brokerage firm or bank, the individual retail investor is able to execute trades at his or her discretion and convenience.\n\nThe highly liquid, volatile nature of currency trading is appealing to many traders because trade execution can be made very quickly and can result in large profits. However, trading global currencies can be extremely risky as a loss in capital can occur very rapidly. Novice traders and those that are risk averse should avoid trading Forex. Despite the risks associated with such trading, many find the foreign exchange markets for trading currencies desirable over other types of investment vehicles such as stocks, bonds, and commodities."

If I run the indicator I get a set of values based on Close[0] (the current price) but if I remove the indicator from the chart and re-add it, the calculations are now different because presumably Close[0] is the single closing price for the bar, not the current price at each tick. Is that true and is there a way around that?\n\nYes, Close[0] represents only the last tick of a bar. It sounds like you designed your indicator to work on the change in close values within a bar that is currently forming. If this is the case, it's not really applicable to historical data. You'll only have the four data points of the bar, and not any of the price changes that were made to create the bar. To look within the bar in an historical sense would require a secondary series smaller that your primary.\n\nThis style of indicator may work best working in real time only, and using OnMarketData(). to drive it. You then can access the stream of last traded prices directly."

      "text": "Are Trading Algos Proprietary?\n\nElectronic trading had a blank slate when it was first envisioned. Many just figured that they would take their pit trading skills and transfer them to the screen. However, innovation creates more innovation. Engineers automated a lot of those old pit skills and created algorithms to automatically trade. In the pit, we always knew pit location was a big deal. Little did we know that co-location was going to be an even bigger deal in the electronic age.\n\nAs electronic trading has developed, there have been lawsuits filed when engineers have switched firms. They are being sued over the trading codes they developed. Firms are suing former employees. Part of the reason they do this is to try and keep them in line. Once you figure out a good code that works, it's pretty easy to go off on your own, raise some capital and let it rip.\n\nBut is trading code a patentable proprietary thing?\n\nWhen we were in the trading pits, nothing was patentable. If I figured out a better way to leg a spread, or put a trade on, you could follow me. You were free to copy me and try to compete. The Crush spread, the Crack spread, and any other strategy was easily copied once you figured out how to execute it.\n\nIf I backed you as a trader, taught you how to execute the strategy, and then you left and began executing it on your own I had little recourse. I might be able to beat up your reputation a little, but I couldn't stop you from trading with a lawsuit.\n\nIs there a fine line between trading code and any other code that becomes patentable and proprietary? For example, Google($GOOG) has a search engine code. It's defended by patents. There is case law that defends it. Yahoo($YHOO) sued Facebook($FB) earlier this year over patents. I intuitively understand how companies like that think they have some intellectual property that can be defended.\n\nBut I fail to see how a trading algorithm is intellectual property that can be defended in a court of law. What do you think"

With that said, if you're new to currency trading and are looking for tips on how to get started, this article will give you the very basics; hence the title Currency Trading for Dummies…\" Before we continue, it might pay to know that luck sometimes play a huge role in succeeding with currency trading.\n\nOnce you're the game, you will sometimes notice a time when you make a reasonable amount of money and other times when you almost lose completely. During the winning period it may sometime mean you are having a lucky streak, not because you have suddenly become an expert forex player.\n\nThis means you should play the game smartly and be alert at all times. Unfortunately, most people are unwilling to admit their success is due to luck. They become so convinced they have a system that works only to lose a lot of money trying to refine it later. Anyway, currency trading is a lot like stock trading and all technical and fundamental analysis is approximately the same. Some people think the currency market is more difficult to trade than stock market but that depends on individuals.\n\nHowever, with currency trading, you just have to know that currency pairs (e.g. US Dollar vs. British Pounds) always go up and down and you'll be fine. Currency Trading Brokers: Usually, currency trading requires traders to used currency trading platforms or forex brokers. These brokers don't charge commissions like stock brokers; instead they gain from spreads among the currencies and their pairs. This means you should always look for currency brokerage companies with smallest spread possible to maximise your profit.\n\nSpeaking of forex brokers with the smallest spreads, as a 'Currency Trading for Dummies' reader, one major advice you should always keep in mind is that there are forex scams flying all over the internet. Most forex websites are of questionable honesty and are designed solely to steal your money. For example you'll come across website authors who claim they make so and so amount of money online. They'll prompt you to visit their website and pay them some money in exchange for their success secret or tips. When you do, you'll end up losing."

      "text": "Investing\n\nThree-Weeks-Tight May Be Clue To Expect More Gains\n\nTighter is better. And a three-weeks-tight pattern may be a clue that your stock is about to add to its winning ways.\n\nA three-weeks-tight is just what it sounds like. The stock will trade typically in a small range for three weeks, with closing prices each Friday no more than 1.5% above or below the prior Friday's close.\n\nBut there's more to look for.\n\nFirst, the stock must be rising from a base. Maybe you're frustrated that you had missed the ideal buy point, or wishing you had bought more than you did.\n\nRemember, the three-weeks-tight is an add-on point, a spot that signifies a pause within a strong uptrend. The time to buy is when the stock moves past the highest price within the pattern.\n\nA three-weeks-tight is not a base, so when you add shares, only buy a tiny bit. You don't want the average cost of your position to rise fast.\n\nTightness in a stock's trading behavior is a telling clue that big-money institutions are comfortable holding a position in the stock.\n\nThese are the powerful forces that prevent profit-taking or weak-hand selling from doing much damage to a stock.\n\nIf the stock you're looking at has no history of big gains, a three-weeks-tight pattern probably is nothing to get excited about.\n\nPotash Corp. of Saskatchewan (POT) revealed a three-weeks-tight in 2007. In this case, Potash not only built an entry for investors but showed a longer-term improvement in its chart structure, probably reflecting the rising number of funds scrambling for this stock.\n\nPotash broke out of a 62-week base in October 2006. The base was wide and deep. No one would have blamed you for passing on it.\n\nBut the fertilizer producer went on to build a flat base in the five weeks through 20071. What better pattern can a stock construct to atone for its previous sloppy ways?\n\nNow look at the three-weeks-tight not far above the 56.39 split-adjusted buy point 2.\n\nPotash rose 9% in the week ended April 13, the first week of the three-weeks-tight. The stock then showed weekly rises of 0.4%, 0.7% and 0.1% the next three weeks. This pattern actually turned into a 4-weeks-tight, a variation on the same theme. Potash rallied past the 64.70 entry and rose 135% by December."

      "text": "Welcome back to our Ask the Expert series with Oanda's Scott Boyd and Dean Popplewell. This week's question comes from our Facebook page:\n\nOkogba Papa Woyin-Emi asked \"What are the best ways to spot trend reversal?\"\n\nGreat question, and not one that can be answered fully in a single post. So we're going to tackle this important topic in multiple phases, starting with… spotting trend reversal using Relative Strength Index:\n\nRegardless of individual trading strategies, all traders share a common goal – identifying as early as possible, potential trend reversal points. The earlier you can get in on a reversal, the greater the potential for profit. Unfortunately, it is also true that the earlier you act, the greater the chance that what you thought was a trend reversal is really just a fluctuation and once the tend resumes, you may suddenly find yourself on the wrong side of the trend!\n\nTo help avoid this scenario, there are several approaches you can take to improve your analysis of the current market trend. Generally speaking, analysis falls into one of two types – fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Fundamental analysis consists of news events such as central bank actions or the latest unemployment figures. The rule of thumb is that when news is seen as a positive sign for a country's economy, the currency tends to perform better. While the correlation between economic performance and exchange rates is helpful when defining an overall trading strategy, this approach offers little insight into potential reversal points.\n\nThis is where technical analysis comes in. Technical analysis involves the use of charts and historical prices in an attempt to determine future prices and over the years, a whole host of technical indicators have been developed. We don't have room to discuss them all here, but we'll cover a few our favorite indicators and show you how they can be incorporated into your own studies.\n\nRelative Strength Index\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) calculates the total average losses and gains for a currency pair and uses this information to determine the strength of the latest price in relation to the previous price. A numerical value is determined as part of the RSI calculation and this number is plotted on a chart segmented from 0 to 100 and placed at the bottom of a price chart as illustrated below:\n\nIf the RSI value falls in the 30 or under range in the chart, it is considered undersold suggesting that the market could soon start buying the currency pair thereby pushing the rate higher. A reading of 70 or higher on the RSI scale is considered overbought and identifies a potential opportunity to short the currency pair ahead of a falling exchange rate.\n\nIn addition to the undersold and overbought designations, traders also look for what are known as centerline cross-overs. When the RSI crosses over and above the center line (50 on the scale), the buyers are winning and upwards momentum is gaining. When the RSI crosses under and below the centerline, the sellers are gaining and the downwards trend is gaining momentum.\n\nWe'll have more on this topic soon, including how to spot trend reversal using Bollinger Bands and different price chart patterns. Have questions for Scott and Dean? Send them to us viaFacebookandTwitter. We are excited to see what you come up with, just want to point out the relative weakness of technical indicators here so that people get to understand how to use technical indicators properly.\n\nFirstly up with RSI, conditions can stay in overbought/oversold conditions for a long time and offer false buy or sell alerts. For example it can cross above the 70 line to indicate oversold and then break down the 70 line to indicate a reversal only to reverse right back up again to hit your stop loss. Even when we go out to daily charts which helps to reduce the number of false signals offered by technical indicators, this problem still persist. Just take a look at the eurusd chart from September to October for example.\n\nA good way of using technical indicators is actually by doing a mix of fundamental analysis and technical analysis. In the world of technical analysis there is a term called a confluence of signals, that is when two different indicators gives the same signal to buy or sell. However as always, technical indicators are lagging indicators, they are not what drives price action, instead it is price action that drives technical indicators.\n\nSo what I prefer to do instead is to use fundamental analysis to first determine which direction the market is likely to be moving and then using the technical indicator to determine whether it is the right time to go in or not. For example if the RSI indicates that prices are at overbought levels, and other indicators provides no strong support levels near the entry point offered by the market, then I wouldn't be buying. But with the given market condition, if I find that there are fundamental reasons to sell, I would quickly jump into it as prices are at its highs and surely there must be a form of resistance nearby to protect our stop loss tightly and thus offering a good risk to reward ratio.\n\nI hope that offers a deeper insight into the proper use of technical indicators, all the best trading to all of you :)"

      "text": "That's why expert fund manager Rishi Narang has created Inside the Black Box. In a straightforward, nontechnical style - supplemented by real-world examples and informative anecdotes - this reliable resource takes you on a detailed tour through the black box. It skillfully sheds light upon the work that \"quants\" do, lifting the veil of mystery around quantitative trading and allowing anyone interested in doing so to understand quants and their strategies.\n\nDivided into three comprehensive parts, Inside the Black Box opens with an accessible introduction to the discipline of quantitative trading and quickly moves on to demonstrate that what many call a black box is in fact transparent, intuitively sensible, and readily understandable. Along the way, it also explains how quant strategies can fit into your portfolio and why they are so important.\n\nWhether you're an institutional investor or high-networth individual, the lessons learned here will help you gain an edge in today's turbulent market. Some of the tough questions answered throughout these pages include:\n\nHow do quants capture alpha?\n\nWhat is the difference between theory-driven systems and data-mining strategies?\n\nHow do quants model risk?\n\nWhat can be learned about investing in general from quantitative trading?\n\nAnd much more.\n\nGiven both the difficulty of the market environment over the past few years and the negativity surrounding hedge funds in general and quant funds in particular, there has never been a better time to become more familiar with what quantitative trading is really about. With the help of the framework found here, you can gain a firm understanding of quant strategies, discern which are more likely to succeed, and ascertain how to use specific strategies in a portfolio, to help improve the performance of your investment process.\n\nThis tour of the insides of a quant fund is well-structured, with an almost mathematical style. Terms are well defined. There is no fake razzle-dazzle, which I appreciate. It uses examples well, to show what the parts do (alpha, risk, transaction costs, and execution modules, and various tasks such as research and testing models), and how they have worked and failed in particular instances. It is not a book of specific \"tips\" or \"strategies\" to pursue going forward, for the manager or investor. It is introductory; obviously, there are further details and more specific tools and implementations one would need to learn to bolt together a state-of-the-art quant fund. After this, I could intelligently question a fund manager about most any aspects of the operations. The narrator's voice fits the material ideally. I will definitely listen through"

      "text": "There are risks associated with electronic trading in general. Below are risks that you must be aware of with respect to NinjaTrader.\n\nOCO Handling (One Cancels Other) NinjaTrader supports multiple different connectivity providers (brokers, exchange gateways and data feeds) that each have different levels of support for advanced order handling features such as OCO orders. An OCO order is simply a group of linked orders where if one is either filled or canceled, all other orders that belong to it's OCO group is canceled. If your connectivity provider does not support OCO orders natively, NinjaTrader will simulate them on your local PC. It is important to understand how these order types behave.\n\nOCO does not imply that once one order is filled, related orders in the same OCO group are guaranteed to be canceled. It means that once an order is filled or canceled, any remaining orders in the same OCO group will try to be canceled. It is possible (in rare occasions) that order(s) that are part of the OCO group will be filled before the cancellation request has been acknowledged. As an example, let's say you have a stop loss and profit target order as part of an OCO group. The profit target is filled, the market rapidly turns around, the OCO cancellation request is submitted, the stop loss order is filled before the cancellation request is acknowledged. The narrower the spread between your OCO orders the higher the risk of getting filled on an order before it is canceled in fast moving markets.\n\nLocal PC held simulated OCO orders are dependant on order status events returning from your connectivity provider to trigger the cancellation of OCO orders. If NinjaTrader is offline (internet connection is down or PC crashed) then the simulated OCO functionality will not be operational.\n\nIn Flight Executions There are several functions within NinjaTrader that are based on the current state of your account at the moment the function is invoked. These functions are:\n\nClose Position\n\nFlatten Everything\n\nIn flight executions are orders that are partially or completely filled between the time that you invoke one of the above functions and the time your connectivity provider acknowledges the order submission/modification/cancellation requests submitted by these functions. Here is an example:\n\n1. You have an open long position for three contracts and several working stop loss and profit target orders for three contracts each\n\n2. You invoke the command \"Flatten Everything\" which proceeds to cancel all working orders and submit a market order to close the three contract position\n\n3. One of your profit target orders is filled before the cancellation request arrives at the exchange\n\n4. The market order to close the position is also filled for three contracts\n\n5. You now have an open short position for three contracts\n\nThis example is generally a rare occurrence. After invoking any of the above commands it is always prudent to check the Control Center's Positions Tab and Orders Tab to ensure that all orders were canceled and positions flattened. To avoid these situations you should be cautious of using the \"Close Position\" function when you have orders that are working within a few ticks of the inside market."

The idea is that you're gonna suck at first (very guilty of this) so once you get the hang of it they'll give you a bump in capital/position size/stop loss. Since in theory you'll be making money at this point, you should be able to reduce or eliminate your loss.\n\nIncreases in capital are completely at the discretion of the management. The compliance officer is pretty cool, and pretty reasonable so I have no complaints there, and from what I've experienced and the results of other guys the timing and rationale of capital increases are pretty fair.\n\nThey dont want to give you more size when you're just gonna increase the loss by that much more.\n\nOnly complaints I have:\n\n1. The trading platform, which is very fast and has some nice sorters but very little functionality beyond that. Of course, its possible that's why its so fast in the first place.\n\n2. Communication. I would say there are only about 40 people here in our office, and probably some remote guys too. No one really uses the chat for trade ideas, and its a fairly \"do it yourself\" atmosphere. We have the occasional guys who share ideas and I talk often to people from my training group and the guys I sit by, but communication is pretty tame. Half the guys dont even log into the company wide chatroom, so when someone points out that something big is happening many of them miss it.\n\n3. The training itself.

The training is essentially \"Here's how you use the software, here are some definitions, go trade\".

      "text": "Options Education\n\nSwing Stops\n\nAh, the ever-present question as to where a trader should place stops. We all encounter this as we are trading. Let's face it, there is a fine balance in placing a stop that allows you to minimize damage from a bad trade and a stop that is too close to the market which will get shaken out with normal volatility. So what is a trader to do? In past lessons, I have suggested some volatility stops and even using average prices.\n\nSuccessful traders follow rule-based strategies to minimize emotions. That is exactly what we teach in our courses at Online Trading Academy. This week, I will discuss a rule-based stop method that is based on using the definition of trends to determine when to exit. An uptrend is a series of higher lows usually accompanied by higher highs in price. A downtrend, in contrast, is a series of lower highs accompanied by lower lows. As traders, we are taught to trade in the direction of the prevailing trend for our selected trading time frame. Logic dictates that if that trend ends, it would be wise to exit from your trade before losses grow or profits are given back. By using the previously mentioned definitions and fully understanding trend, we can construct a strategy to place effective stops. As I mentioned, an uptrend is a series of higher lows. More specifically, higher swing lows. A swing low is a low with a higher low on either side of it. The time frame you are trading on doesn't matter; this works the same on all time frames and charts of all securities.\n\nFigure 1\n\nIt works similarly for downtrends, except that we focus on lower swing highs to maintain the trend. A swing high is a high with a lower high on either side of it.\n\nFigure 2\n\nIf you are trading to the long side, you want to see a continued series of higher swing lows. You would exit your trade at the supply level you designated for your target or if the trend ended by making a lower swing low. When I am trading, I will always place a protective stop on my trade. Once I am profitable, I need to move my stop to protect those profits in the event the trend changes before I achieve my intended target. Placing stops under the highest swing low in the trend accomplishes this.\n\nFigure 3\n\nMany of you may be saying, \"That makes sense.\" Or perhaps you are thinking, \"I already do that for my stops, but keep getting stopped out too soon.\" The key lies in knowing when to adjust your stop to the next level. Most traders adjust the stop too soon and are subject to the market volatility or a rogue market maker. You do not want to adjust your stops tighter until the trend has proceeded to make new highs. In other words, the price needs to make a higher swing low and then continue the trend upwards to establish a new high for the trend. Let's examine this at work in a stock.\n\nFigure 4\n\nThe same system can be applied to shorting opportunities. You would adjust your stop by placing it above the most recent swing high when you proceed to make fresh lows in price that drop below prior lows as seen in this chart.\n\nFigure 5\n\nNo matter what method you select for setting your stops, the important thing is that you do set them. You cannot be consistently successful in trading if you take large losses. No trader is right all of the time. The best way to prevent those large losses is to stop out of trades that are no longer going the direction you had traded. Until next time, trade safe and trade well!"

      "text": "Options Trading\n\nHistory of the options trading\n\nAn option contract is a contract between two parties where one part has a\nright and other part has an obligation to buy or sell an underlying security at\na specified price within a specified time frame.\n\nThe options have started to trade in 19th century, basically at the same time\nwhen stock started to trade. However, at that time options buyers had to find\noptions sellers through advertising in newspapers.\n\n1848 is considered an official year when options contracts started to trade in\nNorth America. During this year, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) was founded\nwith the first president Thomas Dyer.\n\nThe Kansas City Board of Trade, the Minneapolis Grain Exchange and the New York\nCotton Exchange started to trade later.\n\nBy the middle of the 20th century the options was not a very popular trading\nvehicle. The annual total trading volume was still below 300,000 options\ncontracts by 1968. It was mainly due to the low liquidity of the options.\n\nChanges came with the opening of the Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE) in\n1968. Basically it was the first U.S. options exchange and within several years\nthe daily trading volume increased from 911 options contracts (on April 26,\n1968, the fist day of trading) to more then 200,000 options contacts per day in\nthe 1970's. This increase in trading volume was mainly caused by speculators\nthat were attracted by the grooving liquidity of the options.\n\nAt that time only call options were available for investments, however on 1977\nthe put options started to trade on the CBOE by giving the ability to\nspeculators to participate not just in Bull but Bear markets as well. That was\nadditional force that started to attract more and more investors into the\noptions trading.\n\nBy 1983 the options contracts were mainly offered on stocks. The first options\non the indexes were launched in 1983. The S&P 100 (OEX) index options started to\ntrade on CBOE on March 11, 1983. The S&P 500 (SPX) index options started to\ntrade on CBOE on July 1, 1983.\n\nWith growing popularity of the options investing, the other exchanges started to\ntrade options as well. In 1985 the NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) and the NASDAQ\nStock Exchange started to trade equity options contracts.\n\nAt the current time the options trading is one of the most popular trading\nvehicles that is available on the market. High liquidity, great leverage, no\nmargin requirements (except for uncovered options trading), wide range of the\noptions on equities, indexes, futures and currencies attract more and more\nspeculators. The development of the hi-tech has brought options trading to a new\nlevel. Now, real-time options quotes, options news, charts and indicators can be\ndelivered directly to the trader's desk and are available not just for\ninstitutional professional investors, but for retail traders as well.

      "text": "Understanding and Using Pivot Points in Option Trading\n\nPivot points have been around since Charles Dow first began trading, and invented Point and Figure charting in the late 1800's.\n\nPivots are nothing more than points when the prices begin changing direction, and are leading indicators.\n\nFor traders that view simple bar charts it's very simple.\n\nUsing the OHLC (Open/High/Low/Close) bar charts simply \"read\"…if the OHLC bars have \"lower lows\" it's a pivot low, and conversely if the OHLC bars before and after a bar have lows below the low of the bar, it begins a \"pivot high\".\n\nIndex Options, the QQQQ, emini's and the OEX are all best and simply viewed, however, using Dow's simple point and figure charting. The following chart is how we \"see\" the market each day.\n\nFrom this we calculate the defined pivot point, and very specific support and resistance lines for that DAY. This is how one can learn to day trade options.\n\nPivots help define short-term trends. Trends are made up of simple up and down movements in the market (swings). Within the up and down movement are the typical market actions….reaction (bear) and rally (bull).\n\nAt OEX Options we look for the pivot point for a single day first to help identify the short-term directional bias. If the market moves up and above the pivot point we've established and reported…it's likely the market will move up. If the market moves down below that same pivot point it's likely the market will move down.\n\nWe watch the overall movement in the first hour of trading to define this simple rule of thumb.\n\nPivots are also key to our recommendations for Floyd's Folly, our credit spread, stock and option service. Here we identify more of what a downtrend is.\n\nFor example, if the price of a stock is going UP but closes near the low of the day….a reversal is in the offing. The reversal may be greater if the closing price is lower than the prior day close.\n\nSome reversals take place after a \"three day movement\" directionally if a stock or option moves up or down consecutively. At OEX Options we teach what to watch for with movements like this."

      "text": "Are You Trading In A Dungeon?\n\nby Dr. Al Larson, PhD,\nCTA, RSA\n\nAre you spending your trading day sitting in\nfront of a computer? Under fluorescent lights? Or in front of several computers?\nIf you are, there is a high probability that you feel totally exhausted\nat the end of the day. If you experience this, you have \"Brain Drain.\"\n\nin an open, sunny field and traded, they would\nbe experiencing trading the way God intended it. Something happens when\npeople sit in front of one or several computers and/or under fluorescent\nlights. The human body in its natural state thrives on an electrical upward\nflowing positive vortex. This enhances life and facilitates proper biocircuit\nfunctions. But computer screens and fluorescent lights both generate a downward\nflowing negative vortex. The effect of this vortex is to restrict the positive\nupward flow of energy through a trader. This adds to the stress of mental\nand physical activity. So when one sits in front of a computer(s) and/or\nunder fluorescent lights, it is much harder to focus, think clearly, and\nstay positive.\n\nBrain Drain is due to the effect of electric fields on a person's biochemistry.\nA widely overlooked fact is that the human body must live and operate\nin the earth's electric field. When we walk on the ground, our feet are\non the negative end of a battery. The positive end of that battery is\nan ionized layer in our atmosphere called the ionosphere. The ionosphere\nis a charged layer of ions which has a voltage of approximately 300 million\nvolts. That voltage causes a current to flow between the earth's surface\nand the ionosphere. Human beings live in that current. As explained in\ndetail in my book, Your Electric Life, this current affects much of what\nwe do.\n\nIs there a fix? Fortunately, the answer is yes. For centuries,\nFeng Shui practitioners and Dutch doctors have used small copper coils to\nneutralize these negative energy vortexes. I package these coils on small\nprinted circuit board. Four of these \"Energy Traps\" can be attached to the\ncorners of a monitor. Doing so not only neutralizes the negative energy\nvortex of a monitor, but actually converts it into a positive energy vortex.\nSo the monitor then aids mental activity and good trading. Similarly, six\nof these devices placed on the plastic grill under a 2 tube 40W bulb fluorescent\nlight fixture will convert the negative energy vortex coming from those\ncommon office light fixtures to a positive one.\n\nIn particular, it affects our thinking and our mental energy.\nWhen you stand on the surface of the earth, the electric field voltage at\nthe top of your head is approximately 250 volts. That results in a current\nflowing through your body of approximately 250,000 nanoamperes. Biological\ncircuits work on currents as low as one nanoampere. So when there are surges\nin the current between the earth and the ionosphere, we sense them with\nour biocircuits.\n\nIn addition to the Energy Traps, a trader can wear a special\nheadband that will reduce their susceptibility to surges in the external\nelectric fields, and increase their ability to focus. These headbands consist\nof a properly oriented flexible magnetic strip. They provide an electromagnetic\nshield around the brain much as the magnetic field protects the earth. The\neffect of wearing this headband is to reduce fatigue, increase focus, and\nperform better mentally. These and other products are available on my website\nat \n\nThese surges result in the 40 percent of market activity which is labeled\nemotional. These emotions are not internally generated, but are induced\nby external energy flow. If traders stood"

      "text": "Derivatives: A derivative is an instrument whose value is derived from the value of one or more basic variables called bases (underlying asset, index, or reference rate) in a contractual manner. The underlying asset can be equity, commodity, forex or any other asset. The major financial derivative products are Forwards, Futures, Options and Swaps. We will start with the concept of a Forward contract and then move on to understand Future and Option contracts.\n\nForward Contracts: A forward contract is an agreement to buy or sell an asset on a specified date for a specified price. The main features of this definition are\n\nThere is an agreement\n\nAgreement is to buy or sell the underlying asset\n\nThe transaction takes place on a predetermined future date\n\nThe price at which the transaction will take place is also predetermined\n\nLet us illustrate it with an example. Suppose an IT company exports its services to US and hence earns its revenue in Dollars. If it knows it would receive a payment of $1 million in six months' time, it cannot be sure as to what would be the Rupee value of this $1 million after six months. Assuming that the current rate is Rs 43/$, the value as per current rate would be Rs 43 million. Now suppose the actual forex rate after six months is Rs 37/$ and hence the company receives Rs 37 million which is less by almost 14% that the current value. In the reverse scenario of rupee depreciating vis-à-vis the dollar, a rate of Rs 45/$ would lead to a gain of Rs 2 million. Hence, the company is exposed to currency risk. To hedge this risk, the company may sell dollar forward i.e. it may enter into an agreement to sell $1 mn after 6 months at a rate of Rs 43/$. Note that it satisfies all the conditions of a forward contract.\n\nOne pre-requisite of a forward contract is that there should be another party which is willing to take a reverse position. For example, in the above case we may sell dollars forward only if someone is willing to buy it after six months. An importer who purchases goods and hence makes payment in dollars might need to hedge his currency risk by being the other side of this contract.\n\nFuture Contracts: A future contract is effectively a forward contract which is standardized in nature and is exchange traded. Future contracts remove the lacunas of forward contracts as they are not exposed to counterparty risk and are also much more liquid. The standardization of the contract is with respect to\n\nQuality of underlying\n\nQuantity of underlying\n\nTerm of the contract\n\nLet us understand it with the help of an illustration of a Reliance Future contract. What does the statement - \"I have bought 1 lot (250 shares) of Reliance July Future @ Rs 700\" mean in theory? It means that the person has agreed to buy 250 shares of Reliance Industries on 26th July 2012 (the expiration date) at Rs 700 per share. Here,\n\nThe underlying is the shares of Reliance Industries\n\nThe quantity is 1 lot, i.e. 250 shares\n\nThe expiry date is 26th July 2012 (last Thursday of July), and\n\nThe pre-determined price is Rs 700 (and is called the Strike Price)\n\nIf the actual price of Reliance is Rs 800 on the settlement day (26th July), the person buys 250 shares at the contracted price of Rs 700 and may sell it at the prevailing market price of Rs 800 thereby gaining Rs 100 per share (Rs 25,000 in total). On the other hand if the price falls to 650 he loses Rs 50 per share (Rs 12,500 in total) as he has to buy at Rs 700 but the prevailing market price is Rs 650."

Stocks and options traders alike experienced from a ton of bull and bear traps set on its extended way down. Issues obtained worse when the market lapse into an extended neutral pattern because October 2008, building it unattainable to revenue from directional trades using stocks or possibilities.\n\nUnderneath these current market issue, with volatility combined with uncertainty of route, is there any way to make income at all? Thankfully, there is and the remedy is located in what is identified as Delta Neutral options buying and selling.\n\nWhat does delta neutral buying and selling do? It is simply designing an choices position which will make money no make any difference if the stock goes up or down and improve in price as volatility in the current market rises even if the stock remained stagnant. Yes, basically building money 3 techniques, up, down or stagnant!\n\nSo whats the catch? Certainly, there are only 2 scenarios exactly where a delta neutral place loses cash. 1, when the stock continues to be reasonably stagnant whilst volatility drops. When volatility drops, extrinsic price of alternatives get depressed as the chance of large moves decreases, therefore decreasing the price of the alternatives in the situation even if the stock did not transfer. Two, the stock did not move adequate to cross the breakeven stage of the place. Sure, all buying and selling positions have break even details which must be exceeded in advance of cash can be created.\n\nEven with these restrictions, delta neutral trading continues to offer the greatest probability of gain beneath ailments of volatility and severe uncertainty.\n\nSo, what just is a delta neutral situation? Incredibly only, delta neutral positions are choices based positions which have a delta worth of zero or almost zero but with constructive gamma. These a position will increase delta in the path of the eventual movements of the stock and results in a profit possibly way, up or down.\n\nThere are many approaches to make a delta neutral situation and the ideal way to take total gain of increases in volatility is by getting contact and put selections in these kinds of a proportion as to have their delta price cancel each and every other out. One more way of putting on a delta neutral place but with a milder volatility impact is by buying stock and then adequate place options to cancel out the delta price of the stock.\n\nIn reality, delta neutral buying and selling can also be utilized to safeguard your stock positions in this uncertain market. For example, you purchased a stock that has profited for a couple of days but the degree of uncertainty in the current market is developing up and you want to not only protect your revenue but also proceed to profit no make a difference in which that stock might move on up coming. All you have to do then is to change your stock position into a delta neutral place by buying enough place selections to cancel out the delta worth of the stock will do.\n\nAs you can see by now, delta neutral investing does offer you amounts of flexibility and a wider chance of profit in this unsure and volatile market and you can find out a lot more by going to http// ."

What techniques or features of StockCharts.com help you set them accurately? The Parabolic SAR is a guide, but standard parameters yield a rather loose initial stop point.\n\nTrading experts like Alexander Elder or Seykota advocate the use of stops. Others, like the Motley Fools, follow Buffet's approach and do not use them. I am in Elder's camp, but see my exposure to another flash crash or to sharpies hunting for my stop in less liquid positions.\n\nIf you do not use stops, what StockCharts features do you use to help protect you from severe draw downs?\n\nOne of the benefits of technical analysis is that you can find logical places to set your stops rather than trying to use a P/E ratio that looks better and better as the stock fails. Fundamental analysis does not offer logical stop setting.\n\nOne of the main ideas behind setting stops is to protect capital, to let your winners run. You can also use mental stops, but most technicians agree that the stop is one of the primary benefits of technical analysis.\n\nLets say you are trading the Tom Demark 11-day breakout. A stock is making new 2-week Highs. When you enter the trade, the best time to enter is as the trade starts to move. It is also a time when the trade falls apart. In this example, the trade fell apart almost instantly 4 times in a row. See the black lines for the setting of the stop at the 22-DMA (one-month moving average).\n\nYou can look on the chart and pick the same as your entry price, or the 20-dma, or a lower Bollinger Band (or anything else) as your stop. The difference between the buy price and the sell price is your risk on the trade. I have picked a chart in a downtrend to illustrate how the stops at the 22-dma would avoid serious losses. This chart also shows how sensitive the breakout location is to failure."

Some futures are quoted as dollars and 32c of a dollar. This will also define the minimum price movements, the tick, in this case $1/32.\n\nLimit up/down - It has to be specified the limit of the price of the futures contract, when trading would stop. This is to prevent speculation.\n\nPosition limits - The maximum number of contracts that the agent is allowed to hold has to be regulated. These include the total number of contracts that can be held and the maximum number of contracts expiring in any particular month. This also prevents speculation in the market"

This increases the probability of making a highly successful trade.\n\nInvestopedia explains 'Confirmation On A Chart'\n\nFor example, a trader who witnesses a short-term moving average cross above a longer-term moving average would predict that the upward momentum over the coming weeks is likely to increase. Before this trader decides to place an order for the security he or she may want to look to other indicators as confirmation of the initial prediction.

Or rather, in relation to not pyramiding.\n\n\"Ah yes, but at double the initial risk for not double the profit\"\n\nThe point I was making is that going into a position all gung-ho with a double initial position size may well generate more profit compared with pyramiding into the position gradually, but it won't give you double the profit for the double initial risk you are taking! Let me demonstrate using the following chart for Enterprise Inns:\n\nX marks the spot at which I established an initial £1-per-point position on this real-life trade, at a price of 29p-per-share on 28 December 2011. X also marks the spot at which I established a second £1-per-point position, at a price of 51p-per-share on 3 March 2012.\n\nWith the price sitting at 69p-per-share at the end of the chart, my accumulated 'paper' profit was £40 on the first position and £18 on the second (pyramided) position giving a total of £58 profit across the combined positions.\n\nIf I had established a more meaningful double £2-per-point position at the outset, I would have been sitting on a higher paper profit of £80 by the end of the chart, which is an almost 40% higher profit. But here's the thing:\n\nA double position size at the outset would have incurred double the risk; i.e. £58 initial risk in the double-position-size case vs. £29 initial risk in the gradual pyramiding case.\n\nSo the question is: do you think that a reward of £70 for an initial risk of £58 (ratio 1.2:1) is better than a reward of £58 for an initial risk of £29 (ratio 2:1)? Me neither, and that's why I'm a big fan of introducing risk gradually through pyramiding. And the golden rule is to never establish a second (pyramided) position until the new risk is more-than-covered by the trailed stop order on the first position.\n\nIn conclusion, my Enterprise Inns* example is what led me to write the following sentence in my new (under construction) book's manuscript\n\n'Ah yes, but at double the initial risk for not double the profit.'\n\nWant to read more of my views on stop orders and pyramiding?

      "text": "Below you will find a brief description of each of these financial asset classes.\n\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate (Forex) Pairs\n\nI start with this one because (a.) it's the most prevalent asset for which binary options are purchased since the forex markets are typically open 24 hours a day 5 days a week and (b.) it's also the easiest for people without a background in finance to understand with regards to binary options trading.\n\nMost binary options brokers offer the \"major\" forex pairs as underlying assets in their binary options. The major foreign currencies means the following: the US Dollar, European Union Euro, Great Britain's Pound, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen and the New Zealand Dollar and their various pairs: the Euro/Dollar (EUR/USD), Pound/Dollar (GBP/USD), Dollar/Yen (USD/JPY), Dollar/Swiss Franc (USD/CHF), etc.\n\nSome option brokers may also offer \"rarer\" forex pairs in their binary options such as the Turkish Lira and the Chinese Yuan.\n\nWhen purchasing a binary option on a forex pair, a trader is essentially predicting whether one currency will increase or decrease in value vis-a-vis another currency in a currency pair. So, if Trader A takes an UP (Call) position on a EUR/USD binary option that pays 75% and expires in one hour's time, Trader A is basically saying \"I believe the Euro will increase in value vis-a-vis the dollar in one hour's time.\"\n\nLikewise, if Trader A were to take the DOWN (Put) position on that same binary option, he would be saying \"I believe the Euro will decrease in value vis-a-vis the Dollar in one hour's time.\"\n\nThe vast majority of forex binary options are available for purchase from midnight on Monday to midnight on Friday in the countries from which the currency is issued.\n\nCommodities\n\nCommodities refers to natural resources such as oil, gold, and silver that are bought and sold in the global commodities market.\n\nMost option brokers offer binary options on oil, gold and silver and some also offer binary options on more commodities such as copper, platinum, wheat, sugar and coffee.\n\nWhen a trader purchases an UP (Call) binary option on a commodity such as gold with an expiry time 30 minutes in the future, it means that he or she believes that the current value of gold will increase in the next 30 minutes.\n\nShares of Stock\n\nEvery day, an untold number of shares of stocks changes hands throughout dozens of stock exchanges around the world. This movement causes the value of individual shares of stock to fluctuate. In an effort to allow traders to capitalize on these fluctuations, option brokers offer binary options on a variety of stocks throughout several different worldwide stock exchanges.\n\nThe most common stock shares offered as underlying assets for binary options are the stock of large hi-tech companies like Google, Microsoft, Intel and Apple as well as large multinational corporations such as Coca-Cola, Nike, McDonalds and Citigroup in the US and Rolls Royce, HSBC Holdings and Barclays in the UK.\n\nThe idea is that option brokers aim to offer binary options for the stock of companies with a prominent profile so that traders are able to use publicly available news and information to make informed decisions on binary options for the companies' stock.\n\nAs you might have guessed, a trader who takes a DOWN (Put) position on a Google stock binary option that expires in 3 hours and pays 80% is indicating that he or she believes that a share of Google stock will decrease in value by the end of the next 3 hours.\n\nStock Indices\n\nJust as one can purchase a binary option on the value of one share of Google stock, for example, one can also purchase a binary option on the overall average of a specific stock exchange.\n\nAdditional smaller indices are typically also available as underlying assets in binary options.\n\nBinary options for stock indices are only available for purchase during the hours that the stock index is open for trading which varies widely depending on the country and time zone.\n\nA trader who invests $1000 in an UP (Call) binary option on the Nasdaq that pays out 81% and expires in 2 hours is indicating that he or she believes that the average of the Nasdaq stock index will increase by the end of the two hour period.\n\nConclusion\n\nBinary options are offered on the value of stocks, forex pairs and commodities and the global stock index averages.\n\nIt's important to fully understand how binary options function with regards to each asset class. However, once one fully understands how they work, binary options can be a great way to diversify an investor's portfolio by investing in a short-term binary option alongside a longer more traditional investment in one of these assets.\n\nGD Star Rating loading...\n\nGD Star Rating loading...\n\nBinary Option Underlying Financial Assets, 5.0 out of 5 based on 1 rating"

Is this difference inherient to the various data providers? Is there settings on my Ninja Trader that need to be addressed. It is difficult to develope stratigies and collaborate with my Brother in law when such large discrepencies show up in the data.\n\nReal-time data from both of these data providers is typically quite accurate, but different data sources will produce different charts, especially when using tick based intervals vs time based intervals.\n\nMarket it is highly likely that two traders using NinjaTrader on different data feeds will have minor differences when plotting the same market and time interval.\n\nThat said, real-time data from a single source should match provided that the two PC's use the same settings."

      "text": "As part of the development for my S&P500 Volatility Timing Model, I test several data sets and build several tweaked models. What I'm interested in in is finding the \"outliers\", also known as the financial asteroids. These represent great opportunities for me because I usually buy either mutual funds, ETF's, or stocks in our 401k when they happen.\nIn the case of the May 10, 2007 selloff, we were hit by a small financial meteor. Take a look at the posted pic, you'll can see a green dot which is \"out there\" from the regular cluster of data points. That was the financial meteor, the outlier! However, based on my model it was a small buying opportunity, nothing to get overly excited about.\n[tags]Finance, Quantitative, YALE, AI, NeuralNets, Trading, Volatility, Timing[/tags]\n\nToday I wanted to share with you a part of the algorithmic back end to my ETF Trend System. Note, I said \"part\", I'm not giving away all my secrets. It's written completely in Excel, incredibly simple, and is a macro that you can import. The system works by using something called linear regression slope.\nWhat's that?\nThe easiest way to understand what linear regression slope is, is to think back to your basic statistics class. Linear regression is the \"best fit\" line between a bunch of data points. A line is defined by the formula: y = mx+b, where y is your data point's position on the y-axis, m is the slope, x is your data point's position on the x-axis, and b is the slope intercept. What this ETF Trend following system does is place a \"best fit\" line across several price data points (8, 13, and 26 weeks) and then calculate the slope of the line. If the slope is positive, you have an upward trending ETF. Conversely, if the slope is negative then you have a downward tending slope.\nAs the ETF trades in the markets, the price goes up, down, and sometimes consolidates inside a trend. When that happens the linear regression slope begins to \"flatten\" out, meaning the slope becomes more horizontal. When combined with two or more periods, like an 8, 13, and 26 week period, you can see the overall short-term, medium-term, and long-term trends in a particular ETF. This makes for a great indicator that warns you of either a change in trend or a dip buying opportunity.\nReady to try it out for yourself? Just follow these easy steps and you'll be ETF Trend following in no time. First you have to make sure you have Excel 2003 or a later version installed and access to ETF data.\nStep 1: Get two years of ETF data. You'll need your favorite ETF and two years of weekly closing data. Make sure you include the date, open, high, low, and closing prices. You can cheat, and follow along with my example by downloading this XLS: GSPC ETF Trend Example\nIn the example contained in this lesson, I use the S&P500 weekly data but you can substitute that with any ETF or index you'd like to follow\nStep 2: Copy the macro code below and paste it into your Excel Visual Basic Editor. You can find this editor by going to Tools > Macros > Visual Basic Editor.\n\nStep 3: Save the file and then activate the macro by clicking Run. You should see that the macro created four new columns and color coded the slopes. It should look something like this XLS: GSPC ETF Trend Example 2Step 4: This step is optional but I highly recommend you do this. You should build a chart from that 8, 13, and 26 week slopes. This will help you identify the peaks and valleys in the ETF's (or index's) trend. See our last XLS example: GSPC ETF Trend Example 3\nThere you have it! A very simple and fun way for you to build a basic ETF trend system. Please feel free to modify the macro, or add to it as you see fit. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact me.\n\nThis is week two of my positions still being trapped near the all time highs in the EURUSD. I had to lighten my load last week and close two more positions after the EURUSD's plunge triggered two buy orders. I try not to have more than 4 open positions in one currency at a time and all of them remain in negative territory. Right now my average price for my position is $1.35682 and the currency pair is trading at $1.35350.\nYou might be wondering, why go against all trading wisdom and hold a loser. I wonder that myself but I trust my neural net models. They tell me to continue to be long. Why trust my neural net models? Good question! I trust my models because they've been right time and time again based on two observational methods: back-testing and real time observation. I'd agree with you 100% if you argued that back-testing isn't as good as forward-testing, but my models are built on older data, correlated to a very high degree, and seem to be working well in the real-time environment.\nTime will tell if the model is right. :)\n[tags]Quantitative, Finance, NeuralNets, Euro, USD, Currency, FOREX, Trading[/tags]\n\nI fixed my Yen model and its showing the corrected trend signals. Goes to show you, one small toggle or incorrect label designation in your prediction model and your signals are wrong. Good thing I only had a few million at stake! :) It's wise to always question your results. :)\n\nI'm busy working on my S&P500 Volatility Model tonight and I'm slowly inching toward a better correlation. Despite my headway, it still needs a lot of work to be statistically significant. Right now its close to 75% correlated but I still haven't figured out how I want to rank the volatility events.\nI did create a nice image of how the data looks after its modeled. The x-axis is the rate of price change in the S&500 closing price and the y-axis is the volatility event (1 being severe and 0 being safe). If you squint at the image you can see a possible \"U\" shape outline, which means that this model could be explained by a second order function (parabola).\nThe next image, a chart from my Excel spreadsheet, shows the parabolic function of the modeled data.\nWell, back to work!\n[tags]S&P500, Volatility, Models, NeuralNet, Timing, Quantitative, Finance[/tags]\n\nI worked in my vegetable garden for most of the weekend and with every weed I plucked, the words \"Ethanol\" and \"bio-fuel\" kept popping in my head. I know that everywhere I turn, I see and hear about how Ethanol is going to save us from oil dependence and global warming.\nDespite my skepticism about Ethanol, I am curious to know what set of this new trend in the Agriculture index? Exactly what happened at the end of 2001? Was it demand from China? Or a sudden fascination with Cocoa? Inquiring minds want to know!\n\nI've been following the China iShares, FXI, for a long time now and I noticed that Maoxian posted about it nearing its all time high. This reminded me of the time when the talk was that FXI might be overextended or possibly reaching a top. At the time, it sure looked that way. I even posted on my old site saying that the trend might be over but the more I thought about it, the more I wondered if my initial call was wrong.\nSomething didn't seem right to me so I built a classification model to analyze FXI's trend. I was surprised when the model remained long throughout the selloff. You can see the charts I posted on January 31, 2007 and April 6, 2007 on my old site. I even reiterated FXI's UP trend on one of my first blog entries here.\nAs of today, the trend still remains UP.\n[tags]FXI, China, Investing, Trading, Timing, NeuralNet, Classification[/tags]\n\nWhen I was first introduced to data mining and modeling, I felt like I had found the goose that laid the golden egg. I thought, erroneously, that I could create a predictive model that would be able to tell me what the closing price would be for a specific asset. I successfully modeled the S&P500 Spiders (SPY) and was able to predict the daily closing price within a 3% price range. I soon learned that this only worked well when the market was trending in a one direction. If the market turned on a dime, as it usually does, the model would fall apart.\nSo I scratched that pipe dream and focused on identifying macro trends instead.\nHaving successfully modeled currency, stock, and future trends, I decided to start fooling around with market timing. I'm a firm believer that market timing is critical to financial success and here's why. When I was in MBA school, I had written an independent research paper about Hedge Funds and the various trading strategies they use. One strategy I discovered was a volatility based strategy that would invest money during times of extreme market volatility. I analyzed three fictional portfolios to see if the volatility based strategy was superior to a buy and hold, and dollar cost averaging strategy.\nI used the $VIX as my volatility indicator and assumed each investor would buy into the S&P500. The results shocked me! I don't remember the exact percentages anymore (I'll try to dig out the paper and post it) but a buy and hold investor would get a 14% return (not bad), a dollar cost averaging investor would get a 20% return (even better), and a volatility based investor would return over 100% over the same time period. Damn!\nThen I read \"The (Mis)Behavior of Markets\" and realized that its easier, and smarter, to model volatility instead of prices. If I were able to forecast and determine the magnitude of volatility for a future event, I would be ready to take profits or buy in. Now that would be truly profitable!\nSo I began working on a S&P500 Volatility Timing Model, which is in testing phase right now. Its not perfect and it has few bugs in it (only 66% correlated) but here's a snapshot of volatility vs. the S&P500 over the last three months. See anything that could make you money? Note: 1 is very volatile and anything below 0 is low volatility.\nHave a good weekend all!\n[tags]SP500, Markets, Timing, Volatility, NeuralNet, Forecasting, Investing[/tags]\n\nPeople do dumb things at the heights of trends, like issuing the homebuilders ETF XHB.\nShortly after its debut, XHB began to sell off as the negative sentiment snapped the RE buying trend. As I mentioned yesterday, sentiment and fundamentals affect trend and in turn the trend affects sentiment and fundamentals.\nI believe the pain for XHB and real estate isn't over but I wouldn't be a buyer here. Some people with their limit orders at $29 might just get XHB at the price they want, if they wait a bit longer.\n[tags]Trends, XHB, RealEstate, Bubble, Crash, ETF[/tags]\n\nI'm still trapped in my EURUSD positions as this currency bounces around $1.3528, my average position is at $1.3609. My models still show an UP trend in the Euro and a DOWN trend in the USD so I'll have to sit tight and wait it out.\n[tags]NeuralNet, Currency, FOREX, Trading, Euro, Dollar[/tags]\n\nSeveral years ago, when I was living in New Mexico, I had a girlfriend who used read very esoteric books about cutting edge theories on biology, evolution, and astronomy. We were talking about \"what-if\" scenarios one day and the conversation drifted to some called \"punctuated equilibrium.\" It was explained to me, at the time, that species evolve slowly in an environment that's in equilibrium. A sudden leap in a species evolutionary development happens when a catastrophic internal or external event occurs. The example she used was the asteroid wiping out the dinosaurs theory. The dinosaurs lived and evolved in a relatively state of equilibrium until an asteroid killed them suddenly and allowed mammals to evolve rapidly.\nWikipedia defines it as:\n\nPunctuated equilibrium (also called punctuated equilibria) is a theory in evolutionary biology, which states that most sexually reproducing species will show little change for most of their geological history. When phenotypic evolution occurs, it is localized in rare events of branching speciation (called cladogenesis), and occurs relatively quickly compared to the species' full and stable duration on earth. [via wikipedia]\n\nI understand that some of these theories have changed over the years but its premise stayed with me for years. Can the upset of punctuated equilibrium (PE) or something similar explain the sudden emergence or death of trends?\nAlthough we like to believe in market equilibrium (PE?) and slow evolution of prices when new fundamentals occur, I'm a firm believer that the markets themselves are not always seeking equilibrium. Sentiment and fundamentals drive a trend and then the trend in turn drives the sentiment and fundamentals of that market. Trends become reinforcing and suck more and more capital into them until they crash. Then the crash becomes self reinforcing as the sentiment and fundamentals change and a new trend emerges downward. Where's the equilibrium in that?\nWhat truly interests me in trend following is the moment a financial asteroid hits the trend. What are the events or sudden changes in the financial environment that will allow some trends to die and cause others to evolve? Was it single event or several smaller events together that killed a trend or caused financial havoc? The first example that comes to mind was the Russian domestic debt default in the late 90's that led to Long Term Capital Management (LTCM)'s sudden demise.\nI know I don't have all the answers, all I have is an interesting brain tease, and an interesting biological theory that I'm trying to superimpose on existing trends, hoping to uncover future financial asteroids.\n\nIn my old blog, Digital Breakfast, I posted a few times about my desire to build an Automated Trading System (ATS) using Excel. I figured I'd build it in Excel since I know that software the best and conveniently enough, Interactive Brokers offers an API for Excel. Today, I located my old real time ETF Trend Signal system, which is based on statistical performance measures to generate trend signals, and decided to begin additional back end development on it.\nI want to explore some ideas I learned over the past few days from C++ Trader and Christian about option neutral trading and even asset mispricings (arbitrage). The more I think about it, what I really want to do is to build an algorithmic trading system first and then an automated trading system. So step one, build an ATS and then step two, build an ATS. :)\n[tags]ATS, Algorithms, Trading, System, Excel, Trends, Quantitative, Finance[/tags]\n\nThe Spiders have been on a nice trend upward, thanks to a lot of money chasing too few good assets. One day, when the liquidity dries up, I expect the party to come to an end. In the meantime, I'll ride the wave up and make some money. :)\n\nWelcome back! In this lesson we will set our preferences to make sure everything loads in correctly before we create the model. By now, you should've read and built the experiment framework, as described in Lesson III. If you haven't, then what I'll post here might not make a lot of sense.\nWe'll cover 4 items in this lesson:\n\nData Loading Preferences\n\nModel Writing Preferences\n\nPerformance Preferences\n\nRun the experiment\n\nData Loading Preferences\nBefore you run the experiment for the first time, you have tell it where to find your data. If you click on the ExcelExampleSource operator, you'll see the following preferences and toggle box.\nI highlighted the important preferences with red dots in the above image so to avoid confusion. First select your data spreadsheet (Gold Final Input.xls) from your file folders, click on the \"first_row_as_names\", enter the number 9 into the label_column field, and enter the number 1 into the id_column field.\nIt's important that you get this step right. What you are doing is telling the experiment where your output variable is located and what your reference id is. The label_column field is the Excel column number of your output variable and the id_column field should be your date column number. Remember this because you'll have to fill these fields in for your other experiments.\nNext, you should create a breakpoint in the experiment which is nothing more than a pause in the experiment's run. We're doing this because we want the experiment to pause right after its loaded in the data. Why do we do this? By creating a breakpoint at this point in the experiment, you can inspect the loaded in data and make sure the experiment is reading in your output variable correctly.\n\nTip: You can skip this step but I highly advise that you don't. You can create breakpoints at any step in the experiment if you choose but its more valuable during the data loading stage.\n\nModel Saving Preferences\nScroll down to the ModelWriter operator and click on it. You'll see only one field that will allow you select the path location to save your model. Click on it > select your data directory > type \"gold_final.mod\" and hit enter. Done!\nPerformance Preferences\nNow we reach the final step, the setting of the performance preferences. Scroll down to the Performance Evaluator operator and click on it. You should see several fields available with check boxes. Scroll down and check the absolute error, relative error, correlation, square correlation, accuracy, and classification error boxes. Make sure the field with the pull down menu is set at correlation. Refer to the image below for the setup.\nYou're done now. Let's run the experiment!\nRun the Experiment\nThis is the best part, all your hard work is about to pay off! Find the \"play\" button and click it!\nThe experiment should load your data in flash and then reach the breakpoint we discussed about. The experiment will automatically switch to the results screen which should look like this:\nThis is where the fun in data analysis begins! This results screen (only if you used the breakpoint) will tell you what the model sees as your output variable (label column). If its not GC Trend, then press the stop button and go back to the ExcelExampleSource operator and check your preferences.\nTake a moment and click on the \"plot view\" option. Here you can create scatter plots, self organizing maps, or historgrams to your heart's content. Take a moment and create a scatter plot, choose whatever you want for the X, Y, and Point Colors. YALE should automatically create a plot for you with several dots. These dots are from your id_column preference, in this case the date.\nRemember we added in the data visualization operator? Doing this allows us to click on anyone of those scatter points and find out more about that data point. Adding this operator lets you determine that data composition of outliers and or specific information about a data point of your choosing.\nWhen you're all done, you'll have to resume the experiment. Click on the resume button.\nNow the experiment will create the model and determine its performance. This step could take a few minutes, depending on the size of your data. While you're waiting, take a moment to subscribe to my RSS feed (shameless plug).\nWhen the experiment finishes you should see the information in the results tab be replaced with the following screen:\nI'm not going to discuss the importance of the statistical measures here but I will tell you that in building a classification model, like this, a high correlation is good. The correlation can be positive or negative and the closer it is to 1 (or -1) the better.\nCongratulations! You've finished your first YALE experiment and build your first model! In Lesson V, I will show you how to build a prediction experiment and we'll finally predict some current trends for Gold.\nAs always, if you have any questions regarding this lesson or the topics covered so far, please leave a comment or email me.\n\nI wanted to take a moment to recognize C++ Trader and Blogger Jacks, two quant/programming related blogs, I've stumbled across in the last few days. I like them so much, I added them to my blogroll. They post topics range from algorithmic trading systems to modeling for market inefficiencies. I feel so inspired by their blogs that I want become a member of their quant club, if they let me in. I promise to bring my own pocket protector and chips.\n\nC++ Trader went to so far and gave Neural Market Trends a shout out about my YALE Tutorial, which made me realize I haven't posted Lesson IV (I promise to post it tonight).We exchanged comments and plan on exchanging ideas in the future to hopefully find each others mistakes. :)\n\nThere's something to be said about buying winners. Winners continue to win, and in the case of stocks, they keep making new highs. I know that AAPL is a favorite holding of Howard and his hedge fund's strategy of finding and investing select stocks making new 52 week all time highs is a smart. The trick is to buy the right company making a the high.\nIt's safe to say that Apple is the right company, its emerged as an innovative powerhouse once again. Steve Jobs and company sure have been busy, first the iPod (and iTunes), a new generation of desktop computers running on Intel chips, and now the iPhone (out soon). People are loving it and buying like crazy.\nAPPL made another 52 week high yesterday.\nGood company + Good Products + Strong trends = Strong Price Appreciation.\n[tags]Apple, AAPL, Trends, Stocks, Trading, Investing[/tags]\n\nI'm pretty sure a short-term top is in for EURUSD and I'm trapped up there. :) I have four positions open at an average price of $1.36132 and with EURUSD trading around $1.35764, I have a long way to go before I see profits again. Still my neural trend models say to remain long so and I will be adding to this position on severe drips (around $1.3500 and then $1.34700).\nIts too early to tell if the Australian Dollar's trend is resuming or if its still consolidating, either way the trend model retains an UP signal for this currency. I don't regret selling my two AUDUSD positions but I'm mad that I didn't wait for the mini rally yesterday. Lesson learned, I should always trust my trend model and buy on dips, not on new highs.\nI have to re-examine my Yen model because it gives me a lot of UP signals in a continuing downward trend. I find it awfully suspect but then again the market forces could be there to make the Yen pop. A stronger Yen will surely rein in the carry trade and help reduce the global liquidity glut. That will in turn firm up our mortgage interest rates push more sub-prime borrowers into bankruptcy or foreclosure.\nOh what a tangled web we weave, when first we practise to deceive! - Sir Walter Scott\n[tags]Currency, NeuralNet, Models, AI, Forex, Trading, Euro, Dollar, Australian[/tags]\n\nToday was a USEC day for me. First I saw it profiled on WallStrip and then it showed up on Google Finance's top % gainers list. It sure looks like a healthy trending stock as it rises from the lower left corner of the chart to that magical upper right hand corner.\nIt doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that the world needs more energy everyday and with all the fervor about fossil feuls and greenhouse gases, nuclear could be a viable option. The only drawback to nuclear energy is that pesky radioactive waste. So the question you have to ask yourself, do you want to glow or sizzle?\n[tags]USU, Nuclear, Energy, Trend, Stocks, Investing, Trading[/tags]\n\nGood Morning! Here are the latest currency trends from my model. You'll notice that today's signals are the same as last week. A note of caution, I do find the Yen signal a bit suspect because the chart shows a further price decline but on the other hand the model could be warning us of an impending trend change.\n\nI was curious to see what the blog posting trends were for these three assets and some other topics of interest.\nIt seems like all three are on a steady upward trend, that's probably because oil and gold are rising in price and all the real estate bloggers are posting \"I told you so.\"\nBritney spiked in late Feb, probably because of her head shaving event, Angelina is cruising along. I'm still waiting for Mr. Ugly to spike. Maybe if he shaved his head and adopted a second cat his ratings might increase. :)\n\nI heard this first on Bloomberg Radio and then found the article. It's about the ever increasing use of data mining and AI in the financial markets.\n\nIn his cubicle overlooking the trading floor, Kearns, 44, consults with Lehman Brothers traders as Ph.D.s tap away at secret software. The programs they're writing are designed to sift through billions of trades and spot subtle patterns in world markets.\nKearns, a computer scientist who has a doctorate from Harvard University, says the code is part of a dream he's been chasing for more than two decades: to imbue computers with artificial intelligence, or AI.\n\nThat's precisely the strength of an AI model, the ability to find and learn subtle patterns and help you find an emerging (or ending) trend.\n\nFinancial service companies have already begun to deploy basic machine-learning programs, Kearns says. Such programs typically work in reverse to solve problems and learn from mistakes.\n\nLike every move a player makes in a game of chess, every trade changes the potential outcome, Kearns says. Machine-learning algorithms are designed to examine possible scenarios at every point along the way, from beginning to middle to end, and figure out the best choice at each moment. [By Jason Kelly]\n\nThis week was a true test of my new currency trading plan and neural net models. My models have remained long the Euro and short the Dollar despite the strengthening in the USD. Unfortunately I had to sell three positions this week, two at 1% loss each and one as a scratch. I completely closed my AUDUSD position because the price action makes me think that the trend could be stalling. I say this because the economic reports coming from Australia are indicating a slowing inflation rate. Lower inflation usually means no further rate hikes and no further currency appreciation. I guess I could wait for my neural net model to catch up but sometimes you have to trade what you see and read.\nNext, I lightened up my load in EURUSD by selling one position at another 1% loss but entered another position right afterthe Non-farm Payroll report came out. So far my aggregate EURUSD position remains a net negative as we head into the weekend.\nGood thing I'm working in my garden this weekend!\n[Tags]Euro, Currency, Trading, Positions, Dollar[/tags]\n\nNoble Engineering popped up on my fundamental screen last week and I've been watching it since then. Using Yahoo's stock screener, I created a special scan that only looks for key drivers of stock appreciation. Can you guess how I figured out these key drivers?\nI bought NE for my wife's account yesterday, so it better do damn good or I'm in trouble! :)\n[tags]DataMining, NeuralNet, NE, Drilling, Oil, Fundamental[/tags]\n\nGoogle has been on fire since its IPO a few years back. I was suffering from post Nasdaq bubble syndrome and thought, \"no way is GOOG going $400!\" Boy was I wrong!\nWhat can I say? Google is the new Microsoft.\n\nGood Morning! I had to lighten my load yesterday and sell one position in AUDUSD. It was down about 1% and I decided take a loss. Since then, both pairs (EURUSD and AUDUSD) have been languishing at there intraweek lows. I think currency traders are awaiting the Non Farm Payrolls out tomorrow to decide whether to buy or sell the USD. The EUR and AUD have no where to go but up if yesterday's ADP report was a hint, but I'll have to wait till tomorrow and continue to nurture my remaining 5 positions.\n[tags]Currencies, Euro, Dollar, Forex[/tags]\n\nCould the trend party in IYR be over? Maybe.\nA lot of information can be gleaned from observing a price chart, mostly technical information. A lot of traders/investors forget that fundamental and sentiment information also drives prices up or down.\n[tags]IYR, RealEstate, ETF, Trend[/tags]\n\nSometimes trends have intra-trend reversals (which are great selling or buying opportunities) and then quickly resume their trends. Motorola tried to break free from their down trend, and almost succeeded with the introduction of their wildly popular Razr phone (I have one). With no new innovative product followup, MOT resumed its downward trend.\nI wonder if Icahn can really help?\n[tags]Motorola, MOT, Stocks, Trends, Charts[/tags]\n\nGood Morning! There was further sell off in the EURUSD and AUDUSD pair last night as the USD gained strength. It's just follow through from the better than expected ISM report yesterday. I believe these market machinations will be short lived and expect the pairs to reverse and head back up in short order.\nIn the meantime, I'm holding 6 positions in these pairs (4 in EURUSD and 2 in AUDUSD). Right now I'm down 48 and 18 pips respectively, with my largest single loss at 75 pips in the EURUSD pair.\nIt's times like these I must remain true to my trading plan and stick it out. I ran my neural nets this morning and they still indicate UP trends for the EUR and AUD, so I'll have to be patient. The worse case scenario is that I slowly scale out of losing positions. :)\n[tags]Currencies, Forex, Euro, Dollar, Trading, Wealth[/tags]"

      "text": "Making appropriate order to brokers (2)\n\nLimit order: A limit order is directly the opposite of a market order. As the name implies, limit order imposes price limitation on the sell or buy order. It means that the stockbroker cannot buy above the price limit or sell below the price limit a, although as agent of the investor, who must also seek to protect the interest of his principal, he can obtain better price for his client's transaction. In addition to specifying the benchmark price for transaction, the investor must specify the volume and other details as in the case of market order.\n\nOpen order: This is a sell or buy mandate that remains binding until the actualisation of the mandate or further instruction cancelling such order. Open order is usually used by strategic investors to hunt for and accumulate value stocks, so the broker is on the lookout for such supply.\n\nDay order: This is a buy or sell mandate that is specific to a particular trading day, it takes effect and expires on the same day. For instance, an investor that envisaged that the share of a company would be remarkably underpriced on the day its share price would be marked down for cash or scrip dividend can enter a day order targeting the immediate period after the markdown before the share price regains its intensity.\n\nOpening price order: This is an order instructing the broker to buy or sell specified volume of a stock at the opening price for the trading day. Technically, the opening price for a new trading session is usually the closing price of the previous trading session.\n\nClosing price order: The opposite mandate to opening price order, this mandate targets the closing price for a stock.\n\nTime or future order: Like futures, time or future order is a buy or sell mandate that will become effective at a specified time or period in the future. It may have additional features of other types of order such as price restriction.\n\nContingency order: This type of order is used frequently by highly active portfolio managers, who have lists of alternative stocks to fit into a bearish or bullish market condition. The contingency order instructs a broker to sell a particular stock and buy another stock or conversely to buy a particular stock and sell another one; when the trading prices reached certain levels. For instance, a contingency order for an oil and gas portfolio investor can read thus: sell 100,000 shares of Oando if the price reaches N17 and buy Conoil shares if the price reaches N25. The attainment of the price difference is mandatory to the execution of this order. Because it involves replacing a stock with another, contingency order is also known as switch order.\n\nFull or none order: This is a type of mandate that instructs a broker to buy or sell a stock (or some stocks) in its entirety or otherwise, not to sell at all. This order goes against piecemeal purchase or sale of stock.\n\nAlternative order: Alternative order is a situation whereby an investor directs a broker to act on either of two or more alternatives. Investors with multiple options of stocks or securities but with limited funds or investors with diverse buy and sell needs can give alternative orders to their brokers to ensure that in whatever way the market situation turns in a particular trading day, they achieve part of their portfolio objectives.\n\nFor instance, an investor can mandate a broker to buy 10,000 shares of Unilever Nigeria or 9,000 shares of UAC of Nigeria. Where the alternatives are more than two and there is element of preference, the investor can structure his mandate according to scale of preference. This implies that the absence of option one leads to option two and in that descending order.\n\nBut where there is no indication of any element of preference, the broker will act on any of the alternatives on first attempt basis.\n\nStop-limit order: This is a buy or sell mandate that comes into effect when the share price of a stock reaches the limit price or within the daily range of the stop price. It's also known as stop loss order or by its shorter form, stop order. This type of order is commonly used by fund managers, who have clearly spelt out exit and entry prices for stocks and a constant rebalancing strategy to meet changing market situation.\n\nScale order: One of the more technical limit orders usually used by active fund managers, scale order sets out the total amount of a stock to be bought or sold alongside the price scale detailing what amount to be bought or sold at specified price variations.\n\nTechnical investors with adept knowledge of cost averaging strategy usually use scale order to achieve identified benchmark cost for a portfolio, especially in a tight turbulent market situation.\n\nPercentage order: This is a buy or sell mandate that comes into effect when a certain number of shares in that stock have traded. Percentage order can be used as a cautionary order by a strategic core investor to protect his shareholding or ward off potential takeover.\n\nFor instance, an investor can give a standing percentage order to his broker to buy a stated amount of a stock when at least two percent of the stock's outstanding shares have been traded and vice versa.\n\nIt should be noted that a particular order may have characteristics of two or more types of order, for instance a scale order with opening or closing price order.\n\nAlso, each type of order has its won advantages and disadvantages, an investor needs to be certain the order meets his investment objective and represents the best way forward to the attainment of his portfolio target."

      "text": "There are several forex trading strategies that can bring you profits. However, what works in a trending market may not work in a sideways market (and vice versa).\n\nHere are six general strategies for placing trades in different forex trading situations. You may have seen some of these ideas in previous blog posts, but this will be a nice summary of forex trading rules to print and keep by your forex trading desk.\n\nRemember to combine the general information listed here with the more detailed, case-specific information you've learned throughout this blog.\n\nStrategy #1: This forex trading strategy works well in both sideways markets and trending markets. To trade the first trading strategy, follow these steps:\n\nPlace limit exit orders for each lot at different pip increments (e.g. place your first exit order to exit one lot at 40 pips away from entry; place your second exit order to exit one lot at 60 pips away from entry; place your third exit order to exit one lot at 100 pips away from entry; place your fourth exit order to exit one lot at 150 pips away from entry; place your fifth exit order to exit one lot at 200 pips away from entry).\n\nStrategy #6: This forex trading strategy also works well in trending markets and poorly in sideways markets. To trade the sixth forex trading strategy, follow these steps:\n\nEnter with multiple lots (5 or 10, for example).\n\nPlace your stop loss order at the last level of support if you are a bull (you are buying) or the last level of resistance if you are a bear (you are selling).\n\nPlace limit exit orders for each lot at different pip increments, just as you would in the fifth trading strategy, except this time don't set a limit exit for the last lot (the fifth lot, in this case). Instead, allow your trade to take advantage of potentially huge moves. As you follow the market with your fifth lot, continue canceling previous stop loss orders and replacing them at new highs or lows, to lock in your profit.\n\nNow you have 6 different forex trading strategies for different market situations. Mastering a few of these could become your bread and butter as a forex trader. The rapid forex blog will continue to teach you more forex trading strategies, but knowing these will add valuable tools to your forex trading toolbox!"

      "text": "Index futures as a risk-management tool\n\nB. Venkatesh\n\nIS INDEX futures a risk-management tool for fund managers?\n\nIf the question seems innane, let me assure you it is not. The question actually sparked a discussion I had with a leading fund manager some time back. The fund manager's contention was that index futures is not a risk-management tool. In this article, I lay down the arguments set forth by the fund manager and the reasons why I do not quite agree with them.\n\nBut, first, how can funds perceivably use index futures? Suppose Fund `X', an equity fund, has a large proportion of its exposure in Hindustan Lever (HLL) and Infosys.\n\nFurther, suppose the fund manager feels that HLL may fall in the near-term but also thinks the stock holds good long-term potential. He, thus, has two options to protect the near-term downside in the net asset value (NAV). One, sell HLL and buy the stock at a lower price but that involves large transaction costs. Two, short index futures.\n\nHow does shorting index futures help? We know that HLL is a heavyweight in the index. This means the cash index will go down if HLL falls. And index futures typically moves in the same direction as the cash index. Shorting index futures will, thus, help the fund manager protect the downside if the HLL stock price falls. How?\n\nAs index futures falls with HLL, the fund manager can close the futures contract at a lower price and profit from the deal. The profit from futures contract may offset the loss suffered by the equity portfolio, provided the fund manager uses an optimal hedge. Now, the fund manager posed the following question: How different is index futures from any stock?\n\nWhat he asked was essentially this: In the above example, would it make any difference if a fund manager shorts, say, Satyam Computer, instead of index futures?\n\nOf course, at present, mutual funds cannot short sell. But even if SEBI lifts the ban some time soon, such a strategy may not be very effective. This is because the stock to be short-sold has to have a strong correlation with the stock whose downside is to be protected. In the above example, this means Satyam has to move in the same direction as HLL.\n\nBut what if the fund manager shorts HLL itself? Actually, what the fund manager will do is technically called ``shorting the box''. This refers to shorting a stock with an intent of buying it back later and all the time holding the stock itself. In this case, the fund manager holds HLL which he does not want to sell, because of its long-term growth potential. Yet, he wants to protect the fund's NAV from a likely fall in the near-term. He, therefore, shorts HLL hoping to buy it back at a later date. In case the price goes up, the fund manager can deliver the stock from the portfolio. Otherwise, he can cover the short-position at a lower price. This is similar to covered call write in the options market. But there is a problem with this strategy.\n\nWhat if the fund manager expects a couple of stocks to fall in the near-term? It could mean shorting all these stocks to hedge the risk. And that could prove costly as shorting stocks requires maintaining large margins on the trading account with the broker.\n\nNow, shorting index futures in such cases is more effective. As its underlying base is a basket of stocks, index futures can be used as a hedge for a wide range of stocks. Besides, as contracts are marked-to-mark on a daily basis, the counterparty default-risk is lower in the case of futures than with stocks.\n\nThe discussion then shifted to whether fund managers needed to hedge at all in the first place. The fund manager felt that funds had no necessity to hedge as they did not a run a risk. The rationale? You run a risk only when there is a likelihood of not being able to meet a target return. Now, equity funds do not assure returns to unit-holders. So, what risk does a fund run? If anything, he argued, it was the unit-holder who needed to hedge his/her risk.\n\nThis is an acceptable line of thought. But why should that prevent fund managers from trading in futures? Will the unit-holders not benefit if the fund manager were to trade in index futures?\n\nConsider this. The unit-holders tend to get nervous when their fund's NAV falls. Fund managers can protect NAVs from falling in the near-term by suitably hedging their portfolio through index futures. Besides, outperformance also helps mutual funds attract more money. Research conducted on investor psychology by several behavioral scientists also buttress this point.\n\nGoetzmann and Peles, for instance, conducted a study on mutual fund flows. They found that money moves fast into mutual funds that perform well, than out of funds that perform badly. The study terms this behaviour cognitive dissonance.\n\nSimply put, this refers to the mental conflict that investors experience when their beliefs and expectations go wrong. The unit-holders in the mutual funds that lose money are, therefore, unable to confront their bad investment and, hence, do not sell the fund. By the same logic, investors prefer to invest in funds that are doing well. In the event a fund's performance turns bad, they easily explain the losses because everyone else has also bought the fund.\n\nHow is cognitive dissonance related to fund managers using index futures? If a fund manager uses index futures to protect the near-term downside, the fund's performance may be better than its competitors. And the better performance may attract higher inflows.\n\nOf course, I did not quote this study to the fund manager during our discussion. But when I mentioned that index futures can help the fund protect short-term losses, he was quick to point out that unit-holders may not take kindly if the fund manager's view were to go wrong.\n\nFor instance, what if a fund manager shorts index futures and the market actually moves up instead of going down? The fund's NAV will suffer because the profit made in HLL (as per the above example) will be lost on covering the index futures at a higher price.\n\nI think the concern voiced by the fund manager is a bit over done. Do unit-holders question the fund manager on why, say, DSQ Software is part of the equity fund's portfolio? Or, do they question the fund manager why he did not sell Infosys when the stock was about Rs 10,000? They do not because they are aware the fund manager is better informed on the market. In other words, the unit-holders are willing to play with the fund manager's view. So, why should it be any different with index futures?\n\nIn all, fund managers can use index futures as a risk-management tool to protect their near-term downside. Of course, the basic premise of index futures as a risk-management tool is that the stocks the fund manager wants to hedge have a strong correlation with the index. Otherwise, the fund will run a basis risk. Besides, the fund manager needs to get prior approval from unit-holders to trade in such instruments."

      "text": "I don't know if any characteristic of this massive 6 month rally has been more apparent than the huge futures run-ups we've seen at random points during the trading day. Without news, the S&P 500 futures get gunned on huge volume and surge higher. I've seen it at least every other day for 6 months. It tends to occur on low volume days such as the one we're currently experiencing. As you can see in the chart below, the futures are getting gunned on massive volume without any coinciding volume in SPY. This means an institution is jamming the futures higher knowing that they can drive the market higher on no volume. Effectively, they can take out every asking price with a large enough order and immediately create a 0.25% bump in the market in no time. If you've been wondering why we've seen huge surges on low volume days and conviction high volume selling on down days this explains much of it. I don't know if there is malfeasance behind this or if the buyer is simply too stupid to input trades at the bid (like most rational investors do as they try to achieve the best low price), but this is certainly an odd phenomenon that I cannot recall occurring so routinely over the course of my career. Who is the mystery institutional buyer that just needs to place their huge block orders with such urgency?\n\nDo you have the tools to look for the same things (either the volume observations or the futures) in other countries' stock markets? For it to be malfeasance despite global markets all doing about the same upward march, it seems either it would have to happen everywhere or other markets would have to consistently take all their directional cues from the US.\n\nother markets would have to consistently take all their directional cues from the US.\n\nthere could be policy coordination, as the same global banks operate on many exchanges and all are recipients of extensive government largesse. but truthfully i doubt that's what's needed. there's plenty of global arbitrageurs who would, on a jump in the US, buy the closed exchanges and sell the US, conveying the futures jump to overseas on no volume at all. i don't think there really needs to be much or any buying of the actual stocks to effect changes in global stock prices if you control the US futures. the price is just an idea, and a persistent lifting bid in the futures can change that idea.\n\nThe bears cannot \"punish\" the action because it is the Federal Reserve doing it, operating through the medium of programmed trading software at Goldman Sachs and other market making firms. A bear would need the total taxing power of the United States government to punish the action. It will only end when the excess dollars, created by the market pumping, flow so heavily into the currency market, that no one wants to buy treasury bonds denominated in a falling dollar anymore.\n\nWhy should this be the PPT? Why cant this be a macro fund trying to get the SPX over 1100. Many shorts have stops there. If we break 1100 we will get a 2-3% move higher. Well worth the capital for the macro guys to risk some capital.\n\nMaybe ETFs are influencing prices of stocks to rise well beyond what's rational. I also note that stocks trade in a remarkably similar pattern to stocks in their sector (another ETF effect?). Take for example NEM and FCX. While I realize they're both materials stocks/mining giants isn't it a little odd that their charts are almost identical? It's as if there really isn't any point to trading one company over another, when the result will be roughly identical. In this case look at the XME. If you can chart today's action and overlay FCX NEM XME you will see the pattern match perfectly. The other freaky thing to me is there are ALWAYS dip buyers. Every daily chart looks like a U, with a tailoff at the end (usually), when traders dump shares. Look at the XME, XLE, XLB, XLF for today. Always the U. This dip buying is keeping the market suspended and creeping higher, because there hasn't been a penalty for buying the dip since the late June/July sell off. Until this gets slammed hard (which will only happen because of policy change, which I believe is very unlikely) I can see the SPX creeping higher and higher every month until there's complete exhaustion and the over-valuation is so absurd that it feels like the pets.com era.\n\nGo see Minyanville.com, last Thursday, \"Mr. Practical's\" article called \"Strange Days\". He belives that in the fine print, under TARP, the primary dealers are allowed to REPO common stock, every night, to the FED. They are driving up the market during the day, taking a \"riskless profit\" each evening. This process is \"reflating\". The Fed likes this, it is a devious way of printing money. Very interesting, same as this article.\n\nand a couple more comment… JTodd is right, they (the FED) only cares about driving the market up, not making money (it's another way of printing). Also, nobody can see the FED balance sheet, to verify what they are holding.\n\nDoesn't look like a long hedge. These are billion dollar orders getting filled in less than a matter of minutes. Look at the orders. The ask prices aren't being raised. They're being knocked out. Look at the orders.\n\nMany are marveled at the boom in stocks, given really rotten fundamentals. Of course, so far it's been a function of a lower dollar and there's a way to \"reflate\" with those printed dollars that normal conduits won't allow.\n\nWhat if the government/Fed realized the most efficient way right now to \"print\" dollars and \"reflate\" the economy was to get stock prices up? What better way to do that than print dollars to buy stocks?\n\nThere's ancillary evidence that stocks are acting \"artificial\". Stocks aren't only climbing a wall of worry , they're scaling the Mt. Everest of bad fundamentals. Tick data is extreme, especially when the stock market is down. We constantly see 1000+ tick prints when stocks are down; this is very strange indeed. Volumes are down at least 20% from normal levels (and much more if you discount for high-frequency trading), making it easier to get stocks up.\n\nUnder TARP, the fine print allows dealers to REPO stocks to the Fed as collateral (holy cow is right).\n\nWhat if there were an arrangement where large dealers buy stocks and stock futures through the day and REPO them to the Fed at the high closing prices? The dealer would book the profits derived from the difference at no risk.\n\nIf you look at the trading patterns of the largest dealers, one in particular lost money trading in only one day last quarter. Statistically that's like finding a needle at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nOf course no one knows for sure because no one is allowed to see what's on the Fed's balance sheet. But more and more of us are suspecting it's not just the normal junk people talk about.\n\nThere was a good editorial in the Wall Street Journal describing the government's and the Fed's involvement in the financial ponzi scheme that has accumulated over the years. I believe it disingenuous for the government to persist in covering up its complicity by doing more of the same. They seem intent on bankrupting the country instead of steering clear of gobbledygook economics.\n\nMacro funds can't sustain the kind of buying needed to make this kind of directional move over several months. Without the fed putting a floor under the market, 1/2 would be buying and 1/2 would be seliing and the market would trade in a normal rhythym not 8 months straight up. Since there is not enough money to break the Fed's floor what do funds do? What would you do? If you can't beat them join them. Add all of the federal monetary incentives and presto you have a rediculous environment for stocks.\n\nThe global response has indeed been coordinated. You could follow the development of it. There was a meeting of global leaders (perhaps a G20 meeting) late last year or this Jan when they discussed how to \"fix\" the financial crisis. Then in Feb 09, Obama has a meeting with bank execs, Treasury Sec issues his \"I'll do whatever it takes\" at his confirmation hearing and then since March the market hasn't gone down. Perhaps that third leg down from Jan to March was caused in part by transitioning to a new adminstration (waiting for that).\n\nOf course the real conspiracy theorists will say that the market was driven down like that just to keep the republicans out of office. In Sept 08 McCain was even and a little in front of Obama. By Nov he was toast. It's just being reinflated now. If you're John McCain you have to believe you just weren't meant to be president.\n\nThe thing is – there is no conspiracy side to this argument. As TPC eloquently explained, there is NO reason for a buyer to execute such a huge order at the asking price on such a low volume day. Why would they effectively execute at a high price? They wouldn't unless they were trying to force price up.\n\nThis is either a trading error that occurs every day, bad market making, stupid trading or something nefarious. You decide. There is no conspiracy theory to this argument. It simply is what it is.\n\nThe market is overpriced but seems to me to be completely rational. (Or one can at least rationalize its level.) S&P500 earnings were $15.96 in Q3 2008 and the market end September (already post Lehman) at 1,166. Things were deteriorating in 2008. Fast forward to Q3 2009 and earnigns are $15.53 or so. Down about 3% versus 2008. Expectation for earnings last year were that they would continue to decline into Q4 (they sure did going negative for the first time in history). Now expectations are for earnings to continue a steady climb higher (as stimulus continues, cost cutting continues and sales stabilize). The S&P's current level is a heck of a lot closer to its long-term trend that it has been over most of the past 15 years (the past year excluded).\n\nOn the surface, the finanicals are in a far better position than last year. Free money from the Fed, no mark-to-market, goverment backed loans, some still with TARP preferreds, etc. A banker would have to be a complete idiot not to make money now (just borrow at zero percent and buy Treasuries). So long as banks are confident that the Fed will not raise rates that will be an endless source of riches to offset mounting home mortgage, commercial real estate and credit card losses (which will continue to rise). The US treasury can issue debt, have the big banks buy it with free money from the Fed (the Fed never really needed to buy Treasuries to keep rates down, just convince the big banks that it was in their interest to do so). If I were a bank that was effectively insolvent, why would I lend to anyone and take on more potentially bad loans when I can get a guaranteed return from Uncle Sam. Earnings don't look like they will deteriorate any time soon with so much government support"

      "text": "Investing In An Etf – Why Timing Is all things\n\nInvesting In An Etf – Why Timing Is all things\n\nEtfs, short for transfer traded funds, are widely popular with both fund managers and personel traders. This is largely due to the fact that they can be bought and sold at any time, just like customary stocks. However if you want to make consistent profits trading these instruments, then you have to get your timing right.\n\nThey say that timing is all when investing in the stock market, and the same applies to transfer traded funds. These instruments tend to track a determined index or market. So this could include major indices such as the Ftse 100 and Dow Jones, major currency pairs such as the Gbp/Usd and Eur/Usd pairs or commodities such as corn, crude oil, copper, gold, natural gas and wheat. The truth is that you can find an Etf for pretty much anyone nowadays.\n\nAnyway the point is that anyone you are concerned in investing in, you have to buy at the most opportune moment. Therefore one option you have is to trade breakouts because a lot of the most popular markets are watched avidly by escape traders, so any resulting price move can become self-fulfilling to a determined degree.\n\nSo for example if the price of crude oil happens to trade between and 0 for months on end before ultimately breaking through the 0 barrier, then it might be worth buying the crude oil Etf. If the price continues heading higher to nearby the 0 mark, then you should make nearby 20% profit from your Etf investment.\n\nAn alternative arrival is to wait for a shop to be massively undervalued. For instance if the S&P 500 drops sharply over a period of several months and the Rsi and stochastic indicators are now both below 20 and there is a clear Macd difference pattern forming, then it may be worth drip feeding some money into an S&P 500 Etf for the long term.\n\nTo give you a few examples of how much money you can potentially make from transfer traded funds, let's look back at 2008 and 2009. During this time you could have bought Etfs in the Ftse 100 when the price was nearby 3500 (now 6000+) and the Dow Jones when the price was nearby 6500 (now 12300+). Similarly you could have bought a crude oil Etf when the price per barrel was nearby (now ).\n\nSo the point I want to make is that Etfs provide you with plentifulness of opportunities to spend in a variety of separate instruments whether it's indices, currencies or commodities, for instance. However you still need to get your timing precisely right otherwise you will struggle to make any money in the long run."

      "text": "Since You Asked\n\nwith Don Bright\n\nConfused about some aspect of trading? Professional\ntrader Don Bright of Bright Trading ( an equity trading corporation, answers a few of your questions.\n\nSurvival of the fittest\nDon, I read your article about the subpennies and high-frequency trading. I have also read that these new demons might very well kill each other off in the near future. What steps are you and your traders taking currently to help offset these challenges?\n\nGood question, I'll try to give you a few ideas. The idea of \"parking\" on a limit price in hopes of collecting 0.002 or so in liquidity rebates seems sort of silly nowadays since these subpenny orders can flash in front you at the rate of thousands per second. What happens when you have 1,000 shares offered at 42.30, for example, is that these flash orders will go in offered at 42.2999 or similar and take the order from you. The only time you'll be filled is when there is a large-enough order or a higher limit, allowing the price to go a few pennies against you. This can cost a lot of money. The other alternative is for you to basically lose a penny and hit the prevailing bid price. Either way, you're losing money.\n\nWhat we have found is that there is much less of this going in with 100-share orders. As a result, many of our traders will trade in 100-share increments, more stocks (pairs generally), and eliminate the subpenny losses. On the more liquid stocks, especially higher-volatility issues, we can take out offers and hit bits the way we used to back in the day.\n\nPairs risk\nI understand that Bright Trading is heavily involved in pairs trading, and does quite well. My question is about managing the risks involved. Some of the overall market movement risk can be cut down because you are somewhat market-neutral with a pair, long one stock and short another. How do you maintain the market neutrality with a single pair, and does adding more pairs help or hurt the overall risk?\n\nWe try to keep it simple when looking at overall market neutrality. Rather than analyze every trader's pick of pairs, we generally just look at long dollars vs. short dollars. We, of course, have to be aware of \"short\" exchange traded funds (Etfs) and so on that would obviously skew that risk control, but most traders use equities for their pairs trading (many do use baskets vs. Etfs, however).\n\nNow, as far as spreading the risk via more pairs is concerned, I'm a big fan, even as it relates to using smaller orders (see previous answer regarding subpennies), which we feel are executed better. The analysis of the stocks is primary, and we tend to like the better-valued stocks to be long vs. the growth stocks to be short. However, be extra careful when doing this analysis. Be aware that the lower-capitalized companies may be takeover candidates — another risk altogether. Overall, yes, we prefer to see several pairs within a sector, and multiple sectors in a portfolio. This helps eliminate consolidating too much risk in a small group of stocks.\n\nWe then move to frequency of trading for capturing profits. When we determine how much \"should\" be made from each layer of a pair (and how many layers we can go with overall), we must be diligent in taking these profits. This profit taking is actually a good method of risk control as well, since when we back down to even or one layer, the risk is actually or nearly nonexistent.\n\nTo address the movement in stock prices within a pair, we have elaborate data banks and spread history files that will allow us to modify our share size per side when needed.\n\nHope all this helps!\n\nE-mail your questions for Don Bright to Editor@Traders.com, with the subject line\ndirect to \"Don Bright Question.\""

      "text": "Options Education\n\nWhat is Wrong with Your Risk to Reward Ratio?\n\nOne of the more common trading rules that traders have in their Trading Plan is to take trades with at least a certain Risk:Reward ratio. (Or the Reward:Risk ratio, whichever you prefer.) What is this ratio, and why is it so important? That's the easy part. Most of you reading this newsletter have had the idea of a 1:3 or greater Risk:Reward ratio drilled into you from the moment you sat through your first Online Trading Academy class. The general idea is you only take trades where you will risk 1 unit for every 3 units of reward. That could mean risk 10 pips to make 30 pips, risk 50 pips to make 150, etc.\n\nNow, quick quiz. What are two of the main benefits of taking only trades with a Risk:Reward ratio of 1:3? The first I'll mention is the quality of the trades you take will be better. These 1:3 trades don't show up every thirty seconds, so being more selective in your trading is a good thing.\n\nThe second reason for taking only 1:3 Risk:Reward ratio trades is the pure mathematical fact that you don't have to be right very often to make money, let alone break even! Here is a quick demonstration:\n\nFigure 1\n\nAs you can see with the column on the left, the trader wins on 1 out of 3 trades (2 losses) and still makes a little bit of money. The column on the right the trader only makes money on one out of four trades, yet is still flat! There are not too many jobs on the planet where you can be right only 33% of the time and still make money.\n\nNow, here comes the hard part. The Risk:Reward ratio of 1:3 may be your INTENDED outcome for your trades, but what is the REAL outcome? In class, we'll occasionally have a student with trading experience who has already heard of the 1:3 Risk:Reward ratio and has applied it unsuccessfully in his trading. My response is always, \"What is the real outcome of your trades?\" For example: With an intended 1:3 and 10 trades, perhaps he lost on 5 trades and won on 5. This would be the result:\n\nIntended:\n\nTrades 1-5: Losses of 10 each for a total of 50.\n\nTrades 6-10: Wins of 30 each for a total of 150, with a net result of +100.\n\nBut what if the REAL outcome was as follows:\n\nFigure 2\n\nFor a net result of flat. What is the real problem here? In this hypothetical example, the trader may be having trouble \"letting his winners run.\" Another issue may be that with a small string of losses, this frustrated trader just wants to see a couple of profitable trades in his history. Whatever the reason for this, you must figure it out! As I have stated before, trading is a simple job just not an easy one. If you find yourself in this same situation, you must examine your trades AFTER THEY ARE COMPLETELY DONE. Look back at the chart and see what happened after you exited. Very often the trade will eventually hit your final target even though you may have exited early. By studying what happened to the market after you exit the trade, you should be able to more quickly determine if you are \"good\" at recognizing the 1:3 Risk Reward ratio trades. When you realize that you are good at them, it will be a lot easier to let those winners run!\n\nUntil next time,"

      "text": "Charting\n\nCharting and technical analysis are used by some investors to assist in shares decision making. The whole area can get incredibly technical, and this charting tip will explain some of the fundamental basics to you. There are a number of underlying reasons as to why some have great faith in charting. The first is a belief that share prices move along in trends, and these trends can be identified via charting in theory. Secondly, some believe that charting can highlight history repeats itself when it comes to the price of a particular share. And lastly, charting is a reflection of a share price and therefore has already priced in all the information that is known about a particular company.\n\nNow here are some of the basic aspects that fans of charting sometimes look out for:\n\nResistance levels: This is the historical price point identified that a share commonly fails to go above.\n\nSupport levels: The opposite to the above. It is a point where a share commonly stops falling in value and rises.\n\nDouble Tops: This is the point in which a share has historically peaked at the same time, multiple times. If a double top is identified, this is often viewed badly because it implied that the share has hit a plateau and potentially the only way is down.\n\nDouble Bottom: After a share price historically falls to roughly the same lows following a brief rise, some charters believe there is proof that a share may bounce back and rise from the previous resistance.\n\nMoving averages: A moving average can be calculated to truly understand whether a share price is on an upward or downward trend as it takes into account all the historical movement over a particular period. This is a particularly common tool for short-term investors.\n\nAnd remember…\n\nCharting uses history as a predictor of the future. Stock markets are incredibly volatile and past performance is by no means a definite indicator of future performance. For example, charting may show that a share may be on an upward trend, but new legislation related to that particular share could bring its potential rise crashing down"

      "text": "Hi, If the sell rule evaluates to true (1), the sim/port will sell the stock at rebalance. A sell rule of 1 is always true so all stocks are always sold at rebalance. Same as rank > 101 which has often been used.\n\nEveryone except computer programmers (and academic logicians) will be confused by what \"1\" means as a sell rule. \"1\" is how a computer records \"true\" in its numerical notation. Putting \"1\" in a sell rule is a very quick way to tell the computers at P123 that you want to sell ALL the stocks in a simulation or portfolio.\n\nIn particular, \"1\" does not mean \"rank > 1\" although both would have the same effect, namely selling all the stocks (unless a stock had a rank of 1).\n\n\"1\" by itself is often used by P123 users who have a knowledge of computer programming when they want to force P123 to sell all stocks.\n\nAnother common way to force the sale of all stocks is to write a sell rule that will be \"true\" for every stock. A favorite one is \"rank < 101\" which will be true for all stocks because the highest possible rank is 100. A rule like \"rank < 150\" would work just as well. Another rule that will always be true would be \"close(0) < 10000000000\" since no stocks that I know of have a price greater than 10 million per share. Other P123 users get creative by putting in a sell rule that does not refer to anything to do with a stock. For example, \"2=2\" is always true so the computer records that as a \"1\" and will thus sell all the stocks. One could also use \"3 < 5\" since this is always \"true\". Some p123 do not bother writing a comparison rule at all and and just put \"1\" in the sell rule.\n\nSo \"1\" as a sell rule does not refer to anything about the stock at all. It is just one of a thousand ways a user can tell P123 to sell all stocks.\n\nSpeaking for myself it is useful in establishing a \"baseline\" when developing Sell rules. The rule \"1\" sells everything at each rebalance. You can then proceed to try various other sell rules and compare the performance and turnover with this. I don't expect you'd see the rule used much in real world trading\n\nthe interpretation 0 and 1 in this case is not quite the same as \"false\" and \"true\" because p123 will accept numbers inbetween, and regard them as \"partial sales\". E.g. 0.5 means \"sell half the position\". So the number means how much of the position is sold, ranging from 0 (sell nothing) to 1 (sell everything). Logical test expressions will either return 0 or 1 corresponding to true or false, but it is possible to engineer expressions that return some other number, e.g. useful for trimming positions if they become overweight."

That's because there's very little difference between what I'm\ndoing now and what I've been doing for years.\n\nNUTS AND BOLTS\n\nFX is the largest financial market, trading $2.5-3 trillion per day.\nIt is open 24 hours per day, except for a break from 4 pm ET Friday to\n2 pm ET Sunday.

These can be the US dollar (USD) and the euro (EUR), or\nit can be between two foreign currencies, such as the EUR and the British\npound (GBP).

      "text": "The New York Stock Exchange was first established in 1792 by 24 stock brokers standing under a tree. What began as a simple agreement has evolved into an intricate financial system.\n\nFinancial markets reflect global hopes, fears, failures, and big wins. Markets are actually personal, but the way we share stock tips and information is anything but connective.\n\nToday not everyone trades — partially because the markets seem to have a closed-door policy, lending themselves to those with brokers and inside trading tips. An exclusive process in which a limited number of people are privy to limited information. There's no place on the Internet currently where anyone can discuss the stock market in real time.\n\nStockr wants to change that. It's a social network specifically for watching stocks and talking with other investors.\n\nVinny Jindal, CEO of Stockr, said, \"Right now trading is a team sport. And it's a very exclusive team sport. Professionals have all kinds of informational resources. They have systems like Bloomberg. And more importantly they have a physical social network. I've rarely seen somebody make an investment decision in a vacuum all on their own, just with some data. They ask other people whose opinion they respect, people they've come to meet.\"\n\n\"On the Internet, there's very limited social technology to find someone, to ask something, to hear what that person has said, and then hit the follow button. That doesn't exist anywhere online for finance.\"\n\nJindal, a biologist who left science to work as a biotech equity research analyst, was a principal at Boston Millennia Partners and a managing director at ThinkEquity Partners. He also worked for Lehman Brothers, Wedbush Morgan Securities, and Origin Capital Management.\n\nSpending nearly a decade in the field, he gained an intricate understanding of how stocks moved and how information on what to invest in was digested and distributed. His learnings inspired him and his partners to create a platform for breaking down the walls of financial information sharing.\n\nFounded in June 2010, Stockr will launch out of private beta this July.\n\nEssentially Bloomberg for the masses, it allows users to watch the markets and discuss them all day — at work, at home, on the site in private chats (like IM), or on public-facing message boards (like a Facebook wall). It provides an easy way to look at how your portfolio has performed on a daily basis. It almost makes the stock market more friendly.\n\nWhereas Yahoo! Finance gives a quick, static snap shot with little way to directly communicate with other (often anonymous) users and message boards are relics from the 1990s, the Stockr platform is an in-depth, real-time, more sophisticated deep dive.\n\nThe site includes:\n\nInvestor Profile Pages. Your own page that lists who you are and what stocks you watch.\n\nCompany Pages. A full picture of the company and how the stock performed over the course of time.\n\nWatch List. Lists out the stocks you're currently watching.\n\nPulse. What everyone on the site is saying in real time about stocks that you currently follow.\n\nStockr's algorithm connects you with companies and other investors you might be interested in, based on your trading interests. If you like technology stocks, their algorithm seeks out the most relevant people on the network to talk about technology stocks with you.\n\n\"At the same time, you're able to track not only the prices of the individual companies in real time, but you're able to see all the things happening around those companies right now. So, if an article is written on the web about a company you follow, we pick that up and push that to you in real time,\" said Tim Symington, Stockr co-founder.\n\nWhat about those who might spread false information?\n\nJindal explained, \"Social networks where participants use their real identity tend to either reduce spamming and dishonesty, or to hold the person spreading falsehoods accountable. Unlike the existing, anonymous message boards, we force the use of real identity so people will have to stand by their words. And if you don't like what someone is saying or don't believe that they're being honest, you simply don't have to follow them.\"\n\nRegistration is currently through Facebook. Eventually, the start-up plans to offer sign-up through LinkedIn and Google Plus.\n\nPerhaps this sort of democratization has been a long time coming. With the Occupy movement as a national backdrop and the disenfranchised feeling a greater chasm between those that have choices and those that do not, this time is ripe for tools that champion greater open access and communication. Tools that might actually change how business isPicking stocks is difficult. Why would it be any easier to pick the correct person(s) to listen to or shadow? Perhaps, someone is an industry expert on Stockr and had a series of good calls, but will that person always be correct? Not likely. So do your odds improve for picking the right stocks at the right time? More importantly, do your odds of having a profitable investment or portfolio edge above 50%? The data says no. If we assume that active managers are the smart people with timely information and have insightful colleagues to confer their idea with so they don't make investment decision in a vacuum, reports (like S&P's SPIVA) have show that over the long-term active management does not beat indexing. These are the smart people! Why would an individual investor do any better? Will the average person be better off with a social network for investors (i.e., will they make more money at the end of the day). While financial social networks could be interesting to socialize on (so is gambling which has similar if not better odds depending on what segment of the active management world your compare to), individual investors would be better off with a diversified portfolio of index funds. Is this really what the millions of individual investors need?\n\nActually, jacobandersen — Yahoo! is not real-time at all. It provides static finance snapshots. But that is all. Twitter is not a platform for stocks, it's a social media platform; if stock information is shared, it's only part of many other larger conversations.\n\nNot sure how STOCKR democratizes the stock market. I guess it facilitates the ability of shareowners to converse with each other and that is a first step… but there would be a long way to go to democratize anything. Democracy is about control, the rules of the game being more fair and balanced"

A new study in the Journal of Consumer Research shows that when investors use charts, they are likely to make a baseless decision about the riskiness of a stock based on its run-length.\n\nShare This:\n\nStock graphs are everywhere, available on financial and public websites to be loaded and customized by users. Authors Priya Raghubir (New York University) and Sanjiv R. Das (Santa Clara University) found that investors believe that stocks with shorter up-and-down movements are less risky than those with longer run-length. This is called the \"run-length\" effect.\n\nThey tested three groups—affluent Californians, undergraduates, and general investors—and found that all three judged a stock with a shorter run-length more favorably. They found that the run-length effect increases with greater education and frequency, length, and diversity of trading experience.\n\nThey conclude that because of the large amount of data presented on a graph, investors simplify their task by sampling points from a financial instrument's price history to estimate trend and noise. The sampling strategy leads to perceptual biases when the sample points are not representative of the price series.\n\nThe authors believe there are public policy implications that might lead to how data is presented because \"systematic biases in risk perceptions may permeate the market uniformly, resulting in persistent biases in prices. . . From a consumer perspective, individual investors should be made aware of their biases in appraising and comparing stocks using charts.\"\n\n\"These results have implications for how financial information is communicated to investors,\" the authors write. The visual display of stock information has increased and the number of commercial purveyors of stock analysis information has mushroomed…From a public policy perspective, regulators should consider imposing guidelines about how financial information is presented to individuals, akin to mandatory labeling by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)."

But that's not the case for Pradeep Bonde, who publishes a blog called StockBeeStockBee.blogspot.com. Bonde follows a strategy based on tracking surprises that, reportedly, has been producing high double-digit annual returns for several years.\n\nYou don't need to make earnings prediction. Earnings surprise is actual earnings vs analyst consensus of earnings. For example analyst expect XYZ to make 10 cents but the actual earnings are 40 cents then that company has 30 cents earnings surprise.\n\nDo you think this strategy still works? Nowadays, surprise positive earnings don't seem to necessary work. Some simply result in a 1day jump in price then fade. Others will gap up in price but fall during the day and subsequent days will simply consolidate at that level"

      "text": "Bollinger bands are comprised of three bands which are referred to as the upper band, lower band and central band. The central band is a simple moving average which is normally set at 20 period and the upper and lower band represent the chart points at 2 standard deviations from the central band.\n\nThe following is an example of Bollinger bands indicator on the EURJPY currency pair.\n\nBollinger Bands Indicator On EURJPY Currency Pair\n\nBollinger bands are used to measure markets volatility. When there is not much volatility Bollinger Bands are close together. When market has a lot of volatility Bollinger bands spread apart. Check the following picture. In the following picture you can see the areas where Bollinger bands are close together and there is very less volatility. You can also see the areas where the Bollinger bands are spread apart and you can see a lot of volatility. This can also be told in a reverse way. When the Bollinger bands are coming closer together means the volatility of the currency pair is decreasing. When the Bollinger bands are moving away from each other that mean the volatility is increasing.\n\nBollinger Bands Contrasting and Expanding\n\nHow to trade using Bollinger Bands:\n\nBollinger Bands Squeezing: When the Bollinger bands squeeze that means when the bands come very close together that means a break out is about to occur. If the price starts to break the upper bands then that means the price will usually go up. If the Bollinger bands start to break the lower bands means the price will usually go down. Check the following picture. In the following picture after the bands squeezed together it broke the upper bands and moved upwards.\n\nCheck the following picture. It is a USDJPY hourly chart. You can see the Bollinger bands squeezing in the highlighted area. The price broke the lower Bollinger bands and it went down.\n\nUSDJPY Bollinger Bands Squeezing and Breakout\n\nUsing Bollinger bands in range markets: You can use Bollinger bands with any other indicators like stochastic, CCI etc. in a range market. You can identify range markets with Bollinger bands easily. In a range market the Bollinger bands are parallel or almost parallel to each other and horizontal. In such conditions if the stochastic indicator goes in to an oversold condition and the price touches or breaks the lower Bollinger bands you can buy the currency pair. If the stochastic indicator goes into an overbought condition and the price touches or breaks the upper Bollinger band you can sell the currency pair.\n\nCheck the following picture. In the following picture the Bollinger bands are parallel to each other and you can see the buy and sell opportunities when the stochastic indicator goes into the oversold and overbought regions.\n\nBollinger Bands and Range Market\n\nUsing Bollinger bands in trending markets: When the Bollinger bands are parallel to each other but moving in upward or downward direction, it is a trending market. When the trend is upward or downward you should not enter trading immediately. You have to enter the market at price reversals. When the market is trending generally the price reverses to the middle band and the middle band acts a strong resistance. Sometimes the price also reverses until the other band then starts to follow the trend again. You can look at other indicators like stochastic or use other techniques like candlestick patterns to enter the trading in the direction of trend at this point. When the price reaches the middle band or the opposite band and an engulfing candlestick pattern is formed in the direction of trend, you can enter the trading. Or if the price reaches the over bought or oversold regions you can enter trading in the direction of trend. Check the following picture the Bollinger bands are parallel to each other and moving upwards. That means the price is trending upwards. You can see that the price reverses until the middle band a lot of times and then followed the trend again.\n\nBollinger Bands Upward Trending Market\n\nTrend Line Breakouts: This technique can be generally used in daily chart. Using this technique you can get 50 to 100 pips profit. I will explain you this technique using the following picture. The following is a daily chart of EURGBP currency pair. You can see the trend line I have drawn for this. The trend line is broken with a strong bullish candlestick. Moreover it also broken the middle band and closed above the middle band. There is around 50 pips distance between the current candlestick and the upper band. You can take advantage of this and enter trading. You can close the trade when the price touches the upper band. Moreover stochastic indicator is not also in the overbought region.\n\nBollinger Bands Trend Line Breakout\n\nChart Patterns: You can use chart patterns with Bollinger bonds. Check the following picture. The following is the daily chart of EURUSD and you can see a reverse head and shoulder pattern for the currency pair. The neckline was broken by a strong bullish candlestick and it also broke the Bollinger bands. You can see the strong upward trend after that.\n\nEURUSD Neck Line Breakout\n\nBollinger bands and 123 pattern: You can use 123 pattern with Bollinger bands to find the beginning of a trend. You can also use candlestick patterns with this. Check the following picture. It is again the daily chart of EURGBP. You can see the 123 pattern I have identified. The price touched the upper Bollinger bands and returned to middle of the bands. Then a doji and then a strong bullish candlestick formed. This is the entry point. The stop loss can be placed below the bullish candlestick. You can see the trending market after the 123 pattern. It went up to almost 300 pips.\n\nBollinger Bands and 123 Pattern - Picture 1\n\nThe following is another 123 pattern for the same currency pair. Now at the third point a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern is formed. As you can see I have entered a sell trade at this point. I am expecting a large move at this point. I will move my take profit levels and stop loss levels accordingly."

      "text": "Death of a Trader\n\nJust heard an old trader buddy of mine took his own life. It has happened more than enough times in my trading career than I care to talk about. I have been at the CME since May of 1986. At least 7 people I know have taken their lives due to being depressed.\n\nMost of the time it's over money. For some it was millions, for others as little as 30k.\n\nThis guy was always a stand up guy. Another local, just like me. We'd compete like heck all day, and sometimes scream at each other across the pit. But at the end we would go down and have a beer and all was forgotten.\n\nI saw him a couple of months ago and we had lunch. Laughed like old times and he seemed to be doing well. Was going to start up an incubator for businesses in Chicago, and introduced me to the person who was going to run it. It was the last time I saw or spoke to him.\n\nBlack. Chasm.\n\nI feel terribly for the family he left behind. They must be so distraught. The unanswered questions…..\n\nTraders are an eclectic bunch. But one thing that was on the floor that you only find in places like military units, or sometimes sports teams was a macho camaraderie. While we fought like cats and dogs, and competed like crazy, we were still all in this mess together.\nTraders sometimes have very warped personalities. Addictive.\n\nI have seen guys kill themselves in different ways via drugs or booze. But I also know several that have come out of those depths to lead fantastic lives. One of my closest friends managed to do it. We had a lot of fun in the old days, but I like him better now that he quit. There is a place for you in this world, don't end your life.\n\nHarris Brumfield, former 10 year note trader and CEO of Trading Technologies said, \"There was not a more fun way to make money.\" He was right. But those days are long gone.\n\nFred Pickard(FRP) might have made the most insightful statement ever when we were talking about the death of the floors. Trying to explain it to someone that had never been there he said, \"It was the most amazing network on the face of the earth. You could get anything you wanted at any time anywhere, all it took was money. If you wanted a hotel room somewhere, somebody always knew somebody. If they didn't, you'd call another exchange. If that didn't work, you could always call someone around the the world that could get it done.\" Leveraging that network meant power, and for a century a bunch of enterprising guys from Chicago had it. That network still exists, it's just a lot harder to tap. If you are thinking of ending your life, don't despair. There is hope.\n\nWhen a trader meets someone, invariably they know someone else that traded. \"Do you know John Doe?\". I always ask what they traded, what exchange they were at. Then we ask the operative question: What was their badge? I know more people by their badges than by their name. Even when I saw ZMAN the last time, I called him \"ZMAN\", not John. It was a part of your identity, but in the new world, we will create new identity's. There is a tomorrow.\n\nTraders have done some amazing things over the years. I encourage any trader that reads this blog to leave a comment, a story about someone, something they know. We could kill a lot of forests recanting them all. To give you a flavor; there were more millionaires per square inch on the floors of the Chicago exchanges than anywhere else in the world. However, they were/are some of the most charitable people I know. You'd give 20, 50, 100 dollars per week to various charities. An old trader on a private chat room we have asked if anyone had a charity for him to donate to. He is off the floor living in another state but felt that was one way for him to reconnect and be a part of it. Two brothers I know tragically lost their brother. They established a foundation in his name, The Clubber Fund, largely supported by donations from the floor. They have sent over 15 deserving kids to college. There is a place for you. Don't end it.\n\nTraders did crazy stuff, and they competed like hell. Trading your own money against other people that trade your own money in a trading pit is more competitive than pro sports. It is a visceral experience. But sometimes, I have seen guys do things to make sure we all survived another day. Letting you have a piece of a trade. Lending money when you were down. Taking you under their wing for awhile. One trader I knew called it \"stepping off their throat.\" Someday it might be you that needed help. Once in the hogs, I needed to buy a couple of hundred hogs to cover a position. A guy sold 500 contracts, and faster than you can blink your eye, the market was up around 150 points. That's a 300k loss. There were some orders up there and I turned to him and said, \"If you want to buy them they are yours.\" Then, put my hands in my pockets and waited. There are millions of stories like this. You will live to fight another day.\n\nIf you are despondent take a breath. Wait. Sit on your hands. Don't make the ultimate selfish sacrifice.\n\nIf you know of a trader that is on the edge. Put your arms around him and tell his family. It's just like helping him out of a bad position in the pit. Oh, and send this one around. If there is anyone out there on the brink that is thinking about ending it all-maybe they won't. There is light at the end f the tunnel. The happy warriors that we are will fight again another day.\n\nRIP ZMAN, lots of people are going to miss you.\n\nUPDATE\n\nSome extremely moving comments. Keep them coming. Not just about ZMAN, but about hope. Too often, people in our industry measure themselves by their P+L (thanks OLA). Three days ago, another guy I didn't know from Wall Street jumped off a bridge, taking his life.\n\nAs a trader, I empathize with them. It is so easy to stay down when you are ice cold. I understand what the depths look like. However, we have to focus on other things are reframe ourselves. Please, more comments on how you reframed your career during a tough time. This suicide thing can't become de facto for losing money, or losing your perceived purpose in life.\n\nUPDATEAgain\nWe lost another one. Michael T. Lee from the CME. RIP. Please, if you are thinking of ending it..Don't.\n\ntip of the hat to John Lothian for linking to this. Thanks"

      "text": "An NASD &\nSEC rule that applies to anyone who buys and sells a\nparticular security in the same trading day (day\ntrades), and does this four or more times in any five\nconsecutive business day period. A pattern day trader is\nsubject to special rules. The main rule is that in order\nto engage in pattern day trading you must maintain an\nequity balance of at least $25,000 in a margin account.\n\nIt is important to understand what is\nconsidered a day trade under this rule. A day trade is\nwhen you buy and sell the same stock (same symbol)\nduring the same day. This includes if you buy and sell\nduring the pre-market, regular market hours, or in the\nafter-market hours on the same day. A day trade is just a buy and sell\n(or short sell and buy to cover) of the same stock in one trading day.\n\nWhat is not a day trade?:\n\nIf you open a stock position one day and hold it\novernight and cover it the next day (or any subsequent\nday), that is an overnight trade. A trade held\novernight is not considered a day trade in relation to\nthis rule. There is no limits imposed on overnight trading,\nyou can do this as often as you want.\n\nCan I\nday trade at all with under $25,000?:\n\nIf you have under\n$25,000, you can still place day trades through a US\nbroker. However you can\nonly do a maximum of 3 day trades in any 5 consecutive\nbusiness day period. Once you do that 4th day trade\nwithin 5 business days, you become a \"pattern day\ntrader\" and trigger the $25,000 requirement. It is a\nrolling 5 business day period, so every business day is\npart of a 5 day period.\n\nCounting\nday trades clarification:\n\nIt does not\nmatter whether you buy and sell the same stock or\ndifferent stocks. Each time you place a buy and sell\n(or short sell and buy to cover)\non the same stock symbol\nduring the same day it always counts as a day trade\nagainst the pattern day trader rule. Whether you place\nday trades on the same day or different days is not\nrelevant.\n\nExample - Same Stock: If you buy\nand sell 100 shares of the symbol MSFT, that is a day\ntrade. After that you buy and sell 100 shares of MSFT\nagain that day, that is another day trade. You have done\n2 day trades.\n\nExample - Different Stocks: If you\nbuy and sell 100 shares of the symbol INTC, that is a day\ntrade. If you then buy and sell 100 shares of CSCO\nthat day, that is another day trade. You have done 2 day\ntrades.\n\nAccount Type:\n\nMargin vs. Cash - You can only do\npattern day trading in a margin account. You cannot be a\npattern day trader using a cash account. You cannot use\na cash account to \"get around\" this rule. There is no\nexception to the PDT rule based on account type at all.\n\nPatternDayTraderRule.com (the\n\"site\") is an informational website only.

If\nthe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) experiences a substantial single-day\ndecline, the circuit breakers pause trading for a specified time period\nor close the market for the rest of the day.\n\nHistorical Levels\n\nWhen they were first implemented, a 250-point drop halted trading for one hour, and a\n400-point drop halted trading for two hours.\n\nFrom February 1997 to April 1998, a 350-point drop would halt trading for 30 minutes,\nand if this circuit breaker were triggered in the last 30 minutes of the session, the\nmarket would close for the day. A 550-point drop would cause the market to close for 1\nhour or for the rest of the day if it were triggered within the last hour of trading.\n\nOver the past ten years, circuit breakers have only been triggered once. On October 27,\n1997, the DJIA fell 350 points at 2:35 p.m. ET and 550 points at 3:30 p.m. ET. Due to\nthe timing of the declines, the market closed for the rest of the day.\n\nCurrent Levels\n\nNew standards were established in April 1998 to reflect the growth of the market\nover the past 10 years.

      "text": "Support, Resistance and Breakouts\n\nThink of security prices as a war. It is a battle between a bull (the\nbuyer) and a bear (the seller). The bulls push prices higher and the bears\npush prices lower. A buyer that feels an area has good value, will buy at\nthat level. The seller that feels that a stock has reached fair value, will\nsell at that higher fair value price. The direction prices actually move\nreveals who has won the battle.\n\nRemember when a trade takes place, a buyer and seller agreed to a price.\nThere was a buyer and a seller involved in the transaction. The buyer feels\nthe stock will go up. The seller wants to move on to another stock that he\nmay feel will appreciate faster.\n\nSupport levels are the price where the majority of traders feel the value is\na good buy.\n\nResistance is the level in which the majority of traders feel prices will\nmove lower.\n\nWhen the majority of traders and investors change their expectations, these\nsupport and resistance areas get violated and a new trend may be beginning.\nThis can occur due to changes in expectation of earnings, new product\ndevelopment, change of personnel, cut backs or expansions.\n\nOne interesting pattern that traders see after a breakout, is that the stock\nor index retraces a part of the initial move by about 50%. If the 50%\nretracement does not hold, the stock or index can still be in a trend if the\nprevious breakout resistance holds.\n\nLet's look at Genzyme General (NASDAQ: GENZ).\n\nFor the past week we have been looking a number of stocks that were\nmirroring the NASDAQ in a congestion range waiting to break up or break\ndown.\n\nHere is a stock that has been hitting resistance several times.

      "text": "Trading Commodity Spreads\n\nMany professional commodity traders focus on trading spreads. A spread involves the simultaneous buying of one commodity and the selling of the same or similar commodity. Using spreads often cuts down on the risk of buying a straight commodity position.\n\nSome of the more popular spreads are in the grain markets. A common trade is to buy one grain and sell another grain. For example, a trader might buy December corn and sell December wheat. The premise for the trade is that the trader expects the corn market to be stronger than the wheat market. As long as corn moves up more than wheat or doesn't fall as much, the trader can make a profit.\n\nSpreads can also be done within the same commodity. For example, a trader can buy July corn and sell December corn at the same time during spring. This is called a bull spread. The front month typically moves more than the further out months. If someone was expecting corn prices to move higher during the year, this would be a considered a proper trade.\n\nCorn prices can move 10 plus cents each day, while spreads usually only move a fraction of that amount. They are considered a more conservative strategy than solely buying or selling a straight futures contract. The margin is also much lower on a futures spread than it is on a straight futures contract.\n\nTypes of Commodity Spreads\n\nA trader can find almost any type of commodity spread to meet any outlook on the markets. This not only applies to an outlook on one market, but it can apply to an outlook on multiple markets. Below are the types of futures spreads that a trader can utilize.\n\nIntra Market Spreads - These are commonly called Calendar Spreads. They involve the buying and selling of different contract months within the same commodity. For example, a trader can buy May soybeans and sell November soybeans.\n\nInter Market Spread - This type of futures spread involves buying and selling of different but related commodities. The commodities usually move closely together, but there may be particular reasons why one commodity might be stronger than the other. For example, a trader could buy silver and sell gold.\n\nInter Exchange Spreads - The inter exchange spread involves the simultaneous purchase and sell of the same underlying commodity, but traded on different exchanges. An example of this trade would be buying December wheat futures traded on the CME Group and selling December wheat futures traded on the Kansas City Board of Trade.\n\nTrading Commodity Spreads\n\nA trader should be more aware of the price spread between the two contracts rather than actual prices. The price spread is the difference between the two contracts. For example, July corn is trading at $6.05 and December corn is trading at $5.75. The spread is 30 cents. If July corn moves up faster than December corn, the spread will increase. Therefore, buyers of the spread will make a profit.\n\nThe more conservative nature of commodity spreads does not necessarily mean there is less risk. Anyone who has traded spreads over a period of time knows that things can sometimes go awry. Weather conditions and crop reports are but a couple of the things that can cause spreads to jump more than normal.\n\nA worse case scenario is when the futures contract you buy moves sharply lower and the contract you sell moves sharply higher. Two fairly correlated commodities like corn and wheat can do this. It is not a good feeling when you are looking for a five cent gain on a spread and overnight you loose 15 cents because of crop news coming out of China. The key here is to always be aware of the risks even though you are using a more conservative strategy."

So if the married put is a more expensive endeavor than the long call because of the interest paid on the investment portion that is below the strike, why would anyone buy a married put? Wouldnít traders instead buy the less expensiveóless capital- intensiveólong call?\n\nGiven the additional interest expense, they would rather buy the call. This relates to the concept of arbitrage. Given two effectively identical choices,rational traders will choose to buy the less expensive alternative. The market as a wholewould buy the calls, creating demand which would cause upward price pressure on thecall. The price of the call would rise until its interest advantage over the married put wasgone.\n\nIn a robust market with many savvy traders, arbitrage opportunities donít exist for very long. It is possible to mathematically state the equilibrium point toward which the market forces the prices of call and put options by use of the put-call parity. The put-call parity equation states:\n\nc + PV(x) = p + s\n\nwhere\n\nc is the call premium\n\nPV(x) is the present value of the strike price\n\np is the put premium\n\ns is the stock price.\n\nAnother, less academic and more trader-friendly way of stating this equation is\n\nCall + Strike ñ Interest = Put + Stock\n\nwhere Interest is calculated as\n\nInterest = Strike x Interest Rate x (Days to Expiration/365)\n\nThe two versions of the put-call parity stated here hold true for European options on nonñdividend-paying stocks.\n\nDividends Another difference between call and married-put values is dividends. A call option does not extend to its owner the right to receive a dividend payment. Traders, however, who are long a put and long stock are entitled to a dividend if it is the corporationís policy to distribute dividends to its shareholders.\n\nAn adjustment must be made to the put-call parity to account for the possibility of a dividend payment. The equation must be adjusted to account for the absence of dividends paid to call holders. For a dividend-paying stock, the put-call parity states\n\nCall + Strike ñ Interest + Dividend = Put + Stock\n\nThe interest advantage and dividend disadvantage of owning a call is removed from the market by arbitrageurs. Ultimately, that is what is expressed in the put-call parity. Itís a way to measure the point at which the arbitrage opportunity ceases to exist. When interest and dividends are factored in, a long call is an equal position to a long putpaired with long stock. In options nomenclature, a long put with long stock is a syntheticlong call. Algebraically rearranging the above equation:\n\nCall = Put + Stock ñ Strike + Interest ñ Dividend\n\nThe interest and dividend variables in this equation are often referred to as the basis. From this equation, other synthetic relationships can be algebraically derived, like the synthetic long put.\n\nPut = Call ñ Stock + Strike ñ Interest + Dividend\n\nA synthetic long put is created by buying a call and selling (short) stock. The at-expiration diagrams in FIGURE 6.2 show identical payouts for these two trades.\n\nSynthetics The concept of synthetics can become more approachable when studied from the perspective of delta as well. Take the 50-strike put and call listed on a $50 stock. A general rule of thumb in the put-call pair is that the call delta plus the put delta equals 1.00 when the signs are ignored. If the 50 put in this example has a ñ0.45 delta, the 50 call will have a 0.55 delta. By combining the long call (0.55 delta) with short stock (ñ1.00delta), we get a synthetic long put with a ñ0.45 delta, just like the actual put.\n\nThedirectional risk is the same for the synthetic put and the actual put. A synthetic short put can be created by selling a call of the same month and strike and buying stock on a share-for-share basis. This is indicated mathematically by multiplying both sides of the put-call parity equation by ñ1:"

      "text": "Posts Tagged 'interest'\n\nThe foreign exchange market is finally beginning to garner mainstream attention. The Bank of International Settlements estimates that the average daily volume in the fx market is around $4 trillion, which makes it by far the largest financial marketplace in the world. Surprisingly, however, many novice investors and traders have never even heard of this market.\n\nUntil the late 1990's, the only players allowed to execute trades in the foreign exchange market were investment banks, hedge funds, and very wealthy private investors. Since the minimum contract size was generally $1,000,000, smaller traders were effectively denied entrance into the market.\n\nIn the late 90's, however, this all changed. The advance of the internet and technology led several online forex brokers to open shop and begin catering to smaller investors and traders. This led to the birth of the retail foreign exchange market. In this article, we are going to discuss three key elements to forex trading: Leverage, Margin, and Equity.\n\nLeverage\n\nThe idea of leverage in the fx market has been under intense debate over the last several years. Since the market is decentralized and worldwide, regulation was largely absent from the fx market until recently. In 2010, the National Futures Association instituted some major changes, one of them being a cap on leverage at 50:1. This means that an fx trader in the United States can trade on leverage at a ratio of 50:1. Thus, if a trader has $1,000 in his account, then he is able to leverage that $1,000 into $50,000 and trade much larger positions in EUR USD. Until the National Futures Association passed this regulation, some brokers were offering traders up to 400:1 leverage, which means that with a $1,000 account, traders were able to control a $400,000 position in the market. Note that leverage is a two-edged sword. It will increase both losses and profits.\n\nMargin\n\nMargin is the life of a trader. If a trader does not have enough margin, then he cannot open a trade. Furthermore, if a trader has an open position moving against him, he may eventually not have enough money to act as margin, which means his account would suffer a \"margin call.\"\n\nMargin is the amount of money required to open a leveraged position. For example, if Broker ABC offers 50:1 leverage, and Bob the Forex Trader wants to open a position of $100,000, then Bob has to put up $2,000 of margin. If Bob's trade begins to move against him to the point where his account equity becomes less than $2,000, Bob will suffer a \"margin call,\" which basically means that his broker will call for more margin if Bob wants to keep the position open.\n\nEquity\n\nEveryone knows that one of the leading causes of business failure is a lack of initial capital, and trading is no different. If a trader opens an account with a few thousand bucks and trades heavily leveraged positions, his chances of success are nominal.\n\nEquity is essential to trading success. The question many new traders have is, how much money do I need to open an account? Well, the answer to that question is different for everyone, and it largely depends on what your goals are. If you simply want to get some trading experience, but still have a full-time job, then a person can open an account with a few thousand bucks. However, if you are trying to generate enough capital gains to sustain a living, then the initial account balance should be much, much higher.\n\nLeverage, Margin, and Account Equity are three essential aspects of fx trading that every trader must be familiar with."

      "text": "Sunday, 29 April 2012\n\nAverage True Range: the ATR indicator\n\nThe ATR is an attempt at finding out about trader sentiment by\ncomparing price ranges over a period of time. To do this in an easily\nunderstood and observed manner, the range values are presented in the\nform of an exponential moving average. Note: Past performance is not indicative of future results.\nAs we see, the ATR looks more like an oscillator than a moving\naverage. This because of the fact that although prices do not have\nbounds (they can move as high or low as the market can take them), the\nactual trading range is in fact confined to practical limits during even\nthe most heated action in the market. By making use of this knowledge\nJ. Welles Wilder was able to create an exceptionally simple, yet\npowerful and tradeable indicator.\n\nCalculation of the ATR\n\nThe average true range indicator is in some ways similar to the\ncommodity channel index discussed in this site. Here also, we compare\nprice ranges with previous values to establish overbought oversold\nlevels. But unlike the CCI, the ATR itself is a moving average: namely,\nit is the exponential average of a concept called the \"true range\" over a\ntrader-determined period. Let's examine how it is calculated in greater\ndetail.\nLet's first define a few concepts used in the determination of the true range:\nThe range is the value (H - L) where H is the high, while l is the low of the price over the period.\nThe true range is the extension of this concept to the period prior\nto the one in consideration. It is defined as Max(high, close) - Min\n(low, open) of the previous period, if the price action extended beyond\ntoday's range in that timeframe. In plainer terms, the true range is the\nlargest distance between the high or close, and low or open of a time\nperiod. It is an attempt to discover the greatest extent that the price\naction covered, thus establishing how agitated traders were.\nThe Average True Range indicator is then computed by taking the\nexponential moving average of the true ranges of a predefined period.\nThe exponential moving average is sensitive to the latest movements in\nthe price, and it is thus used as a gauge of trader enthusiasm in the\nmarket.\n\nTrading with ATR\n\nThere are two ways of using the ATR. One is looking for\ndivergence/convergence patterns between the price action and the\nindicator values. If the range is contracting even as the market is\nbreaking new records, we would consider the possibility that traders are\nlosing confidence in the momentum of the market. Otherwise, successive\nhighs would result in greater ranges as more and more traders are\nexcited about the price action. Another way of utilizing this indicator\nis looking for trends in the daily ranges, and entering or exiting\npositions in anticipation of breakouts. If the EMA is showing pattern of\nincreasing ranges while the price action itself is muted, there is\nsignal that a consolidation formation will culminate in a breakout one\nway or the other.\nAs with the CCI, and the Williams Oscillators, the ATR is a volatile\nindicator. If you plan to use it in your trade decisions, it is a good\nidea to complement your trading strategy with strong risk controls so\nthat the whipsaws that materialize, like those observed in the chart, do\nnot lead to unacceptably high losses.\nFinally, it is very important to understand that the ATR does not say\nmuch about price direction, or trend duration. It measures the\nvolatility of the price action, and is useful for analyzing extremes of\npositioning, both in trends, and range patterns. For analyzing direction\nand duration, we should use other indicators derived for this purpose.\n\nAccessibility\n\nATR is not one of the most popular indicators out there, but it is\nregarded as a part of the standard toolbox of any trader, beginner, or\nprofessional. It comes as a part of the Easy-Forex trading software, the\nMetaTrader platform, as well the trading packages of MGForex, or\nForexClub. Some minimalist designs may not include it, so it is a good\nidea to check before you make a decision about your account.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe ATR indicator is a powerful tool for volatility based strategies.\nAlthough prone to generating whipsaws, its role as a volatility\nindicator means that you can determine the type of market that you wish\nto trade with the ATR, while deriving actual signals and entering trades\non the basis of other secondary strategies. Most of us have a good idea\non how important volatility is in determining the profit potential, and\nsuitability of a particular market environment for our trading\ndecisions. The ATR, along with the Bollinger Bands, is an exceptional\nway of measuring this aspect of the market, and offers great potential\nto those who seek to use it."

      "text": "As the article points out, decay works to your disadvantage in volatile markets that go nowhere, but works to your advantage in strongly trending markets. For example, if you look at the NASDAQ 100 vs it's 3-times ETF TQQQ from the low of 8/27/10 to the high of 11/9/10, the NASDAQ 100 was up 25.9% while the TQQQ was up 97.3%, or nearly 4x the NASDAQ 100!\n\nSince the Market Direction Model (MDM) switches signals on average between 12 to 20 times a year and usually exits after the uptrend or downtrend reverses, decay should have only a small impact if any. That said, some may wish to take the decay advantage/disadvantage out of the MDM model equation by shorting normal leveraged (2-times and 3-times) ETFs on a sell signal instead of buying inverse ETFs provided you can get the borrow. Be careful of high fees associated with shorting ETFs. In our experience, there are enough ETFs out there that can be borrowed with little to no fees.\n\nImportant note: The UVXY model switches far more frequently than the MDM. That said, UVXY SELL signals tend to last longer than UVXY BUY signals since the general market tends to trend higher in a more orderly manner. In other words, when the general market is in an uptrend, UVXY tends to be in an orderly downtrend. Thus, these 2-times leveraged ETFs reap additional profits because of the downtrend."

It sounds like a number of things went wrong in Wallstreet as stock traders, hedge fund managers and people betting on FB stock possibly got burned.\n\nA hedge fund manager was so upset with the situation he revealed to Business Insider some of the issues he's been running into. It was asked that the manager's name be kept anonymous because he said, \"I have a mortgage\" and \"I'm a blue collar Wall Street guy…I could lose my job if my partners found out I was talking to you.\"\n\nThe first problem it seems that NASDAQ had was on opening day of the Facebook IPO. The system was somehow broken in that it was not delivering confirmed trades on buy and sells of the FB stock. While the weekend left traders scratching their heads wondering if their stock had actually sold or been purchased they got a surprise Monday morning.\n\nIn order to clear up the confusion NASDAQ started calling stock brokers about the Facebook stock issues. From the interview with the anonymous hedge fund manager with Business Insider it was said, \"NASDAQ has a rule that says this is how we handle computer f–kups. NASDAQ rule 4626. It says if we f–kup we'll pay it. They have a kitty of $3 million that they'll payout.\"\n\nHow was one supposed to get a piece of this $3 million backup fund in case NASDAQ had a computer problem? A form. The form caused the confusion that has apparently created lots of selling on Monday of Facebook stock. There was a 12:00pm lunch time deadline for the form to be filled out and submitted to NASDAQ in order to get money from their computer error fund.\n\nThe form applies to the NASDAQ rule 4626 and was pretty short and sweet. The form simply asked a trader how much they tried to sell NASDAQ:FB at and what they actually sold NASDAQ:FB at. Both parts of the form had to be filled out so traders took the que that in order to submit the form they need to sell the Facebook stock they were holding.\n\nThis apparently caused a rash of selling of Facebook stock and created downward pressure on the price which in turn caused more selling. NASDAQ isn't answering press attempts to comment on the way the whole Facebook stock mess went down. It will probably be a few days before everyone knows whether NASDAQ will try and fix this or if stock traders get burned with major losses.\n\nFacebook shares fall by 11% since Friday launch\n\nFacebook IPO Dot Com Scam?\n\nFB Stock Confusion From NASDAQ rule 4626 form Could Have Caused Selling, 2.1 out of 5 based on 16 ratings\n\n17 Responses\n\nFB stock sunk bc of several reasons, the first being they diluted the stock, second being they over valued the company at 100 billion, and the third being they dont have much of a business model, , its a black box company that sells peoples vacation photos. Forth being the banks have shorted the stock from day 1. They essentially raised the stock price while increasing the shares and the market doesn't work that way, I foresee this stock falling to around 10/share, once the speculation is cleared up.\n\nTony, the stock market is not a casino. Its impossible to never loose money, the worlds greatest investors have lost money in the stock market AND will loose money again in the future. Before you buy a stock, research the fundamentals and realize how much who are paying for it. Then calculate the risk and reward.\n\nShenanigans. No way is Rule 4626 or anything other than the market reaction to an ill conceived IPO that is sending FB into the dumpster. $3 million is nothing in a 2 Billion share/$100 Billion offering. No one is going to sell at a loss to maybe get a tiny piece of that $3 million insurance. If FB had any real value then a single position alone would equal that $3 million. It would cover less an hour of regular trading activity of a regular day if that much. When it became apparent that retail investors were warned off by principals dumping and running and the horrible fundamentals it became only the underwriters making trades to support any value to the stock whatsoever. From today on you are likely to see shorts buying to cover their positions, but FB is in for quite a slide.\n\nLinkedIN EPS is 15 cents it opened at 45 now around 100. Facebook EPS 31 cents opened around 38-42. It will double maybe more in a couple of month's. All this Neg. does not mean a thing. I am surrounded by peolple that did not like facebook and are now BUYING. Don't buy if you can't stomach this bad press that has nothing to do will value.\n\nOnly a fool would have bought any stock in facebook during the IPO. It's stock was valued at over 100 times it's \"projected\" earnings. That stock is not woth more than $5 a share in my opinion. Those with preferred stock made a bundle selling it to people caught up in the hype of the moment. I see facebook falling to $22 by this weekend.\n\nI completely agree with JC. It's understood that Nasdaq f'd up, but this mess should be cleaned up the right way. In this market, these types of losses should not be taken lightly and if FB executives decided at the last minute to increase the shares offered which has also affected the price, then they should also take the responsibility of their F'up and buy back their shares at the price. Many of us have been burned by this and an 11% decrease on day 2 followed by a 9% decrease on day 3 is hard to ignore, especially when its your kids college savings funds that are now in jeopardy.\n\nWhy would Facebook pay for NASDAQ's screw-up? They're a victim here too; their stock is tumbling in part because the exchange fumbled the IPO, combined with Morgan Stanley's revenue estimate downgrade which is now being investigated.\n\nI am confused by your concept of fair. Buying a stock is an economic decision in which the value will either go up or go down. Just because someone is stupid enough to think that a facebook IPO would be their pathway to instant riches, does not mean that Facebook owes them a cent. The fact that the Facebook IPO tanked is economic Darwinism at its finest."

      "text": "Members Area\n\nSearch\n\nIntro To Technical Analysis\n\nOne of the most significant tools in the financial markets is the technical analysis. It is used to define and to analyze the movement of market, (volumes, open interests and rates of prices) using information from the past. The technical analysis helps you predict the movement of the forex currency pairs. You can use past market data such as trends, prices and chart indicators to predict the movement of a given currency's price. The main advantage of the technical analysis is its universality. A trader, who deals with a couple of currencies and specializes in one of them, is also able to apply the same technique to analyze and predict another forex currency.\n\nThe Forex traders use 4 major currency prices as a foundation for their technological analysis and forecast: open, close, high, low. It is really a matter of personal choice or strategy, but most often traders use the close price as a starting point. The combination of technical indicators is also a matter of personal choice and strategy: Trend Indicators, Oscillators, Volatility, Volume, Cycle and Bill Williams' Indicators.\n\nSignals of technical analysis.\n\nThere are multiple signals you can use in the technical analysis:\n\nPrice. All market forces influence the price of a given Forex currency.\n\nThere is a cycling effect that proves the movement of the price is historically repetitive.\n\nThe movement of the price follows the trend.\n\nThere are three trends in the Forex market: major, secondary, and minor.\n\nThe trend must be confirmed by the volume.\n\nThe reversals indicate the end of the current trend and the beginning of a new one in the opposite direction.\n\nVolume\n\nThe volume shows the total amount of the currencies traded in Forex for a specific time, most often one day. The Forex traders trade very efficiently. They search, find and invest only in high-volume markets. The traders believe that a large trading volume instrument can help them earn more money. One of the methods to calculate the volume is to inspect the figures from the previous trends of a given forex pair and then you can anticipate the next trend. You have to use different sources of information like newspapers, economic on-line news, newswires, etc. They should help you predict the strength of the volume, because strong volume means strong currency movement.\n\nIf you learn to make proper technical analysis, your forecast will be very precise and profitable. Without research, analysis and forecast you will not be able to earn big money"

      "text": "Greenfaucet.com - Global Market Commentaries\n\nPositive Expectancy: The Key to Trading Success\n\nIf there is a key concept that leads to trading success, it's the understanding, integration and application of the Expectancy Return:\n\n(Average Dollar Win x Win Rate) - (Average Dollar LosS x Loss rate)\n\nWhere:\n\n* A$Win = the average of the dollars won in our winning trades\n* Win Rate = the total number of winning trades/sum total of all trades\n* A$Loss= the average of the dollars lost in our losing trades\n* Loss Rate = the total number of losing trades/sum total of all trades\n\nThe reason why the formula is important is because trading is a probability game. We don't know what will happen; we make best guesses and create scenarios that are neutral, scenarios that favour our trade and scenarios that are unfavourable. Even then, the fact that a scenario is favourable in any particular trade does not mean that for that trade we will be successful. If we have an edge, it will mean that over a large sample size, we will have a positive return.\n\nThat edge is expressed in the Expectancy Return.\n\nThere are certain key elements we need to bear in mind:\n\n1. The Win Rate alone means little. A trader can have a Win Rate of 90% and still produce a negative expectancy. Let's say a trader has a 90% Win Rate, and an average dollar win of $10; and he has an average dollar loss of $100. Given these numbers, the trader will lose over time.\n\n2. The important relationship is the relationship of the two sides of the equation. The greater the difference between the average dollar win over the average dollar loss, the lower the Win Rate can be over the Loss Rate.\n\n3. Generally, the shorter the time frame, the higher the Win Rate, and the lower the average dollar win. Successful scalpers, for example, produce a high win rate with a lower dollar win punctuated by some very large losses that happen infrequently.\n\n4. Since we are unsure of what the future will bring, the standard by which to judge when to take profits is governed by our stop loss, our expectancy return and our Maximum Adverse Excursion.\n\nThis brings me to my final point. It's important to keep records and statistics of our trading. Without them it would be impossible to maximise our return. For example, let's say you consistently use 40 points stops and take 17 points profits; and let's say that while you have not lost your shirt, you are exactly making a fortune.\n\nTo work out what you need to change means you need data. You need to know the frequency distribution of your profits and losses and of course the win and loss rates. Armed with this information, you will be able to judge whether you would be better off taking fewer profits i.e. letting the profits run and have fewer winners and more frequent losses; or reduce the size of the stops, have more frequent but smaller losers etc. The point is we need information in the form of records to make an informed decision"

      "text": "Key Concepts\n\nA B Andrew's Pitchfork is a trend-channel drawing technique consisting of three lines – parallel upper and lower lines and a median line that bisects the distant between the two. It is named after its developer, Alan Andrews. The chart below shows an example of a Pitchfork drawn from the March 2009 low on a weekly chart of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). There are three reference points used to draw the Pitchfork: the initial low (A), a subsequent swing high (B), and a subsequent swing low (C). The process is identical for creating down-sloping Pitchforks from highs. The slope of the Pitchfork is determined by the median line, which connects the initial low with the midpoint of the line connecting points B and C. The Pitchfork is a trend channel intended to provide boundaries to price action, with penetration of the outer lines implying a reversal of the preceding trend. Note that reference highs and lows are chosen subjectively. Different selections will result in different Pitchforks, different trend definitions and different implied reversals.\n\nAverage and median: The mean (or average) of a set of values is the sum of the values divided by the number of values in the set. If a set consists of 10 numbers, add them and divide by 10 to get the mean.\nA statistical weakness of the mean is that it can be distorted by exceptionally large or small values. For example, the mean of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 200 is 28.5 (228/8). Take away 200, and the mean of the remaining seven numbers is 4, which is much more representative of the numbers in this set than 28.5.\nThe median can help gauge how representative a mean really is. The median of a data set is its middle value (when the set has an odd number of elements) or the mean of the middle two elements (when the set has an even number of elements). The median is less susceptible than the mean to distortion from extreme, non-representative values. The median of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 200 is 4.5 ((4+5)/2), which is much more in line with the majority of numbers in the set.\nAverage true range (ATR) is simply a moving average of the true range\nover a certain time period. For example, the five-day ATR would be the\naverage of the true range calculations over the last five days.\n\nBid-to-cover ratio: The ratio of the number of received bids to the number accepted bids in a Treasury auction. A ratio of 2 (twice as many bids received as accepted) is typically considered a sign of strong demand and a successful auction.\n\nBollinger Bands: Bollinger Bands are a type of trading \"envelope\" consisting of lines plotted above and below a moving average, which are designed to capture a market's typical price fluctuations.\nThe indicator is similar in concept to the moving average envelope, with an important difference: While moving average envelopes plot lines at a fixed percentage above and below the average (typically 3 percent above and below a 21-day simple moving average), Bollinger Bands use standard deviation to determine how far above and below the moving average the lines are placed. As a result, while the upper and lower lines of a moving average envelope move in tandem, Bollinger Bands expand during periods of rising market volatility and contract during periods of decreasing market volatility.\nBollinger Bands were created by John Bollinger, CFA, CMT, the president and founder of Bollinger Capital Management. By default, the upper and lower Bollinger Bands are placed two standard deviations above and below a 20-period simple moving average.\n\nBollinger Bands highlight when price has become high or low on a relative basis, which is signaled through the touch (or minor penetration) of the upper or lower line. However, Bollinger stresses that price touching the lower or upper band does not constitute an automatic buy or sell signal. For example, a close (or multiple closes) above the upper band or below the lower band reflects stronger upside or downside momentum that is more likely to be a breakout (or trend) signal, rather than a reversal signal. Accordingly, Bollinger suggests using the bands in conjunction with other trading tools that can supply context and signal confirmation.\nBack to top\n\nC D\n\nCarry trades involve buying (or lending) a currency with a high interest rate and selling (or borrowing) a currency with a low interest rate. Traders looking to \"earn carry\" will buy a high-yielding currency while simultaneously selling a low-yielding currency.\n\nPublished weekly by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Commitments of Traders (COT) report breaks down the open interest in major futures markets. Clearing member firms, futures commission merchants, and foreign brokers are required to report daily the futures and options positions of their customers that are above specific reporting levels (for each market) set by the CFTC.\n\nFor each futures market, report data is traditionally divided into major reporting categories: commercial, non-commercial, and non-reportable positions. The first two groups are those who hold positions above specific reporting levels. The \"commercials\" are often referred to as \"large hedgers.\" Commercial hedgers are typically those who actually deal in the cash market (for example, agribusinesses and oil companies, who either produce or consume the underlying commodity) and typically have access to supply and demand information other market players do not.\n\nNon-commercial large traders include large speculators (\"large specs\") such as commodity trading advisors (CTAs) and hedge funds. This group consists mostly of institutional and quasi-institutional money managers who do not deal in the underlying cash markets, but speculate in futures on a large-scale basis for their clients. The final COT category is called the non-reportable position category — otherwise known as small traders — i.e., the general public.\n\nIn an effort to make the COT data more transparent, in 2009 the CFTC began publishing a more detailed \"disaggregated\" report that breaks down traders into the following four groups: Producer/Merchant/Processor/User (traditional commercial hedgers); Swap Dealers (traders that deal primarily in commodity swaps and uses the futures markets to manage or hedge their risk); Managed Money (CTAs and other professional funds); and Other Reportables (all other traders).\nCOT data can be accessed at \n\nConfidence levels: Confidence levels offer a more precise estimate of an average value by setting upper and lower limits for a data set's central tendency. This range can suggest how precise a statistic is (mean, correlation, etc.) according to a certain probability. For example, 98-percent confidence levels suggest that the market is likely to have traded outside of therange just 2 percent of the time.\n\nAssume the S&P 500's average monthly move is 1.76 percent over the past 12 months, and we want to find the upper and lower confidence levels for this mean at the 95-percent confidence interval. (The higher the confidence interval, the wider this range is.)\n\nThe site  offers relatively easy-to-digest definitions of this and other statistical terms.\n\nCorrelation coefficient, sometimes referred to simply as correlation, refers to the degree of similarity between two variables. In the markets, correlation is typically used to measure how close the relationship is between two price series (e.g., two distinct stocks or markets), between an individual stock (or trading fund) and an index, and so on. Correlation coefficients range between -1.00 and +1.00, with +1.00 representing perfect positive correlation (i.e., two variables moving precisely in tandem); -1.00 represents perfect negative correlation (i.e., two variables moving exactly opposite to one another). A correlation coefficient of zero means the two variables have no discernible relation. The site  offers relatively easy-to-digest definitions of this and other statistical terms.\n\nCurve-fitting refers to the process of tailoring or optimizing a trading system's rules to produce the best result (typically, the highest profit) on a particular set of price data. However, trading rules that are overly fit to specific data in this fashion almost invariably produce poor results in actual trading because the exact conditions of the test data are never repeated precisely in the future.\n\nElliott Wave is a descriptive form of technical analysis based on the concept that price action unfolds in identifiable, structured waves that define both trend and countertrend moves.\n\nRalph Nelson Elliott (1871-1948) introduced his ideas through a series of letters to Charles J. Collins, who help Elliott publish The Wave Principle in 1938. Also with Collins' aid, Elliott published a series of articles in Financial World magazine in 1939. Today, Elliott Wave theory is probably best known through the work of Robert R. Prechter Jr., who in 1978 coauthored with A.J. Frost Elliott Wave Principle: Key to Stock Market Profits (John Wiley & Sons, 10th edition, 2001).\n\nElliott Wave theory contains elements of a concept known as a fractal, which is an object or shape that has self-similarity on different scales. Fractals are found in a variety of phenomena. For example, if you look at a mountain from a distance, you may see a peak with relatively smooth sides. As you move closer, you begin to see how the sides of the mountain are actually made up of smaller sub-peaks and sides, which consist of even smaller peaks and sides, all sharing a similar basic structure or pattern.\n\nSimilarly, part of wave theory is the idea that any wave cycle is part of a larger wave cycle that adheres to the same rules, and is also composed of smaller wave cycles with the same structure. Many devotees of Elliott Wave consider price action to be a natural phenomena driven by human emotion, which makes the fractal aspect of wave patterns a valid way to understand and describe the price movement.\n\nExponential moving average (EMA): While the simple moving average (SMA) calculation gives every price point in the average equal emphasis — for example, a five-day SMA is the sum of the most recent five closing prices divided by five — weighted moving averages emphasize more recent price action. An exponential moving average is a type of weighted moving average that uses the following formula:\n\nEMA = SC * price + (1 - SC) * EMA(yesterday)\n\nwhere: SC is a \"smoothing constant\" between 0 and 1, and EMA(yesterday) is the previous day's EMA value.\n\nYou can approximate a particular SMA length for an EMA by using this formula to calculate the equivalent smoothing constant:\n\nSC = 2/(n + 1)\n\nwhere: n = the number of days in a simple moving average of approximately equivalent length.\n\nFor example, a smoothing constant of 0.095 creates an exponential moving average equivalent to a 20-day SMA (2/(20 + 1) = 0.095). The larger n is, the smaller the constant, and the smaller the constant, the less impact the most recent price action will have on the EMA. In practice, most software programs allow you to simply choose how many days you want in your moving average and select either simple, weighted, or exponential calculations.\n\nFibonacci series: A number progression in which each successive number is the sum of the two immediately preceding it: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, and so on. As the series progresses, the ratio of a number in the series divided by the immediately preceding number approaches 1.618, a number that is attributed significance by many traders because of its appearance in natural phenomena (the progression of a shell's spiral, for example), as well as in art and architecture (including the dimensions of the Parthenon and the Great Pyramid). The inverse, 0.618 (0.62), has a similar significance.\nSome traders use fairly complex variations of Fibonacci numbers to generate price forecasts, but a basic approach is to use ratios derived from the series to calculate likely price targets. For example, if a stock broke out of a trading range and rallied from 25 to 55, potential retracement levels could be calculated by multiplying the distance of the move (30 points) by Fibonacci ratios –– say, 0.382, 0.50, and 0.618 –– and then subtracting the results from the high of the price move. In this case, retracement levels of 43.60 [55 - (30 * 0.38)], 40 [55 - (30 * 0.50)], and 36.40 [55 - (30 * 0.62)] would result.\nSimilarly, after a trading range breakout and an up move of 10 points, a Fibonacci follower might project the size of the next leg up in terms of a Fibonacci ratio –– e.g., 1.382 times the first move, or 13.82 points in this case.\nThe most commonly used ratios are 0.382, 0.50, 0.618, 0.786, 1.00, 1.382, and 1.618. Depending on circumstances, other ratios, such as 0.236 and 2.618, are used.\n\nWhile Fibonacci retracements are used to calculate the possible partial correction levels of a previous price move (i.e., a reversal of up to 100 percent of a previous price swing), Fibonacci extension levels are used to extrapolate moves in the same direction as a previous price swing — for example, projecting a target for a new upswing that represents a 161.8-percent gain from a certain price level based on the size of the previous upswing.\n\nKeltner channels: Price bands formed by placing lines above and below a moving average of the \"typical price\" (the average of a bar's high, low, and closing prices) by a distance equal to the moving average of the daily ranges over an n-day period. The following definition uses a 10-day simple moving average (SMA) for both calculations.\n\nKey reversal: A basic key reversal high is a bar that makes a significantly higher high than the preceding high but reverses intrabar to close near the bottom of the bar's range. (Different definitions require the close to be below the close of the preceding bar, etc.) A key reversal is essentially a \"spike\" high that closes weakly. The traditional implication is that price has expended upside momentum and turned lower, foreshadowing further selling. (A key reversal low is the opposite pattern.) However, although such bars can often be observed – in retrospect – at market turning points, traders are apt to overlook them when they are followed by more price movement in the same direction. As with all patterns, objectifying such concepts as a \"significantly higher high\" and \"near the bottom\" are necessary to be able to consistently identify and test key reversal bars in different markets. Linear regression (\"best-fit\") line: A way to calculate a straight line that best fits a set of data (such as closing prices over a certain period) — that is, a line that most accurately reflects the slope, or trend, of the data.\nA regression line is calculated using the \"least squares\" method, which refers to finding the minimum squared (x*x, or x2) differences between price points and a straight line. For example, if two closing prices are 2 and 3 points away (the distance being calculated vertically) from a straight line, the squared differences between the points and the line are 4 and 9, respectively.\nThe squared differences are used (instead of just the differences) because some differences are negative (for points below the line) and others are positive (for points above the line). Squaring all the differences creates all-positive values and allows you to calculate a formula for the straight line.\nThe \"best-fit\" line is the line for which the sum of the squared differences between each price and the straight line are minimized.\nThe formula for a straight line (y) is:\n\ny = a + b*t where: t = time a = the initial value of the line when \"t\" is equal to zero (sometimes called the \"intercept\" value — i.e., the point at which the line intercepts the vertical y-axis) or the point at which a specific line begins b = the slope of the line, which is the rate at which the line rises or falls (e.g., 0.75 points per day). Back to top\n\nM N\n\nMoving average convergence-divergence (MACD): Although it is often grouped with oscillators, the MACD is more of an intermediate-term trend indicator (although it can reflect overbought and oversold conditions). The default MACD line (which can also be plotted as a histogram) is created by subtracting a 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) of closing prices from a 12-period EMA of closing prices; a nine-period EMA is then applied to the MACD line to create a \"signal line.\"\n\nMACD = EMA(C,12)-EMA(C,26)\n\nSignal line = EMA(MACD,9)\n\nMoving average crossover: A trend-following approach that signals a trend change when a shorter-term moving average crosses above or below a longer-term moving average.\nBack to top\n\nO P\n\nOpen interest: The number of outstanding (unclosed) positions in a given futures or options market.\n\nOptimization (and walk-forward optimization, walk-forward testing, in-sample, and out-of-sample: The\nprocess of testing a range of system parameters on historical price\ndata to find the \"best\" values for use in trading. For example, a\ntrading system that enters long when price makes an n-bar high might be\noptimized to find the value of n, from 10 to 100, that produces the most\nfavorable results. There is a great deal of debate over the benefits of\noptimization, because the process is often simply used to find system\nparameter values that produce the highest net profit on a certain set of\nhistorical data, with the expectation these values will produce similar\nresults in the future. However, this is rarely the case. Highly\noptimized parameters typically do nothing more than reflect the specific\ncircumstances of the data set from which they were derived; they will\ntypically underperform in the future because price action never unfolds\nexactly as it has in the past.\nSome traders believe optimization of any kind is potentially damaging.\nHowever, there is an argument that optimization can be used to find\nless-idealized but more reliable parameter settings by identifying\nranges of values with comparable, positive results. In the case of the\naforementioned n-bar breakout system, it might turn out that a 23-bar\nbreakout produced the best results over the initial test period, but the\nresults for 20-, 21-, 22-, 24-, 25-, and 26-bar breakouts were all\nnegative, and even n values up to 30 produced sub-par results. This\nsuggests the 23-bar results were an anomaly, and using this parameter\nwould likely result in poor performance in the future. By contrast, if\nall n values from 35 to 47 produced positive, comparable results — even\nif they were much less profitable than the 23-bar breakout — a\nrepresentative value from this stable range (i.e., the median value, 41)\nis much more likely to produce success in actual trading.\nTypically, parameter values are optimized on an initial data set (the\n\"test,\" \"sample\" or \"in-sample\" data), and then tested on a new,\ndifferent data set (the \"out-of-sample\" data) to simulate the process of\ntrading the system. This can be repeated several times — the process of\n\"walking the system forward\" on new data is the reason this approach is\nreferred to as \"walk-forward\" optimization. If the optimized values do\nnot perform consistently on new, out-of-sample data, they are not suited\nfor trading. Some system designers choose to re-optimize system\nparameters on relatively short data periods and use these parameters on\nthe next set of data, believing the price behavior from the more recent\npast has a greater chance of persisting into the near future. Others\nbelieve this simply results in a highly optimized system that will\nalways be one step behind the market.\nFinally, among the many problems of optimization is the challenge of\ndetermining what constitutes a \"best-performing\" value. Traders are apt\nto look exclusively at net profit, without incorporating measures of\nrisk (e.g., drawdown depth and duration) and consistency (e.g., winning\npercentage, average trade) that are likely to make future profitability\nmore likely.\n\nPoint-and-figure charts display price independently of time. Price advances and declines are represented by columns of Xs and Os, respectively. (Note: Charting programs often replace Os with squares.) Each time price advances by a certain amount, called the \"box size,\" an X is added to the ascending column of Xs. For example, when analyzing a stock, a box size of 1.00 point would mean an X would be added every time price gained 1.00 point. If the box size was .50, an X would be added every time price rallied 0.50 points, and so on.\n\nTo begin plotting a column of Os, price first has to decline a certain amount, called the reversal size. A reversal size of \"2\" would mean price would have to drop by two box sizes before you would end a column of ascending Xs and begin plotting a column of descending Os. Similarly, to begin a new column of Xs, price would have to turn back up at least 2.00 points.\n\nThe larger the box and reversal sizes, the more price fluctuations a point-and-figure chart will filter out. For more detail, you simply decrease those values.\n\nPurchasing power parity: The idea that an exchange rate should reflect the level that results in the same price (in the two currencies) for a product purchased in two countries. For example, if a certain automobile costs 50,000 British pounds in Great Britain, it should cost 25,000 U.S. dollars in the United States if the current British pound/U.S. dollar rate (GBP/USD) is 2.0000.\nBack to top\n\nQ R\n\nQuantitative easing is a tool a central bank uses to attempt to stimulate the economy when cutting interest rates is not feasible — such as when rates are already at or near zero. Through quantitative easing, the central bank purchases assets (e.g., treasuries, mortgages, securities) from financial institutions to pump money into the financial system. Quantitative easing is often referred to as \"printing money.\" Critics contend the practice runs a high risk of creating high inflation, among other drawbacks.\n\nR2 (r-squared): A measure of correlation strength. It is the square of the correlation coefficient, which is the measure of association of two variables ranging from +1 (perfect positive correlation) to -1 (perfect negative correlation), where zero represents no correlation. R-squared is always a positive number, ranging from zero to +1.\n\nSimple moving average (SMA). The simple moving average (SMA) is the mean price of a stock, futures contract, currency, or other instrument over a specific time period:\n\nN-day moving average = Sum (Pricet, Pricet-1 … Pricet-N)/N\n\nwhere,\n\nPricet = today's price\nPricet-N = price N days ago\n\nFor example, a 20-day SMA is the sum of the prices of the most recent 20 days, divided by 20.\nThe closing price is usually used in moving average calculations, although the high, low, opening price, or average price of a price bar is sometimes substituted. As the market moves forward in time, the newest price is added to the average and the oldest is dropped from it.\nMoving averages can be calculated for any time increment – daily, intraday, weekly, monthly. For a five-minute bar chart, for example, a 10-bar SMA would be the average price of the 10 most recent five-minute bars. Moving averages are typically used to highlight trend direction and filter out smaller fluctuations (or \"noise\") from a data series. The degree to which they do this depends on the length of the average: A longer moving average reflects a longer-term trend and filters out shorter-term fluctuations, while a shorter moving average reflects the more immediate trend and filters out less noise. However, this filtering comes at a cost: The longer the average, the more it lags behind the movements of the data series.\n\nThe European currency \"snake:\" A short-lived agreement among European member states in the early 1970s to limit currency fluctuations within a proscribed percentage band.\n\nStandard error channel (linear regression channel): The linear regression line is a straight line that minimizes the distance between itself and every data point in a series. A standard error measures the variance from the linear regression. Subtracting the standard error from the linear regression line yields the bottom of the standard error channel, and adding it to the linear regression value gives you the top of the channel.\n\nThe standard error channel is a parallel concept to Bollinger Bands, which use the standard deviation calculation to set boundaries above and below a moving average to capture variance away from the average. Because the moving average is a wavy line, the Bollinger bands are wavy, too, and also widen or narrow as variability rises or falls. The standard error does the same thing, only with straight lines. The critical difference is that you don't need to choose a starting and ending point for Bollinger Bands, because they track a moving average that constantly discards old data and refreshes itself with new data. To construct a useful linear regression channel, however, you have to subjectively select starting and ending points.\n\nSupport and resistance: Support is a price level that acts as a \"floor,\" preventing prices from dropping below that level. Resistance is the opposite: a price level that acts as a \"ceiling;\" a barrier that prevents prices from rising higher.\n\nSupport and resistance levels are a natural outgrowth of the interaction of supply and demand in any market. For example, increased demand for a stock will cause its price to rise, creating an uptrend. But when price has risen to a certain level, traders and investors will take profits and short sellers will come into the market, creating \"resistance\" to further price increases. Price may retreat from and advance to this resistance level many times, sometimes eventually breaking through it and continuing the previous trend, other times reversing completely.\n\nSupport and resistance should be thought of more as general price levels rather than precise prices. For example, if a stock makes a low of 52.15, rallies slightly, then declines again to 52.15, then rallies again, a subsequent move down to 52 does not violate the \"support level\" of 52.15. In this case, the fact that the stock retraced once to the exact price level it had established before is more of a coincidence than anything else.\n\nTrue range (TR): A measure of price movement or volatility that accounts for the gaps that occur between price bars. This calculation provides a more accurate reflection of the size of a price move over a given period than the standard range calculation, which is simply the high of a price bar minus the low of a price bar. The true range calculation was developed by Welles Wilder and discussed in his book New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems (Trend Research, 1978).True range can be calculated on any time frame or price bar — five-minute, hourly, daily, weekly, etc. Using daily price bars as an example, true range is the greatest (absolute) distance of the following:\n1. Today's high and today's low.\n2. Today's high and yesterday's close.\n3. Today's low and yesterday's close.\n\nAverage true range (ATR) is simply a moving average of the true range over a certain time period. For example, the five-day ATR would be the average of the true range calculations over the last five days.\nBack to top\n\nU V\n\nUlcer Index: A measure of the depth and duration of a drawdown from an equity peak.\n\nVariance and standard deviation: Variance measures how spread out a group of values are — in other words, how much they vary. Mathematically, variance is the average squared \"deviation\" (or difference) of each number in the group from the group's mean value, divided by the number of elements in the group. For example, for the numbers 8, 9, and 10, the mean is 9 and the variance is:\n\n{(8-9)2 + (9-9)2 + (10-9)2}/3 = (1 + 0 + 1)/3 = 0.667\n\nNow look at the variance of a more widely distributed set of numbers: 2, 9, and 16:\n\n{(2-9)2 + (9-9)2 + (16-9)2}/3 = (49 + 0 + 49)/3 = 32.67\n\nThe more varied the prices, the higher their variance — the more widely distributed they will be. The more varied a market's price changes from day to day (or week to week, etc.), the more volatile that market is.\nA common application of variance in trading is standard deviation, which is the square root of variance. The standard deviation of 8, 9, and 10 is: sq. rt. 0.667 = .82; the standard deviation of 2, 9, and 16 is: sq. rt. 32.67 = 5.72.\n\nVolatility: The level of price movement in a market. Historical (\"statistical\") volatility measures the price fluctuations (usually calculated as the standard deviation of closing prices) over a certain time period — e.g., the past 20 days. Implied volatility is the current market estimate of future volatility as reflected in the level of option premiums. The higher the implied volatility, the higher the option premium.\nBack to top"

      "text": "CFD Trading Strategies\n\nWith the recent developments of mobile trading technology, a broader audience of traders now has access to the CFD markets and many of these investors are disinterested in using the traditional buy and hold strategies that have typically been implemented previously. Fortunately, CFD trading offers a diversified array of trading strategies that are well-suited for all investment styles, market environments and financial goals. Some of these strategies are more appropriate for leveraged trades, so a detailed analysis of each method should be undertaken before real money is invested in these markets.\nOne advantage of these trading methods of that they can be applied to a wide variety of financial instruments and this essentially means that these methods have been researched and back-tested by traders in many different markets. It should be noted that most trading styles are much shorter in duration than what is seen with traditional stock investing but when looking at these shorter time frames, technical analysis tends to have greater levels of success. Here we will look at the three foundational approaches taken by technical CFD traders when they look to establish new positions: Trend Trading, Range Trading, and Contrarian Trading. There are many variations that can be taken but these three approaches form the basis of nearly every other commonly used trading method.\n\nTrend Trading\n\nOne of the first maxims new traders hear is that the \"trend is your friend.\" The essential argument is that most asset classes tend to trade with an underlying momentum that can be identified by looking at price activity as well as technical chart indicators such as the ADX or MACD. Up-trends are generally defined as being comprised of a series of higher highs combined with a series of higher lows. In contrast, downtrends are seen when lower highs are combined with lower lows in price activity. Many CFDs tutorials often advise new traders to look for trends and establish trade ideas based on the underlying momentum, as this is an easy way to turn the forecasting probabilities into your favor.\n\nRange Trading\n\nRange trading conditions occur when prices are confined by upper and lower limits, which prohibit an asset from establishing a clear trend in either direction. Ranges are defined by support and resistance levels, which are areas where prices have historically met selling pressure (resistance) or met active buyers (support), pushing prices higher. Buying positions are generally established when prices obey support levels and sell positions are favored when prices fail at previously established resistance. Additionally, profit targets are very clear with range trading methods, as many traders will look to close long trades when prices approach resistance and to close sell trades when prices approach support.\n\nContrarian Trading\n\nContrarian is probably the most difficult CFD trading strategies, as it requires a great deal more practice in identifying critical reversal points on your charts. One common characteristic of a successful reversal entry occurs when prices have extended too far in one direction without any corrective retracements. Chart indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) can be used to clearly see when prices have become \"overbought\" or \"oversold\" and these areas can be used to establish new contrarian positions.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe trading strategies outlined in this article comprise the basis from which most other CFD trading styles are generated. These strategies achieve higher levels of probability when combined with other method, such as a fundamental analysis of the macro economic factors affecting prices or the use of technical indicators to remove some of the subjectivity from your chart analysis"

People often call it 'The change', 'the change for the day', or 'up for the day'. We call it, the up for the day filter.\n\nI'm sure you've seen a table like this. For each stock it shows you the change from the close in dollars, and also in percent. We also track this data a third way, which shows how big the change looks on a stock chart.\n\nThe first thing to notice is that some of these numbers are positive, and some are negative. Let me sort by the '% Change' field to group those together. All the positive numbers are stocks which are up for the day. FAZ is up just over 5% today. VGK is is down about 2%. A change of negative two means down by 2%.\n\nThe numbers in this table are exactly the same as the numbers you'd put into our filters.\n\nLet's start with a simple example. If I only want to see stocks which are up for the day, I'd set a minimum of 0%. If I only want to see stocks which are down, I'd set a maximum of 0%. Notice that the minimum field always points up, to more positive numbers. The maximum field always points down, to more negative numbers.\n\nLet's try something slightly more complicated. The market as a whole was down a little more than a percent today. Let's say that I want to see things that did better than average today. So I'll set my min to -1.15%. This is a min, so I'll see everything that's doing better than that value. In a separate window I'll set my max to -1.15%. Don't let the negative numbers trip you up. Min always points to the green end, and max always points to the red end.\n\nOf course, you can do even more. Let's look at stocks that did similar to the market as a whole. Let's look at stocks in the range of negative 1/2 to negative 1 and 1/2. Again, don't let the negative numbers trip you up. 'Min' always means 'this and higher'. 'Max' always means 'this and lower'.\n\nWhat happens if I set the max below the min? In this case I see everything which was below the max and also everything above the min. This is the opposite of the previous query. This shows everything that moved a lot differently than the market as a whole.\n\nI've shown you a few examples, but you can do more on your own. Click the link on the left to do this yourself. I'll get you started. Let's say that you want everything that's down by at least 3% today. Would that be a minimum of negative 3? Nope. That's exactly the opposite of what I wanted. Let me try again. I want everything worse than -3, so let me try the maximum. That's it! I got it.\n\nYou can try anything, just to see what the results will look like. This is a powerful tool, so don't be afraid to spend some time investigating it."

      "text": "Binary Options vs Gambling\n\nGambling is a common pastime for those who are financially well off. Some are looking to become more well off; others are simply looking for an opportunity to pass the time. A smaller fraction of the gambling population is simply addicted to the slots and machines. What many people don't know is that there's an even smaller population of gamblers, a subset that would prefer to refer to themselves as traders. This terminology isn't simply a gimmick to remove the association of chance from the money-making equation. Rather, it's a suitable specification that helps to affiliate it with the public market – the home of the stock market.\n\nThere are several key differences between regular gambling and trading. For one, where gambling is a one-time shot, trading can be more or less considered a legitimate investment. Through your decisions, you'll come to acquire pieces of the public market which you can manage as you see fit for the best monetary outcome. The more you trade, the better you become at the art; thus, the more likely you are to make a profit in the future. Gambling, as we all know, is all sheer luck. Whether it be the push of a button or the pull of a switch, the odds are all programmed into the machines.\n\nAnother difference between the two is that, just like stocks, the fluctuations in price of assets involved in trading are directly tied to their corresponding markets. This is the key element where your knowledge of the market your betting on will determine the probability of you placing your money in the right place. If we speak honestly, the entire stock market is essentially one large gamble. Even players who have trained and studied the system and their options risk huge financial losses. Trading binary options is no different, but there's still the edge of logical reasoning and decision-making absent in conventional gambling.\n\nGetting your foot into binary trading is as simple as beginning basic deconstruction of the primary principles and an assessment of assets you can make the most informed decision about. From there, you can expand your knowledge and holdings until you reach a stress-free payout."

      "text": "What is the Stock Market?\n\nThe stock market is a public exchange or place where stocks and bonds are traded. Wall Street is another term for the stock market. When stocks and bonds are bought and sold, that is known as trading. Prices on the stock market rise and fall each business day, so the price of stocks change regularly. Investors and stock traders make money when they buy equities at a low price, hold onto them for a certain amount of time, and then sell them when the value of the stock increases. This is how people investing in the stock market and Wall Street make money.\n\nHow Investors Use the Stock Market\n\nWhen investors buy a stock, they are purchasing a share of that company. Most investors purchase shares in large quantities, especially when the stock price is low. This means they feel that the company's stock price is lower than the actual value of it. The investor purchases shares of their desired company at the current stock price and then sells the stock when they feel the price has increased sufficiently. Equities can both increase and decrease due to market forces, so there is a degree of risk when dealing with the stock market.\n\nWall Street and the Stock Market\n\nWall Street is another name for the stock market in the United States. In other markets around the world, they are known by the most prominent street of the financial district. At the stock market, institutional traders and stock brokers are responsible for buying and selling stocks for investors. Most of the buying and selling of stock happens electronically now, with many investors and traders doing it online.\n\nAny investor that is considering playing the stock market must be aware of the risk they are taking. They should educate themselves through research and do their due diligence in the companies they plan to invest in. It is almost always wise to diversify investments on Wall Street so that that risk is spread out over the performance of many stocks or mutual funds. If you aren't sure how you should be investing, an advisor can help you make these kinds of decisions"

      "text": "Kevin Drum\n\nIn my previous post I wrote about the disclosure that, for a price, investors can get access to the University of Michigan consumer confidence index a few minutes before the usual 10 am release time. In fact, high-speed traders pay to get access just two seconds earlier than everyone else. I concluded that instead of having to work harder or risk breaking the law to get early information, as in the past, \"now you just have to pay a fee in order to guarantee that you can take all the ordinary schlubs to the cleaners.\" Felix Salmon, ever the contrarian when it comes to little guys getting screwed by Wall Street, tweeted back:\n\nDear @kdrum, how exactly are ordinary schlubs being taken to the cleaners here?\n\nWell, here's my case, in convenient list form:\n\nWall Street traders are paying for this early information.\n\nThey aren't idiots. They'd only do this if they could make trading profits based on their insider knowledge.\n\nNo new money is created by making this information available to a few well-heeled traders a few minutes before everyone else. It's a zero-sum game.\n\nThus, someone is getting the short end of these trades.\n\nThat someone must be the people who aren't paying for early access. There's no one else these traders could be taking advantage of.\n\nAnd who are these folks? I don't know. But almost by definition, once the snowball rolls all the way downhill the answer has to be people who aren't plugged in and don't have the money to buy early access. In other words, ordinary schlubs.\n\nI'll grant that this argument isn't 100% watertight. It's possible that the early-access crowd all spend a few minutes fighting with each other, and by the time 10 am rolls around the market is exactly where it would have been otherwise. It's also possible that Wall Street's sharpest traders pay for this information in order to get better returns for the widows and orphans funds they run. But I don't believe in the tooth fairy and I don't believe in either of these things either.\n\nBottom line: the release of financial information moves markets. If you have early access to this information, it means you have privileged insight into how the market is going to move five minutes from now. That's a moneymaker, and the money is made from all the people who trade with you during the period when you know more than they do.\n\nWall Street pros, of course, have always known more than most of us. They work harder, they have more training, they have Bloomberg terminals, etc. That's produced a skyrocketing amount of unproductive financial activity over the past few decades, but usually in ways that are at least marginally defensible. This latest disclosure, however, is almost a parody of unproductive financial activity. Not only is it obviously socially useless, but there's just something a lot rawer about providing an early release of supposedly public financial information to a chosen few who are willing to fork over a bit of squeeze. Welcome to the schlubocracy.\n\nUPDATE: Karl Smith provides a more macro version of this argument here. It's worth a read. Friedman also"

      "text": "Understand What It Means To Online Stock Market Trade\n\nAs you begin your journey into online stock market trading you'll find that it can be overwhelming from time to time to get started. Factually speaking most new to the markets go through this and it's commonly referred to as the beginner's learning curve. To make understanding online stock market trading a fun and quick adoption remember a few things.\n\nRemember Part Time Still Deserves All Attention\n\nFirst remember that though success in investing or trading can be accomplished part time it would behoove you to place all of your attention in your preparation and while placing trades. I don't think it is any harder to find profitable set ups as a part time trader and it may be more beneficial for controlling emotions, but there is a difference. Here at Stocks and Stocks we consider two prime time trade zones in the morning session.\n\nTime To Trade With Back story\n\nMost trades taken by someone with experience tend to occur within the first 2 hours of the day, but this is not mandatory nor does it have to be the case. We should remind ourselves that everyone takes a lunch break and that includes other traders. So be mindful of the fact that the lunch hour or two can become slow and choppy and is generally avoided. The next time zone of influence would be the afternoon session which we consider as after 12:15 PM CST, but before 2:30 PM CST. When available during this time remain undisturbed in your analysis.\n\nTry This Trading Tip Now Instead of Down The Line\n\nGenerally as a trader progresses and makes the determination that this truly is the path desired a valuable tip is hopefully afforded to them. That tip is to learn what you're doing well enough to be able to teach it to the next person. This will instill confidence in what you're doing. Though you don't have to share it with anyone you should still master your own niche within the market you choose."

A stock exchange is a trading entity where stocks and other commodities and securities are traded. This includes stocks that encompass futures, options and derivatives. ATSs, which stands for alternative trading systems, and ECNs, which stands for electronic communications networks are also traded on stock exchanges. Shares of companies' stocks, bonds, and other monetary units are also bought and sold at stock exchanges.\n\nMajor United States Stock Exchanges. The major stock exchanges in the United States are the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq Stock Market (NASDAQ).\n\nMajor Canadian Stock Exchange. The Toronto Stock Exchange in Canada includes TSX Venture Exchange, a merger of the Vancouver, Alberta, and Winnipeg stock exchanges.\n\nMajor European Stock Exchanges.

Both countries created central banks that were fundamentally similar to the Federal Reserve of USA. Along the line, their scope was customized to their domestic needs and they diverged from their model.\n\nFor the foreign exchange operations most significant are repurchase agreements to sell the same security back at the same price at a predetermined date in the future (usually within 15 days), and at a specific rate of interest. This arrangement amounts to a temporary injection of reserves into the banking system. The impact on the foreign exchange market is that the dollar should weaken. The repurchase agreements may be either customer repos or system repos.\n\nThe Inverse Head-and-Shoulders formation is a mirror image of the Head-and-Shoulders Forex Pattern. Therefore, you can apply the same characteristics, potential problems, signals, and trader's point of view from the preceding presentation.\n\nThe head-and-shoulders pattern is one of the most reliable and wellknown chart formations. It consists of three consecutive rallies. The first and third rallies—the shoulders—have about the same height, and the middle one—the head—is the highest. All three rallies are based on the same support line (or on the resistance line in the case of the reversed head-and-shoulders formation), known as the neckline.\n\nFundamentally, the minimal lot size for a trade is $10,000. Thus the leverage limitations are set according to the amount you choose to trade, for instance, for the above lot of 10,000$ for a trade size of 25$ the maximum leverage is 400, for 50 the leverage is 200 and for trade of 100$ we have the leverage of 100."

      "text": "Have you ever observed the Stock dealer's screen having market operators glued to it with anxious, anticipating glances? The screen shows rows of figures in a dynamic state, changing instantaneously. Now, to analyze these figures closely, let's go back to the definition of \"market\". A market is a place where the sellers of a product (or service) and its buyers converge. The market forces of demand and supply determine the price at which the trades are affected i.e. the price at which the sellers are willing to sell the product and the buyers are willing to buy the product.\n\nSimilarly, the Stock Market is the place where the sellers and buyers of shares of companies trade and the same forces of demand and supply determine the price of trade. The share market provides an electronic platform, unlike the normal markets where the buyers and sellers are known.\n\nThe orders are placed and executed electronically through a stock exchange which gives its dealers electronic platforms to place bids to buy and sell. The stock exchange server maintains an order book for all the orders that its members place (whether buy or sell). The software determines the price of a stock based upon the demand and supply. Here is a simplistic example of how this is achieved. The stock of Company A is currently trading at $ 30.7800.\n\nBuy orders Sell Orders\n\nShares Price Shares Price\n\n600 30.800 800 30.7800\n\n400 30.775 700 30.775\n\nIt can be seen above that the buy orders at this price (demand) is 600 shares while sell order (supply) is 800 shares. As supply is more than demand, therefore the price of the stock would fall. In this case, the next lower order is at 30.775.So the next instant price would be 30.775. It must be noted that the order book is in a dynamic state and contains all the orders of the members. This is the microscopic view of changing demand and supply and corresponding prices of the stock. This is a very fast process almost taking fraction of seconds. In the real life, it is hard to make out such interaction and supply and the \"stock quote\" at any instant gives the price of any stock at any given time.\n\nThe price, volume and other details comprise the Stock quotes at that instant if the market is open or closing price if the market is closed. The other accompanied details apart from price are\n\nVolume – The total number of shares traded\nClosing price – The Previous Closing price.\n\nThere are other details as well. Let's see a typical example of stock quote of Microsoft Corporation as on 19/06/2009\n\nThere are many websites that also give other parameters like EPS (earning per share) P/E price earning ratios etc. These data help to make competitive analysis of stock with respect to its past performance, stock of companies engaged in similar business and with respect to the main indices of the market.\n\nWe Provide Horse Rentals for horseback riding adventure vacations in the mountains.

People and companies have diverse needs for enclosed trailers. Contractors will use them for safe and secure equipment storage and transport. Race car or vintage car owners will use them for transporting their valuable property all over the country. Bike owners will use them to get their motorcycles to rides, rallies or other events. Enclosed trailers can even be customized with full living quarters, cabinetry, bathroom and showers.\n\nCustomizing an enclosed trailer to suit your specific needs is the best way to utilize the space and get the most out of your cargo trailer. Here are some ideas on how you can customize your trailer depending on how you plan to use it:\n\nCar Hauler Trailer – first you'll want to choose the right size trailer, at least 8.5 feet in width and 16 feet long but you can go up to 53 in length. You can also choose ball hitch, gooseneck, or fifth wheel hitch. You'll want a heavy duty ramp door and interior flooring. You may choose e-track for the floor and/or wall, floor mount and/or wall mount D-rings, fold down stabilizer jacks, interior lighting, and custom cabinetry. You can even spice it up with a checkered tile floor and white vinyl walls.\n\nMotorcycle Trailers – here, too, you'll want to choose the right size trailer. 7′x14′ V-nose tandem axle is a popular size for toy haulers. You should even be able to haul 2 bikes in a staggered layout with this size. Bike owners often choose wheel chocks to keep the bikes in place. You'll want to get the ramp door for easy loading and there are options for custom cabinetry and living quarters.\n\nEquipment Trailers – contractors and moving companies will choose enclosed cargo trailers for safe and secure storage and transport of their equipment and valuable goods. The size of the enclosed trailer really depends on the projected size of the jobs and equipment needed. A contractor may do well with an 12-16 foot long trailer. A moving company will likely need a range of sizes from 12 feet to 38 feet. Trailers can be customized with floor and wall mount D-Rings, shelving, cabinets, lighting, electrical packages, side entry doors, steps, ramps, and more.\n\nHorse and Stock Trailers – these trailers are often designed specifically for use with transporting large animals so they will come with windows, a tack room, head and shoulder dividers, floor mats, feed doors, interior lighting, vents, and more. There are options for 2,3, or 4 horse trailers.\n\nIdentifying your projected use for an enclosed trailer is the first step in determining what kind of customizations will work best. Sizing, axles, interior and exterior modifications, electrical, structural changes, living quarters packages – almost anything is possible in terms of customizing an enclosed trailer to meet exact owner specifications. Be sure to find a trailer dealer or manufacturer who can accommodate any add-ons or accessories you want.\n\nGive ones Tow Vehicle the Upkeep it DeservesIn yesteryear, this newsletter has discussed the benefit of providing regular maintenance in your horse trailer.

You'd understand more about the functionality of trailers for construction purposes. Trailers and construction equipment have been an integral part of many construction companies. They play a major role in shaping up the construction world and are needed for almost any project they undertake. A lot of companies are thinking of renting or leasing used trailers mainly due to the fact that they are pretty expensive. It makes sense as they are being used for a limited period of time, and investing a huge amount of money is not entirely feasible. Industries must also look into the space to be allotted when hiring a trailer, and if they buy it, they need to allot a permanent space for keeping it long term. A lot of people are searching for cargo trailers, motorcycle trailers as well as horse trailers, but most of the times end up confused as to which one would suit them. They would realize at some point that choosing a trailer could be an arduous task. Considering the fact that there're plenty of trailer manufacturers, it's not surprising that they are finding it difficult to choose among various trailer types in the market. You must remember that you need to consider plenty of factors when thinking of buying a new or a used trailer. First and foremost, you should look for trailer manufacturers that have a good brand name. You must also understand that you would get the product you paid for, and there's no harm to adopt a watchful wait and approach method to get the best trailer that suits your construction purpose as well as your budget.Companies must decide which trailer types match their requirement and this would surely help them narrow down on trailer manufacturers. These days, you can get trailers for any kind of cargo, be it bikes, concessions to horses. If you need to haul the trailer, then there're trailers meant to haul or can easily be converted for that specific job. When you're finally done with the trailer manufacturers and have chosen the right one, the next step is to figure out what trailer size you'd need. It must be noted that trailers come in various lengths and widths. If you're looking to buy or rent an enclosed trailer, then you would also have to consider the trailer's interior height. If you need to be inside the trailer when the trailer's being hauled, then you also have to make sure the height of the interiors is tall enough for you to be able to stand without stooping.Your next step when choosing the trailer would be to figure out whether you need an enclosed or an open trailer. Basically, an open trailer is one that exposes the cargo you're planning to ship to outside elements. In case the weather is just fine to move your cargo to a different place and there's no sign of any snow or rain, then open trailers are the most convenient and economical choice. Open trailers could be priced anywhere from $ 900 to $ 2500. Open utility trailers suits very well for many useful purposes to include smaller landscaping businesses that are just beginning to establish themselves and are looking for something to haul their landscaping equipment. Over time, their business would have eventually grown to better heights and they have options now to move to enclosed trailers. However, the open trailers would still be very useful to haul many materials to include rock, mulch and plants.An upside to open trailers is the overall weight. They are comparatively lighter and offer less aerodynamic lug when you compare to enclosed trailers. Though open trailers are very beneficial and economical, you can't expect utmost protection of the cargo being shipped from the outside elements and you need to study the weather report before even dispatching your materials. On the other hand, enclosed trailers offer the protection and you can be rest assured about your cargo shipment. You can also expect additional security in enclosed trailers as they come with functions like lockable, portable storage building. Enclosed trailers are heavier and lot less aerodynamically stable when compared to open trailers. An enclosed trailer normally costs $ 1600 to $ 5000 and can go a bit higher too. There are a lot of dealers dealing trailers on the web. You need to understand your requirement, and then search trailer types by trailer manufacturers. You can also avail attractive discounts from dealers. It's also imperative that you have a good relationship with your dealer for future purchases. For example, if you need any type of trailer in the future, you can solely depend on your dealer to get the best trailer at a reasonable rate without having to intervene much.\n\nTrucksbay.com is an ideal online site when searching for used trailers beseeming your requirement. You can go through used trailers for sale inventory by travel manufacturers and then decide on renting, leasing or buying bigger or smaller office trailers that match your requirement rest assured that quality is never a compromise and value for your time, money and patience greatly considered.\n\nThe UK Driving License Requirements for Towing a Horse Trailer, or Driving a HorseboxThe legal requirements from the DVLA rules determining who can tow a horse trailer or drive a horsebox, are pretty complicated! They are mainly dependant on when you passed your driving license, with people passing in 1996 or earlier being legally able to do a lot more. This means, for us youngsters, that we have to take additional tests.In order to simplify these rules, I'll split the horseboxes/trailers into 3 groups:1. Can I tow a Horse Trailer? – Did you get your driving license before 1st January 1997?\n\nIf the answer is 'Yes', then you're fine to drive any vehicle/trailer combo up to 8.25 tonnes. This will cover almost every horse trailer/vehicle!\n\nIf the answer is 'No', then you may need to pass an additional test to upgrade from a category B license to a category B+E license. To find out if you need to take the extra test, you need to know:\n\nThe unladen weight of your towing vehicle (A) The MAM (Maximum Authorised Mass) of your towing vehicle (B) The MAM of your trailer (C)You can find out these specifications from either your vehicle/trailer's guidebook or from the manufacturer.Rules: Towing vehicle's MAM must be less than 3500kgs (B < 3500kg) The trailer's MAM must be less than the vehicle's unladen weight (C < A) The trailer's MAM + the vehicle's MAM must be less than 3500kgs (B + C < 3500kg)If you break any of these rules, then you will need to upgrade your license to gain category B+E. Go to the DVLA website for more information on this test and how to book it. At the time of writing, this test costs 115 (\n\nHorse insurance is usually taken to cover oneself getting injured while riding a horse, cover oneself from claims made by a third party due to any accidents caused by the horse, medical cover for treating horses, the death of the horse and also cover for a permanent loss of use. This last clause is an important aspect as if the horse becomes incapacitated due to an accident the owner of a horse that has been used for various commercial purposes will not be able to use it for those purposes in the future. The other important cover horse insurance includes is the cover for theft of the horse, and even damages caused to the horse trailer. These are some of the coverage options that are available when an owner takes out an insurance policy on a horse or a group of horses. In the case of trailer insurance, the insurance provider will determine the condition of the trailer separately from the horse and calculate the premium for the trailer coverage. The horse owner should be very careful when signing up with an insurance provider. There are various sub-clauses in every policy and the owner must read all the clauses. For death insurance, some insurance providers add a clause stating that death coverage is only applicable when the horse dies at the place where it is taken care of. When the horse is transported by train or ship to some other place for a show or a competition and the horse dies during transit, the owner will not be able to claim for the death of the horse. Also the horse owner has to be very careful to read the clauses and sub clauses regarding personal injury coverage. The provider may only cover medical expenses or it may also cover the loss of income in the future if the person is not be able to work due to the accident. When the owner chooses horse insurance, the owner may plan to cover the horse and its related accessories such as the saddle and also insurance coverage against accidents and injuries. The additional costs of coverage for these more minor problems is usually minimal, and when purchased together as a package they may be the best bet for your horse insurance. On the other hand, some policy providers will throw in all of these extras to increase the price of the policy, so choose a policy which offers the best bang for your buck.\n\nPassion\n\nOne of the essential responsibilities on the shoulders of a Leader is to constantly generate a spark in his team about the ideology of life like success, passion and quotes can help you to add trustworthiness to your words.\n\nPassion Quotes are quotes about how to live with a compassion on fire. When you place yourself on fire, people love to come and see you burn. Passion Quotes cheer one to live a successful life through understanding and pursuing one's own path, not chasing after the dreams of others.\n\nNobody can be successful unless he loves his work. One person with passion is better than forty people merely interested.\n\nPassion creates a hard core feeling of Do or Die.\n\nWithout passion man is a mere latent force and prospect, like the flint which awaits the shock of the iron before it can give forth its spark. Passion Quotes work as a spark to ignite the zeal within oneself. There is no greatness without a passion to be great, whether it's the aspiration of an athlete or an artist, a scientist, a parent, or any other person.\n\nOne of the things that may get in the way of people being lifelong learners is that they're not in touch with their passion.\n\nIf you're passionate about what it is you do, and then you're going to be looking for everything you can to get better at it. Our passions are the winds that propel our vessel. Without winds the vessel would not move.\n\nThus, we can say Passion is everything. Passion quotes and sayings promote people to Strive for excellence."

      "text": "New to Forex\n\nBasic Concepts of Forex Trading\n\nLearning to trade in a new market is like learning to speak a new language. It's easiest when you have a good vocabulary and understand some basic ideas and concepts. So let's start with the basics of forex trading before moving on to learn how to use FXCM's Trading Station II platform.\n\nForex is a popular term that means foreign exchange or currency trading, which is the buying and selling of currency. A forex trader purchases currencies that are undervalued and sells currencies that are overvalued; just as a stock trader purchases stock that is undervalued and sells stock that is overvalued. The familiar expression, \"buy low and sell high,\" certainly applies to forex trading as well.\n\nToday, forex trading is primarily done online through software or web-based trading platforms. If you have access to a personal computer or a cell phone, you most likely have everything that is required to trade forex with FXCM.\n\nOne of the best ways to learn how to trade forex is by learning from FXCM's DailyFX course instructors. The course instructors have nearly 100 years of combined experience between them. FXCM also offers free forex trading demo accounts, with $50,000 of virtual money, to help new traders learn to use FXCM's Trading Station II platform, risk-free.\n\nWHAT DOES IT MEAN TO \"BUY A CURRENCY PAIR?\"\n\nEach forex transaction involves the buying of one currency and the selling of another. For example, you might buy euros (EUR) while selling US dollars (USD). This transaction is often referred to as buying the EUR/USD currency pair.\n\nCurrency pairs are needed to create exchange rates, which tell you the value of one currency relative to another. For example, if the EUR/USD currency pair had an exchange rate of 1.3500 it would take $1.35 to exchange for 1 euro. If the EUR/USD currency pair had an exchange rate of 0.9500 it would take $0.95 to exchange for 1 euro. Forex traders essentially speculate on exchange rates by buying or selling currency pairs. The decision to buy or sell is determined by whether they think the exchange rate will go up or down.\n\nA pip is a common term that is used in the forex market. It refers to the smallest movement (not considering fractional pips) that a currency exchange rate can make. For example, if the GBP/USD exchange rate changed from 2.0010 to 2.0012, you could say that it increased by 2 pips.\n\nMost currency pair exchange rates are priced to the fourth decimal place, frequently making the fourth decimal place represent the pip value. However, for currency pairs like the USD/JPY, which are only priced to the second decimal place, the pip value is not the fourth decimal place but instead the second. So a two pip increase could be represented by a change of 85.35 to 85.37.\n\nCalculating price changes in pips helps you determine transaction costs, profit and loss on trades, among other things.\n\nA lot is the smallest trade size available and is determined by the account type. FXCM offers standardized trade sizes and the lot determines the trade sizes available as well.\n\nFor example, with an FXCM Standard account, the smallest lot size is 1,000 units of currency. Therefore, the smallest trade size is 1,000 units of currency. Additionally, Standard account holders can place trades of any size, so long as they are in increments of 1,000 units like, 5,000, 20,000, 30,000, 100,000, 310,000, etc.\n\nFXCM's Trading Station II platform is very intuitive, which means placing a forex trade with FXCM is a simple process. In addition to watching the educational video below, which will visually explain how to place a forex trade, we encourage new traders to call one of our platform specialists today and request a free platform walkthrough.\n\nFXCM's highly trained support team is willing and ready to provide personalized platform walkthroughs over the phone, free of charge. Call a platform specialist today to request your free platform walkthrough at 1800 109 751.\n\nFXCM offers two order types, stop orders and limit orders, that allow you to control the risk on your trades, and we recommend that you use these orders whenever possible. A limit is placed on the winning side of your trade and a stop is placed on the losing side of your trade. If the market price reaches either the stop price or the limit price that you define, your live trade will attempt to be closed.\n\nWHAT IS LEVERAGE?\n\nOne of the reasons forex trading is attractive to some individuals is because it can be traded with leverage. Leverage allows an individual to control market positions that exceed the equity available in the trader's account. For example, a trader may have $5,000 of equity in their account, but still open a trade size with a value equivalent to $10,000. This would represent a position that is leveraged 2:1 because the market position is twice as large as the equity in the account.\n\nFXCM AU offers a maximum of approximately 200:1 leverage. Leverage is a double-edged sword and can dramatically amplify your profits. It can also just as dramatically amplify your losses. Trading foreign exchange with any level of leverage may not be suitable for all investors"

She loves them, I think they're all charlatans who target soft-brained people with insecurities and I have proof. Here it is:\n\nLogic. If I could tell the future I'd be a billionaire, not telling fortunes for $20 a pop.\n\nThe fact no one ever wants to tell your fortune without getting paid.\n\nThe fact that a Buddhist monk fortune-teller once told my first wife that she was going to marry a military man. At the time I was sitting beside her with a US Marine hair cut. ''Holy'' indeed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Australia, we once paid for a fortune-teller to ''entertain us'' after dinner. He was incredible. The restaurant owner told us later that his modus operandi was to come in early and earwig his victim's dinner conversation.\n\nIt's like religion. A hole down which you can throw all your questions and uncertainties and get some form of an answer. We all need that.\n\nBut we all know the truth. It's hocus-pocus and my wife isn't stupid, she is just choosing to enjoy the show whereas I choose to bag it. She chooses to believe it, which is very different from actually believing it. And she is the better for it, if only for the entertaining moment she is there with her palm held out and her brain in fantasy land. It's worth it for that alone.\n\nI have also learnt, as a stockbroker, not to push my views about fortune-tellers too far or she attacks me with some indisputable truths, such as, ''What's the difference between a stockbroker and a fortune-teller? You only lose $20 with a fortune-teller,'' and, ''At least fortune-tellers know they're making it up.''\n\nWell dear, stockbroking is actually very different from fortune-telling. Yes, a lot of people think finance professionals are there to tell the future and a lot of young brokers join the industry thinking this is their job, but before we get to predictions there are a lot of other functions we provide first.\n\nThe execution of trades, for instance. The administration of share trading. The administration of share holdings. Portfolio advice (standard moron portfolio stuff at this stage). Financial planning and access to products such as cash-management trusts, margin lending and fixed interest.\n\nOf course, so far all these things are within the capabilities of a professional functionary, some are offered online and many broking relationships survive simply on this level. There are no wild money-making ideas or ''trust'', just a conduit between what a broking house offers and its clients. A fair bit of value and we still haven't even mentioned the fortune-telling yet.\n\nNow the services get more personal, including the broker's own ideas, listening to your ideas and the beginnings of a relationship.\n\nBrokers have access to a network of ideas and the best ideas come from having someone to bounce them off. You don't get that online.\n\nThen there are two other essential services. One, a hand to hold in times of trouble - your own personal sharemarket shrink. Essential objectivity, which is not, by definition, possible alone. And two, access to someone with sharemarket experience. The sharemarket is all about going through hoops, financial and emotional, and who better to talk to than someone who has been through them all before.\n\nExperience is something that can be very costly to acquire alone.\n\nAnd finally there comes trust and friendship, things that can endure for a lifetime and become more valuable than the money. And still we haven't mentioned fortune-telling.\n\nFootnote: OK, so my first wife ran off with a marine but it's just that old stockbroking rule at work again. Make enough predictions and even a Buddhist monk will get a couple right.\n\nMarcus Padley is a stockbroker with Patersons Securities and the author of sharemarket newsletter Marcus Today. His views do not necessarily reflect the views of Patersons."

      "text": "Options Trading & Analysis\n\nHow To Hedge Your Stock Positions Using Collars - Part Two\n\nA \"Costless Collar\" Another typical configuration of a collar is what is known as a \"costless\" collar. Here, you buy an out-of-the-money (lower strike) put on the stock and sell an out-of-the-money (higher strike) call for about the same amount of premium.\n\nGraph 2 shows an example of a \"costless\" collar. Here we hedged our 100 shares of Apple by writing the January 2008 $75 call for $9.95 and buying the January $65 put for premium of $10.30. This combination gives us a small net debit of $0.35 (or $35 on 100 shares).\n\nNotice the advantage of this costless collar, since you get $1465 worth of upside ($80 Call Strike minus $65.00 stock price minus $0.35 net premium paid) in return for a maximum loss of only $0.35.\n\nOften the way option premiums are priced can add to the attractiveness of these \"costless\" collars. This is especially true for longer-term options when the interest rate factors make out-of-the-money call premiums higher than many put premiums.\n\nA \"Diagonal Collar\" You may choose instead to buy a longer-term lower-strike put and sell a shorter-term higher strike call to round out your collar. In Graph 3, we have written the out-of-the-money July $70 strike call at $2.60 and we have bought a January 2008 $65 put at $10.30.\n\nThis hedge benefits from the slower time decay of the longer-term option. Thus, on the July expiration date, if the stock is still at $65, you will have kept the call's entire premium while the long put will still be worth a large part of its original value (assuming no decline in implied volatility).\n\nOne important note about this diagonal hedge: notice that you achieve your maximum profit if the stock price ends up at the short call's $70.00 strike price. Above that strike the gains get narrower, owing to losses in the long put. Indeed, it is possible to actually lose money if the stock rises far enough.\n\nA Truly Bearish Collar You can even construct your collar so that it gives you a bearish exposure to the underlying stock. Graph 4, we have sold a deep in-the-money July $55.00 strike call at $11.35 against the stock and bought a deep in-the-money July $75.00 put at $10.95.\n\nThese two transactions more than offset the effects of owning the stock, creating a net bearish position. Such a collar can be useful in accounts (such as some IRAs) in which investors are restricted from taking outright bearish"

      "text": "Forex Algebra\n\nOkay, today we're going to discuss forex algebra. Remember algebra from school, a + b = c ? I know there are some traders out there that don't know this, and that's fine. You can be a very successful trader without knowing this, but from my point of view I think it'll make you look very amateur or ignorant. You want to look professional. Besides, this can come in handy sometimes and you always want to add to your knowledge. We're going to get started right away.\n\nLong or Short\n\nIf you buy USD/JPY, you are long USD and short JPY. You profit when the chart rises.\n\nIf you sell USD/JPY, you are short USD and long JPY. You profit when the chart falls.\n\nSee the connection? If you buy you are always long the first currency (the base currency) in the currency pair and short the other. The other way around is also true. Now, how can this be useful?\n\nMost of the time you just say you are long USD/JPY, it implies long USD and short JPY. The other way is also true.\n\nThe Hedge\n\nSay for example you decide to sell CAD/JPY, and at the same time you thought it was a good idea to buy EUR/JPY. What happens is this:\n\nCADshort\n\nJPYlong\n\nEURlong\n\nJPYshort\n\nWhat really happens is this:\n\nCADshort\n\nJPYlong\n\nEURlong\n\nJPYshort\n\nThey cancel each other: you end up having bought EUR/CAD (long EUR, short CAD). Maybe you had a valid reason to do so, perhaps it was a part of your trading strategy and you viewed the two trades as two completely separate. However, it's important to understand that, as for this moment, your exposure to JPY has been completely hedged*: whatever happens to JPY will not affect your NAV. Can we use this to our advantage?\n\nSynthetic Pairs\n\nCreating a synthetic pair requires you to enter two orders simultaneously\n\nFor instance, you want to buy gold against your home currency SEK. Of course your broker is not offering you the XAU/SEK, you will have to create it for your own: long XAU/USD and long USD/SEK. Yes, do the calculation, see if it adds up (long XAU, short USD + long USD, short SEK).\n\n*However, all of this is only true as long as the two positions completely cancel each other. In the example above, both the XAU/USD and the USD/SEK trade would have to be \"worth\" the same amount i.e. being of the same \"trade value\" at the time of execution. For example, a trade value of 10, 000 USD each (later the value will change according to the market).\n\nNow, you could calculate the exact amount of units needed for each trade (search the internet if you don't know how to do this, this is beyond the scope of this article). Although, most of the time I just use the order window on the platform, which has a field for the estimated trade value, and I get the numbers about right. Anyways, it's impossible sometimes (e.g. if not both the base currencies are the same) to get the numbers exactly right as the market is constantly moving. I guess, if you're really obsessed you could just buy or sell more of the pair you overshot with to get it exactly right. Although, it should be of such a small amount that it should not matter much.\n\nQuotation and Charting\n\nHow do we get the price for synthetic pairs and what about charting? Easy, since the expression is purely algebraic we just take (XAU/USD) / (USD/SEK) (USD was hedged out) -> (XAU/1) / (1/SEK), so to get the price of XAU/SEK just take XAU/USD * USD/SEK. Or in the original expression ((XAU/USD)/1) / (1/(USD/SEK)). The same goes for charting, just take the historical quotes and multiple them to get the data for your chart. However, for a more convenient way I sometimes rely on finance.yahoo.com. Just type in the currency pair you're interested in in the quote box, like this \"XAUSEK=X\", and you get some limited charting too.\n\nFinal words\n\nIt's always good to keep track of your overall exposure\n\nIt's not that often I trade synthetic pairs since I most do day trading, and as the higher costs, difficulties charting and the time required to enter and exit a trade it wouldn't make sense anyways. However, I do use them sometimes for swing and position trading when I have a very clear picture of the position I want to take.\n\nAnother drawback of synthetic trading is the double margin requirement because you're opening two positions. All retail forex brokers / market makers I know of are counting your margin based on open trades and not overall exposure, which however would seem like a more logical approach. I think there is more the brokers could do for us, besides better margin utilization, like synthetic charting and an easier way to open and close trades right on the platform. However, since we don't trade synthetic pairs that often the demands are probably not high enough.\n\nEven though you're not going to use synthetic trading that much it's always good as a trader to know how opening a position will affect your overall exposure and risk, and to be able to do some calculations if necessary. The possibilities are endless, to partial close a position—simply sell or buy back some units in the same pair, to partial hedge—open a position in a new pair. Construct synthetics from three pairs or more if you need to, for example TRY/JPY from (short EUR/TRY, long EUR/USD, long USD/JPY) and you would get the price from taking (EUR/USD / EUR/TRY) * USD/JPY (create TRY/USD first)."

      "text": "Just for something completely random I was bouncing around in my head what would be a sensible approach for Futures Contract Specifications in the EVE universe.\n\nI thought I might as well ask the experts. So the rules are simple, feel free to critique a Specification, but please try to play nicely. Feel free to post your own, but it would really only make sense if it could be considered a commodity.\n\nTo get the ball rolling I have chosen the simple of simplest in-game minerals - Tritanium.\n\nTritanium Specification\n\nUnderlying Asset - Tritanium (Category: Mineral)\n\nType of Settlement - Cash (My assumption is that cash settlement would be the only effective way in EVE)Why couldn't it work? Buyer and Seller both pay margin amounts to Reliable 3rd Party Person.\n\nAt the delivery date: Seller contracts the agreed amount of items to 3rd Party, Buyer pays the rest of amount to 3rd Party\n\nIf seller defaults, 3rd party keeps margin, buyer gets refunded, and so on if the buyer defaults.\n\nIf you want margin to be checked daily then you probably want some programming done though.\n\nThere is no point in requiring actual delivery, Trit is fungible. That way, neither party ever needs to tender the full contract price. If the price of Trit at the settlement date favors one party, the other party's collateral is used to pay out.\n\nExample:\n\nI purchase a contract for 25m Trit at 3.55 isk per unit, face value 88.75M isk of which I pay 25%, which equals 22.1875M isk to the broker. The seller likewise pays that amount to the broker. In a month, the price of Trit has risen to 3.65 isk per unit. As the buyer, I am entitled to get the cash equivalent of 25M Trit at the current price or 91.25M isk, in exchange for the contract price of 88.75M. So rather then doing a bunch of buying and selling of actual Trit, I'm refunded my collateral plus the profits of 2.5M isk, the seller is refunded their collateral minus their loss of 2.5M isk.\n\nPosted - 2011.12.30 23:22:00 -\n[8] - Quote\nI think the idea has no wheels. CCP has no judicial/enforcement mechanism to compel performance of such an obligation in the event of a breach of the contract terms.\n\nThis means that where one party does not pay, or games the system to extract value unfairly even through an otherwise legitimate mechanism, you have no way to force the other person to pay up.\n\nIn real life there is always the good chance that if you do this to another person they will sue you, and if you do not show up to answer the complaint then at some point people with guns will come and take your assets to satisfy the judgment. While there are certainly people with guns in this game, there is no mechanism through which they can use those guns to force you to hand over your assets. Hence this idea is dead on arrival.\n\nWhat imho is VERY hard to overcome is something else. Something that made me decide to build a real time exchange 1 year ago (but then I quit EvE, so good bye plans).\n\nFutures usually go tied with:\n\n- leverage\n\n- margin is accurately and continuously checked. There's also some surplus required for those \"black swan\" periods and yet you are legally tied into reimbursing whatever excess loss the \"umbrella\" did not cover (very rare, but possible).\n\nExpecially the latter (continuously updated margin), is very hard to implement.\n\nI.e. if you invested in \"XYZ\" futures and XYZ today tanks HARD because a guy dumped a zillion of XYZ, you are meant to lose your neck over it. But you can't have a real time data feed from EvE markets unless you want to be permabanned so the margin checks cannot be continuous and therefore an item dropping from 5000 to 1000 in 2 hours and then back to 3000 will not be caught. What if the guy short sold XYZ at 5000, closed the trade at 1000 and he's told \"sorry we won't credit you 4000 x leverage per unit because we can't follow EvE markets in real time and that happened over just 2 hours\".\n\nThere are other non spot derivative securities (forwards) that allow a way more relaxed margin check but they are not futuresWherever You Went - Here You AreIt's not that dumb, people do it all the time on Wall Street ;-)\n\nLook a clueless noob magically appeared to prove I was right that even the most obvious bad ideas deserve to be shot down because theres a always a sucker willing to to believe.Wherever You Went - Here You Are\n\nLook a clueless noob magically appeared to prove I was right that even the most obvious bad ideas deserve to be shot down because theres a always a sucker willing to to believe.\n\nI write derivatives contracts on a regular basis, I've managed to avoid the temptation of futures contracts (which I believe are prone to market makers - a euphemism for manipulators like hedge funds, private equity, sovereign funds, etc), but even with just straight up put/call options there is no guarantee that the price will do what I think it will. For that matter, I can say the same thing about the underlying security (stock) GGt the company could go bankrupt sudden and poofGG*all shareholder value gets wiped out. Sounds like a bad idea? Maybe to you, but it works well for me.\n\nSame goes for the topic at hand GGt you donGGVt get value out of it but somebody else may. While it makes you feel nice to deride an attempt to advance the maturity of the EVE markets it's not particularly helpful84,000 AUR ($420) spent on NeX store for Troll and Profit.\n\nLook the noobs keep on coming.\n\nIn EVE unlike real life.Wherever You Went - Here You AreWherever You Went - Here You Are\n\nThere are analogs to each. EVE is not RL, but there are similarities in some places. Once of those happens to be the trading/investing environment which, relatively, is more hostile compared to the current RL environment. I pointed this out already but I thought it bore repeating with consideration to whom I am speaking.\n\n- Scamming is legal (Sure it is, just do business in one country and have investors in another. Care to guess how many developed countries have robust extradition laws? Or better yet, start a company, get listed on an exchange and then fully and transparently arrange a transaction from one company you own to another company that you own and intentially tank the stock of the first company in the process (say, selling below cost and incurring a heavy one-time loss on assets)....but before you do, short the hell out of your own stock. Profit. Legally. It happens. Just imagine what could be done even a hundred years ago with the right friends in the right places.)\n\n- There is no physical recourse against scamming (See above. You really didn't think this all out.) system systemYou are both right and wrong...fraud is generally illegal everywhere (except Nigeria, where it accounts for the largest export) however a law is generally only effective when it's enforced. What you're getting at here, if I may assist you in your argument, is that a \"law\" cannot be enforced in EVE. True. However, there are very few laws which can be enforced 100% of the time, and many that go unenforced for reasons ranging from lack of oversight to the simple inability to identify the offender.\n\nEVE most closely resembles an anarcho-capitalist society. What this means in general terms is that there is no \"state law\" beyond mutually agreed upon \"contracts\". There is no \"State\" in the traditional sense. Very little of history can point to a working anarcho-capitalist society actually existing....outside of Iceland between 930 and the mid-1200's A.D. How's that for irony?\n\nBut back to the point here...\n\nI've generally refuted every point you've made on why investing can't exist in EVE. I've cited history, precedence, and examples. You've countered none of them in any detailed fashion, instead you've stuck to making generalizations. Perhaps that's good enough for you. If I've made a false claim, let me know which one. If you think I don't understand history, I would also be interested in know where my \"intrepretation\" is erred.\n\nPosted - 2012.01.03 20:57:00 -\n[24] - QuoteThat's the elephant in the room...options were tried once and failed, but almost entirely because no one used them. Even if players got past the mechanical limitations and anemic incentives as you pointed out, people only seem to have real interest in the most basic instruments; stocks and bonds. Right now, I don't see futures taking off even with mechanics and risk overcome.\n\nAdmittedly, a lot of this is an academic exercise but still...it's the first step, so I'm limiting myself to constructive comments here.\n\nPosted - 2012.01.03 22:26:00 -\n[27] - Quote\nAs VV mentioned earlier, Block made an appeal to the MD community for participation in a proposed futures exchange on BSAC, but was abandoned due to lack of interest. This is the biggest barrier to entry IMO.\n\nIf you can garner enough interest in an out of game futures exchange, which means getting people to trust you, then the other barriers are just technical in nature. Not that those barriers are easy per se, but I think not so hard as the initial one. Black Frog Logistics - Lowsec/Nullsec Logistics Services. Join ingame channel 'Black Frog' for more info"

      "text": "4 ETF Lessons From Knight\n\nRELATED QUOTES\n\nAfter Knight lost a tremendous amount of money , it looked like it had stepped away from the ETF markets, and we published a back-of-the-envelope spot-check on how that might have effected ETF spreads . In that piece, I looked at noon spreads for the two days prior to last Wednesday, when Knight's algorithms ran amok, and compared that with Wednesday's and Thursday's spreads. I commented at the time that my analysis was extremely quick-and-dirty, looking at just one spread point a day, and assuming it was representative.\n\nWe spent the weekend buffing that out, grinding through the actual moment-by-moment spreads on all of the NYSE ETFs for which there are lead market makers (about 1,000) over all of the last week. The results, unsurprisingly, broadly match up with our original findings. The spreads on less liquid ETFs (those trading fewer than 50,000 shares a day, on average) widened out in the wake of Knight's issues.\n\nWe've done a few additional things here that are worth pointing out. First, based on this analysis, spreads on Knight LMM ETFs that already had low liquidity broadened out from 50 to 144 basis points during the crisis. However, by Friday, those spreads pulled way back in to 89 bps. From our analysis, this was not because Knight all of a sudden started making good markets.\n\nEven this morning, a spot-check of the less liquid ETFs showed Knight still very far outside the current bids and offers. Instead, what we've seen is that other market participants—both market makers and regular traders—have noticed the spreads on these small-but-still-trading securities and have jumped at the chance to be the guy offering just slightly better prices than we saw before.\n\nIn the most liquid ETFs, the situation is generally unchanged. That's to be expected, since they were essentially unaffected by all this kerfuffle in the first place.\n\nSo with things getting back to normal, I thought I'd address a few \"lessons learned\" from this experience.\n\n1. Lead Market Makers matter. The LMM system at the NYSE has been accused of essentially having no teeth in the past. The LMM for an ETF makes a commitment to provide liquidity by being on the inside of the bid/ask spread—effectively, paying attention to the security throughout the trading day. They're measured (theoretically) by the exchange to make sure that for some reasonable portion of the time, they actually \"are\" making the best market. For this, they get payments from the exchange for helping keep trading flowing—a rebate per share.\n\nIt turns out, having an LMM paying attention matters. At least, it certainly mattered if Knight was your LMM and they stepped to the sidelines like they did last Wednesday. The market-making system is far from perfect, and I'm still on the fence about proposals to make flat, nonflow-based payments to firms that show up for LMM on the first day a fund trades. But there's no question that having someone paying attention to your small ETF matters.\n\nNYSE seems to get this. As of this morning, NYSE has removed Knight's LMM status on hundreds of stocks and ETFs, temporarily reassigning those tasks to Getco .\n\n2. Markets Work. I don't mean this in any kind of Pollyanna-capitalism, uber-alles sense. What I mean is that the astounding thing about Knight's enormous software boo-boo is how well the market did exactly what it's supposed to do. Thousands of market participants quietly took the other side of all of these misplaced Knight trades, right until Knight hit the \"off\" switch. Then all those stocks just settled right back down. The end result of course was hundreds of millions of dollars being transferred out of Knight and into the hands of other traders.\n\nThat's exactly how the market is supposed to handle people who make bad calls. It's supposed to take their money in a calm and orderly way. It makes me extremely sad for the folks at a firm like Knight that end up suffering for the mistakes of the few folks likely responsible, but it's also an example of exactly what's supposed to happen. They ain't perfect, but markets work.\n\n3. Settlement Works. I got a lot of panicked calls from reporters over the last week asking what would happen to all of the trades Knight had made if they should spontaneously combust. It was a fair question, because at some points last week, the rumor mill was suggesting we might indeed have a midday bankruptcy. The basic premise of all these questions was, \"Well, if you bought 1,000 shares of CRUD yesterday from Knight, what happens when Knight doesn't exist tomorrow and those shares haven't yet settled?\"\n\nThe answer, of course, is you still get your shares. Any trade that gets confirmed at the end of the day by the NSCC goes into what's called their continuous net settlement process (CNS). A cornerstone of CNS is that once the trade is in the system, Knight is no longer your counterparty—the NSCC is. And the NSCC has enormous cash reserves (contributed by members like Knight) that it controls precisely to handle things like the default of other members. So if Knight had sold you 1,000 shares of CRUD, went bankrupt, and turned out not to have 1,000 shares of CRUD on inventory at the NSCC, then the NSCC would have taken some of Knight's cash—or at worse, some of its own reserves—and bought your CRUD for you to make sure your trade settled.\n\nWe know this works, because we've seen it happen before. Even before the NSCC changed the rules to become the counterparty for all trades on submission , it successfully dealt with both Lehman and Madoff without having a penny of settlement failure. (Under the current system, that confirm slip in your email box is effectively ironclad.)\n\n4. Illiquid ETFs Need Helpers . Not everyone was particularly happy I pointed out the wide spreads on less liquid ETFs last week. They'll probably be unhappy I'm reiterating those spreads with the minute-by-minute analysis today. But the point remains that ETFs that only trade a handful of shares a day are enormously challenging for small investors.\n\nBut there's a catch. Even the least liquid ETFs—something like the iShares MSCI ACWI ex US Information Technology Sector Index Fund (AXIT) can actually still be traded reasonably well. That might seem ludicrous when you look at the numbers. The fund trades less than 100 shares on an average day, and is consistently quoted at spreads of 2-3 percent. Can you get a fair deal by posting a trade for 5,000 shares in your Schwab account? Probably not. However, if you wanted to trade, say 50,000 shares, chances are you could make that trade for a handful of basis points off of fair value, just by working that trade through a liquidity provider like Wallach Beth; a market maker like Susquehanna; or a trading desk at a firm like ConvergEx.\n\nIt's not all roses—in our IndexUniverse ETF Analytics system , AXIT rightly scores just a 22 out of 100 for tradability. But even there, it's possible. For most investors, however, illiquid ETFs remain a place where professional help is going to be the norm, not the exception.\n\nIt's All Good\n\nIn general, all four of these lessons are good news. There's a system here. Far from an investor-shaking flash crash, last week turns out to be a testament to just how well that system"

      "text": "@techreport{Hendershott2008Does,\nabstract = {Algorithmic trading has sharply increased over the past decade. Equity market liquidity has improved as well. Are the two trends related? For a recent five-year panel of New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) stocks, we use a normalized measure of electronic message traffic (order submissions, cancellations, and executions) as a proxy for algorithmic trading, and we trace the associations between liquidity and message traffic. Based on within-stock variation, we find that algorithmic trading and liquidity are positively related. To sort out causality, we use the start of autoquoting on the NYSE as an exogenous instrument for algorithmic trading. Previously, specialists were responsible for manually disseminating the inside quote. As stocks were phased in gradually during early 2003, the manual quote was replaced by a new automated quote whenever there was a change to the NYSE limit order book. This market structure change provides quicker feedback to traders and algorithms and results in more message traffic.

      "text": "7 Tips for Successful Forex Trading\n\nCurrency trading is a competitive business that puts you up against institutions, central banks and other traders. In order to succeed in forex, you need to be organized, disciplined and alert to the market. In this article we'll look at some tips to help you do just that.\n\n1. Make a Plan, Trade the Plan\n\nYou can be a successful trader without a plan – at least for a short period of time. In the long-term, however, a trading plan is essential for consistent success. Having written guidelines for how to approach trades, including your entry point, take-profit, stop-loss and position size, greatly simplifies the mechanics of a trade. This, in turn, frees up some mental resources so you can focus on finding trading opportunities rather than stressing out about what to do with open trades. (Do you have a trading plan or a trading strategy? Find out the difference. Check out What is the Difference Between a Forex Trading Plan and a Trading Strategy?)\n\n2. Choose A Few Currency Pairs\n\nEach currency and each currency pair is moved by national and global factors, some of which are common across the board and some of which are unique to that currency or currency pair. Unless a you are planning to go completely technical in your trading and become a scalper, you will need to be familiar with the factors that move the currency pairs you trade. This requires a certain amount of dedicated study, so it is best to keep your focus narrow rather than trying to trade currency pairs with only a passing knowledge of what moves them.\n\n3. Create a Calendar\n\nOnce you've selected your currency pairs, you can quickly assemble a calendar of the regularly scheduled events that matter. This includes the economic releases, any key announcements, the meetings for policy decisions, global summits that include the nations and so on. You may also want to include things like national holidays, as these often set the condition for low liquidity days that may affect your trading.\n\n4. Cast a Wide Information Net\n\nForex doesn't exist in a bubble. Very often, the price action in a currency pair can be traced to a news event or a situation in another market. The Eurozone crisis from 2010-2011 was an excellent example of this. As the appetite for sovereign debt from certain Eurozone nations dried up, the euro took a direct hit. If a trader was watching swap rates or even just following the headlines, he would have had plenty of time to follow the euro's decline against other currencies like the yen and USD. Being aware of world events can help a trader move with - or slightly ahead of - the market reaction.\n\n5. Anticipate and Evaluate\n\nWith an accurate calendar and a steady stream of potentially market moving news at your fingertips, it makes sense to try to anticipate the market – within reason. Although fighting the trend is a sure way to fail as a trader, anticipating events and creating alternate strategies for different outcomes is the best way for a trader to profit while others are merely reacting. This type of trading should always be kept within defined limits (ideally outlined in the trading plan) and evaluated after every attempt to solidify any useful lessons.\n\n6. Don't Skimp on Technical Analysis\n\nEven if you are not a technical trader, you need to be aware of the technical signals and trends in the time frames you are trading. This is simply due to the fact that there are so many technical traders, institutional and individual, out there. Just as these traders must be aware of economic and news events, less technical traders should understand what the \"technical news\" is on a given position. What are the recent highs and lows in the timeframe you hope to trade (monthly, weekly, daily)? What is the primary trend? Where are the key support and resistance levels? Following the key technical levels will deepen your understanding of the trade.\n\n7. Always Protect Your Profits and Limit Your Losses\n\nThis phrase should be tattooed on the back of trader's hands so they see it whenever they enter a trade. Your goal as a forex trader is not to get rich on one super trade. It is to make money regularly and lose money rarely, adding up to more profit over time. Take profits according to your plan and admit losses while they are still small. If you allow emotions to come into your trading, your trading days (at least the profitable ones) will be numbered.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nNone of these are groundbreaking tips. In fact, most traders have heard them hundreds of times and will hear them many more times yet. That said, it is easy to forget these tips during slumps or in the heat of a volatile market or just with passage of time. Frequently revisiting your plan and reminding yourself of what it takes to be successful is perhaps the best tip any trader can receive.

      "text": "New to Binary Options?\n\nBinaries are an exciting way to trade the directional moves, or future volatility levels, in the underlying market. Binary trades are based on the performance of a financial market over a specific time, with only two possible outcomes.\n\nWhat is a binary trade?\n\nBinaries are designed to be easy to use, with each trade priced between 0 and 100, based on several factors - mainly the time to expiry and underlying market price.\n\nBinaries allow you to take a view on whether a specific outcome will or will not occur. For example, will Wall Street close up on the day?\n\nIf the answer is 'yes', the binary settles at 100\n\nIf the answer is 'no', the binary settles at 0\n\nQUICK GUIDE TO TRADING BINARY OPTIONS\n\nA binary CFD market asks you a question on whether an event will occur - there are only two possible answers:\n\nQUICK GUIDE TO TRADING BINARY OPTIONS\n\nFor example, on a daily Australia 200 UP trade, you are being asked whether you think the Australia 200 will finish above 4611.11\n\nIf you disagree, you sell this market.\n\nIf you agree, you buy this market.\n\nQUICK GUIDE TO TRADING BINARY OPTIONS\n\nAs with all our markets, the price features a spread. But with a binary, the price is displayed in a range between 0 and 100, such as 86.2 – 89.5. Here, you would 'buy' at 89.5 and 'sell' at 86.2.\n\nThese prices are dictated by the underlying market price and the time to expiry. Therefore, the closer you get to expiry, the closer the price will move to either 0 or 100.\n\nQUICK GUIDE TO TRADING BINARY OPTIONS\n\nThe nature of a binary is that it magnifies very small movements in the market. A sharp tick in the underlying price close to an expiry time could cause the binary price to move dramatically.\n\nFor example, if the underlying market price was at 4660 just five minutes before the expiry of a Australia 200 UP [>4611.1] the binary price is likely to be close to 100 as the chance of the binary expiring above 4611.1 is quite high.\n\nIf, however, the Aus 200 suddenly ticks down to 4610 and trade expires below 4611.1, it will instantly settle at 0, which is potentially a massive swing.\n\nTypes of binaries\n\nAll binaries settle at either 0 or 100, but there are different criteria to be satisfied for different types of binaries.\n\nLadders\n\nA binary trade on whether the underlying market will finish above a stated level. For example, a 'Gold to be above 1256' Ladder will settle at 100 if the Gold finishes the day at or above 1256 and will settle at 0 if it finishes below 1256.\n\nTargets\n\nA binary trade on whether a market will close in a certain range. For example, a 'FTSE® to finish down 50-60 points' on that day's trading target will close at 100 if this should happen. It will close at 0 if this event does not occur.\n\nHi-Lo\n\nA binary trade on whether the day's high or low will be a given distance from the previous closing level.\n\nOneTouch\n\nA binary trade on whether the market will touch or go through the barrier level at any time before the stated expiry. For example, the 'Daily Cash Australia 200 to touch 4710' will settle at 100 if the 4710 level is breached before the end of the day's trading session. It will settle at 0 if the level is not breached before the expiry time.\n\nTUNNEL\n\nA binary trade on whether the market will stay within two given barrier levels for the full period up to expiry. For example a 'Wall St +/- 100' tunnel' will settle at 100 if Wall St stays within the +100 / -100 range for the whole trading day. But if it hits up 100 or down 100 at any point during the trading day the trade will settle at 0. Therefore when you buy a tunnel you are selling volatility and when you sell a tunnel you are buying volatility.\n\nTrading Spreads\n\nWe offer a range of variable spreads on binary trades.\n\nYou can trade on weekly, daily and hourly binaries.\n\nNearly all binary trade markets will have a spread in the range of 4-6 points. As prices move towards 50-50, the spread will be closer to 6, and as prices move towards 0 or 100, the spread will tend toward the lower end of the scale. If the price is close to 50-50 near the end of the market, the spread will often increase"

This would be equal to 100 lots in say gbp/usd or eur/usd and would equal $1000 per pip.\n\nI've recently seen a documentary, although an old one, where commercial traders will keep firing off $10M trades to prop price up in the market at a given level. If I remember correctly this was a Barclay's trader trading into the London Session, all be it about 30 to 40 years ago!\n\nYou must remember though that Liquidity plays a key role in just how significant a order may be in moving price. It's a difficult question to answer, and one that I've always been interested in knowing....How much do you have to trade to move the market, or what would it take\n\nLast edited by Jezzode; 10-22-2012 at 03:23 AM.\n\nYou learn more looking for the answer to a question than you do being told the answer straight away.\n\nI read somewhere about a $1 billion intervention that moved the said pair by 300 pips, I watched it happen, so I was only thinking aloud that if $1 billion could move the market by 300 pips, perhaps $100,000,000 would move it by 30 pips. IMO\n\nIt is impossible to correlate market movements in the manner you suggest.\n\nThere are just too many factors.\n\nAs an example years ago I was working the night shift for a major bank. On a sunday night (europe time) as the market opened in Wellington, we would often open a position in a smallish amount in Gbp/Usd. I have seen a Gbp 5 mio position move the market 200 pips if it is caught right.\n\nLike I said in my earlier post, thats in my own opinion, I am not saying you can take it to the bank and cash, but I strongly believe in this theory, like you rightly said, there are too many factors, but try identifying the various factors and you would really be amazed.\n\nAgain the 200 pips move you mentioned could probably not be your former banks trades that pushed it, there could also be some other market makers who wanted to flex their muscles.\n\nI guess it all comes down to order flow at the time of the trade being lodged in the market. Just like the 'Flash Crash' when many sell orders all got activated from one single initial sell order. It would be incorrect to say that the initial sell order was what moved the market.\n\nYou learn more looking for the answer to a question than you do being told the answer straight away."

      "text": "How to Get Started Trading\n\nSo you're looking to get into stock trading. Whether you're trying to make a little money on the side or you just want to better understand the stock market, Active-Investor can help you understand what to expect when you start trading. The first thing you need is capital of course. A lot of people think they can just take a thousand dollars and turn it into ten thousand overnight. Unfortunately that's not the case. In order to make any kind of money without risking it all at the same time, you need to have at least a couple of thousand dollars to start with. The key to being a successful trader is never risk the majority of your account on a single trade, in fact you should try not to risk more than 10% on a single trade especially if you're a beginner. You'll hear a lot of people say that even that is too high. It probably is but if you start with a smaller account you need to be able to put yourself in a position to make more than your commission. Commission is how much the trade costs to execute and is usually around ten dollars or lower a trade and is how E-Trade and Scottrade make their money.\n\nThe best brokers for beginner traders are the ones you see on commercials such as E-Trade, Scottrade, and TD Ameritrade. All have commission rates ranging from $7 with Scottrade to $9.99 with E-Trade and all have good 24/7 customer service. As long as you don't try and trade penny stocks, these brokers will work great for you.\n\nBefore you even begin trading you should formulate some kind of strategy when it comes to managing your capital. It's better to trade safe and secure profits then risk it and lose your whole investment. If you're just starting out, never risk more than 10% of your account on any trade. That way if the trade goes south on you, you still have money to trade with and recoup those losses. Another thing to watch out for is letting your emotions dictate how you trade. I know that's easier said then done, but if you start seeing your trade go south and you stay in it thinking it will go back up you can quickly lose your whole investment. It's better to take the small loss right away then to eventually take a big loss. Remember there will always be other trades to make, you have to make sure you don't lose all your money before they come."

      "text": "Options ideas for a flat market\n\nThis article appeared in the October 2012 ASX Investor Update\nemail newsletter. To subscribe to this newsletter please register with the MyASX section or visit the About MyASX page for past editions and more details.\n\nIf your view is that a stock will stay flat or trade in a range what do you do?\n\nBy Tony Hunter, ASX\n\nYou don't need me to tell you we have had a \"difficult\" market for quite some time. Up a bit, down a bit, goes for a run for a while, then retraces. Essentially drifting and waiting for things to be sorted out in Europe, America, China, the hung parliament - you name it.\n\nThe buy write (bought shares plus a sold call option) is a very popular strategy that allows you to earn extra income on your shareholding. However, it has a capped upside so it appeals to investors in markets that are flat or gently trending upwards. It does not work so well when everything is going gangbusters.\n\nOnce people get more experienced with options they start to see the flexibility and opportunities presented by trading various combinations of them. These are referred to as multi-leg strategies. For example, selling straddles or strangles can be a good way of profiting in a flat market.\n\nIf you have a view that a share, or the whole market, is going to trade within a range then one approach is to sell a call option and also a put option. If your view is on a particular company you would use options over its shares; if it's a market view you would look at XJO options, which are over the S&P/ASX 200 index.\n\nHow it works\n\nSuppose you have a view that a share is going to stay around $10. By selling a $10 call and a $10 put you earn two lots of premium. In a flat market you will have earned premium income despite the share price not moving. Every move away from $10 is eating into your profit so your tolerance will be the amount of premium income earned.\n\nWhy is it called a straddle? Well the payoff diagram looks like this one below so you can easily imagine it as someone straddling a horse or a fence.\n\nShort straddle\n\nSource: ASX\n\nSuppose your view is not so precise and you think the share or the market will trade within a particular range. You might consider a strangle. It sounds horrible but it is just a straddle with different strike prices for the respective legs. Suppose you think the shares will trade in a range of $10 to $10.50. A strangle to reflect this view would be to sell the $10 put and the $10.50 call.\n\nAnother attraction is that because you are selling (writing) options you are being paid to implement your view. The risk, of course, is the market breaks out in one direction or the other, resulting in a heavy loss on one leg that completely blows away any money you made via premium income. And remember that you will be paying more brokerage by transacting multiple legs.\n\nWhy is it called a strangle? Well, from the payoff diagram you could make a case that it looks like it is looping around. But if that is the reason for the name, I don't find it as convincing as the straddle. Anyway, that is what they are called.\n\nSuppose a significant economic event is imminent, say something to do with Europe. You are not sure how the market will react but think it might go up a lot or it down a lot; you are confident it will react strongly. You might consider buying a straddle or a strangle.\n\nThe strategy will cost you money to implement because you are buying two legs - a call option and a put option. You will need the market to move enough in one direction for the profit on that leg to at least cover the premium you paid for the two legs plus any brokerage and exchange fees incurred.\n\nIf the market does not react, or react enough, your maximum loss is the premium you paid. Your upside is potentially unlimited, confined to how far the market can move either up or down during the life of the options.\n\nThese are very high-level descriptions about how options can be used to give effect to a particular market view. But if you want to start using options you should really have quite a bit of experience in share trading - these are leveraged instruments, after all. You need to be confident with mathematics, be prepared to keep a close eye on your positions and adjust your strategy as circumstances change.\n\nThe course explains writing options and your potential margin obligations, what is involved in implementing multi-legged strategies and the types of strategies you can consider for various market views. No registration is required, it is free, and you can work through the modules at your own pace and in the order you prefer.\n\nWhy not have a look now?\n\nAbout the author\n\nTony Hunter is head of investor education at ASX.\n\nFrom ASX\n\nThose new to options should consider the ASX's Introduction to options course. It is designed to help investors understand the features, benefits and risks of exchange-traded options, and introduce various options strategies - all in a stimulating, interactive learning environment"

Pay no attention.\n\nHuman nature tends to want to find patterns to explain the world, especially if there's a chance to cash in. As Fidelity's Tom Stevenson points out in The Sunday Telegraph, \"experiments [show] that the neurological impact of spotting patterns or sets of circumstances that in the past have made us money is exactly the same as that triggered by a hit of cocaine\".\n\nAnd it doesn't take much to make us think we've spotted a trend. Consider a coin flipped six times in a row, says Stevenson. The odds of getting the tails and heads sequence HTTHTT are exactly the same as those of producing HHHHHH, yet the \"streak of heads makes you feel quite differently about what is going on\".\n\nThe S&P 500 index, for instance, has moved in the same direction in the full year as it did in January on 17 of the last 25 occasions. That's a bit better than a coin toss, but hardly impressive when stocks tend to go up most of the time anyway.\n\nIt's a similar story with other famous stockmarket barometers, such as the Superbowl (American football) indicator, Republican or Democratic presidents, and the hemline or lipstick indicators.\n\nCorrelation does not necessarily mean causation – and the spurious correlation often isn't especially impressive anyway, as in the example above. It's the economic backdrop, not the patterns we insist on seeing, that really matters"

      "text": "... More\n\nCandlesticks involve a lot of terminology, and in the mix of jargon it is easy to overlook the significance of some subtle indicators. There is more to a candlestick than opening and closing price and the session's price direction.\n\nFor example, tails - also known as long shadows - may be among the most important parts of a session's candlestick. Most focus is on the real body, the rectangular middle of the formation. A white real body is found in a day that moves upward, and a black real body signifies a downward-moving day. But most days also have upper and lower shadows. The real body's top and bottom are the opening and closing prices for the session; the shadows give you a glance at the full trading range, representing price movement above or below the open and close.\n\nWhen upper or lower shadows are exceptionally long, they are called tails. As a general rule, the longer the tail, the more important it is. A long tail reveals that either buyers (on the upside) or sellers (on the downside) tried to move price further during the day, but the effort failed. The loss of momentum or inability to rally price is very significant. A buyer-led effort (an upper tail) is a bearish sign, because buyers were unable to gain any momentum for greater price appreciation. A seller-led effort (a lower tail) is bullish because sellers were not able to gain any momentum for a larger downward price trend.\n\nTails imply overbought or oversold conditions, but they are most significant when they show up after a sustained trend. So when you see an uptrend and then a session with an upper tail, it might signal the end of the uptrend and a coming reversal. When a lower tail shows up after a strong downtrend, it often signals a turnaround and the start of a new uptrend.\n\nTails can show up in the middle of a trend; they do not always mean reversal, but may also work as continuation indicators. It is difficult to interpret signals; but when you see a lower tail within an uptrend, or an upper tail in a downtrend, it probably is not foreshadowing reversal. There is nothing to reverse with a bullish signal in an uptrend or a bearish signal in a downtrend.\n\nBecause tails, like all indicators, cannot be relied on alone, always seem confirmation. When tails are found immediately after other candlestick formations, the tail is likely to confirm what the other signal tells you (assuming the indication points in the same direction). You may also be able to use tails to confirm Western signals, including volume spikes and tests of resistance or support. They also have greater significance when appearing immediately before or after strong gaps.\n\nTails, as single-session signals, may be strong indicators. But remember, all charting is a combination of interpretive skills and the ability to spot early signs and confirm them. Without confirmation, it is just guesswork. With confirmation, strong signals like candlestick tails are powerful timing tools variation of the short call butterfly is the short call condor. Instead of one middle range strike price, this volatility strategy has two.\n\nIn the short call condor, you combine one in-the-money short call with one in-the-money long call; and one out of the money long call and one out of the money short call. The position is neutral in terms of the direction of the underlying price movement.\n\nExample: The underlying stock is trading at approximately $36.50 per share. You expect the price to either rise or fall substantially. A rumor is out that the company may be acquired. If true, the offer is expected to be far higher than current price; if it falls through, you believe the stock price will tumble many points. This is a perfect situation for the short call condor. Volatility in either direction will create profits.\n\nYou set up the position by selling one 30 strike call at 7 and buying one 35 strike at 3.50; you also buy one 40 strike at 1 and sell one 45 strike at 0.50. Your net credit (before transaction costs) is $300. All of these calls expire on the same date three months away. The outcome at various prices demonstrates that with movement of the stock in either direction, profits are going to be realized. The maximum profit is $300 if the stock price ends up at $30 or lower or at $50 or higher by expiration:\n\nValue at expiration\n\nStock short long long short\n\nPrice 30 35 40 45 total\n\n20 700 - 350 - 100 50 300\n\n25 700 - 350 - 100 50 300\n\n30 700 - 350 - 100 50 300\n\n35 200 - 350 - 100 50 - 200\n\n40 - 300 150 0 50 - 100\n\n45 - 800 650 400 0 250\n\n50 -1,300 1,150 900 - 450 300\n\n55 -1,800 1,650 1,400 - 950 300\n\nAs long as the stock price remains within the middle zone, losses are minor. The advantage to this strategy is that you collect premium for opening the combined short and long, and you can close the short calls at any time. As long as volatility is high, you will profit whether the stock moves up or down. The disadvantage is that returns are small compared to some other straddle positions, but risk in those alternatives is likely to be greater as well.\n\nAll complex option strategies have to be judged based on their overall merit, limited risk and exposure to loss. In addition, a broker will require margin maintenance for positions like the short call condor, which ties up capital until either expiration occurs or then position (or the short portions of it) are closed. The elegance of limited profits in exchange for limited losses has to be judged with these factors in the balanceThe trader's dilemma: Even when you see a strong reversal pattern on a chart, how do you know it's the real thing? The answer is that any indicator needs to be independently confirmed. This is where East (candlesticks) meets West (traditional technical analysis).\n\nOne of the favorite reversal signals used by day traders and swing traders is the volume spike. This applies especially on sessions with an unusually small trading range, the so-called narrow range day (NRD). So an NRD with heavy volume is viewed as a strong two-part signal that the current trend is about to turn around.\n\nThe problem with these signals is that they do not always come through. Failed signals are fairly common, so astute swing traders have to look for separate confirmation. But this raises a second dilemma: If you wait for confirmation, it's probably going to be too late to make an entry decision before the new trend begins. This is where the Marubozu comes into the scene.\n\nIn Japanese, Marubozu means \"with little hair.\" It is called this because it is a long session but with little or no upper or lower shadow. A long session means a bigger than usual gap between opening and closing prices; and the lack of shadow means trading for the day remained mostly within the range between the opening and closing price.\n\nA white Marubozu (meaning price opened at the bottom and closed at the top) is one of the most bullish single-session candlesticks. Of course, the black variety (seen when price opened at the top of the rectangle and closed at the bottom) is one of the most bearish single-session indicators.\n\nThe Marubozu is extremely valuable as a confirming session because it often precedes the traditional NRD and volume spike. So confirmation is given to you before the better-known turning point. When a downtrend ends, you see three signs:\n\n1. The white Marubozu.\n\n2. An NRD in the following session.\n\n3. A volume spike in the same session as the NRD.\n\nWhen an uptrend ends, you see the same three developments, but with a black Marubozu. In both cases, confirmation takes place in anticipation of the turn, and before the NRD/spike session.\n\nCandlesticks are enjoying great popularity today, but they often are misunderstood. They are not effective as a replacement for the older Western technicals, based on price action and trading range analysis. The core of the Western approach is support and resistance and how price patterns work within the range, or when price breaks through above or below that range. This core continues to provide you the best insight to price action and candlesticks do not replace that. Rather, candlesticks work best when they confirm what traditional technical signals forecast. Used together, East and West create a powerful and effective method for timing entry and exit as part of a swing trading strategy. The single-session candlestick is only the starting point. Two-session and three-session indicators provide equally important insights to coming price tendencies - never as 100% guarantees, but tools to vastly improve your timing successInstablogs are Seeking Alpha's free blogging platform customized for finance, with instant set up and exposure to millions of readers interested in the financial markets.

Receive the full newsletter with charts!\n\nThis article shall give six common sense-actions based on both implied volatility and the market's trend direction. First, bullish scenarios will be looked at and then Bearish ones. Within each scenario there will be three subgroups; i.e. Strongly Bullish, Moderately Bullish, & Slightly Bullish.\n\nThe tables in all of the figures follow the same format. Starting on the left, Market Bias, Stock Action, Option Action, the trade Risk, Reward, and in Bold Letters the I.V. reading.\n\nMarket Bias\n\nStock Action\n\nOption Action\n\nRisk\n\nReward\n\nImplied Volatility\n\nStrongly Bullish\n\nBuy the stock\n\nBuy a put (+p)\n\nLimited\n\nUnlimited\n\nLow\n\nThe scenario that matches figure one includes the mindset of a trader who is very Bullish on the underlying yet at the same time wishes to have some protection for the duration of the trade. The re-requisite actions prior to both purchases, stock and put options, is to verify whether the I.V. is low. It is then that the trader can proceed by simultaneously entering into this protected Bullish position. The fact that he purchased both the stock and the put means that there are no limits to his upside potential. If the stock goes up, the value of the put decreases yet the trader already accepted the cost of the put as a way of insuring the long investment. Nevertheless, if the stock tanks a lot then every penny paid for the put would be viewed as a smart investment. Figure 1 can be compared to owning a car with the insurance on it.\n\nMarket Bias\n\nStock Action\n\nOption Action\n\nRisk\n\nReward\n\nImplied Volatility\n\nBullish\n\nBuy the stock\n\n+p and also –c\n\nLimited\n\nLimited\n\nMid Range\n\nIn this second scenario the trader is Bullish on the stock, while the I.V. is in its mid range, meaning the options are neither overpriced nor underpriced. The trader chooses to go long on the stock yet he or she does not want to pay from his or her own pocket the cost of a long put. He or she finances the put purchase by selling a call on the same expiry cycle. Please read this article on Collars for an in-depth explanation of this strategy. In short, the position profit and loss remain within a range because of the two options; both risk and reward are limited.\n\nMarket Bias\n\nStock Action\n\nOption Action\n\nRisk\n\nReward\n\nImplied Volatility\n\nSlightly Bullish\n\nBuy the stock\n\nSell an OTM call\n\nUnlimited\n\nLimited\n\nHigh\n\nAlthough this strategy is known to everyone as the Covered Call, what is not so well known is that it is the most dangerous scenario out of the three that we are discussing. Let us go over the facts. The trader feels the underlying over the long term will be Bullish and he or she does not mind holding it during minor pull backs. Therefore, the out-of-the-money (OTM) calls are sold in proportion to his or her stock holding. Limited premium is received and there is anticipation that the underlying will not go over the OTM call. But what if it does? Could there be a stop loss? Well, if the stop is placed on the underlying and it gets filled the trader is left with a naked call. Also, there is no protection to the downside if the trader owns the stock. Take a look at the table in Figure 3 showing what the risk is.\n\nMoving on to the Bearish scenarios; the figure below shows shorted stock and a call that is purchased.\n\nMarket Bias\n\nStock Action\n\nOption Action\n\nRisk\n\nReward\n\nImplied Volatility\n\nStrongly Bearish\n\nShort the stock\n\nBuy the call\n\nLimited\n\nLimited to 0\n\nLow\n\no a novice eye, at first this strategy might look as the most contradictory one. If a stock is shorted in isolation then the position would carry unlimited risk to the upside; however, due to the long call that \"ain't so.\" The short stock gives us negative delta and the long call gives us positive delta. The long call limits the risk to the upside.\n\nMarket Bias\n\nStock Action\n\nOption Action\n\nRisk\n\nReward\n\nImplied Volatility\n\nBearish\n\nShort the stock\n\n-p and also +c\n\nLimited\n\nLimited\n\nMid Range\n\nFigure 5, above, is still a short position because the underlying is the engine. The short put finances the long call which covers the short stock. So risk is limited to the upside by the long call but reward is limited to the downside due to the short put.\n\nMarket Bias\n\nStock Action\n\nOption Action\n\nRisk\n\nReward\n\nImplied Volatility\n\nSlightly Bearish\n\nShort the stock\n\nSell the put\n\nUnlimited\n\nLimited\n\nHigh\n\nIn this last scenario since there is overinflated premium due to high I.V., an ATM put is sold. If the stock goes nowhere the fluff (extrinsic value) of the ATM put goes out. Keep in mind that if there is any intrinsic value, no matter how small, in that ATM put if it is held until expiry the put will become long stock which in turn would make the overall position flat. Short stock and long stock equal no position. The risk is unlimited to the upside and the reward is limited. The key to this strategy is not just selling the put when the IV is high but also put selection.\n\nIn conclusion this newsletter explained six common-sense actions that take into account both implied volatility and the market's trend direction. The point is NOT to look at just the price chart but also to take into consideration the I.V. Trading options is all about the I.V., leverage and hedging"

The death cross is one of the oldest sell-signals in technical stock market analysis. Other trend following signals, however, did not generate a sell-signal. Why is that?\n\nThe answer to this question lays in the fact that different trend following signals seek a different balance between timeliness and accuracy. Good trend signals are designed for a specific investing purpose.\n\nSome investors like to take a cautious, traditional, approach. They prefer to be rather safe than sorry.

      "text": "Elliot Wave Theory (EWT)\n\nBasics of Elliot Wave Theory\n\nThe basic tenet of Elliot Wave Theory is that the movement of stock market indexes and prices can be described as a series of waves, and that there are 9 degrees of waves that cover different lengths of time, which Elliot named from the longest time span to the shortest:\n\nGrand Supercycle\n\nSupercycle\n\nCycle\n\nPrimary\n\nIntermediate\n\nMinor\n\nMinute\n\nMinuette\n\nSubminuette\n\nEach wave of a specific degree is composed of waves of lesser degrees, so the Grand Supercycle wave is composed of Supercycle waves, which is composed of Cycle waves, which is composed of Primary waves, and so on.\n\nEach wave consists of a motive wave where its main direction is that of the Elliot Wave of the degree immediately above it, and is followed by a corrective wave that moves counter to the motive wave. The impulse wave can be further componentized into 5 subwaves, usually numbered from 1 – 5. Subwaves 1, 3, and 5 move in the direction of the motive wave itself, while subwaves 2 and 4 are corrective waves that move counter to the motive waves. The corrective wave can also be broken down into 3 subwaves, usually designated by the letters A – C. Subwaves A and C move counter to the preceding motive wave, while subwave B is in the direction of the preceding motive wave. The complete motive wave plus the complete corrective wave constitutes a cycle.\n\nThe subwaves have a fractal quality—each Elliot Wave is part of another Elliot Wave of the next higher degree, and is, itself, composed of Elliot Waves of the next lower degree. Specifically, each 2 adjacent subwaves of an Elliot Wave is composed of the 8 waves of the next lower degree, and those waves in turn are also composed of waves of the next lower degree, and so on. So, in the above diagram, Wave 3 would be considered the motive wave of the next lesser degree wave, while Wave 4 would be the corrective wave of the next lesser degree wave.\n\nWhen a wave moves in the same direction as the Elliot Wave in the next higher degree, it is called an actionary wave (aka trend wave); if it moves in the opposite direction, it is called a reactionary wave (aka countertrend wave).\n\nElliot Waves are actually much more complex than even the above discussion would imply. There are 6 specific rules that are considered inviolate—if they are not satisfied, then a wave cannot be considered an Elliot Wave. These basic inviolate rules are the following:\n\nImpulse waves move in the same general direction as the wave of the next higher degree.\n\nImpulse wave consists of 5 subwaves.\n\nSubwaves 1, 3, and 5 of the impulse wave are also impulse waves of 1 less degree, and subwaves 2 and 4 are corrective waves of 1 lesser degree.\n\nSubwaves 1 and 5 may have an impulse or diagonal pattern.\n\nSubwave 3 is always an impulse wave.\n\nIn cash markets, within an impulse pattern, subwave 4 never overlaps subwave 1, but it may do so in futures markets.\n\nThen there are guidelines, which may or may not be present or may vary in detail. An important quality of Elliot Waves is that while their form is specific, the amplitude and duration of the waves will vary, which greatly lessens their value as a forecasting tool.\n\nThe main practical application of Elliot Wave Theory is considered to be that it restricts the number of possible future paths of the market and that it allows an Elliottician to assess the relative probabilities of each path. Generally, the more guidelines that are satisfied by a particular path, the more likely it will occur.\n\nFibonacci Sequence and the Golden Ratio\n\nBoth Collins and Elliot had a fascination with the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio.\n\nA Fibonacci sequence is formed by taking 2 numbers—any 2 numbers—and adding them together to form a 3rd number; then the 2nd and 3rd numbers are added again to form a 4th number, and this is continued to any desired length. The ratio of the last number over the penultimate number approaches 1.618, and this ratio can be found in many natural objects, and for this reason, this ratio is called the golden ratio. The golden ratio is actually an irrational number, like pi, and is often denoted by the Greek letter, phi (Φ)."

      "text": "Learn From Your Mistakes\n\nShow me a trader (or spread bettor) who has never made a mistake, and I'll show you a liar or a superhuman investor. Mistakes are a part of life, and there's very little we can do about them. Whether it's clicking the wrong button within your trading account, selling a little too early or trading a bit too heavily, you too will make mistakes in the process of your trading career, and they may even cost you money. But mistakes shouldn't necessarily be viewed as a bad thing, and in fact many of the world's most successful spread bettors can point to seminal mistakes in their trading careers that pointed out a flaw in their style, or provided them with a valuable lesson and experience points that stayed with them for years to come.\n\nThe trick with making mistakes in spread betting is to realise when you've made a mistake, to realise why you've made a mistake, and to learn from that mistake. If every trading mistake was viewed as a lesson learned, we would see fewer horror stories about traders being bankrupted after unsuccessful spread betting endeavours, and with such simple remedial action, it's a shame that more traders don't take mistakes on board and learn the errors of their ways.\n\nKnowing when you've made a mistake\n\nMistakes happen in spread betting, but being able to identify them can help ensure you don't consistently fall into the same traps. Mistakes can be made on both the positive and negative sides - manifest in either cutting a profit too early, or hogging a loss for too long. Indeed, some entire transactions can even be deemed mistakes, and it doesn't necessarily have to cost you money to be an error you can learn from.\n\nTry to constantly think about your reasons for making trading decisions. Why are you entering a position? Why are you closing? Why are you holding? You must always have an answer for the question of 'why?', and if that answer turns out to be incorrect, you've made a mistake. Sometimes these mistakes might turn out to be lucky escapes in which you win a bit of money, but for different reasons to those which you thought - nevertheless, by figuring out 'why', and learning from your errors, you can help shape your thought processes to become a more refined, accomplished trader.\n\nKeep a log\n\nOne of the best things you can do is to keep a notebook beside your trading desk, and make a note of every losing position you take. Write down every unsuccessful trade you've made, the figures involved and a reason that trade failed. Sometimes it might be a misreading of the research, sometimes you might have waited too long to offload a position, and sometimes it might just be a dose of bad luck.\n\nWhile not every negative trade is necessarily the result of a mistake, analysing and recording your decisions like this can work wonders when it comes to making future trading decisions. The act of mulling over your previous thought processes and seeing their results will, over time, help modify your understanding of how the markets work, how prices respond to certain triggers, and how you should best approach decisions in future. This should help ensure you don't fall into the same trap many times over, and should hopefully in the end improve your trading success rate."

      "text": "Options Trading News\n\nIn Chicago, home to the CBOE and CME, many people know what an option trader is. But that's clearly not the case in other parts of the country.\n\nRecently I was asked what I did for a living by someone in the Northeast, and I had trouble with the answer. I often feel like making something up when this happens--but I realized that some aspects of trading are analogous to online poker, without the negative gambling connotations.\n\nSome of you will immediately see the correlation. And many professional traders, especially option traders, are in fact also poker players.\n\nFrom a certain perspective, telling someone that I am essentially a professional online poker player makes sense because many people already think that trading is as good as gambling. And it certainly can be.\n\nSome \"traders\" would probably be better off going to a roulette wheel and laying all their money on black or red, as that may well be the best they could do without having a probability edge. But therein lies the difference between my job and the tables.\n\nGambling is laying down your money where you don't have an advantage--or, as Dickson Watts writes in \"Speculation as a Fine Art,\" where there is no calculation.\n\nAnother way of looking at the difference is that of luck versus skill. Winning at roulette is usually just a matter of luck; winning at poker, at least consistently, is a matter of skill.\n\nThe same can be said of traders. Those who are simply lucky may find a winning trade, but most of them won't last long in the market because they are gambling. Those who have skill, on the other hand, may lose a given trade but still have the probability of success on their side in the long run.\n\nPart of that skill is trade structure, and part of it is risk management. Leveraged put selling, for instance, requires relatively little skill yet can make money most of the time if done properly. But when one of those \"fat tails\" comes along, those traders get crushed.\n\nRisk-managed volatility selling, on the other hand, does require skill and won't be subjected to potential ruin in the same way. Such trading is essentially the focus of Thorp's \"Beat the Market.\"\n\nSo the next time someone asks me what an option trader really does, I might just tell them it is like being an online poker player and see where the conversion goes.\n\n(A version of this article appeared in optionMONSTER's What's the Trade? newsletter of June 27"

It means that existence of 2 positions with the same name (OpetarionTag) can lead to the incorrect work of the system. To avoid such mistakes one can keep external counter that will assign unique numbers for the open positions to make your script identify them.\n\nExample: Let's write a small trading system that will open your Buy position in case High and Low difference of the last candle accedes 50 points. At the same time it has to make Stop order 20 points lower than Low of that candle and Limit 20 points higher that High of this candle.\n\nCreateOrder() Function is created for creation of pending orders.

      "text": "Using MA Crossovers And Swing Low Candlestick Formations For Entries And Exits\n\n[Today's guest post is by @TSXSwingtrader. Julie is a technical swing trader who focuses on chart patterns and trades mostly Canadian stocks on the TSX and TSX-venture.]\n\nMoving averages are a great tool to use to help determine relative strength in a stock's price. A rising (upward sloping) moving average indicates that price has been rising over x number of days.\n\nWhen shorter term MA's cross over longer term MA's, it indicates that there is relative strength in more recent price action and usually precedes a trend change to the upside. These can be a great opportunity to enter a stock at the beginning of a new uptrend.\n\nIn order to improve entry points, another technique to use in conjunction with the MA crossover is to look for a \"swing low\" entry. A swing low is a set of three candlesticks, where the price has been pulling back, the second candle has a lower low than the first candle, and the third candle has a higher low than the second. This signals that the selling is at the very least taking a break and price could be reversing back to the upside.\n\nThe crossover and swing low entry technique can also be used in reverse for shorting stocks. When the shorter term MA crosses below the longer term MA and the MA's begin to slope downward, a swing high will signal a short entry.\n\n$KMI is an example of how the MA crossover with swing low/high entries worked great:\n\nNot all crossovers are created equal.\n\nMA's are a great tool to add to a trading strategy, but they are just that – a tool. Nothing trumps price action. Entries and exits should not just be made blindly. It is important to watch price levels, pivot points, and support or resistance levels. If the crossover occurs just as the stock has had a good leg up, it's best to wait for a pullback.\n\nDon't enter a stock that is up against important resistance simply because the MA's crossed over. Similarly, use price levels to determine stops, as there often will be overshoots below MA's. So long as the MA's remain upward-sloping a drop below an MA does not necessarily signal a trend change.\n\nThis strategy works best with lower beta stocks. The concept of MA's is to smooth out average price action. Stocks that move more smoothly such as lower beta stocks will have a higher success rate using this technique. It does not work well with more volatile stocks, as these will cause too many whipsaws.\n\nThis technique does not work with ranging stocks. You can tell when a stock is ranging when the MA's intertwine with no specific slope.\n\nIt helps to watch the more standard MA's, such as the 50 and the 200 MA's. Although the technique can still be used when a stock is below its 200 MA, it will work better when price is above these MA's.\n\nI prefer using the 10, and 30 MA's since it seems to work best with my particular trading style. I have seen many variations used, such as the 10/20, 20/40, 20/50; I've also seen EMA's used, such as the 7/13 or 13/34 combinations. Some traders use three MA's, such as the crossovers of 5/10/20 or 10/20/30. Whichever ones you use will depend on your personal trading style and preferences. Using shorter term MA's will signal entries and exits more accurately, but will cause more whipsaws than using longer term MA's.\n\n$NXPI is an example of a current crossover with swing low entry signal:\n\nAs always, no trading strategy is foolproof. Every trade involves risk, and proper risk management should always be employed.\n\n*I first heard of the 10/30 crossover technique on a site called  They also discuss looking at swing low reversals for entry points. The site has a lot of great information for new swing traders and is a highly recommended read"

      "text": "Money management BROKEN DOWN & TIPS in FX (Hot for Beginners)\n\nMoney management is vital to success in trading alongside using the correct lot size in comparison to account size and stop loss. Many people look at Forex as a quick fix to make a raise. From personal experience this attitude will drain your account in a short space of time.The key to consistency is patience, compounding is powerful; your trading success will come.\n\nIt is unwise to risk more than 1-3% (MAXIMUM) of your account on any one trade!\n\nFor example:\n\nIf I had an account of £1000, £30 would be my 3% risk/drawdown.\n\nA good risk reward would be 1:3. Risking 3% to gain 9%\n\nWith my £1000 account I would be risking £30 to gain £90\n\nSo, say you have a valid setup which requires a 30 pip stop loss. To work out what lot size is relevant you would do the following:\n\nTips relating to trader's behaviour and psychology, some of the less known are:\n\nFocus on your current position(s) and place reasonable stop losses at the time you do the trade\n\nFocus on one cross at a time\n\nDon't trust demos - demo trading often causes new traders to learn bad habits. Once you know how your broker's system works, start trading small amounts and only take the risk you can afford to win or lose (new traders - remember that!)\n\nStick to your strategy and invest profits on the next trade that matches your long-term goals\n\nDon't trade if you are bored, unsure or reacting on a whim\n\nRead forums, blogs and chats around to get an unbiased view on your broker\n\nThe trader exposes himself/herself to a higher risk of loss/ incorrect judgement when they:\n\nUse rumours and advice without being certain of their authenticity\n\nActs on fear or hope without basing feelings on real facts. When trading you should be relaxed and calm, it helps to listen to some soothing music!\n\nExploits other people's emotions (people who are constant in their mistakes cannot gain success and earn money)\n\nDo not be greedy. Moving take profits higher/lower wanting to bag more cash. The market always seems to go back on you when you fiddle!\n\nMoving your stop loss as you think the market will go back in your favour. Take a loss!\n\nAlways take a look at the time frame larger than the one you've chosen to trade with. It gives you the bigger picture of what's happening. Analysis is more accurate on larger time frames.\n\nWhen in doubt — stay out. If it is not clear where the market will move — don't trade. In this case saving your present capital is a better choice than taking additional risks and losing money.\n\nA trade that's right for you WILL come along be patient\n\nAlways ensure that a signalling bar/candle on the chart is fully formed and closed before you enter a trade\n\nTo profit in trading, you must make recognize the markets. To recognize the markets, you must first know and recognize yourself. The first step of gaining self-awareness is ensuring that your risk tolerance and capital allocation to Forex and trading are not excessive or lacking. This means that you must carefully study and analyse your own financial goals in engaging Forex trading.\n\n2. Plan your goals. Stick to your plan.\n\nOnce you know what you want from trading, you must systematically define a timeframe and a working plan for your trading career. What constitutes failure, what would be defined as success? What is the timeframe for the trial and error process that will inevitably be an important part of your learning? How much time can you devote to trading? Do you aim at financial independence, or merely aim to generate extra income? These and similar questions must be answered before you can gain the clear vision necessary for a persistent and patient approach to trading. Also, having clear goals will make it easier to abandon the endeavour entirely in case that the risks/return analysis precludes a profitable outcome.\n\n3. Choose your broker carefully.\n\nWhile this point is often neglected by beginners, it is impossible to overemphasize the importance of the choice of broker. That a fake or unreliable broker invalidates all the gains acquired through hard work and study is obvious. But it is equally important that your expertise level and trading goals match the details of the offer made by the broker. What kind of client profile does the Forex broker aim at reaching? Does the trading software suit your expectations? How efficient is customer service? All these must be carefully scrutinized before even beginning to consider the intricacies of trading itself. Please refer to Forex broker reviews for help.\n\nIn continuation of the above item, it is necessary that we choose the account package that is most suited to our expectations and knowledge level. The various types of accounts offered by brokers can be confusing at first, but the general rule is that lower leverage is better. If you have a good understanding of leverage and trading in general, you can be satisfied with a standard account. If you're a complete beginner, it is a must that you undergo a period of study and practice by the use of a mini account. In general, the lower your risk, the higher your chances, so make your choices in the most conservative way possible, especially at the beginning of your career.\n\n5. Begin with small sums and then increase the size of your account through organic gains, not by greater deposits.\n\nOne of the best tips for trading Forex is to begin with small sums, and low leverage, while adding up to your account as it generates profits. There is no justification to the idea that a larger account will allow greater profits. If you can increase the size of your account through your trading choices, perfect. If not, there's no point in keeping pumping money to an account that is burning cash like an furnace burns paper.\n\n6. Focus on a single currency pair; expand as you better your skills.\n\nThe world of currency trading is deep and complicated, due to the chaotic nature of the markets, and the diverse characters and purposes of market participants. It is hard to master all the different kinds of financial activity that goes on in this world, so it is a great idea to restrict our trading activity to a currency pair which we understand, and with which we are familiar. Beginning with the trading of the currency of your nation can be a great idea. If that's not your choice, sticking to the most liquid and widely traded pairs can also be an excellent practice for both the beginner and the advanced traders.\n\n7. Do what you understand.\n\nSimple as it is, failure to abide by this principle has been the doom of countless traders. In general, if you're unsure that you know what you're doing, and that you can defend your opinion with strength and vigour against critics that you value and trust, do not trade. Do not trade on the basis of hearsay or rumours. And do not act unless you're confident that you understand both the positive consequences, and the adverse results that may result from opening a position.\n\n8. Do not add to a losing position.\n\nWhile this is just common sense, ignorance of the principle or carelessness in its employment has caused disasters to many traders in the course of history. Nobody knows where a currency pair will be heading during the next few hours, days, or even weeks. There are lots of educated guesses, but no knowledge of where the price will be a short while later. Thus, the only certain value about trading is now. Nothing much can be said about the future. Consequently, there can be no point in adding to a losing position, unless you love gambling. A position in the red can be allowed to survive on its own in accordance with the initial plan, but adding to it can never be an advisable practice.\n\n9. Restrain your emotions.\n\nGreed, excitement, euphoria, panic or fear should have no place in traders' calculations. Yet traders are human beings, so it is obvious that we have to find a way of living with these emotions, while at the same time controlling them and minimizing their effect on our lives. That is why traders are always advised to begin with small amounts. By reducing our risk, we can be calm enough to realize our long term goals, reducing the impact of emotions on our trading choices. A logical approach and less emotional intensity are the best Forex trading tips necessary to a successful career.\n\n10. Take notes. Study your success and failure.\n\nAn analytical approach to trading does not begin at the fundamental and technical analysis of price trends, or the formulation of trading strategies. It begins at the first step taken into the career, with the first dollar placed in an open position, and the first mistakes in calculation and trading methods. The successful trader will keep a diary, a journal of his trading activity where he carefully scrutinizes his mistakes and successes to find out what works and what does not. This is one of the most importance Forex trading tips that you will get from a good mentor.\n\n11. Automate your trading as much as possible.\n\nWe already noted the importance of emotional control in ensuring a successful and profitable career. In order to minimize the role of emotions, one of the best of courses of action would be the automatisation of trading choices and trader behaviour. You need to do make sure that your responses to similar situations and trading scenarios are themselves similar in nature. In other words, don't improvise. Let your reactions to market events follow a studied and tested pattern.\n\n12. Keep it simple. Both your trade plans and analysis should be easily understood and explained.\n\nForex trading is not rocket science. There is no expectation that you be a mathematical genius, or an economics professor to acquire wealth in currency trading. Instead, clarity of vision, and well-defined, carefully observed goals and practices offer the surest path to a respectable career in Forex. To achieve this, you must resist the temptation to overexplain, overanalyse, and most importantly, to rationalize your failures. A failure is a failure regardless of the conditions that led to it.\n\n13. Don't go against the markets, unless you have enough patience and financial resilience to stick to a long term plan.\n\nIn general, a beginner is never advised to trade against trends, or to pick tops and bottoms by betting against the main forces of market momentum. Join the trends so that your mind can relax. Fight the trends, and constant stress and fear will wreck your career.\n\n14. Understand that Forex is about probabilities.\n\nForex is all about risk analysis and probability. There is no single method or style that will generate profits all the time. The key to success is positioning in such a way that the losses are harmless, while the profits are multiplied. Such a positioning is only possible by managing our risk allocations in accordance with an understanding of probability and risk management.\n\n15. Be humble and patient. Do not fight the markets.\n\nRecognize your failures, and try to accommodate them if they can't be eliminated completely. Above all, resist the illusion that you somehow possess the alchemist's stone of trading. Such an attitude will surely be ruinous on your career eventually.\n\n16. Share your experiences. Follow your own judgment.\n\nWhile it is a great idea to discuss your opinion on the markets with others, you should be the one making the decisions. Consider the opinions of others, but make your own choices. It is your money after all.\n\n17. Study money management.\n\nOnce we make profits, it is time to protect them. Money management is about the minimization of losses, and maximization of profits. To ensure that you don't gamble away your hard-earned profits, to \"cut your losses short, and let profits ride\", you should keep the bible of money management as the centrepiece of your trading library at all times.\n\n18. Study the markets, fundamentals, and technical factors leading the price action.\n\nThat we have placed this so low in the list should not surprise the experienced trader. Faulty analysis is rarely the cause of a wiped-out account. A career that fails to begin is never killed by the consequences of erroneous application or understanding of fundamental or technical studies. Other issues that are related to money management and emotional control are far more important than analysis for the beginner, but as those issues are overcome, and steady gains are realized, the edge gained by successful analysis of the markets will be invaluable. Analysis is important, but only after a proper attitude to trading and risk taking is attained.\n\n19. Don't give up.\n\nFinally, provided that you risk only what you can afford to lose, persistence, and a determination to succeed are great advantages. It is highly unlikely that you will become a trading genius overnight, so it is only sensible to await the ripening of your skills, and the development of your talents before giving up. As long as the learning process is painless, as long as the amounts that you risk do not derail your plans about the future and your life in general, the pains of the learning process will be harmless.\n\nNice Post Shaun - agree with most of your tips - except - trading is not rocket science - keep it simple etc .Who ever originally said that was partly correct - its not \"rocket science\" - it actually a lot more difficult than rocket science - but if all the tutors and guru said that - it might put too many off ;-))"

He founded Invest2Success.com to empower individual institutional... More\n\nBuying and selling stocks according to a screen based on predetermined criteria, usually with the help of technical indicators such as relative strength or momentum. This method allows traders to enter transactions without emotion and backtest their strategies by using historical data from any time period.\n\nFor example, one of the most common mechanical investing systems is called the Dogs of the Dow. This strategy involves buying the 10 stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average with the highest dividend yield at the beginning of each year. The portfolio is then adjusted each year to only include the 10 highest yielding stocks. Proponents of mechanical investing say that using this method of investing removes all emotion by allowing a computer to do the work of deciding whether investing in a certain asset is warranted.\n\nWhen considering any trading strategy, your main criterion should be bottom line performance, that is, your bottom line performance. The primary question to answer is, \"Could I execute the trading strategy according to the rule sets as defined?\"\n\nIn this sense, whether a system is purely mechanical or discretionary or some combination of both is irrelevant. The rule set either makes money according to the plan or it doesn't. If it does, then you can either follow those rules or not and make money or not.\n\nBefore you commit a lot of time and money to developing or investing in a particular trading system, it would be nice to know if your personality type fits that trading system. A lot of people believe that while they are working on developing their own trading system that fits them really well, they can trade a mechanical system since they just have to follow its rules to make money. Then, they discover that the mechanical system needs some of tinkering: bending the rules or otherwise adding a dose of discretion. Tinkering means breaking the rules (which may not have fit them) and they find they don't make money, even though they know the mechanical system makes money. It comes down to following the system's rules.\n\nHere's an example from my own trading experience from which I have had to learn to leave a system alone and follow its rules—even though that's hard.\n\nI have a mechanical system that is in the market only 10 to 15% of the time in a given year. It waits for specific high probability conditions to arise in the market, then it takes a position that is clearly against the mass psychology. It aims to capitalize on the market's tendency to revert to the mean after extreme moves. The rule set guarantees that you enter the market in a direction completely opposite of what your natural human psychological tendencies advise.\n\nI have back-tested this system extensively in multiple market types over the past 15 years with great results. I have traded it profitably with real money for more than four years. I have abundant evidence to be rationally satisfied that this system has a high probability of success and reliable results. Every time it fires a signal, though, I am still uncomfortable entering the position because of my psychology. I have had to learn how to accept the uncomfortable feeling as a positive sign of a good trade. Now I manage my psychology so that I can enter the position at appropriate risk levels when the system generates the signals.\n\nIn a larger sense, I think the following elements are necessary for pure mechanical traders:\n\n* They have confidence in their analytical judgments.\n\n* They have confirmed the reliability of the system.\n\n* They have identified the risk level that allows them to apply their trading system without the danger of blowing up.\n\n* They are committed to their periodic performance review and can approach the entire situation with analytical mind and rigor.\n\nThese are rare qualities for most people but for someone who wants to develop and exploit a good mechanical system, they are idealnice post...mechanical or discretionary? aah, the choices we face as traders...i too feel uncomfortable when the system signals a trade...but if you feel you have an edge you must ignore your emotions and play the probability..\n\nInstablogs are Seeking Alpha's free blogging platform customized for finance, with instant set up and exposure to millions of readers interested in the financial markets.

      "text": "Options Education\n\nThe Components of Options Pricing\n\nTHE MAIN COMPONENTS OF OPTIONS PREMIUM The premium of an option has two main components: intrinsic value and time value.\n\nIntrinsic Value (Calls): When the underlying security's price is higher than the strike price a call option is said to be \"in-the-money.\"\n\nIntrinsic Value (Puts): If the underlying security's price is less than the strike price, a put option is \"in-the-money.\" Only in-the-money options have intrinsic value, representing the difference between the current price of the underlying security and the option's exercise price, or strike price.\n\nTime Value: Prior to expiration, any premium in excess of intrinsic value is called time value. Time value is also known as the amount an investor is willing to pay for an option above its intrinsic value, in the hope that at some time prior to expiration its value will increase because of a favorable change in the price of the underlying security. The longer the amount of time for market conditions to work to an investor's benefit, the greater the time value.\n\nTHE SIX MAJOR FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE OPTIONS PREMIUM There are six major factors that influence option premiums. The factors having the greatest effect are:\n\n* A change in price of the underlying security * Strike price * Time until expiration * Volatility of the underlying security * Dividends/Risk-free interest rate * Dividends and risk-free interest rate have a lesser effect.\n\nChanges in the Underlying Security Price can increase or decrease the value of an option. These price changes have opposite effects on calls and puts. For instance, as the value of the underlying security rises, a call will generally increase and the value of a put will generally decrease in price. A decrease in the underlying security's value will generally have the opposite effect.\n\nThe Strike Price determines whether or not an option has any intrinsic value. An option's premium (intrinsic value plus time value) generally increases as the option becomes further in the money, and decreases as the option becomes more deeply out of the money.\n\nTime Until Expiration, as discussed above, affects the time value component of an option's premium. Generally, as expiration approaches, the levels of an option's time value, for both puts and calls, decreases or \"erodes.\" This effect is most noticeable with at-the-money options.\n\nVolatility is the most subjective and perhaps the most difficult factor to quantify, but it can have a significant impact on the time value portion of an option's premium. Volatility is simply a measure of risk (uncertainty), or variability of price of an option's underlying security. Higher volatility estimates reflect greater expected fluctuations (in either direction) in underlying price levels. This expectation generally results in higher option premiums for puts and calls alike, and is most noticeable with at-the-money options.\n\nDividends and the Current Risk-Free Interest Rate have a small but measurable effect on option premiums. This effect reflects the \"cost of carry\" of shares in an underlying security -- the interest that might be paid for margin or received from alternative investments (such as a Treasury bill), and the dividends that would be received by owning shares outright"

      "text": "iStockMusicPro said\nAs someone said earlier, when investing you need to use stop losses. This is an automatic sell order that triggers at a price you specify. I set my stop losses between 10 – 15% from my entry point. This means I always know exactly the amount that is at risk. It also means you will never be holding onto a stock that goes down 50%, it will have already been sold when it hits your stop. Never invest more than a 6th of your total capital on one stock, and insure that no more than 10% of your capital is at risk at any one point.\n\nFinally, if you find all your stop losses get hit, take a month away from the market and work on your knowledge of the market instead.\n\nIf you read those books and do what they say, you will be fine. Most of it is psychology.\n\nThey sure was mad when they write those books.\n\niStockMusicPro said\nMost people hold on to their losing stocks in the hope they will go up, and sell their winning stocks early to bank some profits. You actually need to do the exact opposite, sell the losers as fast as possible, and ride the winners for all they are worth.\nGood luck and don't worry, all successful traders started out as not so successful traders\n\nMarkedSound said\nThing about the stock market is, like you said, you really really have to know about the company inside and out before investing in it. Also, there's day trading and then long term investing. Two vastly different strategies. People can make the mistake of dabbling in between. Also, as someone mentioned stop-losses are key. If you look at any wealthy investors/entrepreneurs, the common trait is a keen ability to minimize losses. Really, that trumps bringing in more cashflow!\n\nxstortionist said\nI generally look for splits when investing in the stock market. You have to take risks in life to get ahead, no one will ever come to your doorstep with a pile of money or job application. So you lost a lot of money, don't sweat it, get back up on the horse and ride another day. It's only money right? Just go out and make more of it!\nIf you are really interested in the stock game, learn it like the back of your hand and then give it another go. Surround yourself around people who are also in the stock game, learn from their mistakes and find out what their best advice is to make you more successful. It's really a numbers game to be honest."

      "text": "Other Types of Trend Lines\n\nThe concept of trend is central to the field of technical analysis. Therefore, analysts have developed a number of applications and variations of trend lines. Trend lines are not just useful with bar charts; analysts using point-and-figure charts make use of trend lines. Speed lines, Andrews Pitchfork, and Gann fan lines are all example of types of trend lines technical analysts use.\n\nTrend Lines on Point-and-Figure Charts\n\nA trend line may be drawn between successive lows or highs in the standard, old-style, point-and-figure charts, just as they are drawn in a bar or candlestick chart. There is one variation, however, that occurs in the three-box reversal method. For this type of chart, trend lines are drawn at 45-degree angles (see Figure 12.19). Upward trend lines, called bullish support lines, are drawn at a 45-degree angle from the lowest low, and downward trend lines, called bearish resistance lines, are drawn from the last peak. These lines are not really trend lines in the sense that we have covered earlier, but price penetration through them has very specific meaning. We cover these in more detail in Chapter 16, \"Point-and-Figure Chart Patterns.\""

      "text": "The basics of an initial public offering\n\nAn initial public offering is the moment when a privately held company receives a chunk of cash in exchange for control of the company. Image: Flickr / chijs / CC-BY-SA\n\nA stock IPO is a big step for any company, and it usually involves very large piles of cash. For most people, however, the ins and outs of an IPO are confusing.\n\nThe basic idea of an IPO\n\nAn initial public offering is when a company that has previously been privately held offers stock holdings publicly. An IPO is the day a company officially transitions from a privately held company held responsible only to the owners to a publicly owned company responsible to stockholders. An IPO also usually represents a huge amount of cash, because the company gets money for the control of the company that they are selling off. An initial public offering is, essentially, when a company sells control in order to raise money to use for business purposes.\n\nHow an IPO price is set\n\nBefore an initial public offering, a company is allowed to set the price for stock shares. However, once those stocks are offered on a public exchange, the company loses all control of the price of the stock. From that point forward, the only control a company can exert on its stock price is the behavior of the company, rather than the stock price itself. Before the IPO, however, the company usually goes around and \"shops\" its own stock to large investment companies, banks, and other large investors. Most of the stock of a company is usually spoken for at a particular price before the day of the initial public offering. Once the stock hits the public market, market forces determine whether the price should go up or down.\n\nThe importance of the IPO day\n\nThe day of the initial public offering is the day that the previously agreed upon purchases of the stock by large investors actually take place, and the money flows into the company. The IPO day is also the first day that private investors can decide to invest in a company and purchase stock. In short, the IPO day is the day that a company receives buckets of money and hands over control.\n\nShould you buy in on an IPO?\n\nAn initial public offering can be a very tempting day to buy in to a stock. As an individual investor, however, buying in on IPO day may or may not be a good idea. Some stocks only go up in price from the IPO, but most experience some kind of volatility in the few days or weeks after an initial public offering. If you are 100 percent confident that a stock price will only be going up after the IPO, then it could be worth buying in. If not, then it could be worth waiting. Remember that an IPO is not a magic bullet; an IPO is simply the first time something is available.\n\nSources\n\nRelated videos\n\nA number of banks and other entities are starting to offer prepaid debit cards, the re-loadable payment cards that many unbanked consumers use in lieu of bank accounts.

Well, if an investor wanted to purchase stocks, options, or futures - they would need to ultimately go through some sort of regulated exchange - such as the NYSE. Currency traders have no such regulated mechanism overseeing transactions. What exactly does this mean for the average investor? An increased element of risk. Basically, there is no grand body overseeing currency trades. Therefore, the traditional safety nets like clearing houses, arbitration boards, or even an overall governing exchange do not exist. Currency exchanges are simply made between Forex members based upon the credit arrangements and conditions agreed upon before the transaction - yep that's it!"

      "text": "That's terrible news for all of us who want more input into what's going to happen in the future. Bettors on Intrade.com have made incredibly accurate predictions about elections - because they, unlike TV pundits, have real money on the line. This year, I watched on election night as TV pundits said \"too close to call... too close to call...\" while the bettors on Intrade knew that it was not a close call.\n\nIntrade has also successfully predicted events like Saddam Hussein's capture and the winner of the Oscars. People with the best information trade about those events, and drive up the odds on Intrade.\n\nWhy did the American government sue Intrade? It was not for operating an online gambling operation, but for allegedly violating America's incomprehensible financial regulations -- specifically, these ones:\n\n\"Section 4c(b) and 9(a)(3) of the [Commodity Exchange] Act, §§6c(b) and 13(a)(3) (2006); Section 2(e) of the Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, to be codified at 7 U.S.C. § 2(e); and Regulation 32, as amended, to be codified at 17 C.F.R. § 32 (2011);\"\n\nIn English: the government says that many of the things Intrade allows people to predict - everything from what the price of gold will be in the future to whether the U.S. will go to war soon - are legally considered \"commodity options,\" and that Intrade broke the law because it isn't licensed to trade those. The penalty is $140,000 per violation.\n\nIn a press release, the CFTC's chief enforcer went out of his way to target \"prediction markets\":\n\n\"It is against the law to solicit U.S. persons to buy and sell commodity options, even if they are called 'prediction' contracts, unless they are... traded on a CFTC-registered exchange... Today's action should make it clear that we will intervene in the 'prediction' markets, wherever they may be based.\"\n\nWhy doesn't Intrade just obey the complicated law and become a licensed exchange? They tried, but the CFTC won't give them a license. When an established, licensed U.S. commodity exchange applied for permission to do what Intrade does, the CFTC turned them down, too.\n\nThe pompous CFTC enforcer claims that the regulation \"is important for a number of reasons, including that it enables the CFTC to police market activity.\"\n\nPlease. These regulations don't help police market activity. When people make money on Intrade, Intrade sends them the money. There are no allegations of fraud. Customers are happy with Intrade, judging by increased activity on the site (over $50 million was bet about whether Obama or Romney would win.)\n\nThe market polices itself.\n\nIn a sane world, government would focus on preventing fraud, not on crushing innovative ideas.\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats are at fault for creating the bloated government agencies that do things like this. President Obama also deserves blame, indirectly, for appointing Gary Gensler as the head of the CFTC, who in turn appointed the anti- prediction market prosecutor quoted above"

      "text": "Spotting Trends: Some People Want to Spot Trends; Wrong Way to Think!\n\nWe receive the question regularly: How do you pinpoint or find a trend? First, put away the microscope -- it will not help locate trends.\n\nSome people seem to think there must be some one precise way to determine when a trend starts. Identifying the exact trend starting point is their single unreachable objective. It's the same as picking a top or bottom. If you find yourself attempting to peg the exact beginning of a trend -- get ready to start losing money. The holy grail can't be had.\n\nWhat can you do? What do trend followers do? First, you must have a system that covers all system trading issues including money management (or bet size). A complete trend trading system will establish rules for entry, exit, how much to buy and how much to sell. Regardless of the particular day, week, month, year or current market condition, the rules are universal.\n\nBut, still how do you determine a trending market? Wrong question! The question is how do you make money. The answer involves taking small bets early on in a market (that is starting to move) to see if the trend does indeed mature and get big. Trend followers enter markets long before the nightly news is reporting new 13 year highs and long before a trend is ever evident. When the financial news starts talking about high gas prices or a stock at record lows or highs, trend followers have long since established their positions (and profits) and may be exiting when the late to the party amateurs start taking their positions based on a David Faber news report.\n\nWhen trends begin they often arise from a flat market that doesn't appear to be trending in any direction. That's when trend followers are establishing their positions based on their entry rules. There are usually small signs early that signal trend follower's entry into a market. These signs, coupled with money management, are the keys.\n\nThe Wrong Way to View a Trend\n\n\"If a speculator is correct half of the time, he is hitting a good average. Even being right 3 or 4 times out of 10 should yield a person a fortune if he has the sense to cut his losses quickly on the ventures where he is wrong.\" Bernard Baruch\n\nIt was reported that a trading fund had still not seen major redemption's even though the fund was down 95%! Think about that. Your position is down 95% and you are still sitting there holding on hoping for it all to come back. This is a great example of following the trend the wrong way. And for those that think we are simply being 20/20 hindsight, you are dead wrong. Trends are trends and they will continue to behave the same in the future as they have in the past. You just need rules to trade them. More."

      "text": "that generates buy/sell signals on stocks on a 1-day basis. The strategy employs a good deal of indicators with considerable lookback periods (e.g. 75-day SMA etc.).\n\nNow the obstacle that needs to be coped with is: I keep getting major inconsistencies when employing the strategy on various PCs. That is, there are several PCs, each of which should have an accurate historical dataset for the stock prices. These datasets have been obtained via working with this and other strategies for quite a while, adding historical data to the database when needed via Yahoo / Google connections. The NT program settings on the PCs being in use are the same.\n\nWhat happens is: I do the same analysis on two independent PCs, which both have a \"correct\" set of historical data. On the one PC the strategy tells me it has a current AAPL position of 60 pieces, whereas on the other PC it thinks it is flat. It might as well be strategy on PC#1 thinks it has 50 YHOO, whilst the PC#2 strategy thinks it has 95 YHOO. Therefore, the signals being generated differ on the PCs being used - pretty incomfortable to think that the signals don't stem from the strategy, but more likely rely on the underlying data...\n\nCan anyone think of a procedure to establish a \"clean\" dataset, meaning I can do this procedure and then do the analyses on either PC without having to worry about the data possibly being different (I'm not saying wrong) from the other PC's data?\n\nThe best way to ensure identical databases is to export the data from one computer and import it to the next. That will ensure 100% identical data sets across both machines. You can do this process through the Historical Data Manager.\n\nHowever, I think this kind of misses the point a bit - if I get two versions of datasets, how do I know which one is the \"correct\" one (assuming both have been obtained in proper ways)? I mean, I'd want the signals to be generated in the most accurate possible way.\n\nUnfortunately there is no metric to determine one is better than the other as this is subjective in nature. What you get is what is provided by the data provider you use. In deciding which one you ultimately want to use is up to you to decide.\n\nWell, the thing is: I get varying results even when using the same (!) data source on the different systems. I agree with you that the data just has to be consistent \"in itself\" (such as varying minute objects), but at least the results should match when applying the system on different PCs.\n\n- different indicator setting on one PC (myself being stupid there, I admit)\n\n- had to update dividends and splits on every stock in order to bring the results in line.\n\nThanks for helping Josh, and sorry for causing trouble. Is there a way to automatically update stocks and dividends for a given instrument list, by the way? Clicking them all manually might be okay for the Nasdaq 100, but what about the S&P 500...?"

      "text": "Perhaps it is better to be irresponsible and right, than to be responsible and wrong – WINSTON CHURCHILL\n\nI don't know about you but I think it's pretty confusing out there right now. How are the government interventions to the financial crisis going to play out? Is the result going to be rampant inflation? Are we going to be crushed under the debt? Should I buy gold and silver or are they in a bubble? How am I supposed to figure all this out? How do I make money?\n\nThe truth is no one knows what's going to happen. On the other hand, do we really need to know what is going to happen to make money? I don't think so. What we need to do is focus on the things that matter and the things we can control.\n\nEven though we are poorly calibrated in estimating probabilities, we just love to do it. We think we are smarter and have better information than we actually do. Unfortunately most of the information has been discounted in the market or just plain doesn't matter.\n\nCarl Richards from behaviorgap.com says, \"Overconfidence is a huge problem when it comes to making investment decisions. In fact, it's a huge problem when we're dealing with any issue that has an unknown outcome. It's clear that we're very bad at dealing with unknown outcomes, but the biggest problem is that we actually think we're good at it. We think that we can control much more than we can, and we can actually forecast the future. Often we point to what we view as clear evidence and wonder how anyone that doesn't see it the same way can be so stupid. Focusing on the things that matter and the things we can control will go a long way to avoiding investor overconfidence.\"\n\nGood trading requires flexibility and since predictions have an inflexible outcome, they can change our focus. If we get attached to our predictions our focus will shift from being profitable to being right. Being profitable \"matters\", being right does not matter. Also we have no control over what the future may bring, but we can control our risk. We need to stay focused on what matters and what we can control.\n\nIt's practically impossible not to have opinions on the markets, but the trick is to bankroll the opportunity that may be there and not the need to be right. Usually the academic predictor won't predefine his risk because it doesn't cross his mind that it's necessary. As Mark Douglas said in Trading in the zone \"the only way he could believe it is not necessary (to define risk) is if he believes he knows what's going to happen next. The reason he believes he knows what's going to happen next is because he won't get into a trade until he is convinced he is right. At the point where he's convinced the trade will be a winner, it's no longer necessary to define the risk (because if he's right there is no risk).\"\n\nTry not to be a bull or a bear but an opportunist. The opportunity seeker is influenced by the same endless opinions that dominate the news, yet he doesn't allow himself into an inflexible point of view. He explores various scenarios and designs low risk trades to exploit the possible outcomes. He focuses on things he can control.\n\nIn the end, making money is a different game than being right or wrong. I know a lot of smart guys who were right about a market's outcome but still went broke because they were inflexible. In short, they got too invested in being right and lost focus of the real goal, which is to make money.\n\nVincent Ryan Ruggiero, in his book Critical Thinker, says that one way to avoid falling into a committed trap is to train ourselves to think in terms of exception. Once the \"case\" has been made, begin to run through your mind the exceptions that could upset the case.\n\nOne exercise that I use all the time is to think in reverse. Whenever I feel very strong about a scenario, and find myself assuming I'm right, I take the exact opposite posture to see if there is a case there. The more exceptions that I can find, the less impact the original case has, and therefore the more cautious I am about my position. I try and stay focused on making money and not being right about my scenario. I concentrate on what I actually do have control over"

This strategy is very similar to the covered call strategy.\n\nThe safest option is to make sure the put is \"cash secured.\" This simply means that you have enough cash in the account to purchase that specific stock if it trades below the strike price. Your final price would be a tad bit lower when you add the premium you were paid up front into the equation. For example, if you sold a put at a strike of 20 with two months of time left on it for $2.50; $250 per contract would be deposited in your account.\n\nTime is on your side. Every day you profit via time decay as long as the stock price does not drop significantly. In the event it does drop below the strike you sold the put at, you get to buy a stock you like at the price you wanted. Time decay is the greatest in the front month.\n\nIt has tested the $36.00 ranges twice, once in June ($36.34) and once in July (36.27). After a long correction, it is generally a more bullish sign when a stock puts in higher lows. In this case, it has put in lower lows so there is still a chance that it could spike below $36.00 on an intra day basis. The stock has taken a serious drubbing, and it appears to be trying to put in a bottom. A weekly close above $39 will turn the outlook to bullish. If you are bullish on the long-term prospects of this stock, you can implement the following strategy.\n\nWe would wait for the stock to pull back to the $36.50-$37.00 ranges and then attempt to the sell the Jan 2013, 37 puts. These options are currently trading in the $1.85- $2.05 ranges. A pullback to the stated ranges should drive the price of these options to the $2.05-$2.30 ranges. For this example, we will assume that we can sell these puts for $2.10 or better. $210 will be deposited into your account for each contract sold.\n\nIf the stock trades below the strike price, the shares could be put to you (assigned to your account). If this is the case, you have the opportunity of getting into this stock at a much lower price. Your final price per share will be $34.90 ($37.00 minus $2.10). If the stock is not assigned to your account, you walk away with a gain of 5.6% in roughly 7 months.

      "text": "Nav view search\n\nNavigation\n\nSearch\n\nMain Menu\n\nTwitter\n\nStrategies\n\nThe following are some basic concepts of investing strategies that I use in my everyday trading. This section is to serve as a basic guide when understanding the reasoning for certain plays. I'm currently working on several detailed books that will go over my strategies in great detail. These books will be available on this site once released. My goal is to help guide you in learning this great investment game and achieve your investment goals.\n\nEntering a position: I may enter a position using multiple entries and will only enter a position with full risk in certain situations. I usually allow myself 3-5 entries but may make adjustments depending on the setup. What type of entry will be explained on every play I post.\n\nExiting a position: I may exit positions at multiple prices instead of exiting the entire position at one price. This allows me more flexibility when trying to maximize trades. What type of exit will be explained on every play I post.\n\nI recommend my strategies are done at discount brokers with low commissions in order to maximize returns. Many strategies I use generate multiple entries which may increase commissions. The brokers I recommend are Interactive Brokers, light speed and Ameritrade.\n\nPenny Stock Strategies ( Small Cap/ Micro Cap Stock )\n\nMany on wall street compare penny stock investing to gambling and say that investing in penny stocks is extremely risky. Why is most of wall street so negative on penny stocks? Because it is so much easier to favor blue chip companies. By actively promoting their blue chip clients they are able to keep them happy and continue to bring in their investment banking and advisory revenue. On the retail brokerage side it easy for Wall Street to create explanations for underperformance. How can you fault a money manager for losing money on Microsoft or Mc Donalds after all right.\n\nPenny stocks offer investors great opportunities to produce above average returns. The trick of course is trying to find the right ones to invest in. I approach penny stocks differently than other investment strategies by analyzing potential plays from a more fundamental approach. Evaluating penny stocks from a technical point of view is very difficult for most plays due to the low trading volume that is associated with most penny stocks. This low volume could cause extreme volatility at times which causes false moves when entering penny stock positions.\n\nSector Rotation\n\nThis is one of my favorite strategies because it is very simple to implement and is able to take advantage of large shifts in capital as the economy moves through different cycles. Many funds implement this strategy due to the ability to allocate a large amount of capital that could invested without making a material impact to the market as well as the invest to mature over many months and years. This allows funds to slowly move in and out of positions as well as minimizes trading expenses. This type of strategy is suitable for long term investments like 401k's, IRA's and pensions.\n\nSwing Trading\n\nThese trades take advantage of opportunities in the market based off technical analysis. I use basic support and resistance levels tied in with three simple moving averages. I look for setups where stocks may have reached an extreme point which will cause a momentum move in a particular direction. The basic understanding of technical analysis is that the charts represent the emotions of all market participants within a given market. I believe these market participants have certain patterns that occur on a consistent basis in the market due to their beliefs which cause a market to move a certain way. I have found which patterns make the most consistent profits in the markets."

      "text": "Sep\n\n23\n\nLet's examine the limit order in more detail. There are essentially three scenarios that can occur when you place a limit order. One - you are brilliant. You caught the bottom, nicked the top and got in at an excellent price and can now manage a trade with great risk/reward profile. Two, you were right on the overall direction of the instrument but because you tried to be cute with price you missed your entry and now watch wistfully as prices move away from you while you remain empty handed. Three - you got your fill and now you wish you hadn't as price continues in the opposite direction of your bet.\n\nSo in summary in two out of three cases you have a negative outcome. Now if you happen to be a superb market timer that may not matter, but if you are just an average Joe (and we all are) then your chances of execution are basically 33% on each scenario which means your chance of winning is only 33%. That's why limit orders are a sucker's bet. They play to our desire for a bargain, but in the end they cost much more than we think.\n\nSteve Ellison writes:\n\n\"… your chance of winning is only 33%. That's why limit orders are a sucker's bet.\"\n\nHere is a quick test of that proposition.\n\nImagine that traders A, B, and C each make at most one round trip trade in the S&P 500 futures every week. Trader C is a permabull, so every Sunday afternoon when Globex opens, he immediately buys the contract. He sells at the close on Friday.\n\nTrader B wants to only \"trade in the direction of the price flow\", so he only buys the contract if it goes up 5 points from the Sunday open. Then he sells at the close on Friday.\n\nTrader A fancies himself a tough negotiator and places a limit order 5 points below the Sunday open. He is last in line, so his order is only filled if the price drops to 5.25 points below the Sunday open. If filled, he also sells at the close on Friday.\n\nHere is how each trader would have fared in the last 64 weeks.\n\nTrader A, the user of limit orders, would have had 59 of 64 orders filled. He would have been \"too cute\" 5 times and missed out on big gains. 7 of his fills would have suffered from adverse selection as the market continued down, and trader B stayed out of the market. Trader A's net profit on his 59 trades was 223 points. 37 of the 59 trades were profitable.\n\nHence the 2 out of 3 things that can go wrong with limit orders occurred less than 20% of the time empirically. Trader A won far more than 33% of the time. Even after detrending the data to correct for the upward drift during the period, trader A's limit orders were profitable 34 of 59 times (58%).\n\nTrader B would have avoided all the adverse selection weeks in which the market did nothing but go down. However, his net profit on his 57 trades would have been only 53 points.\n\nTrader C, the always-in trader, would have traded all 64 weeks and had a net profit of 172 points.\n\nIn this test, the user of limit orders did better than the follower of price flow.\n\nComments\n\nMr Veltman usually writes very thoughtful posts, unfortunately this is not one of them.\n\nFirst, just because there are three possible outcomes does not mean that there is an equal probability of each occurring, so to conclude \"only a 33% chance of winning with a limit order\" is wrong.\n\nWhy only consider the use of limit orders to open, rather than to close a position? In fast or thin markets (eg gold), having resting limit orders are perhaps the only way to close or part close your position during a \"spike\" at your intended price. So a valid use is to capture liquidity where your reaction speed and connection delays may prevent you getting a good fill with another order type. As you are closing, you are not concerned with market risk of the market moving significantly through your limit price trapping you in a losing trade.\n\nWhen considering bigger positions relative to the liquidity of the market, limit orders can provide a helpful way to scale out of the position while keeping market impact to a minimum.\n\nAs for your third scenario, that the market misses the order and goes the other way - rather than waiting on the sidelines \"wistfully\" a competent trader can read well enough to know when to adjust the price or go at the market. This business is about survival of the fittest and just because something may be difficult for the majority to do does not negate the value it may have in the hands of a more skilled operator.\n\nConsider a small trader (100 lot) reversing a short term long position short. Lets say 100 lots are taken off at limit price close to where the trader anticipates the top, 50 lots a little higher than this to capture the final buying, and then a 50 lot market order to complete the transaction. This is just one example. The 100 lots is expected to be filled safely to go flat, partial of the short is established at limit price, and the final market order is put on at a slightly better or worse price depending on the market action and skill of the operator. In many cases this will result in a better average price than selling 200 at the market. (again, assuming a thin contract or trading an overnight electronic session). If the limit 50 only fills partially, then this gives even more information about the market condition being traded in.\n\nAlso, you ignore specialist cases such as liquidity provision by making an aggressive two way market in size, and the information which a size trader can read from how he is filled. Paul Rotters trading style was a good example, but he is certainly not the only trader who executes in this way.\n\nBottom line is that if even a small (100 lot) trader can benefit from improving execution and the appropriate use of order types, it is downright essential to medium and large size traders. For successful trading, the limitation very quickly becomes market liquidity in all but the large timeframes. Appropriate management of orders is necessary to make the most of the opportunities, especially in markets such as oil where the B/A spread can widen considerably at times of high pace.\n\nFrankly I don't expect any high level discussion of execution strategies to take place in public given the competitive nature of this business. Just pointing out that sometimes a limit is the appropriate and best tool for a certain job and it would be wrong to dismiss it due to the shortcomings of a hypothetical trader who isn't very accurate in placing them or uses them in the wrong way.\n\nTom on\nSeptember 25, 2012 6:19 am\n\nSteve Ellison wrote:\n''Trader B wants to only \"trade in the direction of the price flow\", so he only buys the contract if it goes up 5 points from the Sunday open. Then he sells at the close on Friday.''\n\nI think Mr Ellison's examples very apt, but how many people trade in such a way I wonder. This is the realm of \"curve fitting\" and \"backtesting\" which serves to ensnare many or even most in an endless journey without knowing the destination.\n\nApproach A,B,C will make a little money when the market goes up and lose when it goes down. I suspect many fund managers etc spend endless hours going over data trying to come up with what are essentially more complex variations on this A,B,C theme. All with some sort of mechanical ruleset to try and avoid all the inconsistencies of human decision making.\n\nIn fact, aside from the few real superstars in trading who have grown to the point of managing billions of their own funds with no further need for OPM (some household names, some relatively anonymous) - do most fund managers really know anything? Why would a proficient trader wish the handcuffs of an imposed risk profile and the scrutiny of regulatory bodies? Are they just salesmen who get by on their 2 and 20 with mediocre returns for their clients? Throw out some multivariate regression analysis, quantitative models, etc and then end up being long the index any way. But of course this way is better-you go long the index but only on the Nth day of the month and out at the end, or some other curve fitted variation.\n\nThere are many such discussions here, between undoubtedly intelligent and sophisticated people, which seem to revolve around discussions of how best to predict the past. Trader \"B\" above doesn't know if there is a way to capture the first 5 points instead of buying 5 points higher, and probably also doesn't know that a market going up 5 points without any other parameters tells one exactly zero about the magnitude and direction of the next move.\n\nWe have these interesting discussions about negative sequences, correlations, variance, etc…and it all sounds good but does it really get anyone closer to the level of trading which they aspire to? For sure there is plenty of work being done both to come up with analytical approaches and the time taken to backtest and provide examples. In terms of solid approaches to generate alpha, people here either don't know or are shrewd enough to keep it to themselves.\n\nWhat I enjoy visiting this site for is the eloquent contributions of intelligent and thoughtful members on travel, life, philosophy, Objectivism, sport, games, etc. So I would venture this is site is truly a great read for everything except trading.\n\nThe reason is that everyone seems to think about and discuss only ever a few aspects of trading at a time without considering how it all fits together. Order types one week, why there might be big moves and how many times they have occurred the next week when there is a big move, what the flexions do when our political overlords are busy bailing out their buddies the next. All good reading for sure, but it all ultimately coalesces around reinterpretions or rehashing of the same old concepts. It seems to be that this is how many or most approach trading, and for this of course I am grateful.\n\nAnatoly Veltman on\nSeptember 27, 2012 12:18 am\n\nThanks Tom! Errata: the headline post was NOT my thoughts. As Clooney famously said in \"Ocean's 11″: I know a guy! The headline post merely quoted \"that guy\" I know.

      "text": "Performing a trend analysis on different stocks in the stock market requires accumulating past price data on the stocks in question in an attempt to judge their future performance. Charting these prices is a good start to analysis, since the chart will show the up and down movement of a stock over a period of time. In addition, calculating moving averages, which change as each new bit of price data replaces an outdated piece of information, is also an effective method of trend analysis. Measuring volume of trading on a specific stock can also indicate whether a trend is trustworthy or due for a correction.\n\nMany people believe that all of the pertinent information necessary to trade a specific stock successfully can be found in the stock's past performance. The idea is that the past performance will show some sort of trend that will eventually play itself out once again in the stock's future. There are many different methods of trend analysis available, but the one general rule is that the more information available to investors, the more reliable the analysis will be.\n\nOne of the easiest ways for a beginning investor to perform a trend analysis is by constructing a price chart. The horizontal axis of the chart should be the dates the prices were measured, while the vertical axis will show the corresponding prices of the stock in question. Doing a chart in this way will give investors an easily-understood visual to show which way a stock tends to move over time. If there are a lot of changes in direction, it means that the stock is especially volatile and hard to predict.\n\nMoving averages are another way that trend analysis can be performed. Calculating a moving average requires first taking the average price of a stock for a certain period of time, like, for example, 10 days. On the 11th day of the cycle, the average will change since the newest day will replace the first day in the calculation. Watching how the moving average changes as time goes by can reveal trends in either direction.\n\nSome experts who perform trend analysis believe that a sudden movement in price is only indicative of a trend if it was accompanied by a large volume of trading. The volume on a given day is the amount of times that a stock was bought and sold by investors. If, for example, a big spike in price is accompanied by a high volume of trading, it could mean that the upward move will continue. Low volume levels mean that the price changes aren't to be trusted."

      "text": "Some days this blog has a couple short sentences, and others it has what seems like pages, and understandably it causes inconsistency. Unfortunately that's just the way things turn out sometimes.\n\nI'm glad I'm still paper trading, even with how promising the TT (triple threat) strategy looked. The most important thing you can do for yourself is to do your own work if possible. While I like the TT, I don't fully agree with all the stops such, and that's good for me. A good trader should trade with his or her own style and judgement, not based on what a \"better\" trader teaches them.\n\nSo, I did my own work. Pipwoof said he backtested his system for 4 pairs over 18 months. That's quite a lot of work by hand, so I decided to start small: 1 pair for 1 month. Now, I ran into a bit of a problem, as the following picture shows. The system is based off of the previous days data, so.. that's kind of important to know which days are which.\n\nUnfortunately I ran into some consistency issues of my own: The top clearly says the 8th, while the 3 boxes on the left say the 7th. Which to trust? Considering I made this screen shot today (the 8th) I decided to trust the top number over the bottom.\n\nDaunting I know, but after sorting through it, it's not too bad at all. Step by step, removing the excel stuff if I can help it. If anyone is curious to know about how the functions work or what exactly they are (or if you want the excel file itself) just let me know:\n\nA: Just the date, removing Saturdays\n\nB: Day of the week; important because the breakout system works differently on Mondays than it does others\n\nC/D: PDH/PDL or the previous day's high and low. Pretty self explanatory.\n\nE/F: BT/ST, the Buy and Sell triggers. The excel function first checks if the day if either a Sunday or a Monday. I made a judgement call about trading on Sundays, and put it to the same test as Mondays: The buy/sell trigger has to be 11 pips above the Previous Day's High/Low.\n\nG/H/I: Just data. I recorded that day's High, Low, and Close according to my Platform in EST.\n\nUp to this point nothing special, just data. The only numbers worth using practically as a trader are E and F, the Buy and Sell triggers. Everything else is necessary only to make the functions work, and to be organized.\n\nJ: Trigger? This is a simple function that answers the question: \"Did a Buy or Sell signal appear? This is just to know if the day is trade-able. It lets me know how often I get action using this method. (answer: almost everyday) If a day doesn't trigger, I wouldn't trade it, so the data for that cell (profits, etc) is worthless. Note that these appear on Sundays and Mondays, days where the system of cautious about trading anyway.\n\nK: Both Triggers Hit? This is another simple function that answers the question: \"Did BOTH the buy AND sell signals appear?\" Depending on how the day goes, it is possible for price to move up to trigger a buy, and later retrace all the way to create a sell signal as well. This was made mostly out of curiosity and for fun, but it has uses later, and it is worth noting that it is quite rare for both signals to trigger in a day. Also be aware technically what this means on the chart if both signals DO appear. An engulfing pattern. Yea?\n\nL: Daybreak. Daybreak is a simplified version of the TT. Instead of the 3 exits, you simply hold until the end of the day. I wanted to check if this was profitable, so I made a function that states \"If the close for the day is higher than the BT, or lower than the ST, then Yes. Otherwise, No.\" Either of those options create a profitable day, depending on if I buy or sell in accordance to the trigger.\n\nM: Pips via Daybreak. This cell runs the numbers: It finds out which trigger is made, the buy or sell, makes the trade, buy or short, and then finds out what the profit/loss is at the end of the day.\n\nN: Pip Reach. This is where the more interesting stuff starts to appear. If a buy signal appears, this uses the daily high finds out the max profit on a long. If a sell signal appears, this finds the max profit on a short\n\nO: Nearest 25. The more technical label would be \"Rounded down to the nearest 25 pips\" If I use a variation on the TT system, taking my first profit at the nearest 25, rather than \"at least 25 but no more than 50\", and then moving stops every 25 from that point, this is what I would get. Thus, while N (pip reach) would require me to have psychic abilities to catch its profits, This one does not. This is basically my backtest to the system. This answers the question \"If a trigger is made and I trade on it, taking my first profit/loss at 25 pips, and moving up my stops up 25 at a time, what would my profit on the day be?\" Note that in this backtest, I'm cashing out both position 2 and 3 at the same price, which nets more profit than the actual TT system (since TT would require me to hold another 25 pips of loss)\n\nSo what's the result for the month of July(and a little bit of August)?\n\nIf you scroll over to the \"W\" column there are some statistics. Nearest 25 pip total: 650. If you trade this system the MOST you would be making is 650 pips a month, which is really good. For some perspective, if you traded 1k cash on a 50:1 leverage, you could get at least 25k units of any of the big pairs. Over the course of a month this nets a little over 1.5k. that's over 100% profit. Imagine doubling your stack every month. Of course, this isn't how the system actually pans out in real life. This data assumes that if you don't net at least 25 pips of profit on the position, you break even. Note that in the \"O\" column, there are a lot of 0s. This shows that, say, if a buy trigger was made, that the daily high wasn't higher than 25 pips. Now, if we played the system rules, and took a 25 pip loss on every position that wasn't a gain, how much profit would we have? The statistics show that there are 7 profitable days, and 11 unprofitable days. 11 unprofitable days means 275 lost pips. 650-275=375 pips. Still good, but note that we haven't gone over any charts. We have no idea what's going on. We're pretty safe knowing thatgenerally 1 signal and 1 signal only shows per day, but those mishap days could turn a profitable strategy into an unprofitable one. I could look at the charts true, but I don't care so much about the past as I do the present and future."

      "text": "Learn Forex: How to Trade Trendlines\n\nSupport and resistance levels are considered one of the most used technical tools in the Forex market. These charting points can be used to find out which direction to trade, time entries, as well as to establish position exits. More often than not these convenient levels are found through drawing lines inside of our graphing software, so today we are going to focus on drawing trendlines on the chart.\n\nWhen you begin drawing trendlines it is important to remember that not every trader will draw their line the same. Where you draw your lines may not be exactly where I place mine. This is ok as long as we remember the key rule that trendlines must connect at least two common points on our chart. Let's take a look at a few examples.\n\n(Created using FXCM's Marketscope 2.0 charts)\n\nAbove we can see our first example using a weekly chart of the NAS100 (Nasdaq). The NAS 100 is considered in an uptrend as it has moved 1832 points higher over the course of the last 42 months. Our first trend line is drawn by connecting a series of ascending low points on our graph, which are circled in green. This line is acting as support since price is expected to act as a floor in this scenario, with price holding at these levels.\n\nOnce this trendline is drawn, traders will look to take advantage of new higher highs by creating buy orders. The optimal time to take new long positions in an uptrend occurs when price trades down to support and bounces. Once prices has touched support but not closed below it, traders may look to establish new buy entries. When trading an uptrend, traders can also limit risk by establishing stop losses underneath support.\n\n(Created using FXCM's Marketscope 2.0 charts)\n\nIn our next example above we can see an 8Hour chart of the EURAUD declining in a downtrend. Notice how the resistance trendline is formed by connecting the highs on our graph marked in green. On this chart, prices have recently touched the resistance line for the 4th time. It is important to note that the more times a trendline is tested without breaking, the weaker it becomes. Due to this, trend traders normally prefer to trade trendlines on either the third or fourth test.\n\nSince our trendline is pointed down and price is moving lower, we should consider the EURAUD in a strong downtrend. Trend traders can use this information to trade market swings by looking to sell new positions when price moves back up to resistance. Traders should look for prices to touch resistance but not close above it. When price begins moving back in the direction of the trend, we have a valid sell signal. In this scenario stop losses may be placed above support."

      "text": "So if standard BS models use assume a normal/lognormal distribution of returns, which we know to be slightly incorrect - fatter tails etc. Then is there a model which takes the past data for an asset, defines its distribution and uses that rather than ~N in the calculation. I guess computationally that's a lot harder, but is that thinking a part of some other model, or does it not make logical sense?\n\nIt is quite simple to resample the data and compute option prices - particularly European options - via Monte Carlo. Search for 'bootstrapping' and option pricing.\n\nOne of the problems with this approach is that the pricing of options is only a small part of what makes BS useful. Sensitivities are also very important and using the actual distribution doesn't help there.\n\nIn general, it is much easier to determine the impact of different assumptions on pricing when computing prices via Monte Carlo. Expanding to fatter tails isn't difficult, but what we know about the tails is limited, so how do you choose how fat they should be (or what form they should take)? Part of what makes BS useful is that there is really only one unknown parameter (i.e., volatility). Using a distribution with fatter tails adds more unknown parameters.\n\nIf it's OK i'm going to continue to ask stupid questions about pricing models here rather than starting a new thread. All my knowledge on options comes from practical books like Natenberg/Baird and i have no background in financial mathematics so i can't understand a lot of the language to do with modelling techniques.\n\nAny info much appreciated:\n\n1. Day Count. In Natenberg's book he says that actual days should be used for interest calculations but only trading days for vol, since a stock can only move on those days. But then he says that the pricing model will be OK with only using one input for time to maturity. Why is this?\n\n2\n\n<< 1. Day Count. In Natenberg's book he says that actual days should be used for interest calculations but only trading days for vol, since a stock can only move on those days. >> Natemberg is not holy scriptures. Think for yourself: is it true that stock prices don't move when the market is closed? e.g. is it true that the open price tomorrow morning will be same as close tonight? is it true that open on monday is same as close on friday?\n\n<< 2 >> I don't think you need r at all in this case\n\nI don't know if it is as closely related to your question as it seems to me, but by chance I am reading an old issue of the Risk Magazine (January 2001) and there is an article that seem to answer your question: \"A fair value for the skew\" by Emanuel Derman and Joe Zou. The synopsys is: \"Both investors and dealers want to know the fair value of options in their portfolios. But outside the one-volatility-fits-all Black-Scholes model, there is no consensus on how to do this for a range of strikes and maturities. Using risk-neutralised historical distributions, ED and JZ propose a fair valuation technique that incorporates the skew\".\n\nIf you don't have access to the magazine I can probably email you a scanned version (hoping that I am not going to get in trouble with copyrights.\n\nAbout the question on counting business days or calendar days for volatility, as granchio hinted, it's a matter of personal choice. Some people believe that for some assets there is little or no movement when the exchange is closed hence using business days makes sense. For other assets (e.g. USD swap rates and govt bonds that are practically traded 24x6) it makes more sense to count the week-ends but a little bit less than 2 days. Since realised volatility is strictly speaking not tradable, it's a quantity that doesn't really exist, so any number that you get makes sense if you find that helps you building an intuition for what you are trading and on average helps you to make more money than you lose.\n\nFor interest calculation it's a different matter. This is specified by the contract specification so you have to take it as a definition you start from. (A bond is a tradable entity and if the specs say that the interest accrues daily, that's what you have to consider). BTW: It really depends on the contract you are trading. For example Brasilian Denominated bonds use the Brasilian Bond Basis (B/252), where by the interest accures only on working days and not on Sat/Sundays\n\nr is not in the d1 and d2 terms as it is in the BSM equation which makes sense, but why is it in that main equation? It looks like the call is discounting any possible payoff at expiration [F-K], but why if it is margined like a future? Maybe this isn't the way it is used in practice anymore.\n\n[I don't really know what a partial differential equation is, so that might have something to do with it].\n\nI think CME futures options tend to settle like equity options, w/cash premium paid up front and no daily MtM. The Black76 formula would apply in this case. But futures options in Europe and Asia tend to settle like futures with daily MtM, so cost of carry on the option premium is 0.\n\nWhat's the most common way to store options data in a database. For example if i have options settlements in a csv file, 1 file for each day since sep 09 gives about 730 files, i need them in a database to ultimately look at the vol surfaces. I suppose the relational model gives it more flexibility - but does that necessarily mean 1 table for every day?\n\n1 table would give the surface for that day, but then if i want to calculate time series stuff from the underlying, or atm iv wouldn't that be harder and slower?"

      "text": "Kaeppel's Corner: The Most Important Five Days of the Year?\n\nA long time ago, legendary market analyst Yale Hirsch popularized the phrase \"As January Goes So Goes the Year\", averring that if the stock market performs well in January then the February through December period should look pretty good too (turns out he was right). He also noted that the first five trading days of the month of January can provide a pretty useful \"early warning sign.\" This is what we will focus on in this article. We will refer to this as the \"Fast Five\" method (hey I should of been a marketing guy!).\n\nThe \"Fast Five\" Theory\n\nWe will use this \"method\" only as a bullish indicator as follows:\n\n-If the first five trading days of January show a net gain then the rest of the year (from the close of January trading day five through December 31st) should also show a gain.\n\nIf the Dow shows a loss during the first five days we will essentially have to \"get another indicator\". But if that \"Fast Five\" period shows a gain we will hold a bullish viewpoint for the remainder of the calendar year.\n\nSounds optimistic no? But let's take a closer look.\n\nThe \"Fast Five\" Numbers\n\nBefore breaking things down a bit let's get right to the performance numbers. Since 1937 there have been 48 years that have seen the Dow Jones Industrials Average register a net gain during the first five trading days of January.\n\n-37 times the Dow registered a further gain by the end of December.\n\n-11 times the Dow registered a loss between the fifth trading day of January and the end of December.\n\n-The average Dow performance was +8.0%, and the median performance was +10.4%.\n\n-The maximum gain was +43.7% (1954).\n\n-The maximum loss was -28.5% (1974).\n\nIt should be noted that this \"method\" got hit for double digit losses in the bear market years of 1940, 1941, 1966, 1973, 1974, 1987 and 2002. So clearly things are not all \"sweetness and light\" if early January is bullish for the Dow. Still the overall results are not only respectable but far above average (to say nothing about \"ease of use\").\n\nFigure 1 displays the growth of $1,000 invested only from the end of the fifth trading day of January through December 31st during those years that witnessed a gain for the Dow during the first five trading days of the year.\n\nFigure 1 – Growth of $1,000 invested from January Trading Day 5 through December 31st if Fast Five shows a gain for the Dow Industrials (1938-2010)\n\nDigging a Little Deeper\n\nAs a number geek I could not help but to wonder if the size of the gain during the first five trading days provides any additional useful information. It appears that it does. Before presenting the specifics please note that Figure 2 displays all of the \"First Five up\" years ranked by the size of the gain registered by the Dow during the first five days of January.\n\nFast Five\n\nRest of Year\n\nCumulative\n\nCumulative\n\nYear\n\n% Gain\n\n% +(-)\n\n# Times Up\n\n# Times Down\n\n1976\n\n6.52\n\n10.7\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1938\n\n6.09\n\n20.7\n\n2\n\n0\n\n1987\n\n5.61\n\n(10.2)\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1999\n\n5.03\n\n19.2\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1967\n\n3.54\n\n11.3\n\n4\n\n1\n\n1975\n\n3.11\n\n34.2\n\n5\n\n1\n\n2003\n\n3.04\n\n21.6\n\n6\n\n1\n\n1979\n\n2.87\n\n1.3\n\n7\n\n1\n\n1983\n\n2.82\n\n17.0\n\n8\n\n1\n\n2006\n\n2.75\n\n13.2\n\n9\n\n1\n\n1973\n\n2.73\n\n(18.8)\n\n9\n\n2\n\n1963\n\n2.73\n\n13.9\n\n10\n\n2\n\n1958\n\n2.51\n\n30.7\n\n11\n\n2\n\n1972\n\n2.27\n\n12.1\n\n12\n\n2\n\n1949\n\n2.26\n\n10.4\n\n13\n\n2\n\n1951\n\n2.24\n\n11.9\n\n14\n\n2\n\n1984\n\n2.19\n\n(5.8)\n\n14\n\n3\n\n1942\n\n1.93\n\n5.6\n\n15\n\n3\n\n2010\n\n1.82\n\n9.1\n\n16\n\n3\n\n1994\n\n1.78\n\n0.4\n\n17\n\n3\n\n1966\n\n1.74\n\n(20.3)\n\n17\n\n4\n\n1944\n\n1.61\n\n10.3\n\n18\n\n4\n\n1996\n\n1.57\n\n24.1\n\n19\n\n4\n\n1997\n\n1.57\n\n20.8\n\n20\n\n4\n\n1980\n\n1.55\n\n13.2\n\n21\n\n4\n\n1964\n\n1.51\n\n12.9\n\n22\n\n4\n\n1990\n\n1.50\n\n(5.7)\n\n22\n\n5\n\n1941\n\n1.44\n\n(16.6)\n\n22\n\n6\n\n1989\n\n1.42\n\n25.2\n\n23\n\n6\n\n1961\n\n1.38\n\n17.1\n\n24\n\n6\n\n2004\n\n1.33\n\n1.8\n\n25\n\n6\n\n2002\n\n1.29\n\n(17.8)\n\n25\n\n7\n\n1974\n\n1.28\n\n(28.5)\n\n25\n\n8\n\n1992\n\n1.11\n\n3.1\n\n26\n\n8\n\n1965\n\n0.97\n\n9.8\n\n27\n\n8\n\n1950\n\n0.90\n\n16.6\n\n28\n\n8\n\n2011\n\n0.84\n\n4.7\n\n29\n\n8\n\n1945\n\n0.83\n\n25.6\n\n30\n\n8\n\n1959\n\n0.77\n\n15.5\n\n31\n\n8\n\n1995\n\n0.70\n\n32.5\n\n32\n\n8\n\n1940\n\n0.63\n\n(13.3)\n\n32\n\n9\n\n1968\n\n0.42\n\n3.9\n\n33\n\n9\n\n1952\n\n0.41\n\n8.0\n\n34\n\n9\n\n2000\n\n0.22\n\n(6.4)\n\n34\n\n10\n\n1954\n\n0.22\n\n43.7\n\n35\n\n10\n\n1970\n\n0.21\n\n4.6\n\n36\n\n10\n\n1981\n\n0.18\n\n(9.4)\n\n36\n\n11\n\n1947\n\n0.16\n\n2.1\n\n37\n\n11\n\nFigure 2 – \"Fast Five\" results ranked by % gain during first five trading days of Year\n\nFigure 3 displays a few figures of note regarding the data shown in Figure 2\n\nIf \"Fast Five\"\n\nGain was\n\n#Times Rest\n\nof Year UP\n\n# Times Rest\n\nof Year Down\n\nAverage %\n\nGain\n\n>=+3.0%\n\n6\n\n1\n\n+15.4%\n\n>=+2.2%\n\n14\n\n2\n\n+12.5%\n\n>1.5%\n\n22\n\n4\n\n+10.4%\n\n<=1.5\n\n15\n\n7\n\n+ 5.3%\n\nFigure 3 – Stronger \"Fast Five\" returns tend to be followed by larger, more consistent gains\n\nItems of note:\n\n-There have only been seven times that the Dow has registered a Fast Five gain of 3% or more. While this is an admittedly small sample size the fact remains that the market showed a subsequent gain all but once with an average gain in excess of +15%.\n\n-The Dow would need to close on January 9th at 12,584.08 to fall into this category.\n\n-Fast Five gains in excess of +1.5% have witnessed subsequent gain 85% (22 out of 26) of the time with an average additional gain of +10.4%.\n\n-The Dow would need to close on January 9th at 12,400.82 to qualify this time around.\n\n-Fast Five gains of +1.5% or less have still been followed by further gains more often than not, but only 15 outof 22 times (68%), with an average additional gain of only +5.3%\n\nSo when it comes to the Dow registering a gain during the first five trading days of the year, it would clearly appear to be a case of \"more is better.\"\n\nSummary\n\nSo can an investor really just follow the stock market for five days a year and become a forecasting expert? Well, not necessarily. Each year is another spin of the wheel, another roll of the dice, another dance with the devil, another (your cliché here). So, no, nothing is ever written in stone, especially when it comes to the stock market.\n\nSo instead of pretending that we've uncovered some magic formula here, the real key here is simply to note the closing price of the Dow Jones Industrials Average on Monday, January 9 (the fifth trading day of 2012). If the Dow closes at 12,400.82 or above it will flash a bullish signal that has been 85% accurate over the past seven and a half decades.\n\nSo is the \"Fast Five\" method the one great, ball, end all market timing indicator? Not hardly. Still, as something of an indicator \"junkie\", I can tell you one thing for sure - I've seen worse."

It was organised by a team from the university's Augustus De Morgan Maths Society. Over 150 students came to watch presentations from senior representatives from some of the world's largest financial institutions. The idea was to give an insight into the various products and roles that make up the financial markets. In this extract from his presentation Dr. Jamie Walton, Head of Foreign Exchange and Emerging Markets Quant at Morgan Stanley, explains what a derivative is.\n\nThe main asset classes are equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, commodities and credit.\n\nA derivative is any product whose value is dependent on one or more underlying asset. Two common types of derivatives are forwards and options.\n\nA forward allows you to buy or sell an underlying asset at a future date at a level determined today.\n\nFutures are similar to forwards except that they are traded on exchanges (forwards are traded over the counter) and an investor needs to post margins regularly.\n\nAn option is the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a fixed price on a given future date. An option to buy the underlying asset is called a call option and the option to sell it is called a put option. As the option is a right and not an obligation, it is only exercised if it has positive value (we say it is \"in-the-money\").\n\nHedging is a strategy in which by use of derivatives a party can reduce its risk. An investor engages in transactions that will counterbalance his position on another trade, thus ensuring a certain profit or minimising losses.\n\nSpeculation: Derivatives can also be used to increase risk and generate higher returns. An investor may choose to buy or sell derivatives depending upon whether they expect the value of the underlying asset to rise or fall. This involves speculating on the future movement of markets. Speculation is a popular strategy because the profits can be greater and the losses more limited than if the investor held the asset itself.\n\nArbitrage: An arbitrage opportunity exists where there is a discrepancy in the markets, which means the investor has the chance to make a profit but is guaranteed not to make a loss. There might be a discrepancy between the current value of an asset and its true value. If a market has a significant number of players (i.e. is highly liquid), then such opportunities cease to exist as the present value is pushed towards the true value of the asset"

He's an electricity trader who has done very well for himself.\n\nNorwegian Krones; not Swedish Krona. Clearing a quarter billion dollars in four years (1.2b NOK) seems like a lot of lutefisk to me.\n\nAnyone have data on Norwegian electricity futures? I know a little about Nordpool, but don't really know the lay of the land over there (like, can you hedge with long term futures, rather than the weird 24 hour spot futures on Nordpool). I'm assuming electricity spot is ridiculously seasonal, based on the weather in the couple of major cities they have in Norway.\n\npublic tax records, interesting. i am not sure why it seems to be a taboo in anglo-saxon societies, given that in theory they attach no shame to wealth. it could be a fairly gentle and elegant way to address some issues.\n\n@nsande: Thanks for this information. The scuttlebutt I get from my Norwegian pals is that this guy is a huge consumer of weather and weather forecasting data. My own researches into this general space is that residential demand is a piece of piss to forecast on an hourly level with a decent weather forecast + simple seasonality. Industrial/commercial is usually easily modeled with seasonality. Aggregate (I only talk about the other stuff, as it was some old paid work): with a year's worth of temperature and demand data and a perfect weather forecast, I can get ~1% MAPE everywhere I've looked; better if you include humidity and wind. Most of the uncertainty in the day ahead forecast is weather uncertainty. I've never looked at the futures data, as nobody paid me to do so, but I'm assuming there are all kinds of opportunities here if there are futures traded on the right demand aggregates. Norway looks like a great place to do this, since it is sparsely populated and weather is *very* important there. Never thought of the hydro thing, but it makes perfect sense.\n\nOne thing you may need to consider is that the Scandinavian (and to some extent the northern European) electricity market is quite connected. So you probably need to model usage in the whole region. And this will probably become more important since it seems all of northern Europe looks at Norway for balancing the wind power when the wind is not blowing. Denmark does this already and with Germany closing down nuclear there are discussions on improving the connections from Norway/Sweden to Denmark/Germany.\n\nI guess price impact will also depend upon the current state of the power generation system, especially (as nsande already stated) the current and predicted water levels in the reservoirs, but also on the need of transportation between the regions. Last year when nuclear in Sweden was producing much less than usual, prices soared due to limitations in transportation capacity from northern Sweden/Norway. In short production capacity and where it is placed will have impact on the regional price moves.\n\nRegarding Jante it is sadly true enough, especially for smaller towns and villages. I grew up in one of those places and if someone had the nerve to do something, like starting a new business, people actually wanted him to fail even though they would benefit personally if he was successful. However, in my experience it is much better in the bigger cities."

Rings are the circular arenas on exchange trading floors where traders transfer information about buy and sell orders. They are part of the open outcry system of trading that involves verbal bids and offers and hand signals to convey trading information.\n\nA separate ring is used for each different trading instrument; for instance, the options on a futures contract would typically be in the adjacent ring. The different areas of one pit correspond to the various contract expiration months, with the nearest month taking up the largest section. Workstations around each ring allow exchange members to communicate with pit traders, brokers and large institutional investors. The ring is also called the pit, or the trading pit.\n\nInvestopedia explains 'Rings'\n\nThe rings, or pits, were designed so that the participants can see each other. The round shape has wide steps that lead down towards the center of the pit. Buyers and sellers stand on the steps and shout orders and use hand signals to convey information.\n\nMany different hand signals have been developed to facilitate the trading process, and these signals are often confined to a single exchange or even a certain pit. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange version of a call option, for example, involves holding the hand in the shape of a \"C\" where the thumb forms the bottom of the letter and the rest of the fingers line up to make up the top of the letter"

Instead of bars, these charts have rows of candles with wicks at both ends. Candlesticks are thus graphical representations of price movement for a given period of time formed by the opening, high, low, and closing prices of stock, commodity or future.\n\nCandlesticks provide an easy and valuable picture of price action. One can see immediately the relationship between the open and close, as well as between the high and low. The relationship between the open and close is considered vital information and forms the essence of candlesticks.\n\nIf the opening price is above the closing price then a filled (normally red or black) candlestick is drawn. If the closing price is above the opening price, then normally a green or a hollow candlestick (white with black border) is shown.\n\nHollow candlesticks, where the close is greater than the open, indicate buying pressure. Filled candlesticks, where the close is less than the open, indicate selling pressure. The filled or hollow portion of the candle is known as body or real body, and can be long, normal, or short depending on its proportion to the line above or below it. The lines above and below, known as shadows, tails, or wicks represent the high and low price ranges within the specified time period. However, not all candlesticks have shadows.\n\nThe main advantage of a candlestick chart is its focus on the struggle between amateurs who control openings and professionals who control closings. Unfortunately, most candlestick chartists fail to use many tools of Western analysts. They ignore volume and have no trendlines or technical indicators. These gaps are being filled by modern American analysts such as Greg Morris, whose Candlepower software combines Western technical indicators with classical candlestick patterns.\n\nCandlestick patterns\n\nHammer\n\nThe Hammer is comprised of one candle. It is easily identified by the presence of a small body with a shadow at least two times greater than the body.\n\nMktgeist does not look for simple hammer signals, but for hammers occurring in oversold or overbought conditions. A hammer occurring in oversold reduces the risk of a potential long trade.\n\nMorning star The morning star candlestick pattern can generally be found after a downtrend and indicates that the selling pressure may be over. The signal is formed in a period of three days. The first day of the signal must be a long dark body. The second day must be a day of indecision. This is the star of the formation. The third day should be a long white candle reaching at least halfway into the body of the first day's dark candle. The optimal morning star signal would have a gap before and after the star day.\n\nMktgeist does not look for simple morning stars, but for morning stars occurring in oversold conditions. A morning star in oversold reduces the risk of a potential long trade"

      "text": "A personal journey of a financial novice to grow $100,000 to $1 million!!!\n\nFriday, October 06, 2006\n\nOptions 101\n\nTime to freshen up my option trading skills. I remember being very very confused by what is a \"call\" and what is a \"put.\" Then the whole \"buy\" and \"sell\" part. This little diagram was very helpful. Thought I should share it with you.\n\nHere on vertical axis you have 2 types of options Calls and Puts. On horizontal axis you have buy and sell. This leads to 4 choices A,B,C and D. Lets explore them in more detail in context of stocks. Area of my interest. Pay special attention to words in red color.\n\nA = Buy Call - Gives you theright to buy the shares (of the company for which you bought this option) at the fixed price (that you choose when you buy this option) until a fixed date (that you choose as well). There are variations like \"American\" and \"European\" options. They actually have nothing to do with America or Europe. For all practical purposes you can exercise your options up to the date you selected.\n\nC = Buy Put - Gives you the right to sell the shares at thefixed price until a fixed date. very similar to case A above. One key difference - make sure you get that right.\n\nB = Sell Call - You now have obligation to sell shares at the fixed price until a fixed date. Watch for the word obligation. This one you are forced to sell your shares (You better have them). That means if price goes up you loose out.\n\nD = Sell Put - You are obliged to buy the shares at the fixed price until a fixed date. You better have cash to fork out. Remember if price drops you are still buying them at the price you agreed to.\n\nThese strategies are simple but have all sorts of risk associated with them. I lost money on many of my trades in the beginning. Hopefully, this gives you some idea. Please read up before trading these. Web has lots of information. Chicago Board is a good starting point.\n\n1 comment:\n\nOne way to get a good handle on options is to watch the option contracts through time as the underlying stock moves.\n\nThe option does not always move the same way as a stock. This is prevalent especially through events like earnings. I would recommend a person who is interested in playing options watch 5 stocks and keep track of the price of both calls and puts....At money (ATM), one strike in the money (ITM) and one strike out of the money (OTM). Watch current month and next month out for a month.\n\nDoing this is very important to understand options. Maybe do this for 6 months and then try playing some small positions. A person who does this will be able to play options much more profitably than a person who doesn't understand option movement."

If the 5% buffer is exceeded, your account will be placed in 'margin call'.\n\nWhat is a buffer?\n\nIf a margin loan is in buffer no further funds can be borrowed until the account is restored to within acceptable LVR limits. It's a timely reminder to review your portfolio and avert a potential margin call when your margin loan is in buffer.\n\nClearing a margin call\n\nIf a margin call occurs on your account ANZ will always attempt to contact you. However, it is up to you to monitor your account and keep it in a position that prevents a margin call from occurring.\n\nShould a margin call be placed on your account it must be cleared by close of trade on the following ASX trading day. To bring the balance between your borrowings and your portfolio value back to an acceptable level you can either;\n\nre-pay part of your loan, via direct deposit or BPAY®,\n\nsell off part of your share portfolio and deposit the funds into your account,\n\ntransfer in additional security, or\n\ntransfer cash to your ANZ V2 PLUS account^.\n\nIf you are not able to clear a margin call by close of trade on the following ASX trading day, ANZ Investment Lending will sell enough of your existing securities to clear the amount of your margin call. This will occur even if we are unable to contact you.\n\nMost importantly, once in margin call, any subsequent rises in the market value of your portfolio will not clear the margin call.\n\nIf you need help, please call the ANZ Client Services Team on 1800 639 330, Monday to Friday, 8.00am to 6.00pm (AEST) during ASX trading days.\n\n^ An ANZ V2 PLUS account is automatically linked when you take out an ANZ Share Investment Loan.\n\nBPAY® is registered to BPAY® Pty Ltd ABN 69 079 137 518.\n\nImportant information\n\nLeveraging a share portfolio is fast becoming a popular wealth creation strategy. However, you should be aware that whilst leveraging into investments increases the potential return, it is important to recognise that it can also multiply the effects of falls in sharemarket values. We therefore strongly advise you talk to your financial planner, tax adviser and/or stockbroker and ensure you understand the risks, the specific tax implications as well as the legal and financial ramifications of a share investment lending facility.\n\nThe information provided is general in nature only and has not been prepared taking into consideration your particular needs, circumstances or objectives.

Unfortunately at the moment you really don't have enough capital, so you contact the present operator and you concur on a deal that will permit you to acquire the convertible in ninety days for $one hundred,000. For distinctive rights to this deal, you deposit $1,000.\nThe selling price of the car or truck is anticipated to keep frequent for the upcoming ninety days. On the other hand, there is still the chance that its worth could modify or go down.\nIn the initial circumstance, the selling price of the vehicle rises. If an asteroid hits the earth, destroying all cars and trucks (and strangely leaving individuals by yourself), this convertible's value will skyrocket. You could sell it at any selling price. And,, simply because you have an selection which permits you to invest in the convertible for the cut price selling price of $100,000, you can nonetheless invest in it for $a hundred,000, regardless of its new current market price. Thus, you could sell both the selections agreement or the convertible for a big profit.\nIn the following scenario, the selling price of the automobile drops. The seller's teenage son takes the automobile for a delight trip and has an unfortunate incident with a road lamp. For a luxurious vehicle, the repair expenses are exorbitant, and buying a different auto would be more cost-effective. On the other hand, as the solution purchaser you have the proper to buy the convertible at $a hundred,000, but you are not obligated to finish the transaction. So you select not to exercise the possibilities agreement, and your only reduction is the top quality you compensated for the initial agreement.\nIn the closing scenario, the cost of the automobile stays the exact same. On the expiration date of your contract, you can pick no matter whether or not to purchase the automobile based mostly on your situations. Whether you buy or not, your greatest loss is the deposit you paid for the deal.\nOptions can be traded across a extensive selection of markets, which include commodities, forex trading, stocks and bonds.\nTraders use selections both to hedge and to speculate.\nSpeculating will involve predicting the long run value of a commodity, currency trading pair, stock, or bond, then profiting when that asset goes up or down. For instance, if you have an options agreement to invest in a stock at a specific value and its value will increase, you could then provide it at a much better selling price than the 1 you at first paid out.\nLikewise, if you have an alternatives deal to market a commodity at a set price and the current market cost falls, you can possibly market it for a bigger value than its market value, or offer the selection for a revenue.\nHedging is when traders use choices contracts for insurance policy - as your greatest attainable loss when shopping for options is the unique deposit you paid for the contract, selections customers know their highest danger from the outset.\n\nCity:\n\nLowell"

      "text": "Binary Options\n\nIn the world of finance, a type of trading instrument is a binary option. The payoff for a binary option is one of two things; a fixed amount of the chosen asset or zero. There are two types of binary options and include the cash or nothing option and the asset or nothing option.\n\nYou need to enable JavaScript to see this content\n\nEvery binary option is based on three elements and includes the binary option contract, underlying asset, the and the forecast or prediction.\n\nMost binary option platforms offer binary options on a variety of underlying assets. They include commodities, indices, currencies pairs and stocks. Traders decide to specialize in one particular underlying asset or area of the trading market.\n\nThe contract for the binary option can last anywhere from one hour to a 30 days, however, there are some trading platforms that do offer contracts for as little as 5 minutes. It is always important to know how much time is left until the contract expires before the option expires.\n\nThe goal of the investor or trader is to predict the direction the under lying asset of choice will go before the contract time expires. Traders who predict the asset price will increase should buy a Call option and traders who believe the asset price will decrease should buy a Put option. Predicting the correct direction the asset will move will bring the trader profits that are very high and can sometimes double the trader's investment. If the trader does not predict the correct direction, the trader will lose their investment.\n\nThere is a close now ability which gives the trader the ability to cancel an option before the contract time expires. A trader may decide to take this course of action if the option does not perform as expected because the underlying asset chosen is not moving in the direction predicted. For example, if a trader bought a 60 minute Call option and after 52 minutes the price of the underlying asset begins to fall after being in a positive, upward swing, the trader could choose the Close Now option to ensure a profit is made. Another scenario is if the option has decreased steadily, the trader could use the Close Now option to minimize a loss.\n\nSome trading platforms include a feature called Roll Over. That allows the trader to extend the time of the contract to expire in the money and turn a profit. This is helpful if the asset is moving in the desired direction slower than anticipated."

      "text": "What is Betfair? Betfair provides a betting exchange, quite different to a traditional bookmaker. A betting exchange is essentially a stock market platform taken across to betting on racing and sport.\n\nCustomers bet against each other not against Betfair. Think of it as\nlike two mates in a pub with opposing views on a game and having a bet.\n\nBetfair works like an impartial barman in the pub who holds the money until he gives it to the winner.\n\nBetfair give you all the guidance you need, and we encourage winners! We don't ban or cut back\nas is the case with many bookies who limit stakes or close accounts if\nanyone \"dares\" to beat them. It doesn't matter to Betfair, because we\ntake no position in the markets.\n\nBetfair gives better odds, why?\n\nBetfair gives 20% better odds on average due to competition and lower margins.\n\nCompetition in any walk of life leads to a better deal, Betfair is extremely competitive.\n\nAt any given moment thousands of people worldwide are competing against\neach other to offer better odds on their opinion in order to have a bet.\nThis often means the odds are better than those set by a traditional\nbookie. Advertise a poor price on the site and it is unlikely that your\nbet will be matched as somebody will see the value in improving the\noffer.\n\nAnother reason for better odds is because the bookmaker is taken out of\nthe equation. You are not subject to their five, 10, 20 or even 50%\nmargins. The value will shine through more on markets with more\nselections - racing, football premierships, golf tournaments etc, where\nbookies traditionally make their 'bread and butter'.\n\nWhat is backing and laying?\n\nOn Betfair you can back and lay. To 'back' a selection means you think it will happen, like you'd do at a traditional bookie. Or you can take the opposing viewpoint and 'lay' if you think your selection will not happen.\n\nEvery fixed-odds bet, whether it's with your local High St bookie, a\nbetting exchange or even two mates in a pub, requires a backer and a\nlayer, you've probably just never thought of it that way.\n\nImagine two guys betting a pint on the Merseyside derby - one cheering\nEverton, one cheering Liverpool. The Everton supporter is automatically\nopposing, or laying, Liverpool if he decides to go with his heart.\nLikewise the Liverpool fan backs his team for a pint, but is laying\nEverton in the same process.\n\nLay betting is the other half of the deal from a back bet. Both are bets but opposing views.\n\nBetfair use decimal odds, what are these?\n\nDecimals are a simpler way of working out the odds and don't give you a\nheadache every time you want to place a bet. Do you know the difference\nbetween 8/13 and 4/7? No? Well, not many people do. But with decimals\nyou'd know instantly.\n\nSo, how do decimal odds work? Well, if the decimal odds are 2.2 and you\nplace a back bet of £10 and win, your total return is £10 x 2.2 = £22.\nThis is equivalent to a traditional price of 6/5.\n\nDecimal odds make it much easier to figure out which price is best - the\nbigger the number, the higher the return. Take a look at the table\nbelow to see why.\n\nThe key part to remember is that decimal odds always include the unit stake - thus every price you see on Betfair will be >1.\n\nFractional odds represent the profit - 5/1 means you will win five pounds for every one pound staked.\n\nDecimal odds represent the return - 2.2 means you will receive £2.20 for every pound invested, including your stake.\n\nIf you're struggling with decimal odds, you can now use our mouse-over\nodds displays - traditional odds over every price. Every market on\nBetfair also has an odds-converter table.\n\nOn Betfair you can bet in-play. What is this?\n\nBetting in-play is exactly what it says: betting while an event is going\non. More live sport on TV every year means this is very popular.\n\nOn Betfair\nyou can place bets right up to the final whistle or until the winning\nhorse passes the post, even after that if it's a photo finish. It also\nenables you to see how a game is unfolding as a result of the line-ups,\nconditions and tactics.\n\nThe in-Play logo indicates a market is in-play. It can be a very exciting form of betting with constantly fluctuating odds.\n\nThe ability to trade\n\nBetfair\ngives you the ability to trade. Trading is trying to lower your risk\nand ensure a profit, irrespective of the final result. Have you ever\nbacked a football team who take the lead, but are looking like they\nmight concede an equaliser?\n\nYou could sell some of it back and walk away with a guaranteed profit.\nNow you can lay selections as well, so you could choose to recover your\nstake to leave you with a 'bet to nothing' (a bet where you break even\non your worst outcome), or hedge your position to give you a profit no\nmatter what the result.\n\nBetfair\nis more than just a betting shop where everyone is focused on picking\nthe winner of the race. Because Betfair was modelled on a stock\nexchange, financial traders have recognised that they can trade on\nracing and sports markets just like they were foreign exchange markets.\nAnd even better, there's usually a race every 10 minutes during the\nafternoon so profits can quickly be re-invested.\n\nRange of markets\n\nBetfair\nhas a vast array of markets to bet on, these range from horse racing\nand football to Specials such as Big Brother and the Eurovision Song\nContest. Each market is unique.\n\nSome markets trade millions, others just a few thousand, some have\nhundreds of runners such as a golf outright winner market, whereas\ntennis and basketball have just two in the match odds. Betfair\nis a global business covering sports, racing and special markets all\nover the world. If you like betting on foreign sport in the wee hours,\nthen chances are you'll find people to bet against on Betfair.\n\nProfits can be made on all markets, but you have to treat different\nmarkets accordingly.

This is strictly a money management technique. It doesn't depend on what the stock is doing technically at that time.\n\nThere is no way to know if a stock will go up 20% to 25% after a breakout. But if it does, following this sell rule accomplishes several objectives.\n\nFirst, just because you bought a leading stock that broke out of a picture-perfect base in big volume doesn't guarantee that it's going to be a huge winner.\n\nIn reality, investors will have a number of small losses and be rewarded with a large winner less frequently.\n\nBut selling once you have a profit of 20% to 25%, you lock in a solid gain. Remember that you only have a paper profit until you hit the sell button. Three or four of these gains can make for a happy year.\n\nAnd by selling once you have a 20%-to-25% gain, you can still come out in the black if you have two stocks that fall 8%, followed by one winner.\n\nSecond, some leading stocks will pull back and form new bases once they rise 20% to 25%. This rule will help you avoid sitting through frustrating corrections that can wipe out hard-earned gains.\n\nAlso, investors should often sell when the going is still good.\n\nIn \"How to Make Money in Stocks,\" IBD Chairman William O'Neil wrote, \"The object is to make and take significant gains and not get excited, optimistic, greedy, or emotionally carried away as your stock's advance gets stronger.\"\n\nIn the week ended July 27 last year, IT management software maker SolarWinds (SWI) blew past a 47.99 buy point in a double-bottom base in huge turnover. Better-than-expected Q2 results provided the lift.\n\nThe stock rallied 27% to an all-time high of 60.95 in September before pulling back. There were plenty of chances to take gains. SolarWinds went on to correct 26% to 44.83, 1 wiping out gains from its July breakout"

      "text": "Use 50-Day Average For Trading Signals\n\nA traffic light wouldn't mean much to an alien just arrived from outer space.\n\nOf course, most people know that a green light means go, yellow means proceed with caution and red means stop.\n\nIn a similar way, a 50-day moving average line could confuse a rookie investor.\n\nBut experienced investors know exactly how it can signal buy, hold and sell — or go, caution and stop, if you will.\n\nLet's say you missed out on buying a winning stock. Perhaps it never formed a proper base; some hot stocks don't.\n\nOr maybe it formed a base, broke out and then ran up nicely. The only problem with the picture was that you never purchased any shares.\n\nNow you're looking for an opportunity to get involved. That's where the 50-day, or 10-week, moving average comes in.\n\nGreen Light To Buy\n\nLook for a pullback to the 50-day line in light volume. The low turnover means institutional investors are holding on to the stock even as its initial run-up ends.\n\nNext, watch for the stock to bounce off the line with increasing volume. The higher turnover indicates that mutual funds or other big investors are purchasing shares. They often buy on dips to the line as a way to cut their average cost.\n\nYou might have several days to buy. The buying opportunity starts anytime after the stock bounces off the 50-day average. It extends to up to 5% above the high reached just before the pullback. But beyond 5%, the stock is extended and you should hold off.\n\nKeep in mind that you can't purchase a stock on every pullback to the 50-day line. It's generally a sound move on the first or second trip to the line after a breakout from a base. Buying on the third or later pullback is risky.\n\nA Hold Signal\n\nFor a stock that you already own, a trip down to the 50-day line could make you break out in a sweat. But you generally just need to worry if it slides in heavy volume. That shows that institutions are selling.\n\nIf the pullback occurs without many shares trading hands, that typically means it's OK to hold on to your stake. You might even consider adding to your position on the first or second pullback.\n\nA Clue To Sell\n\nThe 50-day moving average can really excel in signaling when you should lock in your profit overcame an ugly start with a positive reversal that left the indexes with small losses Thursday. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell as much as 1.2% in the first 10 minutes of trade Thursday. But the indexes reversed to cut the losses to 0.1% on the Nasdaq and 0.3% on the S&P 500. The IBD ..."

      "text": "Options Education\n\nVolatility & The Black Scholes Model\n\nVolatility Volatility can be a very important factor in deciding what kind of options to buy or sell. Volatility shows the investor the range that a stocks price has fluctuated in a certain period. The official mathematical value of volatility is denoted as \"the annualized standard deviation of a stocks daily price changes.\"\n\nThere are two types of Volatility: Statistical Volatility and Implied Volatility.\n\nStatistical Volatility A measure of actual asset price changes over a specific period of time.\n\nImplied Volatility A measure of how much the \"market place\" expects asset price to move, for an option price. That is, the volatility that the market itself is implying.\n\nNote: The computation of volatility is a difficult problem for mathematical application.\n\nBlack-Scholes In the Black-Scholes model, volatility is defined as the annual standard deviation of the stock price. There is a way in which the strategist can let the market compute the volatility for him.\n\nThis is called using the implied volatility - that is, the volatility that the market itself is implying. This is similar to an efficient market hypothesis. If there is enough trading interest in an option that is close to the money, that option will generally be fairly priced.\n\nThe Black-Scholes Formula The Black-Scholes formula was the first widely-used model for option pricing. This formula can be used to calculate a theoretical value for an option using current stock prices, expected dividends, the option's strike price, expected interest rates, time to expiration and expected stock volatility.\n\nWhile the Black-Scholes model does not perfectly describe real-world options markets, it is still often used in the valuation and trading of options.\n\nThe variables of the Black Scholes formula are:\n\nStock Price\n\nStrike Price\n\nTime remaining until expiration expressed as a percent of a year\n\nCurrent risk-free interest rate\n\nVolatility measured by annual standard deviation.\n\n\""

      "text": "Correlation Among Stocks\n\nby Michael P. Turner\nIf you are trading stocks, you may find opportunities by tracking the correlation between them. This can lead to different strategies such as trading one company off of another's news, spread trading, and sector trading. The techniques described here were adapted from the book Day Trading Into The Millennium, available from \n\nIn today's financial markets, a relationship, or correlation, exists among all securities. Sometimes there is a positive correlation, sometimes there is a negative correlation, and sometimes there is no correlation whatsoever. Statisticians have a way to measure the relationship between two data series. This statistic is called the correlation coefficient.\n\nFIGURE 1: DELL VS. CPQ. You can see that from October to January, Dell (top chart) and Compaq (bottom chart) were positively correlated.\n\nA correlation coefficient is described by a range that spans from -1 to 1. Securities that are positively correlated will move in tandem with one another and have a correlation coefficient value near or at 1. Stocks that are negatively correlated will move opposite one another and will have a correlation coefficient near or at -1.\n\nFor example, Dell Computers (DELL) and Compaq Computers (CPQ) are two stocks that often have a positive correlation (Figure 1). If they were 100% positively correlated (+1), then a one-point move up in DELL would be matched by a one-point move up in CPQ. If these two stocks were 50% positively correlated (+0.5), then a one-point move up in DELL would be matched by a half-point move in CPQ. If these two stocks had zero correlation (0), then DELL might have a move up of one point, but CPQ would not move at all. For an example for negative correlation coefficients, AZN (Astrazeneca) and ABT (Abbott Labs) from mid-March to mid-April is a very good one. Similar prices and percentages move in opposite directions (Figure 2).\n\nDEGREE OF CORRELATION\n\nWhen stocks are positively or negatively correlated, movement in one stock is followed by movement in other correlated stocks. The degree of correlation, positive or negative, will determine the degree to which prices of correlated stocks move together. And in the same way that different stocks have some degree of correlation to one another, different sectors, which are made up of groups of related stocks, are correlated to one another. Taking this concept one step further, it becomes clear why there is a correlation between different broad market averages, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), the Standard & Poor's 500, and the Russell 2000 (Figures 3, 4, and 5). The correlations can be carried out to the observation that different global markets are correlated to a varying degree.\n\nDaytrader Michael Turner can be reached at"

      "text": "Market Risk Metrics – Volatility Trend Analysis\n\nVolatility Trend Analysis is the analysis of volatility trend lines of various instruments on the portfolio. The volatility trend line is a graphical representation of how the riskiness of that given instrument has changed over time and depicts the general trend witnessed in risk levels. A rising trend indicates an increase in risk due to increased fluctuations in underlying prices (level and/or frequency) over the period of study. A horizontal trend line indicates that average volatilities have remained stable over the period whereas a decline trend line shows decreasing levels of risk.\n\nThe analysis may be carried for varying granularities. For example for the equity market we may analyze riskiness by sector:\n\nOr we may look at trend lines for stocks within a particular sector, such as the cement sector below:\n\nA given point on the graph represents the average of the next sixty volatilities at that particular date. For example average volatility on 5-Jan-09 represents the average of the next sixty volatilities from this date where individual volatilities are calculated using the past sixty returns available.\n\nThe detailed step-by-step process for constructing a volatility trend line is given below:\n\nStep 1: Obtain the price time series for the given instrument being analyzed. We have spot price data for WTI Crude for 2 years from 1st April 2009 to 29th March 2011. A sample subset of the data is given below:\n\nStep 2: Calculate the daily return time series from the price data. The daily returns are calculated by taking the natural logarithm of the ratio of successive (consecutive) prices:\n\nA sample snapshot of the resulting return series is given below:\n\nStep 3: Calculate the daily volatilities for sixty return observation windows, rolling forward by a day so that you get a series of 60-return daily volatilities. These volatilities are calculated using EXCEL's STDEV() function applied to 60-return observations. The methodology for using this function is given in our earlier post:\n\nA sample snapshot of the daily volatility series obtain is given below:\n\nStep 4: Finally, calculate a moving or rolling average of 60 daily volatilities, rolling forward one day at a time to derive a series of average daily volatilities. This series is the volatility trend line. A sample snapshot of the 60-daily volatility rolling average series is given below:\n\nThe resulting volatility trend line for WTI crude oil spot prices is given below:\n\nThe methodology for constructing a line graph in EXCEL is discussed in our post:\n\nAs mentioned earlier a data point on the volatility trend line series or graph represents the average of the next sixty daily volatilities at that particular date where each daily volatility figure is calculated using the past sixty returns available. From the graph above, we can see that the volatility or riskiness associated with WTI crude oil prices have decreased considerably as compared to levels seen in mid-2010.\n\nComments\n\nNice work. I believe we need mnegianful data like this out of which we could draw relationships. I haven't taken a look at the RISK review, but just by the gut feeling about what you might have cooked up here, I recognize that this is a step in the right direction, because I have taken similar dive, although on a limited scale, in a different end of the pool (I have a smirk on my face right now, seeing someone else is beginning to connect the dots as well). But I believe the floor that we hit at the bottom will be the same, checked out oilinsights.net as well As an economy, we are addicted to fossil based fuels, including oil and its derivatives, natural gas, and interestingly coal for electricity and power, but as you have rightly pointed out as well, the story doesn't end here."

      "text": "The transition from structuring to trading is the most natural of any roles...period.\nWhereas the sales guys only need to know high level details to pitch structured products to clients, the structurer has to be THE MOST familiar with the product, all the risk measures and nuances that come with the product. Since trading is essentially the responsibility to hedge the desks exposure to these products (i.e. understand the risks and nuances), you can see why this is an easy transition.\n\nSo exit opps from Structuring:\n\n1)Structuring\n2)Trading (sell-side)\n3)Sales\n4)Trading (buy-side)\n\nnote: this applies to structuring roles where you actually get to price and develop \"interesting\" products, not those \"structuring-in-name-only\" roles where you can recommend buying an ATM vanilla call and selling an OTM vanilla call and refer to that call spread as a complex structure (lol).\n\nThe pay of Flow traders, sales and structuring are all in the same range. (Prop traders obviously surpass this average).\nThe thing with structurers, is if you only have 1 or 2, and they're invaluable to the desk, you'll pay them top dollar to keep them around. But if a hedge fund comes along an offers them top-TOP dollar to work for them...chances are you'll lose that key structurer. As was said before, for every 1 structurer, there are probably 2 traders and 3-4 salespersons.\n\nDay in the life? Ask Revsly. He did Structuring as an SA and will be doing Trading as an FT (exactly what you were looking for)It's hard to pin it down. If your structured products desk is big on vanilla structures that you can almost do through your own retail broker, then Jimbo's point will hold. If your desk is bigger on correlation, volatility, swaps and baskets with barriers and triggers, PnL will increase substantially and structurers will get credit for putting such profitable trades together and concealing the spreads in the product.\n\nThe truth is structurers are harder to replace than traders or sales for the simple reason that there are less of them to go around and you only take a few, so you want to make sure you pick the right one.\n\nYou can imagine what would happen if an Exotic Structuring desk lost their only 2 structurers? the generation of ideas for complex derivatives would be left to sales (because traders are busy managing the existing risk). Salespeople simply do not have the in-depth knowledge to understand the pricing and structuring of the products; again they focus on high-level aspects. Imagine having a salesperson trying to figure out what \"divergent volgamma and vanna\" means. (That's where your structurer comes in). very few salespeople are actually able to explain the intricacy of the exotic product's volatility profile to a client (again, the domain of a structurer).\n\nI've seen it happen and it's not pretty; the desk feels disjointed for awhile because clients call looking for some new idea to take advantage of some change in their market view; and the sales team feels out of their element trying to generate ideas and explain why it works. Result? Clients pull back their flow (very bad PR for that desk). So that's the key reason, the reputational and profitability damage that can be done by losing 1 structurer is too big a risk to take. (especially since some desks only have 1 structurer to begin with)\n\nNo comp. sci background is required... at all.\nLet's put it this way... someone who trades derivatives (e.g. exotics) is typically more \"quant-ish\" than someone who trades delta one (e.g. cash equities). So a structurer needs to be just as quant-ish as the exotics trader, with the added element of \"creativity\" to devise new ways of structuring the products.\n\nSorry for the newbie question, but is the structuring team responsible for creating structured products such as (I'm sure the names will vary depending on the firm) RENs (return enhanced notes), BRENs, etc?\nIf so, I know on the PWM side such products are very popular with clients and are pushed into a lot of portfolios to offer protection, etc. What is the demand for structured products on the institutional side (i.e.; are Pension funds, money managers buying a lot of pre-made structured notes or are they going to the desk and asking for a structure that fits their own markets views?).\n\n\".\"\n\nHow many actual bonus numbers do you know, for structurers/sales/traders at vp level and above? I see from your other posts that you were an analyst on the desk, so I'm figuring the vp's aren't sharing their bonus figures with you. Top Structurers do not make as much as top traders or salesman, and the average line structurer is also going to make less. I know lots of traders and sales people who's total comp is in the 500k-2mm range, and structurers in the 250-750 sort of range. The head of structuring group will still make less than the head of the trading desk he structurers for. It's still a lot of money, but structurers simply don't earn as much as trading or sales.\n\nI'll go about this another way, and hopefully my point will be clear.\nThis is the true reason I tried adamantly to have my position changed from trader to exotics structurer.\n\nIt's based on a conversation at the end of my analyst stint with my senior mentor (who happened to be an FX MD).\n\nHe was discussing how the firm goes about deciding bonus numbers. They key was, \"how little can we pay this employee such that he doesn't think its worth it to switch firms\" (i.e. find the threshold at which the employee will say \"fuck it, doesn't make sense to move across the street\"). And what he emphasized was that because our sales force is so large, you pay a few star salespeople and you can nickel and dime some others because losing one salesperson of 35-40 isn't going to hurt us that bad. However, losing one structurer out of 3-4 can really slow things down (and replacing him may prove very difficult). So when paying that structurer, we consider the downside of losing him much more acutely than with the dime-a-dozen salesperson.....I was honest with him and told him, \"I want to be valued in that manner\" (we had a pretty open relationship, since he was my assigned mentor).\n\nNext, let me go into detail a little further regarding how DBFX runs their desk. Sitting on top of FX Market share, DB likes to \"put their money where there mouth is\" with respect to structured FX products for clients. So in addition to developing ideas and structuring the products, our FX Structurers get to run a substantial \"replication book\" where we actually put our own capital at risk on the very idea we are pitching to client, in an effort to make them feel like we're not just trying to generate commission;but also stand behind the idea. Since this replication book is proprietary, the structurer gets credit for any gains (or blame for losses) associated with it. In essence, this gives some of our structurers an actual PnL to stand on.\n\nThis last point applies really to our London operation. Being the center of FX worldwide, London is always a battle ground for key FX talent. It's chief rival in this location is Barcap. We've always experienced a shuffle between the two shops in FX sales/trading/structuring/strategy. So even if Barcap likes to stiff employees in other areas of the business, they certainly dont pinch pennies when they lure DBFX staff across the City...it's honestly a perpetual contest to see who can poach the most valuable members from their respective FX desks\n\nso as a general rule as we've all agreed, traders are the best paid. period. And on average, yes, a run-of-the-mill structurer will earn less than S or T. However, the role of the structurer varies from product area to product area and from shop to shop. As a result, their value and corresponding compensation isn't necessarily cut-and-dry (I've tried to show some examples here of where the added-value can occur soft..."

      "text": "Saturday, January 2, 2010\n\nMore and exhaustive studies have been made on Elliot wave theory by many experts to follow the markets and the studies are available in the links under Elliot wave Tutorials in this blog.With complex counting of waves and numerous rules and squabble among EW analysts about the correct labelling has scared away many from this simple tool.\n\nMy sincere attempt is to illustrate here the way I self taught myself with the wave theory and the utility of it when combined with other methods in understanding market moves. The book that inspired me the most to follow EW is \"Elliott wave Explained\" by Robert beckman.\nTo me, EW is simply a spontaneous counting of \"Fives and threes\" and its combination to put the market moves in a predictable order.\n\nRalph Nelson Elliot observed after years of analysis that the market movement was quite orderly and followed a pattern of waves. It is a theory that reflects the law governing the form of the natural path of all human activities. This Nature's law, though predictable to the dedicated, still leaves much mystery to many.\nThe comparison with tide, wave and ripple has been used since the earliest days of Dow Theory.\n\nWhat is a wave..?? There are no parameters to define what is a wave and hence it is left to the imagination of the follower. The example of the waves of the ocean illustrates this quite well..\n1. A small wave starts initially.\n\n2. And then it recedes for a while and gathers more strength.\n3.On its next advance, the wave becomes stronger than the earlier one.\n\n4.With a further consolidation, the final wave explodes with full strength.\n\nWhat is a wave..?? There are no parameters to define what is a wave and hence it is left to the imagination of the follower. Years of my observations have helped me to arrive at a basic tool to identify a wave which is \"Trendline\". When a trendline is combined with the study of Technical indicator such as macd (How to combine EW with macd, you are well guided to put these price movements in an orderly fashion as defined by Elliot wave theory that prices move in 5 waves followed by a 3 wave correction. And this process continues..on and on.\nThe Elliot theory:Market moves in waves, each of which is interrelated to one another in time and price. A movement in a particular direction can be represented by \"5\" distinct waves of which three in the direction(called impulse wave-1,3,5) and two against the direction(called Corrective wave-2,4).\nOne such five-wave would become the first wave of the higher degree. Eg: 5 waves in hour would become one single wave in the Day.\nEach corrective wave will subdivide into 3 waves of a lesser degree. And this process continues with variations in actual market place as per the Traders/Investors psychology & their resultant behaviour which moves the markets.\n\nHow to apply..? You simply start labeling them in fives and threes as you deem fit using, if necessary, other \"Overbought & Oversold\" indicators and other methods. There are some basic rules to be followed to help you in counting them correctly which will be discussed next week.\n\nHere is a small illustration to count them and their immense utility in assessing the likely direction of the market which helps in proper entry and exit and above all to \"sit tight\" with the trades.\n\n1. At the reversal point, the first wave is formed with a swift retracement of the last fall. The illustration here is of the onset of the bull run started in March 2009.(In the 5-minute or 30 minute chart, the faster retracement could have been spotted at 2630 after a positive divergences and highly oversold nature).\nAs the first set of \"5\"s is complete, it becomes the 1st or \"A\" wave (As the upmove from mar.09 low is construed as corrective)of a larger degree/ time cycle.\ni.e- from hourly 5 waves, they become the 1st wave of the daily as shown below:\nAlso note that the last fall from 2798 to 2556 got retraced in shorter time to 2836, confirming a trend reversal.\nAlways book out at the count of 5, at least partially and re-enter at the count of \"abc\"-the corrective part. In most bullish cases, the correction ends at the 4th wave of the previous lower cycle. Never miss the \"Third wave entry\"-one of the most rewarding phase.There are many traders who simply wait for the 3rd wave set ups in various time cycles to make their safer & rich trades. Note in the hourly chart below the irregular correction in the second wave(marked in red) wherein the \"b\" moved above the \"1st\" wave suggesting of \"Bullish undercurrent\" that market is quite impatient to forge ahead.\nHere below, you will note the completion of three sets of \"fives\" connected by two sets of \"threes\" to form one big \"First or A\"(Pink) wave to be followed by a correction which ended near the 4th wave of the previous cycle. Now Imagine, what the 3rd wave of this larger time scale can have in store for it after experiencing a small 3rd wave upmove earlier within the \"three sets of Fives\". We'll see soon.\nThe more noisy or countless sub-waves are enclosed within the daily waves in a neat fashion.Note also how the \"first break of the trendline often gives away the end of a 4th wave and the onset of a powerful 5th wave\" This is not a rule but a guideline worth remembering.\nYes..in the daily 3rd wave, the markets gave a Black Swan..a total upward freeze. This happens often to individual scrips.Note also, subsequent to the completion of the 5-waves in daily which make up the 1st or \"A\" wave of the weekly, a larger correction sets in. A break of the redrawn trendline confirms the \"a\" wave(first of the three waves of a correction) of that correction.\nOnce a larger correction in the form of an \"abc\" (We label the corrections as \"abc\" to avoid a confusion of labeling both upmoves and downmoves using numbers) is complete, the next big 3rd wave or \"C\" wave(as it is still considered to be corrective)start to unfold.\nThe most important factor in labeling the moves is to help identify the direction, its magnitude depending on its time cycle to stay in the direction for the correct amount of time. One should not, for eg.,enter into an hourly 3rd wave and sit tight for days.The hourly direction lasts for \"Hours\" only.\nRemember there are waves within waves and various \"Counts\" are in force at any given time for different time cycles. EW works well for the larger time scale and requires high agility & proper stop loss & money management to play the shorter version.\nMy EW learning has come mostly from the shorter version as you will see most of the wave forms in a shorter version since one life time is not enough to see them in larger time scale which can run into centuries.\nIn the next week, we will learn some basic rules that govern this wave movements.\nHave patience..Elliot took 10 years to arrive at his theory.\nGet rich slowly.\n\nFriday, January 1, 2010\n\nWeekly channel support comes at 5050-5060. Supply keeps coming at & above 5180. Overbought Hourly charts may put pressure on the Overbought daily especially after a 5-wave completion. Correction will continue till 5225 is broken decisively. Trading below 5DMA @ 5175 can drag the index down to complete the correction. The weekly pivot(5194) and the daily Pivot(5202) have come quite close to the highs of this upmove suggesting loss of momentum. \"5180\" will be a decisive Level.\n\nExpecting a sideways move after the sharp short term up move of last three days in an \"abc\" form. If it makes a new high in the first hour, then that could be counted as part of the \"5\". The negative divergence in 5-minute chart suggests of a short term correction. Positional Longs may be initiated during this correction to 5060 or 5040 or 5110. For aggressive traders, some trading range of 5100-5130 to 5190 to 5220.\n\nMonday, December 28, 2009\n\nSuccess in the stock market is measured in terms of money earned. Luck is how the envious describe hard work and the successful use of skilled judgement. Stock market offers no absolutes that it will do what it wants to do, when it wants to do it. You need a guide to help define probabilities and the knowledge to weigh them, followed by the confidence to act on your own judgement and not be thrown off-balance by the arrival of the improbable. The most rewarding aspect of the wave principle is that when only one option is offered, the probability of success is extraordinarily high. Markets are efficient but 90% driven by emotions and these emotions are reflected by the Nature's Law called \"Elliott waves\" named after Ralph.N.Elliott who discovered it and effectively applied to US markets on a larger time frame. Most important intellectual quality for successful investment is the ability to keep an open mind. The biggest mistakes are made by those who do not know what they do not know. Genius is nothing but a great aptitude for patience. The precise order of wave formation can often seem obscure, riddled with random noise, leaving you totally confused as to the position of the market within the framework of the overriding elliott trends. The forecasting error is not due to Elliott's wave principle but to our misuse of it. Markets and Elliott wave principle are like the Delphic Oracle; neither are ever right or wrong, they just are. Be realistic - that is the best way to make money from the wave principle. When in doubt, Stay out. Even a slight acquaintance with the wave principle will reinforce your performance. Markets are technically strongest after a sharp decline and technically at their weakest after a sharp upmove and EW suggests to sell into the strength and buy into the weakness quite contrary to the crowd behaviour. Before you'd have been petrified by the falling markets. Now you can place them in context - a mere corrective wave, possibly time to buy in with both hands. Before you were tempted to get wildly enthusiastic about bull markets getting yourself right at the top of the market every time. Now you see that the prices are rising in the fifth wave and you sell the market when there is euphoria all around. Market's movement is a psychological phenomenon. The stock market is a creation of man and therefore reflects human idiosyncrasy. Wave principle represents this rhythm of man's response to external stimuli which shows itself in price fluctuation.\n\nI feel no opportunity should be lost to help you understand this extremely valuable and potentially highly profitable investment tool. I want you to think, live and breathe Elliott and his wave principle.\n\nI have put up a Elliott wave Tutorial Link in the blog. Go through them which are quite simple and lucid to understand. Spend your valuable time on them and allow it to take you through the whole teaching....and do not struggle to understand. If necessary go over again. From next week, we will start discussing various application of the Wave principles to our trading strategies.\n\nSunday, December 27, 2009\n\nTechnical analysis is practiced in two main categories namely chart patterns and indicators. Indicatorsare calculations based on the price of a stock/ Index and indicates trends, volatility and momentum. Indicators are often compared to \"pulse, pressure check\" of a patient by the doctor to assess the extent of the illness. Indicators help you assess the market for its momentum, direction, etc.\n\nIndicators are used as a tool to gain further insight into the supply and demand of securities. Indicators are used to confirm price movement and the probability that the given move will continue. Along with using indicators as secondary confirmation tools, they can also be used as a basis for trading as they can form buy-and-sell signals.\n\nIndicators are of two main types - leading and lagging - both differing in what they show users.\n\nLeading Indicators are those created to precede the price movements of a security giving predictive qualities. Two of the most well-known leading indicators are the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Stochastics Oscillator. I have often identified the reversal with the additional help from Stochastics.\n\nLagging indicator is one that follows price movements and has less predictive qualities. The most well-known lagging indicator is the MACD. The usefulness of this indicator tends to be lower during non-trending periods.\n\nA leading indicator is thought to be the strongest during periods of sidewaystrading ranges, while the lagging indicators are regarded as highly useful during trending periods and produce fewer buy-and-sell signals which allow the trader to capture more of the trend instead of being forced out of their position.\n\nThe stochastic oscillator is calculated as a percentage of a security's closing price to its price range over a given time period. For eg: If a 5 day range of an index is 100 points and the index has closed to day 80 points up from that 5 day low, the stochastic will be 80, near overbought. Similarly if the index closes quite close to the 5 day lows, a mere 20 point away from it, the stochastic is 20, near oversold. The oscillator's sensitivity to market movements can be reduced by adjusting the time period or by taking a moving average of the result. In an upward trend the price should be closing near the highs of the trading range and in a downward trend the price should be closing near the lows of the trading range. When this occurs it signals continued momentum and strength in the direction of the prevailing trend.\n\nThis leading indicator will create many buy and sell signals that make it better for choppy non-trending(Sideways) markets instead of trending markets where it is better to have less entry and exit points.\n\nThe stochastic oscillator is plotted within a range of 0 and 100 and signals overbought conditions above 80 and oversold conditions below 20. The stochastic oscillator contains two lines. The first line is the %K which is essentially the raw measure used to formulate the idea of momentum behind the oscillator. The second line is the %D which is simply a moving average of the %K. The %D line is considered to be the more important of the two lines as it produces better signals.\n\nThere are two main ways this indicator is used to form buy and sell signals are through crossovers and divergence.\n\nCrossovers occur when Stochastic moves up from below 20 or 30 to generate a buy signal or moves down from above 70 or 80 to create a sell set up. It signals that the trend in the indicator is shifting and that this trend shift will lead to a certain movement in the price of the underlying security.\n\nDivergence occurs when the direction of the price trend and the direction of the indicator trend are moving in the opposite direction. This signals that the direction of the price trend may be weakening as the underlying momentum is changing. There are two types of divergence - positive and negative. Positive divergence occurs when the indicator is trending upward while the security is trending downward. This bullish signal suggests that the underlying momentum is starting to reverse and that traders may soon start to see the result of the change in the price of the security. Negative divergence gives a bearish signal as the underlying momentum is weakening during an uptrend.\n\nWhen it is combined with EW, the effectiveness increases as during 3rd waves, it tends to remain in the \"Overbought\" or \"Oversold\" for longer than usual. During such a 3rd wave, the lagging indicator,Macd, works well.\n\nWe, now, have trendlines & Channels, Pivots with supports & Resistances, leading(Stochastics) and lagging(Macd) indicators combination in a Trading systemthat forms the basis of our \"Tech.Table\". Note that we are not obsessed by any indicator or any method but each one contributing its worth as in a \"Cohesive TEAM\" that can lead you into any challenging trading day. What is the one most important team member missing.? The strategist who can peek into the opponents (Market's) next move. We will cover next the Strategist, Elliott wave beat"

      "text": "I don´t accept your intrepretation at all. Whether Appl goes up or down tomorrow, only means one thing to me. If it goes up, I will be closing off the straddle as a completed deal. If it goes down, then I will not be interested in any adjustment until the trend finishes and the volatility dies down, so I can lock in the difference by buying PUTS. That scenario would maybe mean a day or two, perhaps longer. At some point that down trend will stop, the volatility will start to die off, from the PUTS and I can then re-establish the straddle, though it most likely will be a STRANGLE then. Once back in either a STRANGLE or a STRADDLE I can buy and sell and adjust the sides. I´m already ahead by 11%. Now I would work it by adjusting to get it up to 20% possibly.\nIf you can do 20% a month, I think that is a pretty good return? Not there yet, but I´ve done this with overlapping straddles for several months, using them solely as straddles, which returned about 3%. Never lost. The whole point is not to take a loss. The straddle, strangle is perfect for that.\nLike a tennis ball, the market bounces up and down. It does so in short term fluctuations. But overall, the average of those bounces follow a trend, either a longer one, up, or perhaps down. This works out to the high/ low of your monthly bar. Which in the QQQ is about 5 strikes. Now we are in a sideways market and maybe heading for a bear market. The bar might be longer. It doesnt really matter, either way. Thats why you trade a strangle or straddle. The strategy stops theta decay pretty much. With that on your side, you can buy and sell either side to balance it off.\n\nStop bothering me with short term bounces and movements please. It is distracting. I don´t care if I´m winning or losing $200 on an intra day fluctuation. When it gets to be a $400 or $500 fluctuation, THEN I´M INTERESTED, but only to SELL to take a profit.\n\nFalcon... your thinking is flawed. You are NOT up by 11% by any means shape or form. If you were, your account balance would reflect a higher balance right now compared to what it was prior to establishing the position. Currently on your $ 7500 your account is down over 3%.\n\nDon't use smoke and mirrors in justifying your trades. Why in the world would you buy puts AFTER a downtrend finishes and volatility dies down??? Makes no sense.\n\nRemember-- you are new at this. Im not. Your looking to dig yourself a deep hole. Never lost? Famous last wordsOk cool-- time will tell.\n\nBuying puts has no impact on theta decay however...word to the wise. What u have going for u however is the fact that calls and puts only lose about $.01 per day right now this far out. There is always theta negative impact when u r long....albeit how small it is or how much time is left. As an example-- the Junes have $ .02/day.\n\nI buy OTM options either call or put, sofar so good, almost a year now. my feeling is the simpler the better.\n\nnot the cmore complicated the better.\n\ntry aapl 650call or 480put in the earning, you will see simple buy OTM is pretty awesome. you will not lose much, but if you win, you win multiples of risk, at least 2, even 10, 100.\n\nQuote from falconview:\n\nHaving failed at credit spread trading, Gap trading and straight buying of options. I´m now trying LONG STRADDLES in options. Got one week in it now, but probably run through the month. Any body got any advice on making money with lONG STRADDLES?"

      "text": "The Art of Expectations: Expectations Indicator\n\nThe stock market has come under pressure as of late even though the Expectations Indicator signaled low expectations on 6/12/2012. Although it may appear the bears have taken control of the stock market, the fact is the market is trading just as a low expectations market would.\n\nWhen we look at the current activity, we need to evaluate what is causing the pressure and what brings relief. For example, last week the market traded down considerably with the anticipation of a large credit ratings agency lowering 15 banks credit ratings. Since the release was due after market trading hours the market closed nearly on its lows for the day. On following trading day the market popped on the news with a common sentiment the \"it could have been worse\".\n\nThis sense of relief is a typical response to an environment where there are low expectations. No matter what the ratings changes where the low expectations market environment expected worse.\n\nToday and in the coming days the stock market is anticipating more news that should have the similar effect of trading down on the anticipated event followed by a relief rally on the news. This behavior is very typical in the early stages of low expectations.\n\nWe should expect the market to transition from this \"it could be worse\" environment to a more optimistic one as expectations build.\n\nWhy does the stock market go up one day then fall flat on its face the next? The media always has an explanation. One day the economy is on a road to recovery and the next is doomed to fail. If we were to make investment decisions based on the medias interpretation, we would be buying at the highs and selling at the lows.\n\nIf it is already raining outside, how does a forecast for rain help us? What we really need to know is when the sun is coming out. What we need is a barometer. When a barometer's pressure is rising we can expect good weather is on the way. When the barometer's pressure is falling, we should prepare for bad weather. So what is the barometer for the stock market?\n\nThe simple and most logical answer is, expectations. When expectations are falling as with a barometer, we can expect the market to start deteriorating. When expectations are rising like a barometer, we should expect the market to start improving. Probably the most important point to understand is when the pressure can't get any lower or higher.\n\nStock market direction is our reaction to expectations improving or deteriorating. An example of how expectations influence our behavior is best expressed by the following.\n\nImagine twin siblings attending the same school and enrolled in the same classes. One of the twins typically gets straight \"A's\" while the other regularly gets \"B's\". On report card day both twins come home with straight \"A's\". Which twin will have the biggest reaction from their parents? The obvious answer is the \"B\" student, but is it warranted?\n\nThe straight \"A\" student works hard all of the time, while the \"B\" student is capable of getting straight \"A's\", but chooses to only get them when he or she wants a big reaction from their parents. This example shows us that the parents' larger reaction with one twin over the other was determined by expectations.\n\nThis example also shows us that once we reach a peak in high expectation there is no other direction to go but down. It's impossible for a straight \"A\" student to exceed expectations at this level. The higher we move in expectations the smaller is our margin for error.\n\nThe above example plays out in the markets regularly. How many times do we see a company report earnings and beat estimates by a large margin, yet the stock sells off because it just was not enough? On the other hand, how many times have we seen a company miss earnings, but one little data point beats expectations and the stock takes off? The difference between these two companies is the level of expectations the market has for them.\n\nIf we just look at the daily market action, we are just looking out the window. If we really want to forecast future market conditions, we need to know which way expectations are going and at what point it can't get any worse or better.\n\nTo learn how to create an indicator that tracks the stock market expectations and identify its limits, read \"The Art of Expectations\"."

But what's most noteworthy is that we don't expect anything good. We are so used to everything either being one way or the other, but we don't have that kind of environment. So the negative pin action on disappointments such as reports from Monster Beverage or Chipotle Mexican Grill or Priceline simply gets blunted.\n\nTherefore, you get some decent earnings news with a backdrop of gently rising rates and a quiet Europe, and the next thing you know--voila!--you have the hated rally that you see on your screen.\n\nRandom musings: You cut numbers enough, a la Alpha Natural Resources, and even a horrendous quarter can drive the stock higher"

      "text": "You have written about the flash crash and its impact on how the markets are working. Has there been anything done to assure that it won't happen again, or to make the spreads tighter for the average trader? —Maverick99Boston\n\nTalk about a timely issue! My first reaction was to say, \"Of course things are much better\" — but then I asked Dennis Dick, one of my resident experts, on the topic. He had just put together an article about the subject. Some excerpts:\n\nI bought 500 shares of IBM on the opening print today. You would think 500 shares would be pretty easy to liquidate within a penny or two considering how our market scholars claim that the market has deeper liquidity and tighter spreads than ever before. Anyway, a minute after the open, this is the quote that I was trying to liquidate that 500 shares into (Figure 1).\n\nFIGURE 1: IBM TIGHT SPREAD\n\nYes, that's right, you are reading the quote correctly. The spread was 37 cents — 100 shares x 100 shares. Looks pretty thick and deep to me. And why does the quote change so many times in the one-second increment? High-frequency trading (HFT) liquidity providers change their quotes continuously in that increment, usually trying to aggressively penny each other, but then canceling their orders simultaneously.\n\nSo if I wanted to sell my 500 shares at the market, I could be filled on 100 shares at 203.10 and pay that 37-cent spread. And on the last 400 shares, who knows where I would be filled?\n\nWell, IBM is a $200 stock, so of course the spread is going to be wider. This isn't the case with other Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) components, is it? No, they are indeed tighter.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) had a nice tight spread of 21 cents, 19 seconds after the open. Coke (KO) had an 11-cent spread, in the first 30 seconds of trade. MMM had a cool 25-cent spread after the open."

      "text": "The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Mathew Martoma, who used to manage an SAC Capital division, with using inside information about tests on an Alzheimer's drug to trade stock of the company working on it.\n\nThe media love this stuff. I imagine reporters sitting around saying: \"The SEC finally will punish greedy Wall Street!\" But this is nonsense. Government prosecutors are as ruthless and greedy as anyone.\n\nIt's easy to hate the rich — and in our bailout economy, there are reasons for suspicion. But capital doesn't find the best outlets by itself. Hedge funds spot promising opportunities and quickly direct capital that way.\n\nWhen government interferes with that, we all suffer.\n\nUnder current law, insider trading still happens. Stock prices routinely rise before takeovers. The line between research and felony is very fine.\n\nWhat's legal? Even the lawyers can't agree. The SEC says it is illegal to trade \"securities after learning of significant, confidential corporate developments.\" But people in a stock trade never have the same information. One does exhaustive research about a company, another does less, and a third trades based on some market theory. In no way are these three \"equal\" in what they know.\n\nYes, you say, but the prosecutors allege inside information. One trader may be an employee of the firm. Why should he be free to use that information to buy or sell a stock?\n\nBecause America should be a free country.\n\nInvestors say the law persuades more people to invest. \"It makes markets more robust. That gave us biotech, Wal-Mart, Microsoft,\" says hedge fund manager David Berman. \"Companies raise capital in U.S. markets because of that confidence.\"\n\nIf a stock exchange or company wants to have a rule against insider trading, fine. Some of us will invest only in those companies or that exchange. But imprisoning select people who catch a prosecutor's attention stifles the flow of information.\n\nIn an actual free market, a company's stock prices embody traders' expectations about its future. Information confirms or upsets expectations, and that is reflected in prices. The sooner relevant information gets built into the stock price, the better for everyone.\n\nAs economist Warren C. Gibson writes: \"When the dissemination of significant news about a company is blocked by insider-trading restrictions, that company's shares are mispriced relative to where the price would be if the news were out. If the news is bad, investors will buy at prices they would not have paid had they heard the news. Movement of capital toward more productive uses is inhibited. If it is good, some sellers will let go of their shares at prices they would not have accepted. ... In either case, there is a net loss to the economy.\"\n\nVague anti-insider trading laws distort prices. Also, these laws, like all regulation, create a false sense of security. They lead people to think stock traders play on the same level field. Far better to encourage investors to be wary — not complacent — when they buy stocks.\n\nIf you object to insider trading, avoid companies that permit it.\n\nBut government should butt out.\n\nJohn Stossel is host of \"Stossel\" on the Fox Business Network. He's the author of \"No They Can't: Why Government Fails, but Individuals Succeed.\""

      "text": "The Primary Trend is Down!\n\nMajoring in Dow Basics\n\nCharles Dow, in his editorial commentary at the turn of the century, formulated what would\nlater become The Dow Theory. Although his theories would be put together\nlater and amplified by others, the central tenets of his theory have\nbecome one of the basic tools for analyzing markets. Dow believed the\nmarkets have three movements that are all going on at the same time.\nThey are known as the major, secondary, and minor movements in the markets.\n\nThe first movement is the minor movement reflecting what is\ngoing on day to day. This is followed by a secondary trend, or\nshort-term swings that can last from two weeks to six weeks or more. The\nmajor trend is the primary movement in the market, which lasts long-term\nand can encompass time periods covering four years or more.\n\nIn addition to these\nthree movements, Dow formulated trend confirmation indicators such as\nhigher tops and bottoms to confirm a bull market, and lower tops and\nbottoms to confirm a bear market, to which he added the confirmation of\nthe Industrial and Rail Averages. If a Bull Market was in place, a rise\nin the Rails (now the Transportation Index) would rise along with the\nIndustrials. If a Bear Market was the primary trend, a fall of the\nRails with the Industrials would confirm the Bear Market trend. The idea\nbehind the confirmation of the Industrials and the Rails is that things\nbeing made and sold would have to be shipped. If sales fell,\nmanufacturing would contract and there would be a decline in\ntransportation of goods.\n\nOthers would come along after Dow, putting his theories together and refining them such as S.A.\nNelson, William P. Hamilton, who became editor of the Wall Street\nJournal after Dow's death, and Robert Rhea, who became the Dow's\nhistorian and record keeper to Richard Russell, today's leading Dow\ntheorist. Even though Dow's theories were formulated over a century\nago, they are still relevant and followed to this day. Many of his\ntheorems have been refined to form the central tenets of technical\nanalysis. Technical analysis has been refined and improved over the last\ncentury and has advanced significantly with the aid of computers and the\nInternet. Even though these theories were formulated over a century ago,\nthey have just as much meaning today as they did more than a century\nago, especially Dow's theories of primary trends.\n\nDistracted From Today's Primary Trend\n\nThis is the subject\nthat occupies this week's closing Market Wrap-Up. In viewing this week's\nmarket action, it appears the markets have gone back to their primary\ntrend, which is a downward movement in a continuing bear market. What is\nimportant for investors to understand is the primary trend. The primary\ntrend is one of a bear market. There is so much background noise every\nday in the media that obscures this fact. There are a plethora of\nopinions voiced each day that are nothing more than useless drivel.\nVarious reasons as to why an investor should be buying a stock are as\nnumerous and as large as the losses that have occurred in this bear\nmarket which began over two years ago. Such tripe as \"The markets rallied\nover investors\" optimism over the rescue of trapped miners over the\nweekend,\" or \"Executives hauled off to jail,\" are ludicrous and insulting\nto one's intelligence. I call them distractions because they keep\ninvestors from focusing on what is important and what is obvious. We\nhave a repertoire of standard clich's for keeping investors in this\nmarket and keeping them confused. They all have a familiar ring such as\n\"the second half recovery,\" \"we're close to a\nbottom,\" and my favorite, \"stocks are cheap.\"\n\nIn the words of Charles H. Dow, \"The best profits in the stock market are made by people\nwho get long or short at extremes and stay for months or years before\nthey take their profit.\" Dow went on to say, \"The best way of\nreading the market is to read from the standpoint of values\" In\nreading the market, therefore, the main point is to discover what a\nstock can be expected to be worth three months hence\" It is often\npossible to read movements in the market very clearly in this way. To\nknow values is to comprehend the meaning of movements in the\nmarket.\" One of Dow's contemporaries, Samuel A. Nelson, confirmed\nthis by saying, \"Value has little to do with temporary fluctuations\nin stock prices, but is the determining factor in the long run.\"\n\nWhat we can learn from\nstudying Dow and many of his followers is that the primary trend in this\nmarket is down. We are in a bear market whose primary trend is down. It\nis that simple. You can forget all of the background noise. It's just\nclutter designed to keep you distracted and confused. Forget\nthat stocks are cheap (with the one exception being natural resource).\nMoreover, at today's high prices, even after the declines of the last\n28 months, stocks are hardly bargains. The S&P 500 is selling at 31\ntimes trailing earnings with a dividend yield of less than 1.8%. The Dow\nis trading at 23 times trailing earnings and offers investors a dividend\nyield of 2.2%. At the bottom of bear markets, P/E multiples get as low\nas 7 and dividend yields get as high as 6-7%. We are still a long way\noff from stocks becoming cheap. If you want cheap, look at the energy\nsector, which is what Warren Buffett is doing.\n\nToday's Market\n\nDespite the carnage of the last few days, the markets actually ended up on the plus side for the\nweek. The S&P 500 rose 1.3% for the week and is down 24.7% for the\nyear. The Dow gained 0.6% with YTD losses of over 17%. The Nasdaq was\nthe exception this week losing 1.1%, bringing its YTD losses to over\n36%. The week was up, but the primary trend is still down as evidenced by\nthe YTD numbers.\n\nWe may be heading for\nmore problems next week that will take a healthy dose of intervention to\navoid. There is now a full-scale banking crisis emerging globally with\nsystemic risks everywhere that could be amplified by the leverage in the\nfinancial system from derivatives. With bankruptcies and junk bond\ndefaults at record highs, there are huge counterparty risks that lie\nwaiting to erupt. Someone somewhere is on the wrong side of these\ntrades. The following is a sample of the systemic risks that are\nstarting to emerge. Friday, Societe Generale, France's second largest\nbank, reported a 41% decline in second-quarter net income as a result of\ntaking a $371 million hit for bad loans. The same day in London, Lloyds\nTSB said it has become the latest to be hurt by turmoil in the world\nfinancial markets. The bank said it was increasing its loan loss\nreserves by 50% to cover loans it made to Enron, WorldCom, and\nArgentina. There were rumors also circulating around that one of the\nnation's largest airlines is close to going under. Business Week\nintimated that UAL may file for bankruptcy this year. A spokesman for\nthe airline declined to comment on the Business Week story.\n\nStill Watching The Banks\n\nWith Brazil now on the\nropes, the IMF is considering giving the country more time to repay its\n$11 billion in loan payments due next year. We now see bankruptcies\nrising, companies as well as countries defaulting on their debt, credit\nspreads widening, and one has to wonder, Who is next? There is too much\ndebt and the growth in derivatives has only compounded this situation.\nOver the last few weeks, worries and concern has started to spread over\nthe nation's top three banks and their exposure to derivatives. The current exposure exceeds J.P. Morgan Chase's net\nequity. Even as large as Citigroup is, their current exposure could\ncause severe problems for the banks, especially if systemic risks\nthroughout the world's monetary system start to multiply as we are now\nstarting to see unfold.\n\nIn fact, given the extent of their derivative book and considering that they are in all of\nthe wrong places, it is hard not to imagine that one of these three\nbanks are headed for trouble, if not all three. The banks are supposed\nto have risk control measures in place. Yet with derivative books this\nlarge, it doesn't seem possible they can avoid the occurrence of future problems. In the case of\nJPM, their derivative book of $23.4\ntrillion and equity base of $40 billion is all that covers $51 billion in\npotential credit risk, not mentioning the $68.8 billion in derivative\nrisk exposure. These three banks are in all of the wrong places -- corporate loans, loans to emerging markets, and counterparties to a\nTitanic-size derivative book. Add to this the fact that most of the\nderivative books of these major banks are of the OTC variety -- which\nmeans they are far riskier and less liquid -- it isn't too imaginative\nto envision more problems occurring. A lot of the derivative business is\nbased on blind faith and assumptions. These are the assumptions that are\nbuilt into the derivative risk models that provide the theoretical\npricing for much of these complex instruments.\n\n\"It's So Derivative\"\n\nBank\n\nDerivative Contracts'\nTotal Value\n\nCurrent\nExposure\n\nJ. P. MorganChase\n\n$23.4 Trillion\n\n$68.8 Billion\n\nBank of America\n\n$9.8 Trillion\n\n$6.9 Billion\n\nCitigroup\n\n$6.6 Trillion\n\n$22.4 Billion\n\nSource: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as of March 31, 2002.\nTable courtesy of Matthew Goldstein, \"Bank\nDerivatives Back on Radar,\" 8/2/2002\n\nIt is the complexity of these instruments and the prevalence of problems in the international\nsystem that is now causing central bankers and investors to worry. As I\nsaid above, someone somewhere is going to come up on the wrong side of\nthese trades. At this time we don't know who. We just have clues.\n\nLooking Like A Double-Dip Recession\n\nThe economic numbers this week are showing the economy is starting to slow down again and\nthat the recession was much deeper than originally thought. On Friday\nthe government reported the economy created fewer jobs than expected and\nthat the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high. Factory orders fell\n2.4% in June and many more companies are reporting a slowdown in sales\nand profits. The economic numbers this week have already caused one\nmajor Wall Street firm to predict the threat of recession will cause the\nFed to lower interest rates again. Goldman Sachs, which predicted a rate\nhike because of a strong economy only five weeks ago, is now calling for\nthe Fed to lower interest rates again in order to thwart another\nrecession. Some question this move given the large contingent of foreign\nownership in our financial markets. Lower interest rates would now be\nconsidered an act of desperation that could cause foreign investors to\npanic and exit our markets. Currently, interest rates are more attractive overseas, especially in Europe.\n\nThis week Trim Tabs reported that money flowed into equity funds in a delayed reaction to a\njump in stock prices. Last week $20.5 billion flew out of stock funds.\nFor the month of July nearly $48 billion flowed out of stock equity\nfunds. This follows outflows last month that were close to a record $48 billion.\n\nWhat we have seen this\nweek and this quarter is a number of clues on the economy and on\nearnings that call into question a second half recovery. The economy was\nmuch weaker than originally thought and shows signs of new weakness.\nCorporations continue to report weak sales and profits and there are new\nsigns of retrenchment in spending on the consumer front. It is hard to\nmake a case at this point for a second half recovery. In fact, it is\nmuch easier to predict the economy will lapse back into a recession\ninstead of a strong recovery. In summary, the primary trend is for the\nbear market to continue and for the economy to head back into recession.\nIn addition, there is even a greater risk that the Perfect Financial\nStorm is coming closer to fruition as barometric gauges in the financial\nsystem have taken a sudden drop.\n\nOverseas Market\n\nThe Dow Jones Stoxx\n600 Index of European shares headed for its first weekly gain in four\nweeks as drugmakers including GlaxoSmithKline and tobacco companies such\nas Gallaher Group rose. Zurich Financial Services slid as Merrill Lynch\n& Co. cut its profit forecast for the insurer. The Stoxx 600 erased a\ngain of as much as 0.6% and closed 0.2% lower at 217.82. It has climbed\n1.3% since last Friday. The narrower Stoxx 50 Index added 0.1% to 2605.55.\nThree of the eight major European markets were up during today's trading.\n\nAsian stocks fell, led by exporters Sony Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co., after U.S.\nmanufacturing and job reports indicated economic growth in the region's\nbiggest overseas market is faltering. Japan's Nikkei 225 stock average\ndropped 0.9% to 9709.66, as of the 3:01 p.m. close in Tokyo.\n\nTreasury Market\n\nTreasury prices gained considerable yardage as the week's economic stats provided fodder\nto those expecting more rate cuts from the Fed. The December fed funds\nfutures contract is currently factoring in a 1.50 percent overnight\nrate, signaling that the Fed will lop off 25 basis points from short\nrates by year-end.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury note rallied 27/32 to yield 4.285% while the 30-year government bond soared 1 1/8 to yield 5.215%."

      "text": "Part Three: The Risk of the Iron Condor Spread and How to Mitigate it.\n\nSo far we have talked about how the iron condor has great probability of success and can generate a decent return month after month.\n\nIn this section we are going to talk about what happens when things go wrong.\n\nMost traders say that iron condor options trading is a conservative strategy. Others say it is very risky because you can lose a lot more than you can make.\n\nIt all depends on how you set up the condor spread. You can choose strikes that are way out of the money and that give you a 95% probability of success or you can choose strikes that are close to the money and give you a 40% chance of success. The closer your short strikes are to the money, the more your iron condor becomes a butterfly. A butterfly is also two credit spreads like a condor but close to the money.\n\nAs an example, let's look at a condor spread that has an 80% probability of success. In our example we get a credit of $1.00 and the max we can lose is $9.0. So we can make $100 per spread or lose $900. As you can see you don't have to lose too many times to lose all your money. Even if you win 9 times and lose once, you will be negative. And since the odds are saying you will win 8 times and 2 two times for every ten trades this is a losing proposition.\n\nBut no one said you have to lose the whole amount.\n\nBy using money management you can limit your losses in the months your condor spread is not going to make money. And yes, there are several months like that where no matter your adjustments, you are still going to lose unless you are willing to throw an endless supply and money at it and are willing to roll into other months.\n\nInstead of letting our condor spreads go all the way to the max loss; let's say we decide to limit our loss to 20%. For simplicity sake we will limit our loss in the example to $2. Once we enter the trade, we get $1. But if we are ever down $2 or $200 per spread then we exit the trade.\n\nWhat about Stop Loss Orders?\n\nYou can use them. Place orders to buy back your spreads at whatever you decide as an acceptable max loss. That should help you sleep at night.\n\nWhat about another 9/11 event?\n\nThe iron condor does well when the markets are flat. Or if they go in one direction then it works if the move is a slow on. A major event like a 9/11 event that makes the market move huge in one day can kill an iron condor trader.\n\nNormally, these types of moves happen to the downside. If there is a nuclear explosion, or war, or earthquake, or anything similar, the markets will drop. As is the common phrase \"Bulls go up the stairs. Bears go out the window.\"\n\nAn iron condor trader can protect herself from such an event by buying Put insurance. You simply take some of the credit you get and buy enough put protection to protect yourself in case the word ends. With this insurance, if the markets go down enough you can still make money even if you lose the max on the condor spread.\n\nLet's recap our lesson on iron condor risk.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of getting to the max loss, you simply decide on an exit point. \"When I am down ____ % or $_____ I will exit the trade and live to trade another day.\"\n\nAnd to protect yourself from the end of the world, simply buy some Put(s) as insurance. How many puts and which puts is a matter of personal preference and depends on your trade size.\n\nSometimes I will. The main reason is to act as insurance when the underlying is not behaving properly. Especially when it is moving very quickly in one direction, rolling might not be the best option. In that case, buying a long option cuts your deltas down and that flattens the amount you can lose in the short term if the underlying keeps moving. You have to balance the cost of the insurance vs how much you are going to make in the trade. Spending up to 10% of your credit on insurance is not a bad idea. Especially when there is a risk of a large drop in the market. Some traders add the insurance when they get into the trade, I like to add it if needed when the trade is not going my way."

Because the big moves down were all on heavy volume? I know nothing about technicals. I'm looking at a company with a 7.7 PE in a sector that's been annihilated.

To me barring an immediate market rally you have to go to back to the fall of 2008 to find a small area of demand @ $40.41 where it might get a lift. or $39.54 from the summer of 09 may find support. I'd say absolute rock bottom is probably around $27.50.\n\n(CKY, Sam, HSF if you can double check this for me I'd appreciate it).\n\nDoesn't mean it has to drop to $40.41 (also you may get a relief rally before it heads lower), but I don't see the odds in your favor here in the short/intermediate term as there are two big gaps it could fill. I'd need an awesome fundamental reason to be in this stock right here."

The first group is Commercial traders and the second one is Non-Commercial traders.

In fact, they have their strategy and they are constantly going one direction, 40mg Erythromycin Topical Pharmacology.\n\nAlternatively, there is another group, 20mg Erythromycin Topical Pharmacology, that is called Non-Commercial traders. Erythromycin Topical Pharmacology, They differ from Commercial traders by the fact that they are trying to make money in the Forex market for themselves and their clients. Although such a group do exist on Forex market, the majority of experts still doubt whether this group can create a trend. Most likely that due to the fact that Non-commercial traders are in smaller quantity and they operate with smaller sums of money, 500mg Erythromycin Topical Pharmacology, they don't have power to sustain a trend and maintain it on their own when online trading.\n\nNow it's high time to answer the main question bothering the majority of forex traders. I'm talking about the time appropriate to enter the market. Erythromycin Topical Pharmacology overseas, I want you to know that the experienced traders learn to not only follow price but to understand momentum changes in price. Originally, momentum changes are connected with the most important trading times in the market, Erythromycin Topical Pharmacology.

Although many traders may tell you that it's their luck that helps them to notice when it's an appropriate time to enter the market, Erythromycin Topical Pharmacology ebay, but the things are not only about luck alone. Actually, this is all about the understanding of economical and political processes and the way they will influence Forex market.

Investors must abide by a set of rules\n\nSell rules will guide you at certain points of a stock's move, so you won't be a deer in the headlights. Investors should commit to memory at least a dozen sell rules and, of course, act on them.\n\nUsing sound rules will help you achieve consistent results. Don't trade on emotion, such as hoping that a losing stock will make a miraculous comeback. Instead just follow sell rules. The following are just a sample.\n\n• Cut losses at no more than 8%. This is the most important rule that will save you from disaster. When a stock falls 8% from your purchase price, just sell to prevent further damage.\n\n• Lock in gains when they amount to 20% to 25%. Take worthwhile profits when you have them. A few 25% winners can make for a good year\n\n• Don't let a big gain turn into a loss. If a stock breaks down after rising more than 10%, don't wait for an 8% loss; preserve gains.\n\n• Closing below the 10-week moving average in significant volume. Consider selling if a stock closes the week Sell when stock ends below its 10-week line in volume that's at least 40% above average.\n\n• Fast recovery to new highs. Sell if a stock moves down sharply for two weeks and then up for two weeks into new high ground.\n\n• Heavy volume without further price progress. Look to sell when a stock, after a long run, moves up and then retraces the bulk of its move in high volume.\n\n• Weekly close below a long trend line. This is a sell signal that could indicate a change in trend.\n\n• Break above a long upper channel line.Sometimes, this coincides with a climax run.\n\n• Also consider selling when a stock gets 100% or more above its 200-day moving average.\n\n• Big stock splits within a year and a half of each other or less.\n\n• Sell when a company's CEO makes the cover of a mainstream magazine.\n\nCeradyne (CRDN) went on a tear after clearing a cup with handle in the week ended May 2, 2003. As it quadrupled in price, the stock broke above an upper channel line in the week ended Oct. 31. (1)\n\nIt also marked its biggest weekly price spread in the week ended Nov. 14.

Breadth is solid at better than 2-to-1 positive with banks, chips, steel and coal leading while biotechnology takes a breather.\n\nAs I discussed in my opening post, this is classic computerized trading. The high-frequency trading algorithms keep pushing the market in a straight line as they fire off millions of trades for fractional gains. As long as we keep trending, they can continue to buy and sell in miniscule increments and extract steady gains.\n\nSeveral readers have asked how to deal with this sort of action. The answer is to acknowledge it and don't try to fight it. The reason that this works so well for the computers is because there are still so many traders who try to fight it. They feed the action and accentuate the moves being created.\n\nI have to remind myself constantly not to let my desire for pullbacks cloud my view of what is actually happening. We'll see a sharp pullback at some point, likely when the algorithms reverse, but the timing is the challenge.

      "text": "April 21, 2008\n\nAs I have discussed in the past, the TradeRadar analysis attempts to identify stocks that are undergoing reversals. Given my current bullish attitude, this means that we will be featuring stocks that have declined over the last six months or so and are now beginning to bounce off their lows and show some strength in their stock price.\n\nOne thing I have noticed about using the TradeRadar BUY signal is that the stock picks don't carve out a perfect V-shape when they undergo reversals. They tend to hit bottom, then move up fairly quickly, thus triggering the initial TradeRadar BUY signal. Then they tend to back off and go into a consolidation phase after which, if the reversal is meaningful, the stock moves up to new highs.\n\nIn this case, there is a good chance that a cheaper entry point can be obtained. Looking at the following chart of Allis Chalmers (ALY), for example, TradeRadar Alert HQ gave a BUY signal toward the end of February and I purchased the stock at $13.16. The stock soon fell to under $12 then began to steadily move up. A little patience would have provided an extra 5% or 6% profit.\n\nAnother pattern I have seen is that a stock may move up in anticipation of earnings (and we are in the middle of earnings season, after all) thus triggering the TradeRadar BUY signal. When earnings are actually announced, though, anything less than what investors were expecting can push the stock down quickly.\n\nIn this second case, getting hit by an earnings surprise can also be avoided but the timing is trickier. If the earnings release is in the same week as the BUY signal, it can easily be argued that an investor should wait before committing. It can easily mean the difference between being stopped out at a loss or preserving capital for other investment opportunities. It pays to keep an eye on the earnings calendar.\n\nWhen all is said and done, the two situations described here can be remedied by exhibiting patience. Wait and watch for a bit. If the stock deserves to rally, it eventually will"

The Share market is also known as the equity market. In a Share market the stocks and shares are traded at a price that is agreed upon. To regulate the Share market there is an entity which is called the stock exchange. Only those companies which are listed in the stock exchange can trade in the Share market.\n\nThe Share market is rapidly developing. Not only in India but worldwide. The Share market brings together people who need money and those who are ready to invest. With the Share market there is a very good allocation of the resource called money.\n\nParticipants of the Share market\nThe Share market has a lot of people dealing and transacting in it. They are retail or small investors, institutional investors and trading corporations that deal with their own shares. Insurance companies, Mutual funds, hedge funds and banks are all institutional investors. Some decades back only people who are wealthy could deal or trade in the market. But then things have changes after the Share market has become organized and come under the control of stock exchanges. The scenario changed from individual investor to institutional investor.\n\nHistory\nThe Share markets began in the 12th century in France. However now there are Share markets almost all over the world. Every developed nation has a Share market. India's Share market is one of the largest markets in the world. It stands 9th worldwide.\n\nShare markets and Importance\n\nOne of the main and vital functions of the Share market is to raise fund for companies. This means the business can be done publicly; companies can raise some extra funds which can be used for the expansion of the business. They can do this by selling their securities in the Share market and letting the public own a part of the business. The Share market improves the liquidity to a great extent. It is because of this the investors can quickly sell securities. This is the most striking element of the Share market.\n\nIt is proved quite a number of times that the Share market is the direct indicator of the economy. When there is a depression in the market the prices of the shares fall causing a market crash. Similarly there will be a rise in the price of the stocks and shares when there is a boom in the economy. Similarly when the economy is stable the prices are also stable and there is also growth. The Share market clearly reflects the economic strength of a country.\n\nWith the stock exchange the Share market is much more regulated as it has a check on each every transaction. From the point of view of the buyer they collect and also deliver the shares. From the point of view of the seller they see to that they receive the payment for the security that they have sold. In short they minimize the risks both for the buyer as well as the seller.\n\nWith all the above advantages there is an overall growth in the economy as the costs are minimized, risks are lowered to a great extent, more production and output as expansion is made easier, increase in the employment opportunities which ultimately leads to overall growth of the economy and better standard of living for all.\n\nThere is an amazing change in the financial system these days. That means funds that are meant for saving goes directly to the equity market instead of the conventional deposit and lending procedure. Public these days trade in the Share market either through the mutual funds or directly. There is clear and evident increase in the financial assets people hold.\n\nWhen the prices of the stocks and the shares increase the investment in the business increases and the reverse is also true. The prices of the shares also affect the income and the consumption levels of a household. It is because of this the central bank has control over the equity market. It always has an eye on the Share market. It has this check just to ensure that operations in the market are carried our smoothly and also see to that the operations are stable.\n\nShare market is one of the best option for investment you can make very good return from share market. You just need to in-depth knowledge of share and commodity market for investment. This is good post for learning about share market and those one want to start investment in"

      "text": "Earnings Season\n\nWhat It Is:\n\nEarnings season refers to the four times per year when most public companies announce their quarterly and/or annual earnings.\n\nHow It Works/Example:\n\nAlthough there are no official dates, earnings seasons usually last about a month and start in mid-January (after the fourth quarter ends in December), mid-April (after the first quarter ends in March), mid-July (after the second quarter ends in June), and mid-October (after the third quarter ends in September). It is important to note that not every company ends its quarters and announces earnings in this traditional pattern, but most do.\n\nDuring these times, many companies are announcing their earnings via press releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Usually, a company willissue a press release first (which contains key but minimal information), and then make a more detailed filing with the SEC (typically a Form 10-Q or 10-K and possibly additional forms). These disclosures not only report a company's earnings per share, they provide financial statements and some comment or discussion from management.\n\nWhy It Matters:\n\nEarnings season can be a time of heightened volatility and trading volume in the markets as investors react to the onslaught of news and new information about companies. Much of this reaction centers on the difference between what companies were expected to report and what they actually reported.\n\nOften, short-term investors are more affected by the volatility of earnings season than long-term investors. However, all investors are responsible for keeping up-to-date on their investments and following the earnings performance of their companies"

This can be seconds, minutes, hours, or trading basics the complete day.\n\nDay trading huge NYSE shares often includes acquiring a massive total of stock and hoping to earnings from a little fluctuation in value, allows say 1% for example. A single percent is a incredibly modest revenue, but if youre shopping for $100k well worth of stock, 1 percent is a thousand bucks.\n\nWarm penny shares are really unstable and make quick changes in value. Because the selling price modifications so significantly, you dont have best stocks to have or spend virtually as considerably cash to attempt and make a earnings like $1,000.

That indicates you can only invest $1,000 and Nonetheless make $1,000 in gain in less than a day.\n\nSo to make massive gains day buying and selling the typical stock current market, you ordinarily would have to day trading spend a ton of dollars. If you perform the penny stock market place, you can make gains just as significant or more substantial than Wall Streetwhile enjoying with Substantially considerably less funds.\n\nPenny shares have always been seen as a way to degree the enjoying subject with the rich.\n\nIn fact, some of the most well-known and well known hedge fund administrators initially commenced creating prosperity by trading penny stocks. A very little acknowledged solution is that numerous effective penny stocks hedge finances are greatly involved in the penny stock marketbut theyre beneath no authorized prerequisite to disclose this to their purchasers or to the general manifeste so almost no 1 is aware of about this!\n\nIf you have the suitable penny stock picks, you can make just as substantially cash as wealthy tradersbut with out acquiring almost as significantly money in the bank. Its a fantastic way to make large gains devoid of needing to have a big financial institution account."

      "text": "I'm going to consider this a little further but these algorithms are made to make a penny on the dollar.. but it's pretty fair to assume they can lose a penny on the dollar rather easily. If you watch the market daily you rarely see any enormous movement until some type of news is released, then volume jumps. I can think of only a very few NASDAQ based positions than fluctuate very awkwardly daily but you will never see enormous volume for unknown reasons. The funny thing about the market is how psychologically based it is... I once thought I could straight off statistical info and make mad $.. but people constantly overreact and follow like sheep. An algorithm wouldn't follow like sheep when you get an unexpected dip and volume spike.\n\nRegardless measurements go into stock analysis.. insider holdings.. short trades etc.. Each position has a certain degree of volatility that is measured. These algorithm based traders are playing w/ small cap stocks that show enormous fluctuation daily. Large and mid caps are often stabilized by ETF's, Mutual Funds, Insider owners and long positions. Which explains why they often follow the S&P and quarterly results.\n\nBottom line... I'm not to worried about the micro/small cap stocks causing a market collapse...\n\nVery interesting, thank you. Did I hear that guy right, this accounts for 70 percent of trades?\n\nYes. It's an often quoted figure I've heard tossed around for a few years. A feller named Scott Patterson who wrote a book about it (\"Dark Pools\") also verified a similar figure based on some data collected by another firm (don't recall their name, not Nanex) in a recent interview I watched.\n\nI should post a screen shot of what HFT bot \"trading\" looks like on the charts because I see it all the time...even as slow as 1 min time frames.\n\nThese algorithm based traders are playing w/ small cap stocks that show enormous fluctuation daily.\n\nHA! Not true. You could probably make a case for keeping things going in those sectors, but just look at the volume tank since 2007 when these guys really started taking over. If the trend continues, volume on the NYSE will hit zero in the next 10-15 years. Less volume, more algos; more algos, less volume. Methinks something is afoot.\n\nFair enough. But even the physicist / scientist said you have these trades going on with basically no adult supervision. It's a disaster waiting to happen if you don't put safeguards in place.\n\nThat's what I was getting at. Disaster is inevitable, get out before it happens.\n\nQuote from agent00f :\n\nHas it ever occurred to you that the same people/politicians/banks/economists/etc would exist even without a gubmint, and that their failure would still impact you (and everyone you know) regardless of whether you invest with them? Highways are a useful thing, even if they're not owned by the gubmintThey can be, but we have solid information that the highway is no longer a safe place to be for anyone not driving an M1A2 Abrams.\n\nWant to help disease research while you look for SlickDeals?

They obviously won't have the development of the big boys though who have devoted large amounts of money to try and perfect such things.\n\nI know a guy who who has spent I think he said a million of his own money over the years for his personal robotrade setup. (I say \"his own money,\" though much of it was created when he still ran his own fund, so it's not like he's always done it only for himself.) The thing does work, though some years it works better than others, and it does require tweaking.\n\nAnyone can make their own robotrade setup for free if they want, though again, your tools and testing to know what works and what doesn't won't be at the level of people with very large amounts of money.\n\nShould it be banned? eh. I think a main thing is that if someone is going to use such things, then they deserve to take the heat if it goes wrong. Some of those flash crashes are bs since the battlebots go nuts, lose money from going nuts, and then the exchange steps in and says, \"All trades during the flash crash are void.\" That's bs. A buddy of mine had a big short going during a flash crash. $$$$. It got voided. bs.\n\nThey did that for Knight Capital too, but not enough, and Knight Capital, which a mere week ago was a HUGE market maker, now faces possible extinction. Justice is served, imo.\n\nAnyone can robotrade with their computer. They obviously won't have the development of the big boys though who have devoted large amounts of money to try and perfect such things...\n\nYeah, but the game as it's now played in the high frequency big leagues is a completely different deal versus what people used to call automated and rules-based trading. Now you're talking about multiple groups having many parallel processing servers colocated on dedicated interconnected high-speed networks trading tons of shares in milliseconds to take advantage of transient fractional price differences that might only last for a second. By the time anyone recognizes something has happened, it's a done deal and you're way down the road as far as whatever consequencesSure, but money assuredly buys power (esp via PR) in a social order that tautologically equates the two.\n\nQuote :\n\nThey can be, but we have solid information that the highway is no longer a safe place to be for anyone not driving an M1A2 Abrams.\n\nThis thread is rather about banning weaponized vehicles from the highway\"We are all born ignorant, but one must work hard to remain stupid.\" ― Benjamin FranklinThink of it like bump drafting in racing. Everyone can do it, that doesn't make it a safe strategy for the user or everyone else on the track. Just because something is equally risky for everyone doesn't mean it should be allowed. The automatic stop thing just makes me angrier. Like someone else in the thread said. They invalidate all the trades back to before the crash. This is essentially ADMITTING that the algorithm trades are invalid. All of them. It's just they only want to keep the ones that make money, and reject the ones that explode the market.\n\nIf I appear to be ignoring your posts, it's probably because you are on my ignore list.\n\nFine, go ahead but you're not going to \"win\" when the big one happens cause the bots that sit on the exchange can \"see\" all the stops and will \"know\" about it before some dope with a Macbook. In other words, you can protect yourself but all it takes is a nanosecond to turn your account into a black hole.You don't understand Mike A's post.

      "text": "In a previous article, I explained how one aspect of the stock market works, in the plainest language I could. After talking to a few people, I realized that there was another, more basic function of the market, that a lot of people are confused about, and that is shorting stocks, or selling short. A lot of people don't really understand how you make money off of a stock losing money. In fact, it is very counter-intuitive (at least to honest people), so I want to try to illustrate it as simply as possible, with as little Wall Street jargon as I can. It really isn't that complicated, but the way people talk about it makes it seem a lot more cryptic than it really is. So, let's look at how you 'short' a sale.\n\nSay you are a camera buff, and have lots of friends who are camera buffs and professional photographers. One of your friends has so much equipment, he could never use even half of it. He has one lens in particular, that you are really interested in. The reason you are interested, is because it sells on Ebay for as much as $2,000, but you have heard a rumor that it is about to be replaced by a newer, better version. You know that when the new lens is released, the value of the current lens will drop through the floor, because everyone will be selling them to get the new one. So, you get an idea. You get your friend to rent you his lens for $10 a month, with the promise that after a set amount of time, for this example let's say three months, you will return it (or one just like it if something happens to it) to his collection. As soon as he rents it to you, it immediately goes up on your Ebay page for sale, and you end up getting $2,000 for it. Two months later, the new lens you heard rumors about comes out, just like you hoped it would. As you predicted, the old lens plummets in value, as everyone unloads them, and you are able to buy one for $500. You then return the $500 replacement to your friend, and walk away having made $1,500 on your $30 rental fee. You have just completed your first successful short.\n\nOk, I've been doing a lot of research on the financial sector, and what caused the financial collapse a couple years ago, and I think there is something I need to explain, because people seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding about what really happened, and what caused it. Now, this is all pretty complicated, so to try and make it clear, I'm instead going to create a hypothetical situation, which illustrates the problem, instead of going into details about Credit Default Swaps, Collateralized Debt Obligations, and all that sort of thing.\n\nSo, say you are really hungry, but you don't have any money until payday a week from now. So, you get an idea that you will go to one of those restaurants that will give you the meal on the house, if you can finish their giant steak. Of course, you don't want to get in trouble if you can't finish it, so you ask a friend of yours to loan you the money for the dinner, just for the night, and promise you will give it back to him tomorrow, plus another buck on payday, just for the trouble of loaning you the money. You are pretty sure you can eat the whole steak, at which point the meal will be free, and you can give your friend his money back, and even if you can't the worst that happens, is you pay him back everything on payday. Still, to put his mind at ease, you tell him that if for some reason you can't pay it tomorrow, then you will give him a dollar for every day you don't pay him back. So far, so good, right? Your friend likes the deal, because no matter what, he gets extra money, and if you keep his money longer than you promised, he actually makes more than if you pay it when you say you are going to. As long as you don't lose your job, or welsh on the deal, then everything is good. Nothing too complicated.\n\nSo, you go to the restaurant, you eat your meal, and let's say you don't actually finish it, and have to take a little longer paying your friend back. No big deal. You pay him back, and he is happy with the money he got. Normally, this would be the end of it. However, he happens to have a friend who is a natural born trader, who notices that he got a pretty good return on investment, and thinks there has to be a way to turn this into a real revenue stream. So, he starts taking out ads in papers, offering to provide this same service to anyone. He quickly learns that he needs to be careful who he offers to do this for, but on the whole, he makes money at it. Enough money, in fact, that he sets up a company to do this, and starts hiring people. Pretty soon, there are competitors, and several companies vying for this business of making loans to people to cover their meals, for an interest rate. Problem is, there is plenty of demand, after all everybody needs to eat, and everybody is short of cash once in a while, but there are a limited number of people who are a safe-enough bet, that you aren't going to lose your shirt. Because unlike a friend, they have a lot less reason to actually pay the business back. So, all the companies trying to do it, are basically trying to go after the same safe customers.\n\nWhen Android started out, it was treated as little more than a joke. A great many people dismissed it as an irrelevant experiment, by a company blindly casting around for any way to grow their business beyond their core competencies of search and advertising. Back then, Android's claim to openness was undisputed, and treated if anything, as one of the many reasons not to take it seriously as a contender, because it was so clearly some wrong-headed amateur hour OS, from a company who didn't 'get' the market. Now it is the predominant smartphone OS in the world, and practically all anyone can talk about is whether or not it is really \"open.\" Problem is, that is a trick question, and it can't be answered, until you figure out what is really meant by the people asking it. Open is a vague word, that can mean many different things, depending on your point of view, and for the most part, anyone asking if Android is open, is doing it more as a ploy to forward an agenda, than as a serious question.\n\nTo get the actual technical question out of the way, Android's source code is open. You can go right now, download it yourself, and start working on your own version of Android. It might not be the up-to-the minute latest version, but it is still, undeniably, the source code of the OS, there for you to use how you see fit, with no restrictions. You can design your own device around it, and distribute that device in any way you wish, without having to ask permission from a single person, or pay a single license fee. That, in and of itself, is a radically different model from a great many software products, and to most people, meets the minimum requirement by which you can reasonably claim your software is open.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, and the Soviet Union was still around, I used to regale people with hyperbolic tales of a dystopian future, which I was sure was what lay down the path for America. I would plead with people to recognize the little things, which were the first baby steps toward a society that was the antithesis of everything people said set America apart from the \"evil empire\" of the USSR. I talked a lot about slippery slopes, and unintended consequences to well meaning laws. I carried predictable trends to absurd extremes, to try and illustrate a point. Yet never did I actually expect those dark scare tactics to be so oddly prophetic. I never actually expected that America would become a country with tens of thousands of state video surveillance cameras at intersection, or where the state would charge you fines for not living a 'healthy-enough lifestyle', or where smoking a cigarette was illegal. Sure, I might have told people they could look forward to a future where they couldn't board a plane, train or bus without presenting their papers, but I didn't actually expect it to happen. I certainly never seriously predicted that America would become a secure Homeland, where citizens were denied the right to travel because their name was on a suspicious persons list, or where women are required to be felt up before they are allowed to get on a plane. Even in my most elaborate Kafkaesque vision, I never expected the state to issue software for handheld computers to aid citizens in informing on their neighbors. I never even imagined that the US would have more of its citizens incarcerated than any other nation on Earth. It never occurred to me that people would be arrested for exercising their first amendment rights without a permit, or that American citizens would only be able to gather, under the watchful eye of armed troops in full body armor. No, I never actually expected the bleak reality of my imagination, to become the world I actually lived in.\n\nThe reason I never expected it to actually happen, even though I could see the writing on the wall, was because deep down, I really believed that once it became blatant enough for the average American to notice, they wouldn't stand for it. I believed that Americans were, by nature, freedom-loving people, with a healthy mistrust of authority. The very reason for all my dreary prognostications of doom and gloom, was because I honestly believed that if you could just shock people into seeing the disconnect between the rhetoric of freedom, and the developing reality, then they would snap out of it, and choose liberty over oppression. I thought that ingrained in the American psyche, was the idea that it was better for a hundred criminals to go free, than for one innocent man to be imprisoned. I had always taken it as a comforting article of faith, that Americans were the ones who would purposely do the stupid thing they knew was bad for them, rather than submit to to someone telling them they had to do what was good for them. I had never questioned that Americans were the people who would die to protect your right to say the most offensive shit imaginable, no matter how much they hated you for saying it. In my imagination, Americans were the type of people who would go back to a barter economy, before they would stand for businesses reporting their cash transactions to the FBI. In short, I apparently completely misjudged the culture in which I grew up.\n\nI was reading a fascinating interview a Facebook friend sent me, and started to reply to him, but realized it was a long enough topic to deserve a post. One of the things I saw mentioned in the interview, was a concern, which I have heard voiced quite a bit around the world, that people fear 'the Internet' will soon be under siege by corporate forces, who will seek to \"own and control it.\" Now I don't know if it is because I have actually been involved in the Internet industry for so long, or if it is because I am American, and we have a bit of a head start on a lot of the world when it comes to the Internet, but for whatever reason, my perspective puts me in the unenviable position of delivering an uncomfortable message to the everyone. I'm afraid that fight already happened around the turn of the century, and the corporations already won. I think there is a fundamental misunderstanding around the world, of what kind of control corporations want from the Internet, which is probably the reason people don't understand that they already own everything on the Internet.\n\nSee, corporations don't want to keep people off the Internet, they don't want to decide who does or doesn't use the Internet, they don't want to control what you do on the Internet. They want three simple things.\n\nTo convince as many users as possible that their service is essential to their life"

Not one guy, it has to be millions so that Warren Buffets has been able to make ove 50 billions over time, just buying and selling the same crap over and over.\n\nIf I didn't mess up this should show that collective intelligence is not so simple. I used squared error. There is diversity in the predictions. No two people make the same predictions. One group consists of squares. Another group consists of sharps. The third group consists of the two squarest squares and the sharpest sharp. The last group consists of two sharps and a super sharp.\n\nAll of the squares benefited by using their average predictions rather then their individual predictions. All of the sharps benefited by using their average predictions.\nThe mixed case is kind of unexpected. The sharpest sharp benefited by going with the average predictions with the two squarest squares rather than using his own prediction. Finally, the super sharp with the two other sharps did better on his ownYeah, these are arbitrary. I was just trying to show the different possibilities. A simulation is a good idea."

      "text": "It has a been a choppy week for the market, if this choppiness continues for few more sessions then no traders will be left in the market, cautions Sudarshan Sukhani of S2analytics.com.\n\nThe Nifty has managed to stay above 5,300 levels and if there is no major bad news then it may continue to remain above that mark, he told CNBC-TV18.\n\n\"The trade for today is on the long side. Going ahead, we will see a big move on the Nifty in the next one month,\" he added.\n\nBelow is the edited transcript of the interview with CNBC-TV18's Udayan Mukherjee and Mitali Mukherjee. Also watch the accompanying video.\n\nQ: First a trading strategy on the index after what has been a very choppy week for us?\n\nA: Yes it's been a choppy week and if this continues for a few more days there will be almost no traders left in the market. I hope that doesn't happen. The trend is still up, although it's now silly to say so because there is no trend infact but for whatever it is worth the short term trend is up. We did breakout out of that trading range of 5200-5300 and we are floating above 5300. Maybe today also if things don't go bad we'll still remain above 5300. So the trade is to remain long.\n\nThe Nifty is in a very narrow range, it can not stay here. That's the only certainty that this market has today, it is going to move out. I don't know whether it will move out. First we had 5300, now we have 5350 as the barrier. I don't know if it will go above or come back all the way and breakdown below 5200. The trade currently is on the long side but I am very open. If the market decides to move down that's what we'll have to do but we'll get a big move in the next one month, one just needs to be patient.\n\nA: It has become a weak looking chart. Crompton had all the right things going for it and I thought maybe this is now entering a new bull market of its own after that big decline, so a lot of the excesses were washed away. Now it seems its not sustaining, lot of stocks are not sustaining. The Nifty itself is confusing but Crompton Greaves is a short sell. If not anything it will probably come down lower where it becomes a buy. Or if it is entering again a bull market, if the rally was just a relief rally then it will see lower levels . In either case downside values will be seen, so it is a short sell here.\n\nA: Now it is a better looking chart, earlier Fortis was a weak looking chart. It went through a correction, made lower highs, lower lows. Now it has broken out of a fairly bullish head and shoulder pattern that tells us that the decline is over and this is a reversal pattern, and it's now embarking on a new up move. It has also done all the right things on the upside.\n\nYesterday it gained a lot of traction and that traction was not a one day move, it has come on the back of a breakout from a bullish pattern. So Fortis is not just a day trade, it's a good idea to go long today. It's also probably something that you want to hold on to.\n\nQ:Godrej Industries has been trending quite nicely, that one you think has more strength on its charts?\n\nA: It does have more strenght on the charts. Firstly it's making those new highs. Now for the last 3 days, it's in a very narrow range, consolidating. Stocks can't consolidate for long while the index can do that for much longer. This consolidation is going to end and because of the strong uptrend that we are seeing in Godrej, it's reasonable to assume that it will break out on the upside and continue it's up move. It's an excellent stock to be in; it's a buy on dips stock. I have explained earlier it's in the same position as Hindustan Unilever was when it was trading at Rs 300.\n\nA: Yes, I had thought that after that big decline on IGL Petronet also fell and maybe there will be a buy on dips opportunity but that has not happened. Petronet has now actually weakened, it has come back to the levels at which it closed on the IGL news day, so there has been no rally essentially. If there is no rally, if the market is responding to bad news, if support levels are willing to be broken then we should be short. At the worst, we will have a correction because that Rs 155 level is now being taken out on the downside, so that correction should be tradeable."

This is a contract between two parties.\n\nDifference in the price for a specific financial instrument is the subject of such contract. Meanwhile, the resources are not actually transferred, which makes such transactions very popular and easy for most investors.\n\nCFD trading appeared on financial market some years ago. This type of contract was created in the Great Britain in 1980s as a result of long-felt need for such an instrument.\n\nCFD-stocks trading helped improve the possibility of opening short-term positions, as well as avoid some levies. As a result, speculators preferred short-term transactions.\n\nA lot of traders and investors consider CFD to be an easy way to speculate from one trading account, which helps maintain big positions with no risk of shortage of free margin.\n\nCFD-stocks trading is performed on the basis of leverage. This helps receive financial result even if an investor possesses insignificant capital stock. Besides, contract for difference gives a possibility to receive benefits which would be possible in case of actual shareholding.\n\nFor example, distribution of dividends. But there are some limitations. If you speak about shares, a trader won't be able to participate and vote at shareholders' meetings.\n\nThe margin contract is very beneficial for those who needs to protect their stocks, for example, during market decline. This type of contract helps hedge assets and is frequently used by investors or holders of some resources or shares.\n\nConsidering the fact that hedging requires just opening an account and make easy registration, this is the easiest and the most popular variant.\n\nIn order to trade CFD, it is necessary to open a trading account. For example, at a dealing center. Then you need to get necessary software, replenish the trading account, learn the theory and gain necessary skills of terminal operation.\n\nAfter that, it is possible to trade this instrument, which is considered by a lot of traders as an easy way both to earn the basic and additional income, and to diversify assets and save accumulated stocks in investments.\n\nCFD\n\nSymbol\n\nLot Size*\n\nSpread *\n\nStop & Limit\n\nSwap * Long\n\nSwap * Short\n\n#AA\n\n100\n\n3\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#AIG\n\n100\n\n4\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#AXP\n\n100\n\n3\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#BA\n\n100\n\n3\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#CAT\n\n100\n\n4\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#DD\n\n100\n\n3\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#DIS\n\n100\n\n2\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#FB\n\n100\n\n5\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#GE\n\n100\n\n3\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#HD\n\n100\n\n2\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#HON\n\n100\n\n2\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#HPQ\n\n100\n\n2\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#IBM\n\n100\n\n4\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#INTC\n\n100\n\n3\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#IP\n\n100\n\n3\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#JNJ\n\n100\n\n4\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#JPM\n\n100\n\n3\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#KO\n\n100\n\n3\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#MCD\n\n100\n\n3\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#MMM\n\n100\n\n4\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#MO\n\n100\n\n3\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#MRK\n\n100\n\n4\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#MSFT\n\n100\n\n2\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#PFE\n\n100\n\n3\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#PG\n\n100\n\n4\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#T\n\n100\n\n2\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#UTX\n\n100\n\n4\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#VZ\n\n100\n\n3\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#WMT\n\n100\n\n4\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#XOM\n\n100\n\n3\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#DELL\n\n100\n\n2\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#AMD\n\n100\n\n2\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#CSCO\n\n100\n\n2\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#GOOG\n\n100\n\n65\n\n65\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n#AAPL\n\n100\n\n50\n\n50\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n* Spreads and swaps are indicated according to the current market conditions (data is recorded in the table, straight from the trading server, and is updated in real time).

      "text": "Market timing is the strategy of making buy or sell decisions of financial assets (often stocks) by attempting to predict future market price movements. The prediction may be based on an outlook of market or economic conditions resulting from technical or fundamental analysis. This is an investment strategy based on the outlook for an aggregate market, rather than for a particular financial asset.\n\nMarket timing often looks at various moving averages. Popular are the 50- and 200-day moving averages. Some people believe that if the market has gone above the 50- or 200-day average that should be considered bullish, or below conversely bearish.[1] Technical analysts consider it significant when one moving average crosses over another. The market timers then predict that the trend will, more likely than not, continue in the future. Others say, \"nobody knows\" and that world economies and stock markets are of such complexity that market timing strategies are unlikely to be more profitable than buy-and-hold strategies.\n\nWhether market timing is ever a viable investment strategy is controversial. Some may consider market timing to be a form of gambling based on pure chance, because they do not believe in undervalued or overvalued markets. The efficient-market hypothesis claims that financial prices always exhibit random walk behavior and thus cannot be predicted with consistency.\n\nSome consider market timing to be sensible in certain situations, such as an apparent bubble. However, because the economy is a complex system that contains many factors, even at times of significant market optimism or pessimism, it remains difficult, if not impossible, to pre-determine the local maximum or minimum of future prices with any precision; a so-called bubble can last for many years before prices collapse. Likewise, a crash can persist for extended periods; stocks that appear to be \"cheap\" at a glance, can often become much cheaper afterwards, before then either rebounding at some time in the future or heading toward bankruptcy.\n\nProponents of market timing counter that market timing is just another name for trading. They argue that \"attempting to predict future market price movements\" is what all traders do, regardless of whether they trade individual stocks or collections of stocks, aka, mutual funds. Thus if market timing is not a viable investment strategy, the proponents say, then neither is any of the trading on the various stock exchanges. Those who disagree with this view usually advocate a buy-and-hold strategy with periodic \"rebalancing\".\n\nBrokerages may favor institutional investors at the expense of smaller retail investors[edit]\n\nPerhaps consistent with these two opposing views is that, as with any type of trading, market timing is difficult to carry out on a consistent basis, particularly for the individual investor unschooled in technical analysis. Retail brokers are also generally unschooled in both the mind set and the tools needed to successfully time the market, and indeed most are actively discouraged by the brokerages themselves from moving their clients in and out of the market. However, as market makers, many of these same brokerages take the opposite approach with their large institutional clients, trading various financial instruments for these clients in an attempt to \"predict future market price movements\" and thereby make a profit for the institutions. This dichotomy in the treatment of institutional vs. retail clients can potentially be controversial for the brokerages. It may suggest for example that retail brokers and their clients are discouraged from market timing, not because it doesn't work, but because it would interfere with the brokerages' market maker trading for their institutional clients. In other words, retail clients are encouraged to buy and hold so as to maintain market liquidity for the institutional trading. If true, this would suggest a conflict of interest, in which the brokerages are willing to sacrifice potential returns for the smaller retail clients in order to benefit larger institutional clients.\n\nThe 2008 decline in the markets is instructive. While many retail brokers were instructed by their brokerages to tell their clients not to sell, but instead \"look to the long term\", the market makers at those same brokerages were busy selling to cash to avoid losses for the brokerages' large institutional clients. The result was that the retail clients were left with huge losses while the institutions fled to the safety of short term bonds and money market funds, thereby avoiding similar losses.\n\nA major stumbling block for many market timers is the phenomenon of curve fitting. This means that a given set of trading rules has been over-optimized to fit the particular dataset for which it has been back-tested. Unfortunately, if the trading rules are over-optimized they often fail to work on future data. Market timers attempt to avoid these difficulties in a number of ways. One is by looking for clusters of parameter values which work particularly well.[2] Another is using out-of-sample data, which ostensibly allows the market timer to see how the system will work on unforeseen data. However, critics charge that once the strategy has been revised to reflect such data it is no longer \"out-of-sample\".\n\nSeveral independent organizations (e.g., Timer Digest and Hulbert Financial Digest) have tracked some market timers' performance for over thirty years. These organizations have found that purported market timers in many cases do no better than chance, or even worse. However, there are exceptions, with some market timers over the thirty-year period having performances that substantially and reliably exceed those of the general stock market or the sectors in which the market timers invest. Jim Simons' Renaissance Technologies Medallion Hedge Fund has consistently outperformed the market. The fund allegedly uses mathematical models developed by Elwyn Berlekamp.[3]\n\nA recent study suggested that the best predictor of a fund's consistent outperformance of the market was low expenses and low turnover, not pursuit of a value or contrarian strategy.[4] However, other studies have concluded that some simple strategies will outperform the overall market.[5] One market-timing strategy is referred to as Time Zone Arbitrage.\n\nMutual fund flows are published by organizations such as Investment Company Institute and TrimTabs. These show that flows generally track the overall level of the market. For example, in the beginning of the 2000s decade, the largest inflows to stock mutual funds were in early 2000 while the largest outflows were in mid-2002.[6] It is good to note that these mutual fund flows were near the start of a significant bear (downtrending) market and bull (uptrending) market respectively. A similar pattern is repeated near the end of the decade.[7][8][9][10]\n\nThis mutual fund flow data seems to indicate that most investors (despite what they may say) actually follow a buy high, sell low strategy.[11] Studies confirm that the general tendency of investors is to buy after a stock or mutual fund price has already increased. This creates a surge in the number of buyers which then drives the price even higher. However, eventually, the supply of buyers becomes exhausted, and the demand (supply and demand) for the stock declines and the stock or fund price also declines.[12]\n\nThe famous Dalbar study found that the average investor's return in stocks is much less than the amount that would have been obtained by simply holding an index fund consisting of all stocks contained in the S&P 500 index.[13][14] A similar conclusion is drawn in the recent study by Valeriy Zakamulin.[15]\n\nA recent study suggests that corporations and investment banks cannot time the credit markets.[16] They show that investment banks such as Goldman Sachs do as poorly as firms like Ford when it comes to timing the issuance of their bonds.\n\nWhile market timing is legal, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has long frowned on the practice since it passes the trading costs to long-term investors. Consequently, many brokerages will not fill market-timing orders.\n\nProponents of the efficient-market hypothesis claim that prices reflect all available information. EMH assumes that investors are highly intelligent and perfectly rational. However, others dispute this assumption. \"Of course, we know stocks don't work that way.\"[19] In particular, proponents of behavioral finance claim that investors are irrational but their biases are consistent and predictable."

      "text": "Debit Spreads\n\nAll\nAbout Debit Spreads - Definition, An Example, and How to Use\n\nA debit\nspread comes about when you purchase one option and simultaneously sell an\noption (for the same underlying security, of course), and you have to shell out\nsome cash to buy the spread. When\nyou buy a debit spread, except in unusual circumstances (see below), you only\nhave to come up with the difference between what the option cost that you\nbought and what you received from selling the other option to someone else.\n\nDebit\nspreads are purchased to reduce risk.\nThe other side of the coin is that the maximum gain is limited. For example, you might buy a one-month\ncall option at the 70 strike for XYZ stock selling at $70 and pay $3.00. If you just bought the option, your\ncost would be $300 plus commissions, and that is the maximum you could\nlose. If the stock goes up to $80,\nyou could sell the option for $10.00 and make a whopping gain of $700. However, it doesn't happen that way\nvery often. Stocks usually don't shoot up by $10 in a single month.\n\nAnother\nchoice would be to buy a debit spread, sharing both the risk and potential\nreward with someone else. You\ncould probably sell a one-month 75 call on the above stock for $1.50. If you did that, you would collect $150\nfrom someone else and cut your total risk in half. (Your debit spread in this\ncase would be called a vertical spread.) If\nthe stock goes up to $75 in one month (a much more likely event that having it\ngo up to $80), you would make a gain of $350 less commissions on an investment\nof $150. At a $75 ending price,\nthe person who bought the 75 call would lose his entire investment while you\nmade over 200% on yours.\n\nIf the\nstock did manage to go up to $80, your debit spread would still earn you $350,\nbut that is the maximum you could ever gain. Meanwhile, at $80, the person who bought the 75 call would\nalso make $350 on his investment.\nIn the real world, however, your chances of a maximum gain are many\ntimes greater than the person who did not buy a debit spread, but only bought a\ncall option instead (and paying the same amount, $150, for his investment as\nyou did for your debit (vertical) spread).\n\nDebit\nspreads do not have to be only vertical spreads. A calendar spread, also called a time spread or a horizontal spread, is also a debit spread. Diagonal spreads can also be debit spreads. For example, you could buy a call\noption with many months of remaining life and sell a higher-strike call with\nonly a single month of remaining life.\nThat would be a debit (diagonal) spread. As with most debit spreads, you would only have to come up\nwith the difference between what you paid for the long option and what you\nreceived by selling the short option.\n\nThere are\ncertain spreads where you have to come up with more cash than the debit spread\ncost. For example, if you bought a\ndiagonal call spread, buying a 70 strike call with 6 months of remaining life\nand selling a 65 call with only a single month of remaining life, you might be\nable to buy the spread at a debit.\nHowever, theoretically, you could lose $500 on the spread (if the stock\nshot higher, above $70, and never returned.\n\nThe broker\nwould charge you a $500 maintenance requirement on this spread even though it is\nhighly unlikely that you would ever lose that much. At the end of the first month when the 65 strike call\nexpired, you would have to buy it back for its intrinsic value. Of course, it is unlikely that you would lose much if the\nstock did shoot up above $70. When\nyou bought back the expiring 65 call, your 70 call with several months of\nremaining life could probably be sold for a greater amount than it cost you to\nbuy back the 65 call.\n\nIn my\ndiscussion of spreads, I am assuming that you will never allow an in-the-money\ncall or put to be exercised (i.e., either buying someone's stock at the call\nprice or forcing someone to buy shares of your stock at the put price).

      "text": "Trading After-Hours/Out-of-Hours with Spread Betting\n\nQ. I noticed that the FTSE daily is open on IG before even the UK market was open?\n\nI thought FTSE opens 08:00 GMT and closes 16:30GMT? The spread on IG Index before the market opens is about 6 but comes down to 2 when the market opens. So how does it work?\n\nA: Some providers like IG Index and CapitalSpreads quote the FTSE on a 24 hour basis. During market hours the index mirrors the futures and after-hours IG Index make a price based on other futures movements (like the Hang Seng, Dow, ASX...etc) and business. The spread betting firms cover themselves by widening the spread out of hours. Often to 6 points between 16:30 and 8.00.\n\nNote that this doesn't apply just for spread betting by the way; there are 24 hour global markets for the major indices (Globex markets). The spread betting providers will constantly adjust their prices based on the overnight movements on these 24 hour global markets. One such company that deals in 'future' contracts is Euronext ( The global markets for indices do shut over the weekend - and so do the spread betting providers (some stop quoting prices at 9pm on a Friday, some at 10pm and some at some point between).\n\nSo if you think the market will initially drop 1% but IG Index are already discounting this by quoting it down 1% you should stay out as you are basically dealing where it will go from there (rather than where it will head relative to last night's close).\n\nQ. I just can't get my head around the out of hours trading on the Daily FTSE...\n\nMy real-time esignal chart shows an opening at 5279 yet the IG Daily FTSE was trading at 5259/65 at 7.59. Did the market really open at 5279 and if the FTSE is a reflection of the price of the constituent share prices just how does this out of hours trading work? I can understand the market makers pricing the shares down on opening but what 'causes' the out of hours prices to be so different from the previous day's close without the FTSE data having been available?\n\nA: In short, although the FTSE is a 'reflection of the price of the constituent share prices', the FTSE market the spread betting companies offer is slightly different. Their spread reflects what they think the future price of the FTSE will be.\n\nLet me give you an extreme example. FTSE closes at 5279 and then overnight, BP goes bust (run with it). Now, you think the FTSE is going to open at 5279 so you can short it and obviously the FTSE is going to drop dramatically given the news - everyone knows this, everyone expects it. But by how much? Well, a good guess is the price you see on IG index just before the open. That price trades out of hours and that price is based on trades made in light of the new news (amongst other things).\n\nYou will never have the opportunity to sell at your price of 5279 because a) the market makers will mark down the price of BP before you can trade it - and they will do this probably with a barrage of sell orders from people looking to sell. And also, the spread betting companies show a price well below your 5279. In these days of 24 hour trading, the FTSE (traded spread) price moves 24/7. The open hours really only show you a small part of the day.\n\nSo during the day the spreadbetters FTSE price is the futures price adjusted for cost of carry to give the 'cash' price. Add to this a bit of adjustment for the house position if required. Once the FTSE futures close, 5.30pm, the price is a function of other markets. I.e., roughly every 2 point down move on the Dow = 1 point down on the FTSE. If the US and Asian trading sessions have a nightmare they may well drop their opening price by 50-80 points for the previous day's close and vice versa. I.e. because that's where they think the market will go. Obviously they move round the world markets until 7am when the European indexes open and they get a good idea of what will happen in the UK. Of course they will adjust for an increase in commodities (or big corporate news, etc) which is generally positive for the FTSE whilst negative for the Dow.\n\nQ. What happens in the FTSE during 7-8am and 8-9am, is it something to do with market makers setting prices?\n\nA: The FTSE before 08.00 is quoted by the spread betting companies using what information they can get on pre-market order levels / on the activity in the dow and S&P over night and on the Dax index. It is a purely spread betting created market with no absolute correletion anywhere else.\n\nBetween 08.00 and 09.00 the price quoted by the spread betting companies may deviate significantly from the FTSE 100 index because it takes quite sometime for all the stocks to come on line. Sometimes even quite large FTSE 100 stocks have not uncrossed before 08.20. We quote a spread based from the Futures market which can get a little hairy over the open.\n\nQ. 24-hour dealing not...I can't seem to place say a bet on the FTSE when both the FTSE and DOW indices are closed?\n\nFor instance I can't seem to place say a bet on the FTSE when both the FTSE and DOW are closed but I do seem to be able to place a bet on the FTSE when the FTSE is closed but the DOW is open? What about the Nikkei - am I able to place a bet on the FTSE when both the FTSE and Dow are closed but the Nikkei is open? Also, can I trade stocks when the underlying markets are closed? Basically I need clarification on when exactly (and which markets) I can trade when the underlying markets are closed.\n\nA: Both the FTSE and the DOW trade 24 hours a day. There is not a time when they are closed, regardless as to whether the futures on the FTSE and Dow are trading.\n\nIn fact with some providers like IG Index, you can take a position in the FTSE or Wall Street at any time, 24-hours a day, between Sunday night and Friday night. Others will restrict the trading times to certain time brackets - say the FTSE from 7am to 9.00pm and the Dow from 7am to 9.15pm - always best to read the provider's dealing handbook for full details.\n\nQ. Can you let me know the implications of trading markets out-of-hours?\n\nA: Some spread betting providers offer after-hours trading on some markets with some of the markets now being quoted round-the-clock. For instance in the case of quoting the 'FTSE' outside normal market hours the spread betting providers will be basing their quotes on the relationship between the FTSE and the closely-correlated Dow, S&P, Nasdaq and DAX.\n\nExtended hours trading allows for more flexibility (since you can enter or exit a market anytime you like) and the ability to trade outside of normal market hours which means you can effectively trade a market when the real underlying market is closed (for instance trading the FTSE overnight). However, it is important to note that when you trade on out-of-hours prices the spread betting company is acting as a pure market maker or bookmaker essentially making up the stock index futures prices based on what the correlated markets are doing and the business on their books.\nAdditionally, the spreads tend to be wider and maximum trade stake sizes might be reduced. The implications of trading at this time are, basis the wider spreads - orders may also be triggered when they would not have done during in-hours trading (which means that a stop loss can still be triggered out-of-hours). It should still be possible to open and amend positions during after-hours trading.\n\nDifferent markets are priced differently out-of-hours. For example, indices are priced from other world indices that are in hours and also from the volume of trade that the spread betting company might see coming through from other clients.\n\nSpread traders trading during such times are taking on a higher level of risk but some actually see it as bargain hunting, in effect speculating on the day ahead. Having said that you are probably better off not spread trading after-market hours as the spread betting providers will be quoting their own indicative pricing. In other words you have nothing to compare the price against if you believe you were erroneously stopped out. It will be the price they quote and not the market price of the index...\n\nQ. Why don't spread betting firms allow trading on the FTSE 100 shares round-the-clock in a similar way you can do with indices?\n\nA: The answer quite simply is that FTSE 100 firms trade on the LSE (London Stock Exchange) which isn't open on a 24-hours basis. So you can't spread bet on the movements in NEXT stock at 4 am in London as NEXT isn't trading at that time. Of course the LSE could extend its trading times but this is unlikely to happen as there isn't sufficient demand as most trading on blue chips is done by banks and investment companies that do most of their trading when the exchange is open.\n\nNote: A number of years ago the LSE decided to move the start of trading to 8:00 am so they could match the hours in Frankfurt. There was an outburst when they told the big traders this, no one wanted to support it. Finally they got it through, but there is no possibility 24 hour trading will happen anytime soon.\n\nQ. But I've seen one company on AIM last night - how do people go about making deals after the bell/before morning bell as it shot up 30% at about 7:55 this morning?\n\nSaw news on Toledo last night, being AIM I couldn't buy it anyway but it does raise the question for me on how do people go about making deals after the bell/before morning bell as it shot up 30% at about 7:55 this morning.\n\nA: An off market deal is really two people - a buyer and a seller - sitting down and doing a deal. You wouldn't need to use a broker - maybe just a solicitor to ensure the agreement is properly drawn up. It's really not a lot different from buying or selling shares in unquoted private companies - normally done through the company secretary who matches those who want to sell with those who want to buy.\n\nLegally you can buy and sell shares at any time of day you wish and any day of the week. If you want to trade on the market - obviously this has to be done when the market is open...but you don't have to use the market. The market only exists because it's convenient for buyers to have access to large numbers of potential sellers and vice versa.\n\nShares are assets - and when you sell them and when you buy them is up to you and the other party. If you want to buy or sell at midnight on Christmas Eve it's perfectly legal to do so - all you need is a willing buyer and a willing seller.\n\nQ. IG Index - why do they quote after hours spreads based on the closing price, rather than the bid/offer?\n\nI'm asking due to some of the small spreads on the less liquid shares - I don't see who would find this useful?]\n\nA:IG Index do not make out-of-hour spreads on shares. The spread that is evident is merely an indication of where the share was trading at the close of business. However, they are not tradable during out of hours."

(This was a novel idea at the time.)\n\nPeterffy figured out how to use computers to calculate when financial instruments called options were overpriced or underpriced. But he had a problem. It was 1977, and people weren't yet using computers to buy and sell options. They were still standing in trading pits, waving their arms and yelling to do trades.\n\nPeterffy tried bringing binders of computer printouts to the trading floor to guide his buying and selling. But this was slow and inefficient. So he and some engineers tried to build an early tablet computer — a proto-iPad — to bring to the trading floor. The tablet worked, though one burst into flames on the trading floor.\n\nStory #3:\n\nIt wasn't until 1987 that Peterffy was able to take people out of the loop entirely. With the world's first electronic stock exchange, the NASDAQ terminal, traders could type in orders directly into a computer.\n\nPeterffy didn't want to type in the orders. He and his engineers hacked into the NASDAQ terminal and wired it up to their own computer, which traded automatically based on algorithms.\n\nA senior NASDAQ official saw Peterffy's setup and said Peterffy was breaking the rules: All orders had to be entered through the keyboard. He gave Petterfy's group one week to fix the problem.\n\nPeterffy and his engineers came up with a solution. They built a robot with rubber fingers that typed entries into the keyboard. It satisfied the NASDAQ rules. And on active trading days, the robot typed so fast it sounded like a machine gun.\n\nIn the 1990s, over a decade after Peterffy dreamed up computerized trading, exchanges start to let people plug their computers directly into the markets.\n\n'Absolutely No Social Value'\n\nToday, Peterffy is one of the big players. The company he started, Interactive Brokers, does electronic trades on a mind-boggling scale. Forbes estimates his net worth is now over $5 billion.Peterffy is in favor of more regulation. He'd like to see rules that slow things down.\n\nThe challenge of course: People will try to find ways around the rules. There is always someone willing to build a robot that types.\n\nNote: We learned of Peterffy's story from the forthcoming book Automate This.\n\nAnd I'm Melissa Block. By one estimate half of all stock trades now involve a computer which decides on its own to buy or sell. Computerized trading has helped markets function more efficiently, but it's also led to some spectacular messes. Just this month, one firm suddenly lost $440 million dollars because of a computer glitch. NPR's David Kestenbaum of Planet Money visited one of the fathers of computerized trading to explore how he got to this point.\n\nDAVID KESTENBAUM, BYLINE: Thomas Petterfy grew up in Hungary after World War II. His first experience with trading happened when he was around 12. A friend went across the border to Austria and brought back something truly precious.\n\nKESTENBAUM: Petterfy cut each stick into five small pieces, and sold the pieces to his friends at school for a profit.\n\nPETTERFY: Eventually, the principal found out about this and called me down into his office and he said, well, where is your Communist conscience? And I didn't know what he was talking about.\n\nKESTENBAUM: Was that your first time buying low and selling high?\n\nPETTERFY: That is correct.\n\nKESTENBAUM: Petterfy eventually makes his way to the United States, where he meets his first computer - a big boxy, calculator of a thing - and he falls in love, stays up all night programming it. And eventually, gets a job at a company that is trying to use computers and math to make money on Wall Street. In particular there are these complicated things called options or derivatives. They give you the right to buy, say, a certain stock at a certain price on a specific date. It's hard to calculate what one should cost, but Petterfy, with a computer, he finds a kind of secret formula.\n\nPETTERFY: It took me about nine months to figure this out. But once I figured it out, it was a fantastic feeling.\n\nKESTENBAUM: Because it meant there was a way to price them.\n\nPETTERFY: That's right.\n\nKESTENBAUM: And a way to make money. But this is 1977, and Petterfy has a problem. Trading isn't done on computers. You have to go stand in a pit on a trading floor and wave your hands around and shout. Petterfy can't bring his computer onto the floor, so he prints out mathematical tables on paper and puts the pages in a big binder. He brings this big binder down onto the trading floor.\n\nPETTERFY: People looked at me - what the heck is that? And so I said, well, you know, these are my numbers that will help me trade hopefully. They made funny faces and, you know, many of them didn't understand my accent and it was - I didn't feel very welcome there.\n\nKESTENBAUM: Every time Petterfy tries to use computers to trade, it's like the world just isn't ready for it yet. He hires some engineers who help him build these early tablet computers which work - though one burst into flames on the trading floor. It isn't until 1987 that Petterfy finally is able to take people out of the loop entirely. It happens at NASDAQ, the world's first electronic stock exchange. Meaning, there is no trading floor. You buy and sell by typing orders into a computer - a NASDAQ terminal. Petterfy, of course, doesn't want to have to type in orders. So, he and his engineers hack into the terminal. They wire it up to their computer, which starts trading up a storm; so many trades that a high up official with NASDAQ comes by to see what's going on. And the guy sees just this one terminal attached to a computer.\n\nPETTERFY: He looks and looks and looks and he says, well, so tell me again how you are doing this? So I explained to him what's happening here. And then he says, I don't think you can do this, but I really don't think, but let me go back to my office and let you know.\n\nKESTENBAUM: The man calls back and says I'm sorry. The NASDAQ rule book says you can't go cutting wires. All orders have to be entered through the keyboard. You have one week to fix it.\n\nPETTERFY: So this was a problem.\n\nKESTENBAUM: Petterfy and his engineers come up with a solution. Trades have to be entered on the keyboard? Fine. They build a machine to do that.\n\nPETTERFY: So it was basically they were rubber fingers that were typing.\n\nKESTENBAUM: You built a robot to type in the trades.\n\nPETTERFY: We built a robot that types.\n\nKESTENBAUM: What did that thing sound like when it was running?\n\nPETTERFY: Like a machine gun. Brrrrr. Because it was typing so fast.\n\nKESTENBAUM: Finally, in the 1990s exchanges started to let people just plug their computers directly into the markets. Today, Petterfy is one of the big players. The company he started, Interactive Brokers, does electronic trades on a mind-boggling scale. Forbes estimates his net worth is now over $5 billion dollars. Petterfy says automation has done some very good things for the world. It's made buying and selling stocks much, much cheaper for everyone. But Petterfy thinks this race for speed, it's doing more harm than good now. It's an arms race, like the U.S. had with the Soviets.\n\nPETTERFY: We are competing at milliseconds. And whether you can shave off three milliseconds in the execution of an order has absolutely no social value.\n\nKESTENBAUM: Petterfy is in favor of more regulation. Rules that will build in some safeguards and slow things down. The challenge, of course, people will try to find ways around those rules. There's always somebody willing to build a robot that types.

      "text": "How to Build a Strategy, Part 4: Grading Trends\n\nWhether a trader is building a strategy to trade ranges, breakouts, or trends - it is often beneficial to be able to grade how 'strong' the trend(s) may be.\n\nFor traders looking to trade ranges or breakouts - well they generally want the trend, if any, to be quiet to non-existent. After all, if the currency pair is already making new highs and new lows - the trader would be too late to trade the breakout. The range probably wouldn't be operative in that condition either since price has been repeatedly setting new levels of support and/or resistance.\n\nThe 3 primary market conditions; Created with Marketscope\n\nFor those traders looking to employ trending strategies, they usually want to buy up-trends cheaply - or sell down-trends expensive.\n\nUse the 'Longer' Time Frame in the Analysis to Grade the Trend\n\nAs we looked at in The Time Frames of Trading, traders will often employ multiple time-frames in their analysis in an effort to get a 'bigger picture' view of the market they are trading.\n\nUsing multiple time-frames gives the trader the advantage of taking a step back to get a bids-eye-view of the market, and that is precisely what the longer of the two time-frames employed can do.\n\nThe longer time-frame can provide this 'big-picture-view' so that when we dial down to the shorter timeframe to plot our trade, we know what the general market environment has been doing.\n\nCreated with Marketscope/Trading Station\n\nAs we discussed in The Time Frames of Trading, traders can use longer time-frames to grade trends. The table below lists some suggested multi-timeframe setups. So, as you see below, if you are using the hourly chart to enter trades, the 4-hour chart may offer an analysis of the trend. If you are using the 4 hour chart to place trades, the Daily chart will often offer this same type of information.\n\nMultiple Time-Frame Analysis Intervals; prepared by James Stanley\n\nGrading Trends\n\nThere are quite a few ways to grade trends, and many of those ways have pros and cons. One of the more popular indicators for grading trends is the 200 period Simple Moving Average, which is often considered to be one of the more common technical indicators in usage today.\n\nThe 200 period moving average is plotted on the chart, and traders will often consider the trend to be up if price is trading above the 200; while considering the trend to be 'down' while price is trading below the 200 period Moving Average.\n\nCreated with Marketscope/Trading Station\n\nIn the chart above, you can see one of the primary benefits of this type of analysis: It's simple. A trader merely needs to observe prices location to a moving average to say that the trend is up or down.\n\nBut this type of analysis may not offer us what we want, which is to focus on and analyze 'trends,' with an idea for how 'strong' the trend may have been.\n\nAs a matter of fact, this type of analysis may even be misleading. Let's take a closer look at the portion of the chart above that we had denoted as the 'up-trend.'\n\nCreated with Marketscope/Trading Station\n\nAs you can see, the 200 period Simple Moving Average will not always be able to offer valid trend analysis. The same can be said for all other moving averages as well, because, quite simply, any moving average is going to be lagging the market (since moving averages are built on past prices).\n\nSince most indicators are lagging the markets, many traders have then attempted to grade trends as simplistically as possible; under the presumption that stripping away indicators from the analysis may provide more-timely trend-identification, by using only current price to analyze momentum. The concept of Price Action analyzes at individual candles without the necessity of indicators.\n\nIn An Introduction to Price Action we looked at a common way that traders can grade trends without any indicators at all.\n\nDuring up-trends, price will often make successive 'higher-highs,' while also printing 'higher-lows.' The chart below will illustrate in more detail:\n\nCreated with Marketscope/Trading Station\n\nAnd, on the flip-side, down-trends will often show 'lower-lows' and 'lower-highs.'\n\nCreated with Marketscope/Trading Station\n\nMatch the Approach to the Environment\n\nWhile this may sound intuitive and simple, in practice it is more difficult.\n\nIf one is witnessing (on the longer-term chart) a succession of higher-highs and higher-lows; or repeated lower-lows and lower-highs - then we are seeing a trend.\n\nThis trend may have developed for any number of reasons, but traders will generally want to look to employ the age-old mantra of 'buy-low,' and 'sell-high' in these environments.\n\nCreated with Marketscope/Trading Station\n\nWhile the market may move from a trending environment to a ranging environment, money management can usually be used to help mitigate the losses that may occur. If a trader is looking to buy an uptrend, and enters at a 'low' price around support - placing a stop underneath that support; a quick change of condition into a range (thereby pulling price lower) - would only expose the trader to their tight stop underneath support.\n\nIf, however, the market is ranging - traders can take a different approach as there are now 2 possibilities that may take place.\n\nThe range holds - and price stays bound within support and resistance.\n\nThe range breaks - and support/resistance yield to an extended move.\n\nCreated with Marketscope/Trading Station\n\nNeither of these can be easily predicted - which is why traders need to strategize their approach when trading range-bound markets; deciding before-hand whether or not they want to look for breaks of support and resistance (and thus placing entry orders around these levels), or a continuation of range-bound prices.\n\n--- Written by James B.

      "text": "Dilemma Strategy\n\nMost of you have probably already thought of something like this before but I'll share it anyway because this method has an amazing success rate. The logic behind my \"Dilemma Strategy\" is that when the price reaches a strong support or a strong resistance level, it usually tries to break it and it doesn't matter whether or not it succeeds because it is the trying that I'm gonna take advantage of.\n\nI have only tried this strategy on USD/JPY, EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY so I can't speak for rest of the pairs.\n\nOK, now spot supports and resistances in the 4h chart.\n\nWhen the price reaches one of these levels, buy and sell your pair. That's right. You have to create two opposite orders at the same rate.\n\nFor each of those orders, TP = +20 pips, SL = -90 pips. You might get to extend the TP to 30-35 pips if you're monitoring your trade.\n\nThat's it.\n\nIn case you're a money management freak wondering, \"Hey, I'll lose the money I made in 5 successful trades in just one bad trade,\" well, yeah, you will but I found out the probability of success to be 7/8 and that is why I decided to post it here.\n\nbut wouldn't you be loosing money on one at the same time you are making money on the other? Wouldnt the two orders offset like a hedge?\n\nWhen the price is trying to break a support or a resistance level, it will usually oscillate above and below that level for some time before finally deciding its direction. The oscillation about this level, which is your entry level, will make you profit on both trades because the price is moving in both directions. The 90 pip SL ensures that none of your trades gets stopped out in the middle of one of these oscillations.\n\nI still don't get it. if you have two opposite trades and price is just bouncing back and forth between them, doesn't it just balance out to zero gain?\n\nHe has a large stop loss on both ends. Let's say you have two open. Price moves to hit on profit target, and he's then assuming it's going to bounce back and knock out the other profit target. All this done without hitting the stop loss.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't trade a method like this. However, that does not curb my interest in how it fared after 100 trades.\n\nI still don't get it. if you have two opposite trades and price is just bouncing back and forth between them, doesn't it just balance out to zero gain?\n\nTake a look at GBP/JPY 4h and 1h charts. It touched the 143.53 resistance a few hours ago, right? If you opened two positions at 143.53 - one long and one short - and used that 20 pip TP and 90 pip SL, you would have made 40 pips now because since the price touched that level, it's been oscillating. Get it?\n\nok, I get it, you've got a take profit. so if that gets hit youve got profit on that trade. But the other trade is still open. so now you only have one trade open so do you open another one so you still have two open ? so you can continue catching the oscilations back and forth?"

      "text": "Selling a contract\n\nThis is a discussion on Selling a contract within the Commodities forums, part of the Trading Choices category; Just trying to educate myself on futures and i understand most concepts however there is one issue i wish to ...\n\nJust trying to educate myself on futures and i understand most concepts however there is one issue i wish to clarify upon I am unsure how this person creates the contract to sell, it appears to have just been created out of thin air is this correct:\n\n\"Let's say that Sara did some research and came to the conclusion that the price of oil was going to decline over the next six months. She could sell a contract today, in November, at the current higher price, and buy it back within the next six months after the price has declined. This strategy is called going short and is used when speculators take advantage of a declining market.\n\nSuppose that, with an initial margin deposit of $3,000, Sara sold one May crude oil contract (one contract is equivalent to 1,000 barrels) at $25 per barrel, for a total value of $25,000.\n\nBy March, the price of oil had reached $20 per barrel and Sara felt it was time to cash in on her profits. As such, she bought back the contract which was valued at $20,000. By going short, Sara made a profit of $5,000! But again, if Sara's research had not been thorough, and she had made a different decision, her strategy could have ended in a big loss.\"\n\nSorry if this seems particularly simple. I am clear on buying various contracts with reference to predicted price rises or falls, but am unsure how i would instigate a sale of a contract of this or any sort without owning something already and if this is even possible for an individual to do?\n\nWhen you \"sell\" (go short), you have not actually sold anything...yet. Likewise, when you \"buy\" (go long), you have not bought anything...yet. What you have done is enter into a contract to sell or buy by the time the contract (March Crude, for example) goes off the board. That margin you put up when entering a contract (position) is not money to purchase. Think of it as a security deposit. When you exit that position, that's when the purchase/sell money changes hands.\n\nNow, shorting:\nIt workskinda like this:\n\n(There's no margin involved here, because we're not going through a broker. This is personal. Just between you and me.)\n\n(You're about to go short one May Gun Cabinet)\nME: Hey, Tom, I'm looking for an oak gun cabinet. You wouldn't happen to have one you would sell me, would you?\n\nYOU: Gun cabinet?! No, I sure don't. Sorry.\n\nME: Darn. I really want one. I'd pay 1,000 $mackeroo$ for one. I really need it by May 11th.\n\nYou've just entered into a contract to sell me a gun cabinet by May 11th. But you really don't have one. You're short a gun cabinet. You're short one May Gun Cabinet at $1,000.00.\n\nBut that light in your head was the idea to go to a yard sale or sumthin' and pick one up for a lot less than a thousand bucks. (Hopefully you will find one for less than a thou, else you lose money on the deal.\n\nWell, you find one for 50, sell it to me for a thousand, you make 950. Except in the futures market, both parts of that deal go down simultaniously. Oh, yeah: and you hafta pay somebody a commission. And in the futures market, you get that margin (deposit) back.\n\nbut am unsure how I would instigate a sale of a contract of this or any sort without owning something already and if this is even possible for an individual to do?\n\nGene is completely correct about this. You see what you appear to be forgetting is the time element. You are selling it for future delivery. As long as you have it when it is due there is no problem, future delivery. Short selling brings with it an obligation to deliver in the future, to sell before you buy.\n\nSimply each transaction has a buy and a sell. When you remove the linear time progression, what difference does it make if you buy before you sell, or sell before you buy. All the elements of a transaction still occur. A buyer and a seller make an agreement for consideration.\n\nAlso remember that most contracts are never held to expiration for delivery. Only hedgers who deal in the underlying assets will actually want to take delivery (baker) or make delivery (farmer) on the contract. The vast majority of futures contracts are offset (closed out) well before expiration.\n\nAs a speculator, you can buy one contract and sell one later and you are flat (out of the market.) Or you can sell one and then buy it back and end up in the exact same place (flat the market.)\n\nSo it does not matter if you buy or sell first, so long as you later offset an equal position with the exact opposite trade to your opening position."

      "text": "Blog Archives\n\nThe put call ratio can be used to measure market sentiment. It is frequently used as a contrarian indicator. The way it's calculated is very simple it's just the number of puts traded divided by the number of calls traded. You'll see it quoted a couple of different ways, one is the open interest or OI ratio and the other is volume or VOL. The OI ratio uses the open interest on the option contract and the VOL measure uses the volume over a given time frame.\n\nThe dollar weighted put-call ratio is the sum of the put volume times the put price divided by the sum of the call volume times the call price.\n\nContrarians use the put call ratio under the assumption that the public is usually wrong. So when the public is buying a lot of calls, they'll short the stock and when the public is buying a lot of puts, they'll buy the stock.\n\nAs with any strategy it won't work 100% of the time and there have been many times when there has been heavy call buying on a stock and the stock ends up getting taken over. A takeover candidate is not a suitable short sell candidate.\n\nBelow is a chart of the AGG ETF as of 11-9-2012, the IShares Core Total US Bond Index. The red line below shows the put call OI ratio at 226.00.\n\nNot true, the use of options has become more widely accepted over the last several years. Today's modern retail brokerage platforms and tight option spreads put individual investors on the same playing field as the pros. It has been shown in numerous studies that using options can enhance return and lower risk in your portfolio.\n\n#2- Options should only be used in an IRA or tax deferred account\n\nSome people think that due to possible high turnover from using options can create a tax headache. That also is not true. Options can be bought or sold long term and the portfolio turnover is something that can be controlled. Today's tax reporting software make it very simple to report even if you do have high turnover, like from a strategy of selling covered calls on a monthly basis. The IRS will allow an investor to attach a realized gain/loss statement from a brokerage instead of completing the schedule.\n\n#3- Individual investors get taken advantage of in trade execution\n\nIn the old days the market makers controlled the game and the bid ask spreads were wide. Today's electronic markets are very efficient and competitive. Many issues now trade in penny increments. Investors no longer get taken advantage of by the market makers.\n\n#4- Option trading only works when markets are volatile\n\nOptions can help enhance the return on your portfolio regardless of whether the volatility is high or low. There are different strategies that can be used to profit or protect your portfolio when the volatility is rising or when the volatility is falling.\n\n#5- Option trading is not for young investors\n\nSome people say that option trading is good only for highly sophisticated investors with years of experience and a high net worth. That is another misconception that is not true at all. Younger investors with a growth objective may want to purchase long term options on the market or an individual stock to participate in the upside of the market, but limit their downside risk to the amount of the premium paid for the option.\n\n#6- The trades are hard to execute and require experience\n\nAnother common falsehood, today's modern platforms and options chains make it quite simple to enter trades with very little room for trade errors. It only requires a little learning to be able to execute option trades.\n\n#7- Brokerages that are good for options are not suitable for equities or ETFs\n\nNot true, today the main stream brokers all have pretty good option platforms and the firms that specialize in options also have some very good platforms for stocks and ETFs.\n\n#8- You need to spend a lot of time and money on options trading education\n\nThat's another one that may have been true at one time, but does not apply anymore. Most of the brokerages have some good educational materials. The Options industry Council, OIC, has some excellent free education on their website. The Chicago Board Options Exchange, CBOE, also has a wealth of free information. There are many books worth studying as well.\n\n#9- Options traders are greedy short term speculators\n\nNothing could be further from the truth. Options can be employed by long term investors to reduce risk and produce income. Cash secured puts can be sold to target an entry price on a stock or ETF for a long term hold and the returns can be favorable. Covered calls can be used for income generation in today's record low interest rate environment.\n\n#10- Options trading popularity will die off\n\nThe volume in options trading has been expanding recently. The ETF explosion has led to more and more options volume. The use of options is becoming more widely accepted than ever and will continue to increase.\n\nOne of the keys to success in trading options or in using options to enhance return on a portfolio is have some flexibility in your strategy selection so you can adapt to rapidly changing market conditions. I have talked with many traders over the years that have a strategy bias and they get good results for awhile only to eventually experience a period where they have heavy losses and have a substantial drawdown of capital.\n\nWhat strategy bias means is that is that the trader will learn one strategy and use it on a regular basis regardless of market conditions. A strategy like the iron condor is a good example. People learn about the iron condor, understand that it can have a high probability of success, but may not have much experience with dynamic delta hedging and learn the hard way that iron condors also have a poor risk/reward ratio.\n\nThe market goes through cycles knows as \"regime changes\" where the market moves from a period of relative quiet, through a period of high volatility. Iron condor traders can have losses when the market moves from low volatility to high volatility. In 2008 when the volatility spiked to extreme levels iron condor positions would have hit their maximum loss.\n\nIf you are forecasting rising volatility, you'd want to consider trade like a long straddle. Long straddles can be effective when there is a know event approaching that could move the market. On Thursday May 31st the SPY closed at $131.47. The monthly jobs report was released pre-market on Friday June 1st and the SPY opened at $129.41 and hit a low of $128.16. A long straddle bought before the close on Thursday could have produced some nice profits and we knew the jobs report was coming. An iron condor held through that would have had an adverse movement.\n\nTo be successful over time, master several different strategies and learn how to employ them in changing market conditions.\n\nDynamic delta hedging is a term used for adjusting the delta of an option position due to price changes in the underlying security. One of the beauties and challenges of options trading is that there are so many different combinations to consider for any market outlook. Say you're an income oriented investor and you have just established a delta neutral iron condor. In order to receive the maximum profit, you want the underlying security to stay between the two strikes and the entire position to expire worthless. As the stock or ETF begins to move your position will start taking on delta. The gamma of your position is the rate of change of the delta. If you were delta neutral when the position was initiated, check your gamma, the gamma is how much the delta will move with a one point move in the underlying. By knowing the gamma you can be prepared to make adjustments to your position to remain delta neutral. Complex positions that have a high positive theta will also have short gamma, meaning that you have to be prepared to adjust according to price movement in the underlying. In the case of a delta neutral iron condor, if the underlying makes an upward price move you have the choice of adding some long calls, more short puts or some long shares of the underlying stock. If it makes a downward move, you can add long puts, short calls or short some of the stock. Instead of just adding you can also look to reduce some contracts, so in the case of an upward move you'd want to buy back some of the short calls, or in the case of a downward move you could buy back some of the short puts, or you could consider any combination of the above.\n\nOne thing that you need to consider is how often you want to adjust, do want to check your position daily or several times during the trading day? Another consideration is how you choose to define delta neutral. Of course the strict definition is that delta neutral means zero deltas, however when it comes to trading you should establish a guideline so that you'll allow some flexibility. It's impossible to stay at exactly zero, so a good rule of thumb might be to say that you'll allow a range of plus or minus 50 deltas. Allow the position to range from -50 deltas to +50 deltas and don't make any adjustments until those levels are exceeded.\n\nThe final consideration is how to make the adjustments and that is where the fun comes in. Because there are so many different possibilities to evaluate for each position, it is wisest to use an expected return calculator and see which adjustments have the best mathematical expectancy. Remember if you want to add delta and want to add to the position you can buy stock, buy calls or sell puts. If you want to subtract delta and want to add to the position you can buy puts, sell calls or short stock. You can also adjust delta by closing out part of the existing position. Evaluating all of the possibilities is what makes options trading so flexible and challenging.\n\nOne of the advantages of trading options is their virtually unlimited flexibility. For any strategy or position considered there are numerous possibilities. If one is to consider all of the different strike prices and expirations to choose from the universe is huge. Now consider for a moment that for every option position there also exists a synthetic equivalent.\n\nSay for example that you are considering purchasing a long call. Hypothetically, there are ten strikes for that option and also ten different expirations that could be used. That means that there are 100 different call options to evaluate to see what fits your market prognosis the best.\n\nNow consider that there is also a synthetic equivalent to a long call. The equivalent is long stock plus a long put. There is only one long stock position to consider, but hypothetically assume that there are also ten strikes and ten expirations to consider for the long put. That means that in addition to the 100 call options to evaluate, you can also evaluate 100 long put positions to combine with the long stock. So now you have 200 different positions to consider.\n\nThat's the beauty of using options, the possibilities are virtually unlimited and there is is no limit to the amount of creative thinking that can be applied.\n\nRemember for each position there exists a synthetic equivalent. Here's a table of the basic ones.\n\nLong Stock = Long Call + Short Put\n\nShort Put = Long Stock + Short Call\n\nLong Put = Short Stock + Long Call\n\nLong Call = Long Stock + Long Put\n\nShort Call = Short Stock + Short Put\n\nShort Stock = Long Put + Short Call\n\nSince there are many complex option strategies to use, it makes sense that a synthetic equivalent could be used for any of the legs of a normal option strategy if it is advantageous.\n\nThe iron condor is a defined risk market neutral strategy. It is composed of a bull put spread and a bear call spread put on for a net credit. The risk is defined as the distance between one of the spreads minus the credit received. The investor hopes that the underlying market will stay between the two short strikes and the net credit will be collected as profit. This can be a good income strategy. It can have a high probability of success depending on the width of the condor or how far the short strikes are from the underlying. It can also have a poor risk reward ratio depending on the distance between the short and long strikes on the call and put spreads. The closer the strike prices are together, the less risk there is, but you'll also receive less credit for the overall position.\n\nLet's look at an actual example as of the time of this writing. The SPY closed at 137.57. If you had the market opinion that the SPY would not rise by more than $4.43 or fall by more than $5.57 by expiration, you could consider selling an iron condor that would consist of 1 short SPY 132 put, 1 short 142 SPY call, 1 long SPY 145 call and 1 long SPY 129 put. The net credit using the current bid/ask prices and by going out 41 days in time would be $88 for each condor. The risk would be defined as the distance between a spread and the net credit or $212. Volatility is low now so the option prices are not real high. You can get more credit by widening the distance between the spreads, but then there is also more risk. For example is you decided to use a 4 point spread, it would be for a net credit of $104, but now the risk would be $296.\n\nUsing the standard deviation is a good way to determine where to place the spread, it can be calculated so that there is a low probability that the underlying will move far enough against you, but you'll also have the long positions there for the absolute risk control.\n\nThe iron condor can be applied when you think that volatility is high and you believe it will fall. If the implied volatility is high in the current month and lower in the farther out months, a calendar spread might make more sense.\n\nThe covered call is probably the most popular option strategy used today. It is very simple. Most investors tend to be long stocks and the idea of writing a call option, collecting some premium and being willing to accept a higher price for your underlying equity position appeals to many investors. Covered calls can provide some decent income and limited downside protection while you are waiting for your stock to appreciate to your desired exit price.\n\nThe married put is similarly another simple option play that is very common. With a married put, the investor will purchase a stock or an ETF then buy a put for insurance to protect the downside. With a married put the risk is limited and the upside reward in theoretically unlimited.\n\nThe covered put is not commonly used at all, yet can be a good strategy. Most investors don't short stocks, so it is not nearly as common as the two strategies mentioned above. The covered put is just about the opposite of the covered call. The investor will identify a stock or ETF that he thinks has topped out and believes that it's time for a short position. The stock is sold short and then a put option is sold on that position at a price point that the investor will be happy to buy the stock back. The profits to the downside are limited to the strike price selected and the premium received for the sale of the put. Just like a covered call there is risk to adverse price movement in the underlying, but now it is to the upside.\n\nSo, if you think that ABC stock won't go any higher, you could short ABC say at $25. Then you could sell a $20 put say for $1. If ABC goes below $20 you'll get assigned, buy the stock back at $20 and close out your position for a $6 profit. The percent return that you'd receive depends on the margin rate that you get from your broker.\n\nShorting stocks isn't for everybody, but the covered put can be a viable strategy. As always it's wise to do some thorough research and avoid stocks that could be potential takeover candidates or that could experience rapid price appreciation for some other reason like a new product announcement, lawsuit getting settled etc. Investors who rely on technical analysis alone should review the fundamentals to see if there are issues like that pending that could impact the price.\n\nThe uncovered or naked put is sold when an investor wants to produce income and is willing to accumulate shares of stock. The key difference between an investor and a speculator when it comes to naked put selling is that the investor is targeting a stock or ETF for a long term buy and has set a price that he is willing to purchase that stock at. The speculator is trying to profit by selling the put and hopes it will either expire worthless or he can buy it back later for a profit. The investor is satisfied with either outcome having the put expire worthless or getting assigned and purchasing the underlying shares at pre-determined price. Income is produced by selling out of the money put options at a price lower than the current price of a stock, when the investor would be willing to buy the stock at that price. For example, if XYZ stock is trading at $25, the investor is willing to purchase XYZ at $20. Therefore, she sells a $20 put for $1. If the stock stays above $20, the investor retains premium. If the stock goes below $20, it will be put to the investor at $20. However, the investor already has collected $1 in premium so her cost basis is $19. There are many sources that consider naked put selling to be a risky strategy. However, selling an uncovered put is not as risky as outright stock ownership. If an investor owns a stock that goes to 0, like General Motors, the investor has a total loss. If the same investor sold a put and was assigned on that put to purchase those GM shares, the investor would have retained the put premium even though the shares eventually went to zero. Naked put selling is riskier to the brokerage house because they fear that the investor may not meet the margin call if shares are put to her. If the investor utilizes proper position sizing relative to her portfolio and is using the strategy for stock accumulation uncovered put selling is not a high risk strategy and in fact has the same risk profile as the covered call strategy which is generally considered to be low risk. When stock prices decline, implied volatility has a tendency to rise making the options more expensive. If you're targeting an entry price for a stock and see it decline rapidly, check the option quotes for a rise in the implied volatility and high prices for out of the money puts. When bad news comes out on a stock that you want to own, that can be a good time for selling out of the money puts. Say you're willing to accumulate 1000 shares of XYZ over time. You could sell 10 out of the money puts and wait for the shares to get put to you or you could use a fraction of the total, say 2 puts per month and repeat the process until you've accumulated the full 1000 shares. When selling naked puts we target investments to accumulate, a price below the current market that we're willing to buy them at and try to find puts that are relatively expensive. If you're accumulating shares of a stock, puts will have a tendency to be priced high every quarter prior to the earnings release. This can create an opportunity for the put seller as the implied volatility rises to account for a substantial move in the stock. Out of the money puts can have a higher price at this time and provide an attractive entry point. For investors wishing to accumulate shares in a commodity based ETF such as USO, the oil ETF, the volatility can be higher before the weekly release of the petroleum report. Stock index ETFs can have higher implied volatility prior to major releases of\neconomic data like the monthly employment numbers or scheduled Federal Reserve meetings. When selling a put you can use the delta to approximate the probability of getting assigned at expiration. An at the money put will have a 50 delta, so if you sell an at the money put you have a 50/50 chance of ending up owning the shares. The at the money puts also have a relatively high premium and will have high theta. As the puts move out of the money the delta is lower so the probability of getting assigned also gets lower as you move out of the money. If you sell 20 delta puts the premium may not be that high, but you'll only get assigned 20% of the time and your entry price into the underlying will be substantially below the current market price. If you are targeting individual equities with this strategy, you will only get assigned when the stock drops significantly, and you may decide you don't want to own that stock anymore. It's very critical to be sure you're willing to purchase a stock when selling puts. When the strategy is used to accumulate ETF shares in a broad based index like the S&P 500 for example, by selling far out of the money puts on the index, you'll only buy shares on dips and it can be a good dollar cost averaging strategy for share accumulation in an index fund."

If you want to learn further about the stock market, seek the advice of experts and trade pundits. They can make you gain insightful knowledge on the stock market. Let us move towards what a stock market is as we proceed to learn about the stock market.\n\nA stock market or stock exchange is the common place where the share of ownership of several public limited companies are bought and sold by everyone including the common man, investors, institutional investors, foreign investment agencies and amateur investors. Anyone can be part of any stock exchange or stock market. Buying a stock means that you are buying a part of the ownership of a company which are sold in units as specific number of shares.\n\nEach unit of share costs you a certain amount of dollars. This price of a share is neither constant nor fixed. The price of each company's share is determined by several factors including the climate, if it has to do something with the product or the kind of service offered by the company. Then, when the price of a particular share increases, you earn profit through the difference between the price that you purchased the share and the price in which you sold it.\n\nIt is like price in which you sold the share minus the price in which it is bought. If you sell those shares when the price is low, again the price in which you sold the share minus the price in which you bought the share gives you a negative result. This means that you have lost the amount that is derived from the figure shown through the subtraction."

      "text": "Watch stocks you care about\n\nAfter two years of rallying stocks, it's hard to find true bargains in the stock market. Rather than jumping in at any price, value investors prefer to wait for inevitable corrections to pick up stocks on the cheap.\n\nBut as disciplined investors know, sometimes you can wait a long time for a bull market to give way. Fortunately, if you're willing to commit to buying a stock at a discount price, there's a way you can get paid while you wait for stock prices to get more reasonable.\n\nBut another options strategy is designed to let you establish the price you want to pay for a stock. By selling put options, you can pick up bargains if they come while getting paid no matter what happens.\n\nHere's how it works. When you sell a put option, you give the put buyer the right to sell shares of stock to you for the price you agree upon. In exchange for committing to buy those shares if the put buyer exercises the option, you receive a premium. That premium is yours to keep, regardless of what the put buyer decides to do.\n\nAn easy strategy In other words, you're taking advantage of the fact that other investors want to buy put options as protection against a downturn. Conversely, you want that downturn to happen so you can pick up shares on the cheap. So to make the most of the strategy, here's a simple three-step plan:\n\nSo how do you identify good stock prospects? As I did yesterday, one choice is to turn to our Motley Fool CAPS service, this time searching for top-rated five-star stocks that have gained at least 40% in the past year. Here are some of the stocks that pass the test, along with how much you'd receive for selling a put option at a price around 25% lower than where the stock currently trades:\n\nCommitting to buying these stocks at a 25% discount to their current price any time during the next three to nine months or so can earn you between 1% to 3% of the current share price. If the stock stays above your target price, then you simply keep the money you earned from selling the put option. On the other hand, if the stock drops enough, then you'll get to pick up shares at your desired price -- plus keep the option premium as your free bonus.\n\nWhat's the catch? The danger here is that you have to be absolutely certain you'd want to buy the shares after a drop, no matter what caused prices to fall. That may sound fine now, but if a company-specific piece of news is responsible for your target company's stock tanking, then you might not be as optimistic about the company's future prospects as you were before the news came out.\n\nThat's why it's important to pick stocks you'd be happy to own no matter what. That way, the cash you receive from selling the put option is just icing on the cake -- what you're really hoping for is a pullback big enough to get a nice bargain.\n\nUse all your options I hope you've enjoyed this weeklong series on options. Options are scary to many investors, but once you understand them, they can help you broaden your comfort level in your investing and take advantage of opportunities that those who stick with stocks and mutual funds can't use. That alone makes learning about options worth the effort.\n\nIf you're interested in following any of these stocks as potential bargains, add them toyour watchlist. Don't have one?

Several centuries ago in\nthe corn markets of England and the rice markets\nof Japan traders developed a method of recording\ntransactions that would enable them to see at a\nglance how much people had been paying for the\nproduct.

      "text": "I've been working on some multi-instrument indicators and strategies, and I have a suggestion for how to make writing them dramatically easier.\n\nIt's conceptually easy to write a multi-instrument indicator or strategy. In practice, it's pretty hard to make one that's robust, especially in the face of missing data bars.\n\nIt would be fairly easy if Closes[0][x] and Closes[1][x] always referred to the same time & date (for bars of the same time frame). But if either bar series is missing a bar, they don't, they refer to different times or dates. There are a lot of stocks etc. that sometimes have no trades over a 1-minute or 5-minute or longer periods. I've even seen stocks that got out of sync on daily bars.\n\nIt's quite a pain to write code that produces good results when bars are missing, but it can be done, and right now it must be done or you will sometimes have garbage for output.\n\nThere's a fairly simple solution that I'd like to suggest:\n\nFor indicators or strategies which have more than one bar series with the same time frame, you should have the option (settable in Initialize(), defaulting to On) to keep all bars in sync, by ignoring data unless all bar series of that time frame have data. If one bar series is missing a bar, throw away the bars of the other series even if they are present.\n\nThis would make it dramatically easier to write robust multi-instrument indicators and strategies. If programmers could be sure that Closes[0][x] and Closes[1][x] always referred to the same time/date, a whole lot of code/development time/debugging/testing/risk/learning curve/ goes away.\n\nI expect that it won't really be very hard for you to implement. When processing incoming bars from realtime or from history, just throw away any bars for a time frame if there are any missing bars from that time frame. While it may sound wrong at first to throw away data, in a multi-instrument environment you really don't want the data from one instrument unless you have data from the other(s), and it's a whole lot of work to filter it out at the indicator/strategy level.\n\nI think this goes back to the idea of being able to easily plot spreads, which is a huge weakness on NT right now. I can understand that coding an autospreader that would work with all supported brokers would be a challange, but being able to plot a spread on a chart between two time series needs to be more intuitive than it is now.\n\nFor a spread, you only need to refer to the current bar [0], and if one bar is missing, then [0] refers to the most recent bar, which is a reasonable thing to do for a spread.\n\nFor indicators that refer back in time (i.e. correlation), it gets much harder, because only certain [x] bars will have a time-synchronized [y] bar in the other series, and x != y. I now know how to deal with it, but it's just way too hard, and it really doesn't have to be.\n\nKev call me an idiot (I've been called worse!) but I couldn't get that indicator to plot a line in NT7B5. Can you post a screen shot on your indicator and chart settings for say, CL 01-10 (5Min) and CL 02-10 (5Min) so I can see what I'm doing wrong? Thanks.\n\nCorrellation, Cointegration, etc are probably best done using other tools outside NT but it might be nice to use NT as a database. Calling NT7 data into Matlab or R without an intermediate Excel or CSV thing would be cool.\n\nThank you for the suggestion Kevin, but bar objects are independent of each other. We can't just throw out data. Let us say you are running 1 minute bars. If instrument A is a very liquid instrument and B is not so much. Just because B hasn't received any ticks yet for the new minute, we can't negate all of the ticks coming in for instrument A. What happens when B gets a tick 30 seconds into the minute. Then those first 30 seconds of A ticks is gone. Even if we didn't throw them out and just showed them when B updated, it would be extremely delayed and that wouldn't work well either.\n\nJosh, If I am processing 1-Minute bars (with calculate on bar close = true) for 2 instruments, then at the close of the minute, if one of the instruments hasn't received any ticks, in most cases I don't want to see the bar for the other one.\n\nIt's quite complicated to write reliable code that can reference back in time, if Closes[0][x] and Closes[1][x] might refer to different dates/times. You could make NT7 much better for multi-instrument work if you could come up with a way to make [x] always refer to the same date/time for bars of the same timeframe. I'd be fine with throwing away unsynchronized bars, but if that's impractical I encourage you to think of an alternative.\n\nMy spread indicator works with CL 01-10 & CL 02-10; for Symbol2 you need to specify \"CL 02-10\", and I changed the quantities to .001/-.001 to undo the contract multiplier (with +1/-1 it would plot the spread of the full contract value).\n\nI made a revision (attached) to allow non-integer quantities, and to display the contract expiry in the indicator label."

BSZ is a binary ticker for S&P500 which can correlate to Nasdaq, also BSZ only has monthly options, so timing to get the cheapest binaries can be impractical for this strategy, and the strike prices are too few)\n\nAre there comprehensive analyses of theta decay in weekly options? my question is what does the theta decay look like on a graph.

      "text": "Hi, If the sell rule evaluates to true (1), the sim/port will sell the stock at rebalance. A sell rule of 1 is always true so all stocks are always sold at rebalance. Same as rank > 101 which has often been used.\n\nEveryone except computer programmers (and academic logicians) will be confused by what \"1\" means as a sell rule. \"1\" is how a computer records \"true\" in its numerical notation. Putting \"1\" in a sell rule is a very quick way to tell the computers at P123 that you want to sell ALL the stocks in a simulation or portfolio.\n\nIn particular, \"1\" does not mean \"rank > 1\" although both would have the same effect, namely selling all the stocks (unless a stock had a rank of 1).\n\n\"1\" by itself is often used by P123 users who have a knowledge of computer programming when they want to force P123 to sell all stocks.\n\nAnother common way to force the sale of all stocks is to write a sell rule that will be \"true\" for every stock. A favorite one is \"rank < 101\" which will be true for all stocks because the highest possible rank is 100. A rule like \"rank < 150\" would work just as well. Another rule that will always be true would be \"close(0) < 10000000000\" since no stocks that I know of have a price greater than 10 million per share. Other P123 users get creative by putting in a sell rule that does not refer to anything to do with a stock. For example, \"2=2\" is always true so the computer records that as a \"1\" and will thus sell all the stocks. One could also use \"3 < 5\" since this is always \"true\". Some p123 do not bother writing a comparison rule at all and and just put \"1\" in the sell rule.\n\nSo \"1\" as a sell rule does not refer to anything about the stock at all. It is just one of a thousand ways a user can tell P123 to sell all stocks.\n\nSpeaking for myself it is useful in establishing a \"baseline\" when developing Sell rules. The rule \"1\" sells everything at each rebalance. You can then proceed to try various other sell rules and compare the performance and turnover with this. I don't expect you'd see the rule used much in real world trading\n\nthe interpretation 0 and 1 in this case is not quite the same as \"false\" and \"true\" because p123 will accept numbers inbetween, and regard them as \"partial sales\". E.g. 0.5 means \"sell half the position\". So the number means how much of the position is sold, ranging from 0 (sell nothing) to 1 (sell everything). Logical test expressions will either return 0 or 1 corresponding to true or false, but it is possible to engineer expressions that return some other number, e.g. useful for trimming positions if they become overweight."

In selling these shares, the bank takes a short position in the stock, by selling shares it doesn't yet own. If the bank were doing this as a \"naked short\"--selling shares it didn't have a right to buy later at a specific price--the bank would be taking huge risk: The stock might go up, forcing the bank to buy back stock to cover its short at a much higher price. But the \"overallotment option\" allows the bank to buy another 15% of shares from the company at the IPO price, thus allowing it to sell additional stock on the IPO without taking the risk that the stock might go up.\nImportantly, the bank gets paid its full IPO commission on the extra shares it sells if exercises its option, so it has an incentive to sell them regardless of how much excess demand there is. And there's no risk to the bank if the stock price jumps, because the bank can cover its short buy buying the stock back at the IPO price.\n\nAnd if the stock drops after the IPO?\n\nWell, then the bank really cashes in.\n\nBecause then the bank makes money from:\n\n- IPO commissions\n- And proceeds from shorting the stock at the IPO price and then buying it back at a lower price.\n\nAnd that's just what happened with Facebook.\n\nWith Facebook, we all remember, the underwriters \"supported\" the stock for the first day, helping it close just above the IPO price. Then the underwriters gave up on supporting it. And the stock has traded pretty much straight down from there.\nAnd at some point, shortly after the IPO, the underwriters covered the short position they established by \"over-allotting\" Facebook stock on the IPO...and they covered at a lower price."

The difference is reflected on a chart over a period of time, along with the difference of the moving average. An example is shown below.\n\nThe EMAs point to any recent stock price changes.

The move upwards is known as a bullish crossover, while a move downwards is known as a bearish crossover. It is a signal to traders that the trend is about to accelerate in the crossover direction. The histogram is an important aspect of the MACD indicator, as it displays when the crossing happens. It can also help traders to visualize when a crossover is approaching. A zero crossover occurs when there is no difference in the slow and fast EMAs. A zero crossover can indicate that the trend is going to change direction, but it is not a foolproof method of evaluation."

      "text": "Dorothea Lange Dead Ox Kids October 1939 \"The Free children in doorway of their dugout home in Sunday clothes. Dead Ox Flat, Malheur County, Oregon\"\n\nIt's a good time re-visit a concept that I wrote about in late 2010 about market variability and systems failure, in a piece called A Fingerprint of Instability in Biology and Finance. The basic idea is that complex systems with an underlying fractal structure maintain some level of stability through localized and unpredictable variability, or what's frequently referred to as an emergent \"order out of chaos\". We see this dynamic clearly displayed in the cardiovascular system of humans - a healthy and stable heart is characterized by a chaotic beat interval pattern, while the heart of a person in ventricular fibrillation has collapsed into much more regular intervals.\n\nThe piece then described how this \"fingerprint\" has become evident in the realm of finance, focusing on the role played by high-frequency trading (HFT) among fewer and fewer market participants over the last decade in destroying the healthy variability that is characteristic of stable markets. That variability comes primarily from the natural differences in time horizons, asset allocations, investment expectations and trading volume that exist between market participants. The following excerpt briefly describes the \"fractcal markets hypothesis\" and gives an example of why market variability is such a critical aspect of market stability:\n\nRelated to Sornette's work is the \"fractal markets hypothesis\", which has been explained simply and coherently explained by the Australian economist Steve Keen in a slide lecture he produced and made available to the public. [8]. To summarize, this hypothesis suggests that the stock market exhibits deterministic chaos, making the short-term movements of prices extremely impossible to predict.\n\nSimilar to the healthy human heartbeat, the market achieves aggregate stability when investors have variable time horizons and expectations for their investments. In contrast, a speculative bubble is formed when many investors share the same expectations, imitating each other's decisions to buy, and a market crash occurs when they all \"rush for the exit\" at the same time. [Slide 36]\n\nThe reason why variability of time horizons is so important for market stability can be explained with a simple example. Let's compare an average day trader with a five-minute time horizon to an institutional investor (such as a pension fund) with a weekly time horizon from 1992-2002. The average five-minute price change in 1992 was -0.000284% (an overall \"bear market\"), with a standard deviation of 0.05976%. A six standard deviation drop (-.359%) in price during that time period could easily wipe out the day trader's investment if it continues.\n\nThe institutional investor, on the other hand, would consider that drop a buying opportunity since weekly returns over the ten-year period averaged 0.22% with a standard deviation of 2.39%. The relatively large drop for the day trader is basically a non-event for the weekly trader's technical/fundamental outlook, so the latter can buy the dip and provide stabilizing liquidity to the market.[Slides 38-39]\n\nAs the graphs above indicate, it is not just investors' time horizons that have lost most of their variability with the inexorable rise of HFT, but also the differences in the number of stocks traded and the volume of those trades. And the situation has only become worse since that time. From mid-2011 to the first month of 2012 was a period marked by an unprecedented drop in volume for the S&P 500, while European markets have followed similar trends [As the No-Volume Market Churns]. This was also a period of great volatility in markets, with frequent episodes of systemic fear gripping these markets by their throats in the Fall of 2011.\n\nIndeed, U.S. markets finally ended a gut-wrenching 2011 barely changed from where they started the year. The only thing investors gained from the tumultuous market that year was painful whiplash and heartache, as well as the prospect of even more instability in the future. One of the key drivers of this greatly decreased variability in the market over the last few years had been the unabated exodus of the retail investor, who could no longer endure the torture and had completely yielded to robotic traders.\n\nAs the graph from ZeroHedge shows above, U.S. domestic equity mutual funds had an outflow of $3 billion in the week of February 29, the largest in 2012, which brought the total outflows to $66 billion since November 2011. This trend is an important reminder of how market instability does not necessarily equal a market crash or collapse - all of these outflows occurred during a 20% rally in the market from its October lows. The growing instability (decreasing variability) simply weakens the potential for the system as a whole to absorb any triggers of widespread fear when they inevitably arrive.\n\nPeople investing their capital through mutual funds and pension funds have traditionally been the source of variable time horizons, investment sizes and allocations for the equity markets, but they are all but out of the equation now. What's perhaps more interesting is how even the limited variability provided by HFT market participants is now in the process of disappearing, as the robotic traders who can longer compete are weeded out. Boyd Erman speaks to how this issue has rapidly metastasized in Canada for The Globe and Mail:\n\nRetail investors, after gutting it out through years of awful returns, have finally fled. In a normal market, retail participation – Mr. and Mrs. Public trading their personal accounts – should be about 20 per cent. That plunged in November and December, traders say.\n\nProfessional portfolio managers are also sitting on their hands in cash, or moving to fixed-income or alternative investments. Take the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board as an example. In recent years, the pension fund manager has increased its holdings of bonds and what it calls inflation-sensitive assets (roads, bridges and other infrastructure). But its equity portfolio isn't much bigger than it was five years ago.\n\nThere's also the fact that regulation is becoming unfriendly, especially to hedge funds and proprietary traders. The amount of capital that banks can profitably hand to their trading desks to use is in decline.\n\nPerhaps the most likely candidate for the drop-off is a decline in activity by the same high-frequency traders who helped boost volumes so dramatically in the preceding few years, and who now constitute roughly a third of the market by many estimates. So-called HFTs were drawn to Canada by incentives from markets such as the TSX, and by the opportunity to trade against investors big and small who weren't wise to their tricks.\n\nThe market is suddenly tougher for HFTs. Some strategies have become so competitive that they are less profitable, regulation is become steadily tougher on them, and Canadian investors who were easy pickings for HFTs have learned to deploy countermeasures.\n\nIn the past, it has been easy for most people who work outside of finance to be misled by the short-term movement of markets; they see flashes of green in their occasional glimpses of the news and take them as a sign that the economy/markets are healthy and all is well with their portfolio. Since 2008, that perspective has obviously become more difficult to maintain over time, especially for those working within the field of finance and managing money on a daily basis. On top of that, the people (robots) that had become the only source of consistent volume for the markets, high-frequency traders, are now devouring each other.\n\nReturning to the U.S. markets, Peter Chapman for Traders Magazine has also picked up on this underlying trend in the publication's featured story entitled, Fear Factor.\n\n\"Our bread and butter is the retail investor,\" Scott Wren, a senior equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors, one of the country's four largest retail brokerages, told Bloomberg Radio recently. \"They're not jumping into the market. They're not chasing it. Those who have been around for a little bit have been probably burned twice here in the last 10 years or so. They're definitely gun-shy. They're not believers. I'm not sure what it's going to take to get them back in the market.\"\n\nTheir financial advisers aren't sanguine about the U.S. stock market, either. Only 44 percent of them plan to increase their clients' allocations to U.S. stocks this year, according to a recent survey by Investment News. That's down from 63 percent at the start of last year.\n\nPension plans, which own about 20 percent of all U.S. equities, are following individual investors out the door. As a result of the stock market meltdown, both public and private defined benefit plans are underfunded, as their assets have fallen below their liabilities. And because they must earn a return regardless of stock market conditions in order to pay retiree benefits, they are as worried as retail investors.\n\nSo, as noted in my original piece, the natural and variable heartbeat of most equity markets worldwide, and especially in the U.S., has been completely eradicated, leaving the \"brain\" starved of oxygen for much too long. There is no cognition, creativity or conscience left - only the mundane and de-humanized life of patients who are being kept alive by an assortment of machines. However, even the machines are running out of the energy required to keep them powered on, because liquidity is no longer enough for the big money players. The hope of witnessing the market bounce back to a healthy and stable life has been overtaken by the pain and agony of watching it die.\n\nNot all of the oligarchy intends to commit gigadeath by bioweapons or otherwise, some groups are definitely opposed to such crimes. One reason why worse things haven't happened yet is because the humaner groups are resisting the policies of more murderous colleagues. There is a special elitist strain of ecological extremism which may mobilise the non-sociopathic majority of oligarchs in a political platform of planetary depopulation to 'save the planet', whereas the pure psychopath oligarchs, adhering to no ideology, couldn't care less about the earth and only seek depopulation as a tool of control.\n\nI'd like to add that oligarchy is not always criminal, and only some parts interface with the occult. Oligarchy as an organizational substructure revolves around facilitating the hidden financial and commercial dominance of elite groups, but it will resort to openly abusing political and military power to safeguard its position in a contractionary phase, or whenever in danger of becoming obsolete.\n\nWhen oligarchy does degenerate into open criminality and additionally engages parallel command and control structures within occult hierarchies, you'd expect clustered sociopathy running rampant in there. And not all occult hierarchies are criminal or evil, but because the dimensions of their operations are usually well concealed, no legal means of democratic control may restrain organised criminal tendencies or political extremism if such were to appear there.\n\nOverall, I hold the large-scale operation of secret societies to be incompatible with democracy and open civil discourse. If indeed beyond institutional democratic control, the social assimilation of occult value systems must promote conflicting loyalties which dissociate the identity of the citizen as moral actor and reduce initiation to a form of political insanity.\nI do like that part in the mysteries where Gravity is a recursive algorithm. Or is that every part?Thanks in advance.\n\nYour supposition is correct, there are historical reasons I plug in \"Illuminati\" as my most common term for the Global Elite. Mainly I use it because its such a loaded concept and really annoys a lot of people. LOL. However, my definition of Illuminati is a lot broader than just the Elders of Zion or descendants of the Plantaganets etc.\n\nYes also, I pretty quickly grasped that this area is of interest to you, and since I'm writing to grab interest from you and anyone else in coming and visiting with us at DD, I'm tailoring what I write here to do that.\n\nInsofar as providing you with direct Links to other source material, Peter is a lot better at doing that than I am. Of course, we also don't share the same opinions on outcomes here, but he has a great library of source material he has dug up, most of which I have read in the course of arguing with him about the nature of the game here.\n\nFor my part, I write what I refer to as Mr. Peabody History. I work from first principles of Human Behavior and then process all the bits of history I have picked up over many years of reading and spit out my own version of history that I think better fits the facts as they are apparent today then the history we get in textbooks or even in some old source material. My college girlfriend was a massive polyglot who could read Greek and Latin texts in their original form and we spent many nights hashing over the history she read. I refer to here as \"Illuminati Spawn\". LOL. I personally had quite a bit of contact with the Rockefeller family in my youth, since my dad was an apparatchik for Chase Manhattan engaged in making a lot of bad loans to South American countries and acquiring controlling interest in local banks down there in the 1960s.\n\nAnyhow, to answer your question would take a lot of writing here which would be better done on DD, where Peter is more likely to join the discussion. I invite you again to get your butt over there and register and stop LURKING! LOL.\n\nTo leave you thinking, consider this problem. Why do you think we see two different methodologies in play here for monetary collapse, deflation and hyperinflation? IMHO, its because behind the curtain up at the top, you have two different groups which are playing the game. One group would like to retain Dollar hegemony and so would favor a deflation, the other group would like to Hyperinflate it and substitute a new currency. the likely group for retention of the Dollar is the Anglo-American branch of the Illuminati, the HI group is likely led by the Teutonic branch.\n\nBTW, you can directly trace back this dichotomy to two men, both inventors of the Calculus. Sir Isaac Newton on the Brit side, Wilhelm Gottfried Leibniz on the Kraut side. Its because of these two men and their respective discoveries in mathematics that the Brits and the Germans got there first with the application of thermodynamics to the Industrial game. The two men had a bitter battle and both had Egos greater than the size of the known Universe. That battle has never ended.\n\nIrrespective of the reality in your words, love that writing style, should you write any books of quasi-fiction be sure to let us (me) know.\n\nI'm thinking that THEY(???) have everything embedded in words and language, we are born to play out an ancient plot (? Luciferian ?) and it is transmitted subliminally/hypnotically from within both language and popular mythology/history/religion. THEY(???) have no more control over their actions than we do. Consider those ideas for fiction if you so choose.The factions seeking global dictatorship are trying to avoid being identified as the cause of the wars or pandemics, so they cannot proceed too openly. They can only present themselves as solutions to their own dialectic terror, liberators or saviors of the surviving people, if an intercultural memory of their crimes cannot propagate. They'll try to blame the enemy oligarchy of other countries for whatever they unleash domestically.\nHowever, a critical mass of popular awareness has been reached for the first time in recorded history, because of the internet reformation more people than ever before are aware and informed of oligarchical collectivism, and the criminal oligarchy can no longer disguise themselves if they perpetrate gigadeath, too many survivors will know them and hunt them to the ends of the earth.\nThis is their problem now, as aggregate evil is unsustainable, they need to be able to trick the good into compliance by techniques of dialectic deception and fear which are no longer effective.\n\nThe infamous criminal syndicate of the illuminate must be placed within the larger structure of the mystery schools and the various occult hierarchies. There are international factions vying for political and economic power between east and west, some ancient opposing systems of occult control originated simultaneously in the first growth of cities and have never been unified in political ideology or strategy. Some are distinctly less criminal, and even incorporate concepts similar to political liberalism and freedom, if those were compatible with secret societies.\nThere are rumors of a mythical white dragon society in asia, a counterpart to the western illuminate, which may worship something other than nasty lucifer. Occult hierarchies around the world generally serve oligarchy, and nothing else, but not always the same oligarchyFirst off PF, knocking down the population from 7B to 500M Georgia Guidestone numbers while still maintaining enough control to end up at the top of the heap in the end Game is a logistical problem of IMMENSE proportions, far greater than the measely 10-20M Mass Murder/Genocide sprees undertaken to date. If the Illuminati really could Snuff out the Useless Eaters that easily, trust me, they already would have done it.\n\nSecond, it is a canard to believe the Illuminati are a Single Organism with uniform objectives, they are not. There are two very identifiable factions there vying for control, along with divisions along Geographical lines and Cultural lines. Wht they share in common is they are all Power Seekers, but their interests often conflict with each other. they can't willy-nilly Whack everybody, because each of them needs his own Army to protect and defend his Property. If you kill off too many of your \"Loyal Subjects\" too quickly, you lose your Power Base.\n\nWhile most certianly in Absolute Numbers J6P will do most of the dieing here, BY PERCENTAGE the Illuminati will suffer much worse. this because they will Cannibalize EACH OTHER. Its an M&A Game on the Grand Scale, and only One Pigman can walk away with ALL the Chips.\n\nTrust me, when there is nothing left to Loot from J6P, these Scumbags will be Looting each other, and Brutus will be stabbing Caesar inthe back all over the place. There is No Honor Among Thieves PF, not even at this level.\n\nConcerning a bioweapons release, the idea is not to exterminate the population on a fair and equal basis, since the perpetrators would be eugenicist maniacs after all, having a pronounced hatred of certain kinds of people.\nA likely scenario is a less-lethal binary bioweapon release infecting the whole population, whereby the forced vaccination would trigger a tailored effect by a trojan biochemical activator in certain batches of vaccines to be given to political enemies, dissidents or ethnic minorities.\nA binary terminator vaccine would be used to selectively kill the infected, or sterilise the survivors, maybe causing cognitive impairment or metabolic deficiency in certain groups, in order to destroy their organic group viability.\n\nIts conceivable that various opposing factions within the global oligarchy have already infected eachothers elites with dormant or chemically suppressible bioweapons without known cure, thus triggering mutual assured extinction of the disparate dysgenic groups in absense of cooperation within the oligarchical collective and regular exchange of suppressant formula.\nWith the development of scalar tectonic weapons available to opposing factions, no bunker complex is deep enough. If sheltering from either fallout or bioweapons used against opposing oligarchies, they would be pulverised down in their crypts in the first counterstrikeAll Statistics have to be parsed by using your common sense, particularly when stats reflect poorly on Da Goobermint. Far as the Great Depression goes, we KNOW millions of farmers were pushed off their land, we KNOW there was virtually no social safety net in place, and even with the missing data sets from 1931-33 the discontinuity in population growth trends between the 1930 Census and the 1940 one all point to a markedly increased Death Rate during this period. Add in the deprivation in Big Shities of the time (there were Faood Riots in many ajor shitties and the Bonus Army March was in fact one of many Food marches that went on in those years), and you can only conclude that starvation problems here were likely close to what they were in the Ukraine Holodomor.\n\nAs to whether our Goobermint was as bad as Stalin, Ashvin already has delineated how the Chain Gains were used in the South as a means to perpetuate Slavery, and what was the Death Rate on those Gangs? I won;t speculate on the Death Rate for WPA workers, but that probably was pretty high. There was no OSHA in those days, and they were working in some mighty dangerous places.\n\nThen you have the evidence of Japanese-American internment Camps, and our current situation of having the largest Prison population in the world. Can you really make a good case it has beenn that much better here for the Poor than it was in China or Russia?\n\nGreenpa wrote:(aside; I DO like and appreciate the ability to edit posts.)\n\nThese are not characteristics of Iconoclasts, fortunately for me\n\nFirst off, I never think anybody else can make a better analysis than I can, so if Da Goobermint Stats don't match up with my analysis, they are for sure LYING. I GUARANTEE IT! LOL.\n\nClearly though, iconoclastic thinking is socially selected against, and we generally are not very popular people. this also doesn't bother me, because I am basically a hermit and really don't care what other people think of me This frees up your thinking a lot.\n\nash--\"This trend is an important reminder of how market instability does not necessarily equal a market crash or collapse - all of these outflows occurred during a 20% rally in the market from its October lows.\"\n\nTrue enough. But stepping back a bit, one can see that the S&P 500 is about where it was in 1999, 13 years ago. How much cpi inflation has there been since then? Well, a gallon of gasoline costs 3 times as much. Or, you could say that a unit of spy or $spx buys 1/3 as many gallons of unleaded regular gas as in 1999.\n\nWhen are you deflationists gonna throw in the towel? This is a deliberate debasement of the money supply. They can't just tell everyone that their stock is worth 33 cents on the dollar. Far easier to hold the stock market steady and debase the measuring stick, the dollar. And with Euro weakness, the job just got an order of magnitude easierWe all do. Seemingly by preference. Of course, we've been sold the rosy versions since early childhood; but that's not the entire reason; childhood tales do include very dark stuff (Grimm, in fact) yet- we somehow preferentially believe the happy versions.\n\nI find this an interesting behavioral conundrum; particularly in light of another behavioral universal. I'll state them together.On a note closer to the content of Ash's article, bomb throwing anarchist Charles Biderman, ruminating on the roaring stock market and noting that everyone seems to be running away anyway, says it's Da Fed. If you can print your own money, maybe you don't need no steenkin' meat and blood investors. It's the new paranormal.\n\n\"Everybody Knows\"RE- yeah; thanks. I find those numbers rather more credible than \"official\" ones. The infinite plasticity of statistics is by way of being a sub-specialty of mine; I've been aware of the distortions there for many years. The story I linked to above about the NY cop finding crime statistics being consistently and extensively manipulated just brought my appreciation to a new peak.\n\nHaving spent time in China, I got additional appreciation for how people handle information like this. It gets mentioned, slightly, then everybody wants to change the subject. NOBODY wants to face it. The particular instance was a broad floodplain all planted in rice. We were driving across it- it went on and on. It occurred to me to ask my host, related by marriage to one of Mao's generals- \"so is this the region where Mao opened the dikes to cover his retreat?\" \"Oh, let me ask...\" as he referred to the local guide. \"Yes, this is the place.\" Something like 2 million peasants drowned. A glorious victory followed later, of course.\n\nRight here. Great rice. Let's talk about something else, shall we? And while the locals remember; I'll bet you those numbers don't get included much, in official discussions.\n\nThe 1940's draft results dispelled the notion that Americans did not suffer serious malnutrition during the depression.\n\nThe link above was the quickest found, but the sheer numbers of undernourished draftees and those who were too malnourished to serve were startling, even to those who knew that the population did not fare as well as the government and TPTB had insisted.\nNot the mass deaths under Stalin, but a sobering statistic we need to heed. How much of our crop land has ben lost and how much of our food is now imported?? Large cities in the US are showing increasing numbers of severly undernourished children today.\niIt will only get worseOK, I took a LOT of heat when I introduced the following information about starvation deaths in the FSoA during the Great Depression on TBP, most specifically during the worst period from 1931-1933. Its researched up by a Ruskie Boris Borisov who may have an axe to grind here, but I did attempt to verify his statistics. Interestingly, the applicable stats are all maintained by Da Federal Reserve! It is also clear once you go into the files there that data from these years has been excised. Boris was working with old Hard Copies of these data sets in Ruskie Libraries. You cannot reproduce his work from data sets available online, the data is GONE. Seriously, its been wiped out. Go look for yourself. Relevant Data sets from 1931 and 1932 are simply not there.\n\nAnyhow, we know from John Steinbeck's news articles that in the pea picker fields of CA in those years, migrant Okies were dying by the truckload. We also have Dorothy Langen's photography, which shows many people with clear signs of Starvation. It is not unreasonable based on all of this that the numbers lost in the FSofA during the Great Depression were near what Boris calculates them to have been.\n\nIts not just starvation either, plenty of opportunistic diseases hit the chronically malnourished, and its well known that Tuberculosis ran rampant during the GD. Count in the TB deaths, you might come up with still bigger numbers.\n\nAnyhow, I'll paste in an article about Boris published by our friends at Pravda\n\nAnother online scandal has been gathering pace recently. Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, deleted an article by a Russian researcher, who wrote about the USA's losses in the Great Depression of 1932-1933. Indignant bloggers began to actively distribute the article on the Russian part of a popular blog service known as Livejournal. The above-mentioned article triggered a heated debate.\n\nThe researcher touched upon quite a hot topic in the article – the estimation of the number of victims of the Great Depression in the USA. The material presented in the article apparently made Wikipedia's moderators delete the piece from the database of the online encyclopedia.\n\nThe researcher, Boris Borisov, in his article titled \"The American Famine\" estimated the victims of the financial crisis in the US at over seven million people. The researcher also directly compared the US events of 1932-1933 with Holodomor, or Famine, in the USSR during 1932-1933.\n\nIn the article, Borisov used the official data of the US Census Bureau. Having revised the number of the US population, birth and date rates, immigration and emigration, the researcher came to conclusion that the United States lost over seven million people during the famine of 1932-1933.\n\n\"According to the US statistics, the US lost not less than 8 million 553 thousand people from 1931 to 1940. Afterwards, population growth indices change twice instantly exactly between 1930-1931: the indices drop and stay on the same level for ten years. There can no explanation to this phenomenon found in the extensive text of the report by the US Department of Commerce \"Statistical Abstract of the United States,\" the author wrote.\n\nThe researcher points out the movement of population at this point: \"A lot more people left the country than arrived during the 1930s – the difference is estimated at 93,309 people, whereas 2.960,782 people arrived in the country a decade earlier. Well, let's correct the number of total demographic losses in the USA during the 1930s by 3,054 people.\"\n\nAnalyzing the period of the Great Depression in the USA, the author notes a remarkable similarity with events taking place in the USSR during the 1930s. He even introduced a new term for the USA – defarming – an analogue to dispossession of wealthy farmers in the Soviet Union. \"Few people know about five million American farmers (about a million families) whom banks ousted from them lands because of debts. The US government did not provide them with land, work, social aid, pension – nothing,\" the article says.\n\n\"Every sixth American farmer was affected by famine. People were forced to leave their homes and go to nowhere without any money and any property. They found themselves in the middle of nowhere enveloped in massive unemployment, famine and gangsterism.\"\n\nThe then state of affairs in the US society can be seen in Peter Jackson's movie King Kong. The movie starts with scenes of the Great Depression and tells the story of an actress who did not eat for three days and tried to steal an apple from a street vendor. There is food in the city, but many people had no money to buy it in unemployment-paralyzed New York. People starve in the streets against the background of stores selling a variety of foodstuffs.\n\nAt the same time, the US government tried to get rid of redundant foodstuffs, which vendors could not sell. Market rules were observed strictly: unsold goods should always be categorized as redundant and they could not be given away to the poor because it could cause damage to businesses. A variety of methods was used to destroy redundant food. They burnt crops, drowned them in the ocean or plowed 10 million hectares of harvesting fields. \"About 6.5 million pigs were killed at that time,\" the researcher wrote.\n\nThe consequences of those policies were predictable, the author of the article wrote. \"Here is what a child recollected about those years: \"We changed our usual food for something for available. We used to eat bush leaves instead of cabbage. We ate frogs too. My mother and my older sister died during a year.\" (Jack Griffin).\"\n\nSo-called public works introduced by President Roosevelt became a salvation for a huge number of jobless and landless Americans. However, the salvation was only a phantom, Boris Borisov wrote. The works conducted under the aegis of the Public Works Administration and the Civil Works Administration were about building channels, roads or bridges in remote, wild and dangerous territories. Up to 3.3 million people were involved in those works at a time, whereas the total number of people amounted to 8.5 million, not to count prisoners.\n\n\"Conditions and death rate at those works are to be studied separately. A member of public works would make $30, and pay $25 of taxes from this amount. So a person could make only $5 for a month of hard work in malarial swamps.\"\n\nThe conditions, under which people were working for food, could be compared to Stalin's GULAG camp.\n\n\"The Public Works Administration (PWA) bore a striking resemblance to GULAG. The PWA was chaired by \"American Beria,\" the Secretary of Interior Affairs, Harold Ickes, who threw about two million people into camps for the unemployed youth,\" Borisov wrote. \"Harold LeClair Ickes (1874–1952) later interned USA's ethnic Japanesein concentration camps. The first stage of the operation took only 72 hours (1941-1942).\n\n\"In 1940, the US population was supposed to make up at least 141.856 million people upon the preservation of previous demographic trends. As a matter of fact, the USA had the 131.409-strong population in 1940, of which only 3.054 million can be explained with changes in migration dynamics. Thus, 7.394,000 people simply do not exist as of 1940. There are no official arguments to explain the phenomenon,\" Boris Borisov wrote.\n\nIt is worthy of note that modern-day Russian patriotic historians reject methods of research based on the general estimation of demographic losses. They believe that demographic processes are not linear and depend on a number of factors. Such historians think that victims of communism estimations made on the base of demographic research works by Stephan Kurt and Richard Pipes, which George Bush and Helen Bonner announced at the opening of Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington, are false.\n\nOn the other hand, these methods are widely used in contemporary science of history. Ukrainian historian Stanislav Kulchitsky used the method to calculate the number of victims of the Ukrainian Holodomor (famine), which was subsequently officially recognized. Parliaments of eleven countries that recognized Holodomor use those numbers in their research works. To crown it all, the US Congress and the European Union also use Kulchitsky's numbers considering the problemYou are right that they would probably use a microorganism disease vector - probably a virus. But this slime would be neither random nor fair. Neither is their style. They would then go with a very difficult to develop and replicate vaccine and inject their anointed including all their future lackeys. Probably surreptitiously not to panic the sheep. Surreptitiously just means they wouldn't publish all the details in the Toilet Paper of Record, thus making any whistleblower a conspiracy theorist before he wound up in a FEMA camp or among Obama's unbreathing.\n\nLots of evidence coming in that Monsanto's Frankencrops are playing havoc with farm animal fertility. I am sure it's just a coincidence. Also, it appears now that the pathway that Monsanto is using for their terminator seeds is applicable to all life forms. Our Masters have so many choices to pick from as they proceed with God's work. But not to worry, I am quite sure that they couldn't be that evil.\n\n\"The main problem now is one of the resource base measured against the population base. Gold can't solve that problem.\"\n\nWell if we could just get the population under say a billion in the next 15 years, I think we could solve that little problem. Only there is an appalling and disheartening shortage of volunteers. There might be a simple workaround. Kind of like the draft lottery in 1969, but with a diminishing list of deferments as time goes by. Only this is a big logistical problem. Might require German engineering.\n\nBTW, I am glad that we have a constitutional lawyer as POTUS. Hitler and Stalin never had the decency to pass laws that they could kill anyone they felt like. They just did it. Very primitive.\n\nTo do a Population Reduction Quick and Sorta Fair, all you need is a disease vector with say 95% Infection rate and 95% Mortality rate, with no medical intervention possible. Then everyone regardless of class gets Whacked on an equal and random basis. You don;t need Hitler when you have the biochemists at the Whitehead Institute at MIT on the job.\n\nOf course, our Illuminati Masters will no doubt be holing up in underground bunkers with their own filtered air supply, Hitachi Micro Nukes and Aquaponic Food production, but they'll be a while in coming up from out of the hole.\n\nHowever, I do wonder some about the economics of trying to scale down the industrial economy utilizing just what reasonably positive EROEI Oil is left, even with a much smaller population base. It still would not be a growth economy, and thus would suffer the same monetary problems any economy in shrinkage mode would face. it might though Buy Time for the Holy Grail of Cold Fusion to come riding to the rescue of the remaining population. In absence of something like that, I suspect the system would continue to deteriorate until you finally reach a population level of Homo Sapiens that is totally pay as you go on an energy basis without depleting the rest of the environment."

Since a collar is sell a call and buy a put at a lower price, (the opposite of the above graph) the written collar would be buy a call and sell a put at a lower price.\n\nYeah, that's what I got. So you're right, it's not exactly a long forward, but it's close. It also kinda looks like a collar. But if you read the DM book, it says that a collar looks kinda like a forward from a distance.

      "text": "There's more to FX pricing than the spread\n\nSome foreign exchange brokers like to make a lot of noise about low spreads to lure in new clients, but as most experienced traders will tell you, there is more to FX pricing than the raw spread.\n\nVisit one of these brokers' sites and you'll see a message along the lines of 'spreads as low as 0.8 pips on EURUSD' with a miniscule asterisk at the end. A tiny little asterisk that, in a nutshell, means they will give you the spread they advertise when their trading conditions are perfect (and you're placing a trade small enough for them to handle), but if they're less-than-perfect they won't - in fact they may not be able to fill your order at all.\n\nSo, when you look for a new broker, you should also investigate more than the spread. You should research the broker's quality of execution and transparency around pricing and execution.\n\nWhat you see is what you should get This means that when you place a trade, the bid or offer you see on the trading platform, once you have entered the amount you want to trade, should be the price that you get when you click 'sell' or 'buy'.\n\nSome transparent brokers will be able to provide you with 'slippage' or 'rejection' rates. Slippage is how often and how much they had to move your price to fill your trade. Rejection is when the broker cannot fill your trade and rejects it. Make sure you can live with these statistics before choosing a broker.\n\nOther brokers, like Saxo Bank, will only show you a price they know they can fill. We refer to this as 'green prices'. If you click 'buy' or 'sell' on a green price, you'll get that price unless the market price moves significantly before the trade reaches Saxo Bank (due to latency etc.). If Saxo cannot be sure of giving you the price on the screen, the price buttons will be yellow.\n\nTransparent brokers will be able to show you a history of their spreads over time. Saxo Bank has just launched a Historic Spreads tool that allows you to see the average spread and the minimum/maximum spread over a given time period. You can even sort by volume and time of day.\n\n(Click on the image above and try the new Historic Spreads tool.)\n\nLiquidity when you need it There are more benefits to 'green prices' from Saxo Bank. It also means you trade on dedicated liquidity. Let's say you and another trader decide to buy EURUSD 25 million at the exact same time at the exact same price. Since you both trade on 'green prices' Saxo Bank will automatically process both trades disregarding the liquidity available in the interbank market.\n\nIf you plan to make large trades, trade during volatile periods or trade in illiquid hours, you should also investigate how the broker's spread widens under these circumstances. That is, is the liquidity available when you need it?\n\nIf the broker is a market-maker, like Saxo Bank, it will often be able to handle large trades, overnight trades or trades during volatile periods without widening the spread. If the broker is not a market-maker, but is a 'no dealing desk' broker, then it will only be able to give you the liquidity available in the market, that is, the best spread other bigger banks are prepared to give it. At the very least, your broker should tell you what to expect. Saxo Bank provides full transparency to spreads in the Historic Spreads tool.\n\nWhen a stop is not a stop Most experienced traders use stop orders to protect their positions when the market moves against them. In volatile conditions, brokers often struggle to fill stop orders at the desired price, that is, with no slippage. When you choose your broker, make sure to find out what their stop order fill statistics look like or if you have to pay extra to ensure your orders are filled properly.\n\nA solid broker will not only make these statistics available, but the percentage of orders filled without any slippage will be very high, particularly on the major currencies. Saxo Bank publishes updated order fill statistics on its website every quarter.\n\nIn conclusion, when you choose a new broker, make sure to do your research on the quality and transparency of execution and not just on the spread. After all, a few trades where you could not get the price you wanted could cost much, much more than the difference between the advertised spread (with an asterisk!) and the actual spread"

When the stock or security price closes above the 70 level, the market becomes overbought and when it closes below the 30 level, it becomes oversold. Contrarian trades buys when the market becomes overbought (meaning that RSI or MARSI is higher than 70 or 80) and sells when the market becomes oversold (meaning that the RSI or MARSI is lower than 30 or 20).\n\nThe MARSI indicator has two parameters. The first one is the moving average period and the second one is the RSI period. The default value for the moving average lookback period is 13 and the default value for the RSI period is 14.\n\nExample:\nrule1 = cross(MARSI(13, 14), 70);\n\n\"Rule1\" returns a trading signal if the MARSI indicator crosses above 70.

Obviously, that will favor the FRO seller over the buyer. However, since the settlement value and the strike price will rarely be exactly equal, itís only a small advantage for the seller.\n\nHOW THE ìAMEX FRO SETTLEMENT INDEXî VALUE DETERMINES WHETHER FROs ARE IN-THE-MONEY OR OUT-OF-THE-MONEY Hereís where Fixed Return Options get a little tricky. Settlement value for the underlying stock is determined differently than that of standard options. Settlement for calls and puts is usually determined by the underlying stockís price when the market closes on the expiration date.\n\nBut whether an FRO is in- or out-of-the-money is determined by calculating the stockís AMEX FRO Settlement Index value. This is the Volume Weighted Average Price, or ìVWAP,î on the day the option expires.\n\nIn case youíre not familiar with the term VWAP, itís calculated by adding up the dollar value of all trades on a given stock on a given day, and dividing that sum by the total number of shares traded. In other words, VWAP is a fancy way of saying ìthe average dollar price of a specific stock on a particular trading day.î\n\nThe VWAP is calculated and disseminated at 15-second intervals throughout every trading day. Only trades that occur while the markets are open factor into the VWAP. Pre-market trading and after-hours activity do not affect the figure.\n\nThe AMEX FRO Settlement Index value is the final VWAP calculated after close on the FRO expiration date. This will usually be posted within 2 hours of the close. Itís important to note that the AMEX FRO Settlement Index value will usually not be exactly equal to the stockís closing price at expiration.\n\nAnd that serves an important purpose. The reason the VWAP is used for settlement at expiration instead of the closing price for the underlying stock is to prevent any large (and unscrupulous) financial entities from manipulating the stock price near the end of the trading session.\n\nSince FROs are an all-or-nothing trade, and a one-cent increase or decrease in share price can potentially make the difference between receiving $100 per contract and receiving nothing, itís essential to guard against price manipulation.\n\nOPTION GUYíS TIP: In case youíre a stickler for correct pronunciation of financial terminology, in the brokerage world VWAP is usually pronounced, ìVEE-whop.î continued in Part Three..."

      "text": "Binary Options Trading System\n\nAssets Trading In A Binary Options Trading System\n\nOne of the main characteristics of a binary options trading system is what is being traded at the helm. Here are the four main types of assets being traded in binary options:\n\nBinary Options Trading System Asset #1: FOREX\nForeign currency is being used in a binary options trading system. Unlike in regular forex trading, currency pairs aren't used in binary options. The investor simply has to bet on whether a currency will go over or under a predetermined price level or \"strike price.\" Forex can also be traded on an hourly or daily basis.\n\nMany investors are now choosing to trade in foreign exchange through the binary options trading system because of its low-risk nature. There are also a number of binary options trading platform that trade in a variety of currencies. If you have experience in trading in forex, you will have an advantage in binary options.\n\nBinary Options Trading System Asset #2: Stocks\nA company's worth as represented in the financial world as shares is also being traded in a binary options trading system. As in regular stock trading, the price per share is the main unit of the process.\n\nIn binary options though, an investor would only need to determine whether the share price would go over or under the strike price before the trading time expires. This asset can be more fast-paced than forex binary options so it's important to stay in the loop and to be updated in real time of the market changes in order to maximize profit.\n\nBinary Options Trading System Asset #3: Index\nAn index can be defined simply as a group of stocks. Some investors prefer indices because it is more reliable than individual company stocks. As in regular index trading, an investor can choose between indices in Asia, Europe and the US in a binary options trading system.\nAgain, strike prices are used in trading. An index may go above or under that price and investors would either call or put their money in to gain a profit.\n\nBinary Options Trading System Asset #4: Commodity\nGoods like gold, iron, oil and steel fall under this category. Some binary options trading platform such as EZ Trader binary options for example have more commodities to choose from than the others.\nThe premise in trading of commodities in a binary options trading system is essentially the same as with the other asset types.\n\nChoosing an asset to trade in is an important process in binary options. Make sure that you understand the asset and its financial movements before investing in one. Maximizing profits in a binary options trading system is heavily reliant on choosing the right asset."

Does it seem like something you might want to invest?\n\nThe concept of Penny Stock Prophet is really, really simple. They send an email that tells you about recent picks penny stock and their results. This includes the predicted best stocks for today and also some great buy and sell pointers on stock exchanging.\n\nThe buy point refers to the highest price you are willing to pay to purchase the stock. For instance, if it's the case that it tells you to purchase at $0.65 and below. That's precisely what you would do. The lower the price you buy at, the better.\n\nSell point refers to the price point that you should sell the stock i.e. Sell at $3.00 and up. You would do exactly that. It will sure make trick for the users. This is the way to make a decision under those circumstances. Sell the stock immediately when it reaches $3, unless you want to take some additional risk.\n\nAlternatively, if you are more of a risk taker, you may want to wait until it goes past that $3.00 and pray that it continues to increase and then sell when you're satisfied.\n\nThe Truth About Penny Stock Prophet\n\nIt totally depends upon the trader and their values as each strategy has its pros and cons. If you desire to have security, you will achieve the goal, make a sale and achieve a gain. This is a way that stands to cost you some profits you could have reaped.\n\nIf you're a risk taker you could earn much more money but the possibility exists that the stock could quickly drop and leaving you profitless or even at a loss.\n\nSo before you get Penny Stock Prophet I would make sure you understand what you value most: security or risk. Therefore, when you make the trade, you won't have to worry about the effects of your emotions or overconfidence.\n\nNow we can look into information about results. Penny Stock Prophet created by James who 6 months ago with a small capital of $1,000 and made all of the trades sent and have finished that sequence of trades with $197,356. Now I know that seems like an impossibly high number so let's break the process down.\n\nSome of the trades lost money instead of turning profits. I recognize that no one is perfect and hence that possibility needs to be discussed. Accept your loss and move on. if you get hung up on losses you're going to lose a lot more money. I'm wondering how $1,000 became over $197,356. There are only a couple of things you need to know and they are compounded growth. Here's some user testimonial from PennyStockProphet.com\n\nSay you have that $1,000 right now and you followed the alerts you turned it into $1,500. Most casual investors will take that $500 they made and go spend it. THAT'S THE WORST THING YOU COULD DO!.\n\nThe smart thing to do and the way you'll achieve those big numbers is to reinvest the ENTIRE $1,500. because you can buy more stock and therefore profit even more on the next trade.\n\nNext, we'll say that you reinvest the $1500 and turn it into $2000. So what should be done now? You were able to figure it out. Put that $2000 back into the market, as a $500 gain can be turned into $1000 or more immediately. the more you do the more your money will grow. and the bigger the capital, the more profit you can make per trade. It is similar to a snowball rolling down a hill at top speed.\n\nThat's how you achieve big numbers by starting with a small bit of capital. However, that isn't done by the majority. Rather, they make a thousand dollar profit and buy a 42″ LCD HDTV or their new car that will not make them a profit. Be sure you don't get trapped.\n\nIt should also be noted that Penny Stock Prophet comes with an 8 week, 60 day money back guarantee, so you can literally try it out for 59 days. And you can get a refund with ease if you don't, at least, make the newsletter fee back. Well, keep on making that money bud!\n\nFor those 8 weeks you don't have to risk any of your money. Just study the stocks James chooses using something like Yahoo or Google Finance and you'll obtain the result. Thus, using this reasoning, there is very low risk.\n\n50 Comments\n\nBuying Penny stocks is considered a high-risk investment, meaning that you may lose big. But this also means that you can earn extremely high returns in a short time. The risk and potential earnings are what keep people trading these stocks."

Swing traders are not looking to hit the home run with a single trade—they are not concerned about perfect timing to buy a stock exactly at its bottom and sell exactly at its top (or vice versa). In a perfect trading environment, they wait for the stock to confirm its direction before they make their moves.\n\nWhen it comes time to take profits, the swing trader will want to exit the trade as close as possible to the upper or lower channel line without being overly precise, which may cause the risk of missing the best opportunity. In a strong market, when a stock is exhibiting a strong directional trend, traders can wait for the channel line to be reached before taking their profit, but in a weaker market they may take their profits before the line is hit (in the event that the direction changes and the line does not get hit on that particular swing).\n\nSwing trading, while a good trading style for beginning traders, still offers significant profit potential for intermediate and advanced traders. Swing traders can realize sufficient rewards on their trades after a couple of days, which keep them motivated, but their long and short positions of several days are of ideal duration so as to not lead to distraction. By contrast, trend following offers greater profit potential if a trader is able to catch a major market trend of weeks or months. On the other hand, trading dozens of stocks per day (day trading) may just prove too great a white-knuckle ride for some, making swing trading the perfect medium between the extremes."

The angle of the line is big. Major drop? No. It was a 0,05% drop (from 1,723 to 1,722).\n\nThen last night, it was up. A much bigger difference, at +0,34%. The line chart? It is there. The angle of the line? The same.\n\nConclusion? It is not a line chart. It indicates just a binary information: if the rate is up or down. Isn't the up/down arrow already doing exactly that? So why use a line-graphic-like image, that implies the idea of \"angle=quantity of change\"?"

Therefore, the FA must \"guess\" at how much of the difference between market price and FA-Value is due to information available to the market but not to the FA, and factor that guess into his calculation of intrinsic value. That is, unless the FA has special insight into the market price that allows him to apply Sklansky's fundamental theorem.\n\nThis Insider Trading topic is just Sklansky's way of providing some examples to support his proposal that we should look to his Fundamental Theorem of Investing to make more money in the market."

Just like in every breathe we take we have a chance to do what we want with it, data is no different. Anyone can manipulate any data and make it say whatever they want. The tools we have today to measure are better than they every have been but it is making it less science and more art. I don't think it will always be that way but for now it is. After all we are still dealing with humans. Complexity and mass has outran our ability to understand it.\n\nWhat you can't manipulate.\n\nA chart is a recording device but it does not always tell a story. Because it is a recording device it cannot be manipulated. Let me clarify it. A market can be manipulated where the market went cannot be. And yes there are dark pools but there has always been some form of this.\n\nWhat has frustrated me about commentary around data is people think the number is more important than what the market did. To some extent I understand that most people are creating content vs relying on it to make them money. The important part for the latter group is not the data, it is how people acted that is important.\n\nParticipants\n\nIt is not that people act much differently it is whether they are participating. Let me say that again, it is much easier to know how they are going to to react than if they are there at all before the release. By seeing how the market moves when data is released you can tell if they are participating. In my opinion, there is not many different players right now. In that case the big players can easily and cheaply go along with their agenda. I believe their agenda is to attract participants by higher prices.\n\nAnother pitfall.\n\nIf someone cuts us off in traffic it is easier for us to understand if we believe they have something against us than that they did it randomly. That we somehow matter to a stranger. Chances are they did it randomly. They were in a hurry, distracted, or don't care. The same is true about the market. At times it moves with \"reason\" but the correlation between reason and market moves is loose, very loose for right now. The more participants the more likely they are to react in a reasonable way.\n\nIt is hard for a new trader to understand that they can lose money from the random moves. But what they do not understand is that what they may lose in money they gain knowledge. An experienced trader knows how to make money from the random moves. That is the difference.\n\nConclusion\n\nBe careful with what you do with the air you breathe. Data has made confirmation bias easier than it ever has been. This is because it is so much cheaper to produce than it every has been. I can watch the same information being presented by two different networks and feel a different way. As a trader you have to be able to argue both sides at the same time, to create scenarios, and let the market show you who is right.\n\nNow the question for me and something I will have to confront in the future when things are rational again is if I can ever believe in it again. It will not be easy for sure but nothing speeds up the adjustment like having money at risk"

      "text": "Archive\n\nSome indicators can provide a better prediction than others so that it seems logically to use the best selected ones to build a composite forecast. On the other hand, even the best indicators can fail. The questions is how to get a consistent good accuracy in predicting – by using only a few best indicators or many good ones. The answer is not obvious and, therefore, a factual comparative analysis would be needed to shed some light on this issue. This short report is based on limited statistical researches; it is an attempt to reach a certain conclusion.\n\nAbout Expert Method. Apparently, the more good forecasts are taken into consideration, the more precise can be an approximation to actual value. There is Expert Method. This method can be explained by following. As example, an experimentalist shows a pen and asks a group of about 40 people to write down their estimate of the length. Then he collects notes and calculates the average number – normally it is almost 100% accurate. Why it works? Because everyone makes errors in different directions so that averaging gives a precise result.\n\nThe Details of Experiment. To find an optimal number of top performing indicators, two tests have been done – using artificial data and real market data. Artificial data allow performing forward testing with more consistent statistics. Although back-testing has been done on out-of-sample sets, it did not have the same forward-testing success every time. Forward testing showed that in average few indicators might produce less accurate prediction than many.\n\nThe researches and presented chart are made by Technical Analyzer TA-1 (the software is able to compose Neural Network forecasts of many indicators with weights accordingly to each indicator's predictive ability).\n\nConclusion. The main conclusion is that relying on a couple of best indicators might yields less consistent success over a long run than using many best and good ones. However, too many is another extreme and not good. The second conclusion is that the list of best indicators is not static – it evolves depending on many factors, including market conditions and, probably, on the number of traders employing particular indicators to make their buy-sell decisions. Thirdly, if the best current top of indicators is known, here is a magic number – it is around 30. And finally, better results are possible if indicators are combined accordingly to their latest back-testing ranking.\n\nTechnical analysts use many different indicators. Not all indicators are equally good. Some of them have better predictive abilities than others at given conditions. Statistical results of the research for stocks and indexes during the last several months have showed the way to improve some regular indicators. In short, if an indicator is trend-differentially coupled with price – it demonstrates better predictive abilities than a pure indicator.\n\nAmong studied indicators are Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicators. They have been transformed to a slope of line and differentially-coupled with a price line slope. Indicators and price transformation to line slopes has been performed using Least Squares Linear Regression within a sliding 10-day period (moving window). A comparative analysis of indicators' predictive abilities showed that these two coupled ones are better than around 90% of all other (57) the most popular indicators.\n\nThe chart below shows an example of such forecast:\n\nThe research results presented here have been calculated using a feature of Technical Analyzer TA-1 (TA). Except analyzing chart with indicators and historical data, TA enables to perform a 10-day forecast using Artificial Neural Network. The calculations can be done on the basis of one selected technical indicator or all available. If all indicators used, TA decides how much weight should be assigned for each indicator's forecast in a composite result by using back-testing for particular market conditions and a specific stock. Each weight is proportional to a predictive ability of a corresponding technical indicator."

      "text": "Sma and the Trend\n\nIn my last article - Do you know the trend ? - i talked about the famous words \"The trend is your friend\" and why we see this words everywhere. In there, i talked about determining the trend using trend lines. But there are several ways to determine if we are in presence of one trend or not and with trend lines we can get easily false breakouts (price crossing the trend line). We can see that in image 2 taking as reference the pink line there. With this breakouts we may think about trend change but don't is what happens. In this article i'm talking about using a indicator (well, to be correct, same indicator three times) to help us in trend determination. The indicator we are going to use is the SMA - Simple Moving Average.\n\nWhat is SMA ?\n\nSMA refers to \"Simple Moving Average\" and is one of the simplest \"Moving Averages\". \"Moving averages\" are one way to \"smooth\" the price action (price flow) along the time. This \"Moving averages\" can be of two major types: Simple and Exponential. In \"Simple Moving Average\" - SMA - we use the price as is without modifications for a determined number of periods (can be one of Open price, Low price, Higher price or Close price of each period). On Exponential Moving Average - EMA - the more recent one type (as refered before) prices in the number of periods considered are changed to take more weight, and the latest less weight. But we must stick with the theme, and in this case is with SMA. It's easy to calculate the SMA value. SMA is calculated adding each of the prices of X periods and after divide the result by X. We can see in next image the formula for SMA and example of it's calculation.\n\nOf course you can use other settings you think more adequate for your setup. One frequent SMA used is SMA(200) and we find it in a great number of analyses out there. With this setup we can determine if we are in presence of a trend, its strenght and the end of it.. In the following image we see a \"downtrend\" where the prices are getting low and low.\n\nTo consider that we are in presence of a healthy trend, the following conditions must meet:\n\nall SMA lines are in order\n\nall SMA lines are pointing the same direction\n\nall SMA lines are parallel whithout crossing over\n\nprice remains on correct side of 50 SMA\n\nprice never stays near 100 SMA (B area)\n\nPrice swings gets out of 30/50 SMA area (A area)\n\n1- taking the price bar as point of reference, the first line near the bar (except in cases were the price bar crosses the lines) must be the lower SMA, followed by middle SMA and far away the greatest SMA.\n\n2- All three SMA lines must be pointing the same direction. That means up for uptrend and down for downtrend.\n\n3- All SMA lines are parallel without crossover. May occur lower SMA touch middle SMA, but never occur a cross between them by the rule, but i have see some short crosses without meaning the end of the trend.\n\n4- Price bars must be bellow middle SMA for downtrend or above for uptrend. Price bar staying in the A area or crossing of middle SMA line in one way and back next one or two bar don't mean the loss of strenght of trend.\n\n5- Price never stays near the higher SMA, and never stays in B area.\n\n6- Price bars can stay in A area, but not for long, only as a result of a swing.\n\nTrading the trend\n\nIf all of this conditions meet, we are in presence of a strong and healthy trend, and as usual we can take benefit of it. Also we can use this setup if we are on a healthy trend to trigger entries for trades. This entry points are indicated by green arrows in image 2 and 3. We can setup SL (Stop Loss) near (in B area if we are conservative) or after higher SMA (more agressive). We can also setup TP (Take Profit). The greater the angle of SMA lines(taking a horizontal line as reference), the greater that TP can be because the trend is moving more quickly. If we are in presence of a consolidated trend we can also setup a TS (Trailing Stop). TS is a exit point for the trade if the price goes against our trade in a predefined percentage or pips. This stop changes if the price goes in our favor on direction of the trade, but don't change the value if price goes against our trade. If the price goes this percentage or pips against or trade, we get out of this trade with the profits at that moment. That way we can benefit of all trend after entry point till the end of it where a reversal in price or trend occurs and the TS is triggered.\n\nImage 3: Uptrend with 3 SMA lines and it's exaustion and reversal. Some rules and indications are explained below.\n\nTrend exaustion or reversal\n\nIf any of the conditions referred before is no longer true we can be in presence of trend exaustion (the prices are getting \"sideways\") or trend reversal (the prices taking a diferent direction). The signals are:\n\n- the price bars keep crossing middle SMA more than two bars.\n\n- the price bar stays in B area (1 on last image).\n\n- the lower SMA line indicates other direcction (2 on last image).\n\n- the SMA lines crosses one another - as expected lower SMA with middle SMA first (3 on last image)\n\n- price bar crosses higher SMA\n\n- the SMA lines are getting flat losing their angle.\n\nYou can also check higher time frames to confirm the exaustion or reversal of the trend with same SMA setup. It's possible with that way to avoid some \"false breakouts\" as the trend can get back in it's flow.\n\nWhen any of this happens, that's time to \"get out\" if we have trades running and get the possible profit.\n\nRemember that SMA indicator is a lagging indicator that reflects past average price actions. Don't forget, as always, to trade with SL to avoid fast price moves against your trade.\n\nFacts\n\nThe great the period we consider for SMA, if we are using one line in the main chart to represent it, the far way this line stays taking as reference the price bars if the price flow is in a trend. Also, with greatest SMA periods, greatest the time to this line to reflect price action changes. Price bars crossing SMA lines means at least we are in presence of trend end, we don't be in a presence of a trend or in presence of new trend beginning.\n\nIn current times with great volatility and instable economy it's hard to find a great trend as we can find in some years before the end of 2008. In that times is easy to follow the trend. Now we need to work with lower time frames to see them. Hard times for currency traders.\n\nI hope you find any usefull information in this article. Please comment your toughts or opinions as they can be important to our community.\n\nTrade well and good luck.\n\nFinal note:I want to express my gratitude to all community members who made possible my classification on last month contest. Also i want to thank to Dukascopy Contest Team for the kind words on review and of course their classification. I'm expecting to be on top 10 but not in first place. Once again, thankyou!\n\nGood article.MA's are simplest and most powerfull tools in trend followind. However, as you have indicated they are not useful in sideway markets.. Then an ability to identify trending and sideways would be very usefull tool for this methodology...\n\nSMAs are lagging indicators. Anybody will find the crossovers for entry signal only when \"the train has already been missed\"... It involves high risk with considerable returns. I would suggest you to \"google\" XLT TRADING, VOLUME SPREAD ANALYSIS, THE SECRET CODE OF JAPANESE CANDLESTICKS by Felipe Tudela. I am sure after reading these e-books your trading will go much nearer to the expert level traders and you will almost forget using MA Crossovers. Please do not take my words negatively. All of starts small..but one should always find great opportunities which are available free of cost.\n\n@4xkishore: I don't use MA on crossover neither talk about that in article... I'm novice but i came to that conclusion sometime ago if you use great values for MA. I alert for lagging in the article. In my hubble opinion it is good for trend confirmation, trend retracements (in some extent) and trend following. Thankyou for your alert words. Trade well and good luck."

      "text": "The easiest way to make money is with sell to open puts. I have yet to lose money on these. For example: you want to sell to open 1 put contract for apple. Apple currently is down to $380 but you know that it will get back to $400 one day or at least not fall below $350 or something. You set in your order, mine would be at $370 or $380 to be on the safe side, and you get a premium of about $2000 for that 1 contract. The catch is if you bout a $380 contract that expires January and apple is below $380, $375 for example, you have to buy 100 apple shares at $380 so you lose $500 (100 x (380-375)) and you lose the premium of $2000. But that's never been the case for me and I don't play too conservatively. You can even put a super safe target of $340 but you won't make as much money because it's less riskyThank you for any assistance\n\nOnce you've sold to open the contract, you have a cost basis. A current Jan. 21 $370 contract costs 10.10 per share so $1,100 per contract. As time goes by this contract will shrink in value (the goal is for it to hit $0, so it expires worthless) and at expiration you will let it expire. Since the day you buy you will be making money (hopefully, essentially a sell to open put is a call because you want the stock to be over $370 at expiration, for example). You won't make the $1,100 at once but over time (up until expiration) you will make money because the the put will decrease in value and you will owe less. (So if apple is now $380 the put might be $7. Already you'll have made around $300). The thing that's a downside to this is if expires and apple is under $370, you will lose $1,100 and you'll be forced to buy apple at the pre determined price of $370, even though currently it might be $365 for example. In this case you would be set back $1600. It's okay because usually I do sell to open on stocks I wouldn't mind owning anyway, even if I lose money with the sell to open put option.\n\nYLWPF is an example of this.

      "text": "There are numerous stock market indexes. They are generally used as a method of measuring a section of the stock market and are often used as the source of information given in news reports or financial services firms. It is not uncommon for companies and stocks to switch from being listed on one index to being listed at another. You can purchase stocks from a company that is on the NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) and that same company might be listed on the DJIA (Dow Jones Industrial Average) before all is said and done. Here are the differences between the major US stock indices.\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)\n\nMade up of thirty large, publicly owned companies in the US, the DJIA is one of the oldest market indices, second only to the Dow Jones Transporation Average, also created by Dow. It was created by Charles Dow, Wall Street Journal editor and Dow Jones & Company co-founder. Each year, the editors of the Wall Street Journal pick the companies to be listed in the index each year.\n\nThe industrial portion of the name is historical. In it's beginning during the industrial revolution, the top eleven companies were the top industrial companies. This is not the case any longer. Currently, the thirty companies that are listed in the index are at the top of their industry.\n\nNASDAQ\n\nThe NASDAQ, Primarily used track technology stocks, accesses market value of a company, including the company worth of all five thousand stocks listed on the exchange. Many of the technology based companies have overseas factories and plants, so the NASDAQ exchange is not exclusive to the United States. It is considered a primary benchmark of the performance of tech companies. The majority of the companies tracked by the NASDAQ are smaller companies, which causes the index to be more volatile, based on the companies performance.\n\nS&P 500\n\nThe S&P 500 (Standard & Poor 500) lists only US based companies. If a company moves it's headquarters overseas, it will be removed from the S&P 500 index to be replaced by a US company. The stocks listed in the S&P 500 are all large-cap common stocks that are traded actively on either the NYSE or the NASDAQ. Considered a chief indicator of the state of the US economy, the S&P 500 is the most widely followed index, after the Dow.\n\nAs you can see, there are many differences between the indices, but there are also quite a few similarities. Each index is chosen by different people who feel that the best way to track the economy is through the stocks they have listed on the index.\n\nEach investor must choose the index that complements their financial status and beliefs best. While you don't need to be as knowledgable as a stock broker, it is wise to learn enough to try to analyze the economic health of the stocks you are interested in purchasing.\n\n11 Responses to \"The Major Stock Market Indices\"\n\nSomeone necessarily assist to make significantly articles I might state.

The ratio indicates small-investor sentiment, if there is more buying (a value greater than 1) then the small-investor sentiment is positive, is there is more selling (a value of less than 1) then the small investor sentiment is negative.\nSee odd-lot theory\n\nOdd-lot theory\n\nOdd lot theory was based on the idea that small investors typically traded in odd lots. By dividing the amount of odd lot buying by the amount of odd lot selling over a specific period of time they created the odd lot buy/sell ratio. By charting the values over time, they could base decisions on whether there was more buying or selling pressure (ie: positive or negative sentiment). The theory has largely declined in popularity and still remains largely unproven.\nSee odd lot buy/sell ratio\n\nOTC Option\n\nThe OTC or Over the Counter options are constructed specifically to meet certain financial requirements. A single OTC option will often only be traded once. This is in direct contrast to exchange traded options which are more liquid.\n\nOffer Price (ask price)\n\nThe price a buyer is willing to pay ( the price they will offer to buy the instrument from you ). See also Bid Price.\n\nOTC Option\n\nOTC or Over the Counter options are constructed specifically to meet certain financial requirements. A single OTC option will often only be traded once. This is in direct contrast to exchange traded options which are more liquid.\n\nOn-Balance Volume (OBV) Indicator\n\nWeighted sum of volume used to quantify buying or selling pressure to either confirm the current price trend or warn of a possible reversal. See Report.\n\nOpen\n\nPrice of a stock or issue when the market opens for trading.\n\nOpen Interest\n\nTotal number of outstanding contracts in a market at the end of any trading day. Open interest is a measure of market liquidity, the more outstanding contracts, the easier it is to get in and out of the market.\n\nOperating costs\n\nOperating costs refer to the total value of all expenses/costs involved in the operation of the business over a specific time period (example: daily operating costs, monthly operating costs, etc.).\n\nOperating expense\n\nAn operating expense refers to an expense that is required for the normal operation of a business. For example: rent, lights, etc.\n\nOperating interest is a term that is mainly used in the oil and gas industry. The operating interest refers to the lessee, company or working interest owner who bears the leasing, drilling and operating costs of a well.\nSee working interest\n\nOperating Lease\n\nA lease where the risks, benefits and ownership, stays with the lessor.\n\nOperating loss\n\nAn operating loss occurs when a company's operating costs are higher than the pre-tax earnings.\n\nOperating margin\n\nThe operating margin is equal to the operating income (EBIT) divided by the total revenue. This is a ratio of how efficient a company is in producing and selling their good or service. A company with a lower fixed cost and a larger operating margin has more flexibility in pricing strategies and has a better chance of sustaining profit during poor market conditions than a company with a higher fixed cost and lower operating margin. It is extremely important when using operating margin, that it is intended to be compared to like businesses since it is a ratio that represents management\\'s ability to produce profit from a specific business.\nAlso known as operating income or EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes)\n\nAn operating ratio is equal to the operating expenses divided by the operating revenue. The operating ratio is intended to measure operating efficiency. There are several key weaknesses of the operating ratio which are that it does not take into account interest expenses, taxes, debt, expansion and equity. In general, the smaller the value the greater the company's ability to generate profit and can sustain itself better in poor market conditions. When using the operating ratio, it is important to only compare companies that are in the same business.\n\nOperating revenue\n\nOperating revenue is the total value of all income (example: sales, etc.) from the operations of the company over a period of time (daily operating revenue, yearly operating revenue, etc.).\n\nOption\n\nAny financial instrument who's price is based on or derived from the price of another financial instrument. Options can be categorized by the type of instrument they are based on - Equity Derivatives, Bond Options, and Interest Rate Derivatives.\n\nOptionable stock\n\nAn optionable stock is a stock on which listed options can be traded.\n\nOrphan stock\n\nAn orphan stock is a stock which has largely been ignored, typically orphaned stocks are small and/or their sector is out of favour.\n\nOscillator\n\nCompares a stock's closing price with to its price range over a given time period to indicate whether it is overbought or oversold. Overbought: is a term for a market where prices have risen too high, too fast for its fundamental value; which is therefore susceptible to a selloff. Oversold: is a term for a market in which prices have dropped too low, too fast considering its fundamental value; which is therefore due for an increase in price.\n\nOutperform\n\nOutperform is a rating given to stocks by analysis. A stock that is rated to outperform means that the stock is anticipated (not guaranteed) to grow/gain more than it's sector (or the average company in that sector). For example: if company is in sector, and the sector is up 200%, to outperform that sector the company will have to grow more than 200%. (IE: it is anticipated to outperform the sector expectations). Opposite of under perform\n\nOverbought\n\nA condition where the security appears to be over valued and may reverse in trend. This term is commonly used in momentum/strength indicators like RSI and Stochastics\n\nOversold\n\nA condition where the security appears to be under valued and may reverse in trend. This term is commonly used in momentum/strength indicators like RSI and Stochastics\n\nOverweight\n\nA recommendation system used by firms such as JP Morgan use this term as a ranking/evalutaion. If a stock is listed as overweight, it is a \\\"buy\\\" recommendation for the sector, asset class, or market.\nJP Morgan\\'s definition is as follows: \\\"The stock\\'s total return is expected to exceed the average total return of the analyst\\'s industry (or industry team\\'s) coverage universe, on a risk-adjusted basis, over the next 12-18 months.\\\"\n(see Underweight)"

When it uses the Greek letters, the book uses lowercase gamma for the first and capital gamma for the second, but often it just says \"gamma\" without using the Greek letter.\n\nAnyhow, thank you for the information on the standardness/nonstandardness of the notation. Even the Greeks seem to be a little less standard than I'd like. For example, I noticed some sites don't list the option Greek psi, but do list other option Greeks not covered in the McDonald text."

      "text": "Forex Technical Analysis\n\nWhat is Technical Analysis?\n\nTechnical analysis is the analysis of the price action without considering the economic trends and facts. In a very dynamically changing market of Forex, analysis of the the price action is a continuous process. Analyzing the price movement before deciding about the trade to decide about the entry levels and after entering a trade to decide about the exit level is a must .\n\nIn this section we will discuss about Forex price action's technical analysis but while reading about the overview, you may wish to have some detailed overview about some of the important technical analysis indicators and chart patterns etc. Please click on the following technical indicators to check these in detail. Please also check daily technical analysis update for various current pairs for which the hyperlinks are given at the bootom of this page.\n\nForex technical analysis is basically an analysis of price action for any currency pair. Ideally the price movement in the Forex market should be because of health of economy of the country/region and demand and supply for the currency in concern. But then when the currency pairs are traded as speculative investment, only the ideal reasons are not sufficient and hence many other factors drive the direction of the price movement.\n\nApart from Fundamental factors the price movement in Forex market is governed by technical Analysis, psychological aspects and sentiments. This is mainly because large volumes are bought and sold because of these factors and that, in turn, pushes the prices in the direction of the positions taken. For day trading or short term trading psychological aspects and sentiments become very important. Short term Forex trading is not just about the fundamental factors but the analysis of how various trading floors are thinking and behaving. Technical indicators help us in analyzing the market-mood by analyzing how the market is moving. Technical analysis indicators also become very important as the Forex traders around the globe make their trading decisions taking into consideration the signals generated by same indicators.\n\nTechnical Analysis- Know Your Waves\n\nWell, the above statement may look very simple but if hundreds of thousands of Forex traders may be making their buy and sell decisions using the same technical indicators then all should be making profits by buying and selling around the same price levels. But well, that does not happen but why?\n\nWell, any technical analysis indicator would show a different picture if you are using different time frame charts. The picture what an hourly Forex chart would show would be completely different from the picture of daily or weekly chart for that currency pair. An hourly Forex chart may be giving a buy signal but the daily chart may be suggesting a downtrend and a sell signal around that price level.\n\nThe success in trading lies in comparing charts of different time periods (e.g. hourly chart, 3 or 4 hourly chart, daily chart etc) and then placing your trade. A bigger time frame chart may be used for the understanding of the overall trend and a shorter-term time frame chart may be used to decide the entry and exit levels. The success also depends in not taking the decision based on a single technical indicator but using a combination of complementing technical analysis indicators i.e. one indicator to judge the trend situation and another to decide on the entry and exit points and also stop-loss orders and take-profit targets. We should also keep an eye on the the fundamentals and current major news releases. The market does not move only based on the economic releases but major political and other changes as economy depends of the combination of all these factors. The economy of a country, in general, may be doing great, there may also not be any political disturbances and even the charts may be prompting you to go ahead and buy but a major natural disaster can change all this and may prompt you to sell everything you hold or even what you do not hold. Trading is not a game but a business and a multi-dimensional analysis and eyes and ears on every factor which may affect the price movement are required.\n\nFor day trading the short time frame Forex charts e.g. hourly or 30 minutes are very important but the same should not be ignored even for long-term trading. A daily chart (1-day chart) may be giving a signal to buy but an hourly chart may give the signal that the prices may go down. In such situations we may wait for the prices to go down a bit more before buying that currency pair to maximize our pip profits.\n\nMy personal experience with some of the commonly occurring Forex chart patterns has generally been very successful. The main reason is that I never take trading decisions based on the trading chart of a particular time-frame but always use a long time frame chart (e.g. daily) and shorter time frame charts e.g. hourly and 3-hourly. Why, I raised the point of these commonly occurring chart formation or patterns is because always look for those Forex chart patterns while analyzing the price movement based on your chosen technical analysis indicators. The reason is simple that you would find these chart patterns working miraculously most of the times and if your technical indicators are suggesting one trading move for a currency pair but the chart pattern is suggesting otherwise then you may prefer to follow the advice of the chart patterns or the combination of the technical indicators and moves suggested by the chart patterns for the short-term moves.\n\nForex Analysis - Other factors:\n\nYou may find a question on many Forex forums whether people really make profits out of currency trading. My answer is always that if no one makes money then no one would be trading Forex as speculative investment. So the answer is that if one can make profits, and I know many who make, then anyone can have success if they learn and maintain the trading discipline. What it needs to be successful is taking your trading decisions considering a combination of technical analysis indicators while not ignoring market fundamentals and economic releases and also keeping the eyes open for emerging chart patterns. And well, did I forgot the trading discipline and money management? If I did while typing this, please don't forget while you trade.\n\nRepeating: With all the technical and fundamental analysis correct and in place please do not forget the psychological factors and trading discipline/money management which can make or break a Forex trader. Please read our trading psychology section also.\n\nAnother famous question which never seem to go away and that is the comparision of Fundamental and Technical analysis. Technical analysis Vs. Fundamental analysis and which is better for trading? Well, analysis tools cannot be compared with girlfriend or wife where we have the moral issue about having more than one. Oooops!!! My apologies to fellow ladies traders. Well, I include husbands and boyfriends also. In a relationship if you have more than one then you are in a big problem but in the trading if you are having only one then you are in a very big problem. Technical and fundamental analysis complement each other and hence never give an option to select one of the two. Analyze the market technically while considering the fundamental factors as mentioned above. And yes, if you trade with only technical analysis then please use a combination of technical analysis indicators and that too on the charts of a combination of time frames (hourly, daily and so on).\n\nPlease visit Technical Analysis Indicators page for the details of important and commonly used indicators for analysis of price action, This page also details other tools which help in analyzing the market technically reflects"

This order was not active when you tried to submit your new EnterShortLimit() correct? What I am interested in are the active orders and positions as you sent EnterShortLimit(). Thank you.\n\nAnd you're correct -- that sell stop order was NOT active when EnterShortLimit() was called the next day -- that stop order was active\non the previous day, and cancelled prior to the previous day's close.\n\nEnterShortLimit() was called in OnExecution() in response to a fill on a BUY order.\n\nThere were no open positions and no other orders when that order was filled, so the position went from flat to long 1 contract at the time, and\nthe 'Control Center' didn't show any open orders -- the buy order went to a 'Filled' state, EnterShortLimit() was then executed, which generated two\norders to sell -- the 'Close' order and the 'Target' order -- and then the target order was immediately cancelled, which generated the 'Cancelled\npending entry order on opposite side of the market' message in the trace log --\n\nYes that's true, but notice from the trace log output in my original post that the fill on the first PlaceOrder() call in the trace order output fragment you highlight happened in the same second that the order was placed -- in this case my buy limit price of 8819 was above the current market price of about 8795, so the order was filled immediately. The resolution on the timestamps in the trace order output are to the second so that fact is concealed in that output, whereas the timestamps show more precision in the trace log written in My Documents\\NinjaTrader 6.5\\trace --\n\nIs a race condition possible here ? It seems like even though the execution event is shown to occur a fraction of a second before EnterShortLimit() is invoked,\nthe buy order is still somehow being treated as active.\n\nThose two PlaceOrder() entries at 12/9/20089:33:02 AM in the trace order output you highlight must correspond to the EnterLongLimit() call that produced the long position, and the EnterShortLimit() call that got triggered in OnExecution() from the buy fill, since those are the only two calls shown in the trace order output up to that time, and the trace log only shows the fill and the short order at that time.\n\nYou are definitely hitting a race condition. Depending on how you are coding this. What are you checking? The IOrder for a fill or the actual execution event for a fill? You cannot check the IOrder for a state of filled because the IOrder can be filled while you have not received all the execution events for that fill yet. You need to run your own check for fill manually via tracking the quantity of the execution events received. execution.Quantity and compare it to your order quantity.\n\nSo I wasn't using the IExecution value being passed to OnExecution().\nI'm just checking Position.MarketPosition (so I'll fix that), but in this case the order was for a single contract, so a partial fill wasn't possible.\n\nSo given that, in this case shouldn't the check 'Position.MarketPosition == MarketPosition.Long' be sufficient to safely call EnterShortLimit() ?\n\nI was also wondering if OnBarUpdate() might be executed at the same time as OnExecution() as a result of multi-threading, but note that I have CalculateOnBarClose = true;\nbeing set in Initialize(), so I was thinking OnBarUpdate() wouldn't be called again until the next bar started forming (this was a 1 minute chart).\n\nI recommend you not use MarketPosition from OnExecution. If you are using OnExecution I recommend you access the IExecution object directly. You may even want to go even further down and just use OnPositionUpdate.\n\nOk. The documentation recommends using OnExecution() to drive strategy logic based on fills, and states that On Execution() is always called after OnOrderUpdate() -- but when is OnPositionUpdate() called ??\n\nI didn't get a clear idea of the difference between OnExecution() and OnPositionUpdate() from the documentation.\n\n().\n\nThanks for all the help, and the quick replies -- I wish the support people at TradeStation would respond like this.\n\nOnPositionUpdate comes after OnExecution. It is easiest to program a closed loop from OnPositionUpdate. You need to be careful though, you are not guaranteed to receive an OnPositionUpdate() event for every execution event."

Or head to Atlantic City and bet on the Ravens to win the Super Bowl?\n\nFirst, some definitions.\n\nYou're almost certainly familiar with the stock market, a regulated marketplace in which individuals (and others) trade small pieces of the ownership of companies. While a stock market is based on speculation — on the idea that company value will rise and along with it the value of the share of stock — taking ownership of a share of stock means taking immediate ownership over that (very, very small) piece of the company.\n\nFutures are much more speculative. A future is a type of derivative, a regulated contract between two parties tied to some economic event. (For the sake of simplicity, we'll use futures as the case example for derivatives in this article.) Buying a futures contract usually means committing to buying a good or commodity at a future point in time. Buy a contract for corn prices in May, and you theoretically agree to buy corn in May at a set price. The majority of futures speculators are less interested in owning a bunch of corn than they are in hoping that the price at which they bought the contract will be much lower than the price of corn in May. If that happens, people who do want the corn can agree to buy it from the contract-holder — at the new higher price.\n\nPredictions markets are similar to futures markets, except in what they offer for speculators. Predictions markets don't create a contract to assume possession of a good; rather, they are pure speculation. Convinced that polls are underestimating your candidate's chances of being elected president? A prediction market will let you bet on his chances at a certain dollar amount. If the polls suddenly shift, the price of placing a bet on him will rise. On Election Day, if that price is more than you paid, you'll make a profit — whether or not he wins. (Though if he doesn't win, that price will plummet pretty fast.)\n\nAnd then there's gambling. Like Galloping Gert in the fourth race at Aqueduct? Pay your money; take your chances.\n\nIf you noticed a spectrum in that presentation, there's a good reason for that. The line between each — particularly the latter three — is blurry. As economist Justin Wolfers, who worked for bookies as a boy back in his native Australia, told WGBH Boston last year: \"Conceptually, to an economist, there's not a difference between betting and trading — apart from the fact that one sounds more polite than the other.\"\n\nErik Snowberg, professor of economics and political science at the California Institute of Technology and occasional collaborator with Wolfers, likewise isn't surprised that there's confusion in the differentiation. \"The lines are obviously fuzzy,\" he suggested when we spoke earlier today. \"Even the language that people use is the same.\" People investing in the futures market say they're taking a bet on a commodity. People betting on the Ravens in Vegas say they're taking a position on the team.\n\nWhat differentiates between them comes down to one thing: The law. One key (but not universal) distinction between prediction markets and gambling, for example, is that most of the former don't operate using real money, sometimes instead offering prizes for those whose fake-money bets do the best. That's a subtle legal distinction. And the law comes down to a decent amount of subjectivity, no small amount of lobbying, and two somewhat opaque standards. Snowberg explains that legal lines largely depend on the social value of what's being traded.\n\n\"One of them is providing liquidity or hedging,\" Snowberg explained, admitting that hedging had gotten a bit of a black eye during the 2008 economic crisis, thanks to banks' hyperactive efforts to limit the fallout from bad mortgage lending. But in other, less global-economy-destroying ways, hedging provides a safety net for the economy. Lock in a futures price on oil, and companies can better plan for future operations with set costs.\n\nThe second social value? If the market provides information. \"The public may not see the value,\" Snowberg suggests, \"but … most economists feel the value of the information provided by predictions markets is strong enough that they should be allowed.\" This is a key point at which subjectivity enters the equation. While predictive markets don't allow for hedging, since there's nothing besides money tied to the bet, they someday could.\n\nIn fact, the reason InTrade was banned in the United States is because it began to cross the line between the two. As the Financial Times notes:\n\nInTrade is structured as a series of futures markets, and allows participants (who might equally easily be called gamblers or investors) to stake bets on the likelihood of different outcomes taking place. When applied to sports results, this is in practice a form of spread betting. When applied to securities markets, it appears to have come too close to being a fully fledged futures exchange for regulators to swallow.\n\n[W]hen InTrade goes and launches contracts on the price of oil and gold, then they're clearly crossing that line. This is futures speculation, there's a legal way to do it, and what InTrade is doing isn't that legal way. … It looks like an oil futures contract and it quacks like an oil futures contract, so they're not going to let it happen just because you phrase it as a \"prediction market.\"\n\nBut it's not that simple. The \"legal way\" requires that commodities be regulated by the CFTC — regulation that, according to Snowberg, InTrade sought for years. As early as 2005, Tradesports (InTrade's previous iteration) sought CFTC approval; the creation of independent InTrade was meant to satisfy the CFTC's requirements. It didn't work. While the commodities trades weren't the only reason the CFTC shut down American InTrade activity, it was a primary component.\n\nSnowberg is clearly a prediction markets hawk. He suspects that the lines between futures trading and predictions trading will probably be crossed not in the prediction-to-futures direction, as InTrade attempted, but in the other direction, backed by large financial institutions. \"Once a bank sees some sort of value, that they can make a big profit,\" he thinks, \"absolutely it will become a thing.\" And if the banks get involved, Snowberg worries, the market will lose transparency in the banks' bid to turn a profit.\n\n[T]he 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform gave the [CFTC] broad new powers to regulate prediction markets \"in the public interest\". This April it rejected a request by Nadex, a Chicago-based derivatives exchange, to offer contracts on the elections.\n\nThe introduction of Dodd-Frank suggests one way the line between futures markets and predictive markets might be erased: political power. What Nadex and Ireland-based InTrade lack in Capitol Hill clout, it's safe to say that Goldman Sachs has in spades.\n\nIn 2008, Snowberg, Wolfers, and a number of other economics and legal scholars offered a two-step plan to broaden the use of predictive markets in the United States. The first was to have the CFTC establish clear guidelines for under which prediction markets could safely operate. The second was that Congress should offer its support for the creation of such markets. Perhaps given previous government forays into such markets, the proposal didn't get very far.\n\nBut having such innovation driven by the public sector is almost certainly preferable to having it driven by financial companies. There may come a day when you can head down to your broker or off-track-betting parlor and bet on the next Pope, agree to take ownership of 10,000 barrels of oil in June, and put $50 on the Tigers to win the World Series. If that sounds good to you, recognize two caveats. The first is that it would require the retraction of a number of laws meant to prevent risky cross-pollinated economic activity. And, second, that you'd probably be paying your user fees to Bank of"

Each candle is calculated and plotted using some information from the previous candle:\n\n1- Close price: the close price in a Heikin-Ashi candle is the average of open, close, high and low price.\n\n2- Open price: the open price in a Heikin-Ashi candle is the average of the open and close of the previous candle.\n\n3- High price: the high price in a Heikin-Ashi candle is chosen from one of the high, open and close price of which has the highest value.\n\n4- Low price: the low price in a Heikin-Ashi candle is chosen from one of the high, open and close price of which has the lowest value.\n\nSo candles of a Heikin-Ashi chart are related to each other because the close and open price of each candle should be calculated using the previous candle close and open price and also the high and low price of each candle is affected by the previous candle. So a Heikin-Ashi chart is slower than a candlestick chart and its signals are delayed (like when we use moving averages on our chart and trade according to them).\n\nRange chart- Charts based upon price range make a new price bar (or candlestick,\n\nline, etc.) every time the price has moved a specific distance.

The charts ignore the passage of time. Kagi charts have no time axis and are made up of a series of vertical lines, however in the case of Kagi charts, the vertical lines are based solely on the action of closing prices. Another difference is that the thickness of a Kagi chart line changes when closing prices penetrate the previous column top or bottom.\n\nChange Timescale\n\nThere are three ways to change the timescale of a chart: 1.

Can I get some clarification please?\n\nSo my logic is:\n\nFor normal divergences-\n\nIn a downtrend price makes a LL, while the indicator makes a HL. How does this show strength? Stregth as in buying interest outweighs selling interest or strength as in stregth of the underlying move?\n\nAnyway, The indicator shows momentum is building towards increase of prices buy signal? On the other handthe Stochasti would be moving out of oversold territory. Does this not mean the price move is likely to continue. So confused ?!\n\nIn an uptrend price makes HH, while the indicator makes a LH. This indicates momentum towards lower prices- sell signal? Why are bulls considered \"exhausted\" isn't price moving OUT of overbought territory signaling likely continuation of the prior up move?\n\nFor hidden divergences-\n\nIn an uptrend price makes HL, while the indicator makes LL. How does this signal strength and continuation of trend. Is it not the same as price making HH and indicator making LH- momentum towards lower prices ?!?\n\nIn a downtrend price makes LH, while the indicator (MACD, Stochastic, RSI) makes HH. Is this not a buy signal? Does it not show tendency towards higher prices being reached in the near future. On the website it says it shows underlying weakness (of what?) and continuation of move to the downside.\n\nPS. Using the MACD or Stochastic or RSI should not yield a difference, correct?\n\nI am completely confused and it has become utterly impossible for me to understand the logic behind these divergences. I can still learn it by hearth by this would lead to very unfavourable outcomes in the long term. PLEASE somebody help me and clarify this for me. I will be most grateful.\n\nFor you to understand divergence in great detail you may want to look in the fundamentals of the indicators you are using, such as the RSI or MACD. You can then ask yourself the question \"why is the RSI showing a Higher Low, while price is making a Lower Low\"...it is actually very difficult to explain in pure mathematics and would require a lot of workings and examples to prove this.\n\nSo for now, just learn that if price making lower lows and the indicator is making higher lows, then price could turn to the upside. The opposite is also true for price moving to the downside.\n\nYou really need to just 'assume' this and take it as a given rule.\n\nIt's like when you learn to drive a car, you are told that the brake pedal will slow the car down, but you are not told every detail on how the breaks operates, what the mechanics are and why it works in the way it does.\n\nLast edited by Jezzode; 06-17-2012 at 01:28 PM.\n\nYou learn more looking for the answer to a question than you do being told the answer straight away.\n\nI too have been studying WHY osc diverge. I have noticed that divergence at key s/r levels are important, esp on 30 min + charts.\nMy theory:\nOscillators are lagging price, if price makes a push, faster and more determined to a particular level - say an obvious stop raid - then price will leave the osc even further behind thus creating divergence. Being a stop raid then price will turn back -this is why, in hindsight, it is possible to see these highs and lows with osc divergence.\nIt seems to me that in a ranging market these divergences can help with entries and exits.\nStill studying type 2 , work in proress.\n\nI've been researching Divergence for over two years now, as it's a core factor within my own trading. One comment that I can make with a high degree of significance is that any divergence on it's own merit will not provide you with an edge. There are as many false divergence signals as there are true divergence signals, and thus should be combined with other solid trading techniques. Divergence can work will with Fib's on the retrace and extension levels, and also at significant levels of support and resistance, although these 'significant' levels will change in the views of other people and so are open for negation. As for oscillators lagging with price, I dont really think that is true, they are up-to-date with price action and if used correctly on the close price of each time frame candle they can be a very valuable tool.\n\nYou learn more looking for the answer to a question than you do being told the answer straight away.\n\nhi....it looks like jezzode knows his stuff...but i am new to forex..\nthe way i look at divergence and hidden divergence is that i dont actually put much weight on it..\nthe way i look at it..prices even of pairs that have high correlation...must diverge all the time...otherwise cross currency pairs would be a straight line. chart.\n\nanother thing is if a pair or oscillator shows divergence then all it is saying is the rate of change between corrolated pairs is different....so whats the big deal...if your price action on the charts say trade ..only then is it good to trade.\n\nsome may say ...well that means that the smart money is buying lots of euro/gbp.......but if someone is buying lots of euro ..then someone must be selling lots of euro/gbp...so it really balances out.\nor maybe somone is selling lots of gbp/usd ..so to me it doesnt carry much weight..\n\ni would say put more weight on actual price action on the chart and be more alerted when support and resistance lines are being broken..the charts have all the information you need...and its the best indicator in the world...its precise and its current.\n\nplus i would assume divergence may happen when say uk wants to pay america for its gas or something.. the americans need paying no matter what the market is saying ..\n\nso like i said im no expert...but for now i wouldnt worry too much...you may get caught up in a lot of confusion..\ni think its more important to grasp the real basics and get a good fundamental trading technique..and then add to it as you learn along the way...as it can get extremely complex., and i also think you should put the indicators in the dustbin...seriously i went that route at first...and they have to be really studied hard to understand how to use even one of them properly.\nor take them with a pinch of salt...and just use them for added confirmation of your price action trading...you wont regret it."

      "text": "Reversal patterns, or tops and bottoms, signify a fundamental change in the long term trend.\n\nOverview\n\nTops are usually less stable and shorter than bottoms.\n\nBottoms usually have smaller price variations and are slower to establish.\n\nVolume is usually more important on the upside.\n\nConfirmation of a top or bottom is in a double top or bottom (or a short channel.)\n\nThe most popular Reversal Patterns include: head and shoulders, double tops and bottoms, triple tops and bottoms, and V-formations.\n\nInterpretation & Signals\n\nHead & Shoulders\n\nThe well known head and shoulders pattern is formed by three peaks; the center peak, or head, is slightly higher than two lower, and not necessarily symmetrical, shoulders. The line joining the bottoms of the two shoulders is called the neckline. Due to fluctuations, the neckline is rarely symmetrical or perfectly horizontal.\n\nThe pattern isn't complete until the neckline is broken. It is often good to wait for confirmation - for example, two successive closes below the neckline. Remember, markets often bounce back to the Neckline after the breakout and this becomes a new level of resistance.\n\nVolume should be assessed to confirm the validity of these patterns. Volume is normally heaviest during the formation of the left shoulder and also tends to be quite heavy as prices approach the peak. The real confirmation of a developing Head and Shoulders pattern comes with the formation of the right shoulder, which is invariably accompanied by distinctly lower volume.\n\nSome traders use the distance between the neckline and the top of the head to project a \"price objective.\" The price objective is determined by measuring from is the top of the head to the neckline, and using this distance from the breakout point downwards.\n\nAn InvertedHead and Shoulderspattern is a mirror image of the Head & Shoulders pattern (forming a market bottom).\n\nDouble Tops\n\nDouble Tops are another reliable and frequently used reversal pattern. This pattern consists of two tops of approximately equal height. A line is drawn below and parallel to the resistance line that connects the two tops. The neckline is a strong support for price level but eventually fails.\n\nAs with a Head and Shoulders, after the two rallies and their respective reversals are completed the double tops is confirmed only when the neckline is broken. The support line then becomes a resistance line, which often holds a market rebound.\n\nA Double Bottom pattern is a mirror image of a double top pattern: The average height of the bottoms gives a good indication of the price objective.\n\nTriple Top\n\nA triple top is a cross between a head and shoulders and double top. This formation consists of three tops of approximately equal height. A line is drawn below and parallel to the resistance line that connects the three tops. The neckline is a strong support for price level but eventually fails. The support line then becomes a resistance line, which usually holds any market rebound.\n\nTriple Bottom\n\nA triple bottom pattern is a cross between an inverted head and shoulders and double bottom pattern.\n\nV- Pattern\n\nThe V pattern is an unusual pattern in that a sharp trend switches from one direction to the other without warning and with high volume at or just after the turn around.\n\nFurther points\n\nTrend reversals offer some of the most important opportunities for entering a market with a good profit potential. They usually represent fundamental changes in the underlying character of a particular market and often go on to yield big moves.\n\nHowever, a market top or bottom is often difficult to identify. It is even more difficult to choose appropriate entry and exit points. One problem is distinguishing between an actual change in trend or merely a congestive phase in the middle of a move. It is usually advisable to wait for prices to actually confirm a trend reversal by developing one of these well-tested and reliable reversal patterns. The actual buy or sell signals are based on a breakout in the direction of the new trend.\n\nHere are some general observations about Reversal patterns:\n\nA breakout through a trend line is used in conjunction with a price pattern to yield signals in terms of both price level and timing.\n\nThe longer the time required to form a pattern and the greater the price fluctuations within it, the more substantial the coming price movement is likely to be. The time frame is normally from several days to several months - intraday patterns are not considered reliable."

      "text": "How does betting on food prices in financial markets work? How does that affect the price?\n\n'Futures contracts' were first created in the United States in the 19th century to help farmers deal with the uncertainties involved in growing crops, such as unforeseen weather conditions. A 'futures contract' enables farmers to sell their crops at a future date, at a guaranteed price. This gives farmers greater certainty when choosing which crops to grow.\n\nTo buy a futures contract you do not need to buy or sell actual food and so financial players entered the market to make money from these contracts. Following the Wall Street Crash in the 1930s, regulations were introduced by the US government to limit speculation on food prices. But these regulations were weakened in the 1990s through corporate lobbying which allowed rampant betting on the price of staple foods by bankers.\n\nComplex contracts were created called 'derivatives'. This just means that the value of the contract is 'derived' from the commodity being traded. But no actual trading of the physical commodity needs to take place. Derivatives are based on the concept of a 'futures' contract but have become more complex.\n\nThe price of derivatives in food is affected by demand and supply. As more derivatives in a food are bought, the more the price of a derivative contract rises. This causes the 'future' price of food to rise. As mentioned above, this rising price of food in the future has a knock-on effect on the real price of food now.\n\nHow do futures prices affect today's food prices?\n\nTo buy a futures contract you do not need to buy or sell actual food. However, the price of food in a futures contract helps to determine the real price of food. If futures prices rise, it is likely to cause the real price of food to rise.\n\nFor example, if a tonne of wheat is selling for £100 today but through a futures contract the farmer can sell that same tonne of wheat for £200 in three months then the farmer may choose to hold back the sale of wheat until then. This reduces the quantity of wheat being sold and with less wheat being sold, today's prices will be pushed up. Alternatively, the farmer may demand £200 now from buyers, in which case the price today will also be pushed up.\n\nRising prices can also increase demand as buyers look to make purchases sooner to avoid future price increases. This increase in demand then pushes up the price of food.\n\nHow is speculation on food prices done and who does it?\n\nThe main way that investors speculate on food commodities is through 'commodity index funds'. These indexes put money into derivatives across a range of commodities (such as oil, metals and food). They were mainly created by banks such as Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank. It is estimated the total money in such index funds increased from US$46 billion in 2005 to US$250 billion by early 2008. Money began to be taken out of the index funds in the months before food prices began to fall dramatically in mid-2008.\n\nCommodity indexes are open for anyone to invest in, just like the FTSE 100 index for shares. However, they are rarely marketed at 'ordinary' people, and instead tend to be used by institutional investors such as pension funds, insurance companies and mutual funds (a professionally managed fund which pools money from individual investors).\n\nBanks play an important part in the working of index funds. Banks tend to arrange the buying of derivatives contracts for their clients as well as act as the seller of contracts the index fund is buying. This effectively means banks are trading against their own clients.\n\nDoesn't speculation simply follow market trends, not create them?\n\nSome speculation does follow market trends. This has the potential to amplify market changes, making them more extreme. However, speculation by index funds in particular does not pay attention to demand and supply in a particular commodity market. In addition financial speculators as a whole are less likely to pay attention to supply and demand than commercial traders.\n\nFinancial traders who put money into commodity speculation do so to diversify the kinds of things they have money in, in addition to more traditional places to put money such as shares, currencies and government bonds. Money therefore comes and goes into and out of commodities for reasons unrelated to the supply and demand of that commodity. This can create price trends, increasing price inflation and volatility.\n\nBut isn't speculation supposed to help stabilise markets?\n\nDefenders of speculation argue that the extra cash (or liquidity) that it brings helps to smooth the process of buying and selling, stabilising the market. They claim that because speculators are believed to buy when prices are low and sell when prices are high they even out price volatility.\n\nHowever, once speculators dominate the market, they can end up creating and following price trends to form bubbles that distort prices – at least in the short and medium term.\n\nEven temporary spikes in food prices can have devastating effects on consumers in poorer countries.\n\nHow do high food prices affect poor people?\n\nHigh food prices means buying less food, or having less money to spend on other things. Higher food prices are causing more people to go hungry. The 2007-8 food crisis pushed another 115 million people into hunger. Food price rises forced 44 million people into extreme poverty in the last six months of 2010 alone. Nearly 1 billion people are now chronically malnourished.\n\nBut the impact of high prices goes well beyond not getting enough to eat. Poor households in developing countries tend to spend between 50 and 90 per cent of their income on food, compared to an average of 10-15 per cent in developed countries. As well as eating less food, households have been forced to:\n\nEat less fruit, vegetables, dairy and meat in order to afford staple foods such as wheat. This can have drastic impacts on protein and vitamin intake. Nutritional deficiencies particularly affect children, pregnant women and unborn children.\n\nReduce any savings or take out loans. This can include selling off assets vital to future income such as land or cattle.\n\nReduce spending on healthcare, education or family planning.\n\nWomen tend to manage the food budget and often bear much of the suffering. Women may also try to increase income through taking on insecure and risky employment as domestic workers, mail-order brides and sex workers.\n\nEven in countries such as the UK, low-income households are badly hit by food price inflation, with prices 6.9 per cent higher in June 2011 than a year earlier.\n\nIs it the high price of food or the fluctuations in food price which are the problem?\n\nBoth. The extreme increase in the price of food caused major problems for households in developing countries as mentioned above. But increased fluctuations also create problems.\n\nIn recent years, there have been greater fluctuations in food prices. These price swings make it difficult for both producers and consumers of food. For instance, farmers may choose to plant a certain crop on the basis of its high price, but find that the price has collapsed by the time they harvest.\n\nExtreme variations in food and oil prices also make it more difficult for governments to plan how to run their economies. Whether they are net importers or exporters of food and oil, big price changes can play havoc with growth rates, tax revenues, debt and inflation. All of which make it more difficult to manage the economy in a sustainable way.\n\nFor instance, the FAO says: \"At the national level, many developing countries are still highly dependent on primary commodities, either in their exports or imports. While sharp price spikes can be a temporary boon to an exporter's economy, they can also heighten the cost of importing foodstuffs and agricultural inputs. At the same time, large fluctuations in prices can have a destabilizing effect on real exchange rates of countries, putting a severe strain on their economy and hampering their efforts to reduce poverty.\"\n\nAren't high prices good for poor farmers in developing countries as they'll get better prices for their produce?\n\nNo, high food prices affect poor farmers as well as the urban poor. Very few poor farmers produce a significant surplus to sell and a high percentage of rural households are net buyers of staple foods. In Kenya and Mozambique, around 60 per cent of rural householders are net buyers of maize.\n\nIn Zambia, 80 per cent of farm households grow maize, but fewer than 30 per cent sell any. Any farmers who do have a surplus to sell may see little benefit of higher prices. The FAO says that consumers in urban areas are more likely to see the effects of higher prices than producers in rural areas. Moreover, large producers which are part of large (sometimes multinational) companies are most able to benefit from high prices.\n\nAfrica has gone from being a net exporter of food in 1970 to a massive net importer. Around 55 per cent of developing countries are net food importers and almost all countries in Africa are now net importers of cereals. This means they are hugely reliant on the world food prices of their staple foods and higher prices have a direct impact on their ability to feed themselves.\n\nWe buy Fairtrade products because it guarantees a high price. Aren't high prices a good thing?\n\nFairtrade products guarantee a fairer, higher price for farmers growing crops in developing countries which are exported to countries like the UK. Typical Fairtrade crops are 'cash crops' like cocoa, coffee and sugar. Higher prices received for such products are good for farmers and communities growing such crops.\n\nOne key aspect of Fairtrade is that it guarantees stable prices. Therefore farmers do not suffer from the wild fluctuations in prices (see above) which are partly caused by financial speculation. However, even farmers benefiting from stable higher prices for their cash crops due to Fairtrade still have to buy staple crops for their own consumption, which continue to fluctuate wildly in price.\n\nThe Fairtrade Foundation states that the majority of its \"farmers like most smallholders, are net food buyers and as such only a minority have gained from increased commodity prices\".\n\nAren't low commodity prices also a problem for developing countries, surely high prices are a good thing?\n\nThrough the 1980s and 1990s many developing countries suffered from low commodity prices, particularly for tropical commodities such as sugar, cocoa, coffee, tea, jute, cotton and rubber. One estimate is that by 2002, developing countries were losing $240 billion a year from the fall in price of then top ten tropical commodity exports since the 1980s. The price of commodities was due to rise.\n\nWhether or not a country's economy has been helped or hindered by high commodity prices in recent years depends on how much the price of commodities it exports increases compared to those it imports. During 2007 and 2008 the price of oil and staple foods, such as wheat and maize, tended to increase a lot more than that of cash crop exports such as cotton, coffee and cocoa. This meant that the amount they were paying to buy the food they ate outweighed the income received from selling cash crops.\n\nMore fundamentally, what is most important for developing countries as a whole is to receive stable prices on which they can plan their economic development. One of the reasons low prices for crops such as coffee were so damaging in the 1990s is that the World Bank had made countries start growing a small number of popular crops assuming that the price would be higher.\n\nSpeculation destabilises countries because it makes prices more volatile as they fluctuate more. Pedro Paez, former Ecuadorian minister for economic policy coordination, says that both high and low prices \"are bad because both are the result of a distortion in the market. For example, the oil price because of speculation on futures went as high as $150 per barrel, and then due to short-selling dropped in four weeks to less than $40. How as an importer or exporter can you plan a sustainable economy under those conditions? If you export just three basic commodities but don't have any idea what the future price will be, your food security is very vulnerable. The lives of millions of people come to depend on the activities of a handful of financial speculators.\"\n\nDid the price of all foods rise in 2007 and 2008?\n\nNo, there were differences in how food prices changed between commodities. There were changes in supply and demand which would have caused price changes without speculation. However speculation amplified the impacts of these price changes. For example, Brazil has rapidly increased production and exports of sugar, with a higher quantity available in the world market, there has been little scope for speculation to amplify a price change.\n\nConsequently, there is evidence that there was no increase in financial speculation in sugar futures in 2007 and 2008. Some important staple foods such as sorghum, millet and cassava are not traded on futures markets – because they aren't produced or consumed in the main trading centres. Prices for such crops rose in 2007/08, though by nowhere near as much as for wheat and, maize and rice.\n\nThis is evidence of the role of financial speculation in driving up prices of crops such as wheat and maize. Specifically in reference to the potato, research for the FAO says: \"being absent in the major commodity exchanges, there is no risk of potato bearing the ill-effects of speculative activity, which cannot be said of cereal commodities\".\n\nHowever, if the price of imported food such as wheat and maize has risen, this is likely to have a knock-on impact on locally produced crops such as sorghum as demand for them increases to replace more expensive foods.\n\nVery little rice is traded on international commodity exchanges or in futures contracts. Yet the price of rice increased far more than that of wheat in 2007 and 2008. Does this mean that speculation was not the problem?\n\nThe international market for rice is very small; about 6-7 per cent of global production. As the rice price rose, key rice exporters such as India, Vietnam and Thailand introduced export bans to protect rice availability for their own people, making the international market even smaller. The rising price also probably prompted households to buy and store more rice, in anticipation of rising prices, which caused prices to rise further.\n\nSome commentators point to rice to show that financial speculation was not a problem. It is undoubtedly the case that the reason the rice price went so high was due to the factors listed above. However, there is strong evidence that the extreme increase in the price of wheat triggered the increase in the price of rice.\n\nIn some countries, most importantly India, rice and wheat are substitutes for each other. India is a large net importer of wheat. The average cost of India's net wheat imports rose from $220 a tonne in 2006 to $255 a tonne in 2007 and $370 a tonne in 2008. As well as causing the local wheat price to rise, this also led to India importing far less wheat in 2008.\n\nNet imports fell from 5 million tonnes in 2007 to just over 700,000 tonnes in 2008. This rise in the price of wheat and fall in wheat imports had knock-on impacts on rice price and demand.\n\nThe global price of wheat increased particularly in late 2007, whilst the rice price increase began in early 2008. Statistical tests show that at times the price of rice is 'caused' by the price of wheat. There was a crucial period at the start of 2008 when statistical tests by a researcher for the FAO have shown that the rise in the price of rice was 'caused' by the rise in the price of wheat.\n\nPrices of rice, wheat and maize 2001-2009, IMF Similarly, a research paper for the World Bank says that there was little change in production or stocks of rice, and the initial increase in world rice price was caused by the increases in wheat prices in 2007. An FAO food outlook report says: \"The shock to demand for rice was largely generated by demand to make up shortfalls in wheat available to consumers.\"\n\nFinancial speculation can be said to have had an impact on the rice price by amplifying the increase in the price of wheat, which in turn triggered the dramatic increase in the price of rice.\n\nWhat has happened to food prices since the food crisis of 2008? Are food prices stable now or are they still volatile?\n\nThe prices of key staples wheat, maize and rice fell sharply after the spike in 2007 and 2008, but generally remained above pre-2006 levels. Food prices have risen again since mid-2010, setting new records for three consecutive months from December and remaining high. Moreover, the volatility of food prices – how much they move around – seems to still be higher than before 2006.\n\nThese recent increases have not yet produced a global food crisis thanks to good 2010 harvests in many African countries that kept prices stable. Rice has also avoided drastic price increases. However high prices are one factor in the food crisis experienced in the Horn of Africa in 2011.\n\nChocolate producers have identified speculation as a key reason why cocoa prices reached an all time high in April 2010. As long as speculators are not regulated they will be able to cause big increases and changes in price, with disastrous consequences for people across the world.\n\nWasn't it the high oil price which caused high food prices in 2007 and 2008?\n\nOil definitely has an impact on food price by affecting the cost of transport fuel and fossil-fuel based fertiliser. But the oil price rise was due in part to speculation as well. The price of a barrel of oil increased from $60 in 2006 to almost $150 in mid-2008, before falling rapidly to $40 in a matter of weeks. Whilst there are underlying reasons for a rising oil price, these extreme swings can only be explained by speculation.\n\nAn April 2010 survey of banks, traders and oil companies found that 70 per cent say speculation is currently increasing the price of oil, on average by $10 to $30 a barrel.\n\nIsn't it a good thing that oil price is high to deter people from using it?\n\nIf high oil prices are sustained several things are likely:\n\nInvesting in alternative and more energy efficient technologies becomes more attractive.\n\nBut investing in increasing oil extraction, particularly from the dirtiest fuels such as tar sands, also becomes more attractive. A high oil price by itself will do nothing to tackle climate change. Government intervention is needed to ultimately keep oil in the ground.\n\nMost developing countries are net oil importers, so higher oil prices add to their import bill. After food, energy is one of the largest expenditures for poorer people.\n\nWhilst net oil exporters benefit from high oil prices, they are affected by the high volatility of the oil price. Whether they are net importers or exporters of food and oil, big price changes can play havoc with growth rates, tax revenues, debt and inflation. All of which makes it more difficult to manage the economy in a sustainable way.\n\nFor real demand and supply reasons oil prices are likely to continue rising over the medium-term. This is a reason for all countries to invest in cleaner alternatives. But large swings in oil price, and artificially high prices, are likely to create more problems than they solve.\n\nSurely there are much more important factors driving the movement of food prices – isn't speculation relatively unimportant?\n\nThere are many factors driving the movement of food prices. Increased use of biofuels diverts food from humans to being fuel for cars. Changes in crop yields from year to year affect food supply, and such changes are likely to get more extreme as climate change increases. Increases in oil and fertiliser prices also make farming more expensive, and so increase the price of food.\n\nNo one campaign or policy can tackle all the complexities which cause hunger in our world. Governments need to support smallholder farmers who produce most of the world's food and should invest in food reserves to help promote stable prices. But excessive speculation is a perversion, amplifying price movements and making them worse.\n\nIt can be regulated simply and painlessly. Doing so would also have other benefits.\n\nWhat regulation is needed to curb speculation on food?\n\n'Position limits' to cap the share of the market held by financial speculators (as opposed to actual food traders using futures markets to insure themselves against the risk of price changes).\n\nClearing of almost all derivatives on regulated exchanges, instead of secretive, private 'over-thecounter' deals (which currently account for 84 per cent of derivatives trading). This would increase transparency, allowing everyone to see what is being traded at what price. It would also ensure that most derivative trading is subject to proper oversight and regulation, which does not currently happen for over-the-counter trading.\n\nThe European commission is drawing up proposals to regulate speculation, mainly through the 'Markets in Financial Instruments Directive' (MiFID). These will be considered by the European Parliament and member country finance ministers. The UK government could be a major stumbling block to effective regulation.\n\nWhat's the problem with the UK government's plans?\n\nThe UK government accepts the need for more transparency but does not want to introduce position limits. Instead ministers are in favour of 'position management', which they say gives regulators the flexibility to intervene in the market when necessary. In practice however, they have tended to be so hands-off that position management has amounted to complete deregulation.\n\nClear position limits are needed to limit the influence of financial speculators and effectively stabilise the futures market.\n\nWhat are the other benefits of regulating commodity speculation?\n\nBecause the price of commodity futures has been increasingly driven by financial speculation, it has become more difficult for real buyers and sellers of food to use futures to manage their risk. For example, a subcommittee of the US senate has found that in 2007 and 2008 some US farmers were unable to afford future contracts to manage the risks involved in farming.\n\nLarge amounts of money tied up in futures contracts is also a waste of resources. Instead of being used on speculation, resources could be used on genuine assets and investment to increase production. This opportunity cost is particularly pertinent following the credit crunch, as small and medium sized businesses have struggled to secure sufficient capital.\n\nLimiting speculation on commodities could divert resources to being invested in genuinely productive activities.\n\nWhat are the benefits of futures contracts?\n\nFutures contracts are useful to farmers and processors of food to manage the risk of price changes. Some 'speculation' is needed for farmers and processors to do this. Speculators are effectively needed to provide insurance. However, there is no reason for the excessive amount of speculation we have seen in recent years.\n\nLimiting the amount of speculation would prevent excessive speculation, whilst still enabling farmers and processors to use futures as a form of insurance for which they were originally intended.\n\nWhat is happening elsewhere on food and speculation?\n\nSince the food and oil price spikes in 2007 and 2008, the US government has expressed concern over the impact of financial speculation. Gary Gensler, appointed by President Obama as Chairman of the US regulator the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), says: \"I believe that increased speculation in energy and agricultural products has hurt farmers and consumers.\"\n\nIn 2010 the US passed legislation to re-regulate financial markets. However, implementation of measures to curb commodity speculation is being slowed by political and financial opposition to reforms. There is a strong campaign of over 400 groups in the US campaigning for regulation of commodity speculation, including civil society organisations, farmers and businesses.\n\nAction in Europe would also help the campaign in the US. Food speculation has also been on the G20 agenda in 2011. A strong mandate from G20 leaders to tackle commodity speculation could ensure that food speculation is curbed around the globe.\n\nWhat we've achieved recently\n\n2013\n\nTwo years of concerted campaigning"

      "text": "No risk, please!\n\nSuppose you are a bank director. A customer enters your office and states that she would like to contract with you to purchase five hundred shares of a certain telecom company ...\n\nThis is an article from the book \"Five-minute mathematics\" by Ehrhard Behrends which was published in 2008 by the American Mathematical Society (AMS). It is reproduced here with the kind permission of the AMS.\n\nSuppose you are a bank director. A customer enters your office and states that she would like to contract with you to purchase five hundred shares of a certain telecom company next January 1. She says that she hopes and expects that the share price then will be at most 20 euros. If the price is greater, she would like you-the bank-to make up the difference.\n\nThese days, such arrangements are nothing unusual. They are called options. For the customer, the security that the proposed contact offers is not to be had for nothing. When the contract is signed, she will pay a certain premium. What should you do with this money in order to be able to fulfill your contractual obligations come January 1?\n\nThe magic word that allows this problem to be solved is hedging. In the mathematics of finance, hedging your bets amounts to the clever insuring against risk.\n\nFrom the dictionary:\n\nhedge: 1. A row of closely planted shrubs or low-growing trees forming a fence or boundary. 2. A line of people or objects forming a barrier: a hedge of spectators along the sidewalk. 3. a. A means of protection or defense, especially against financial loss: a hedge against inflation. b. A securities transaction that reduces the risk on an existing investment position. 4. An intentionally noncommittal or ambiguous statement.\n\nhedgehog: 1. Any of several small insectivorous mammals of the family Erinaceidae of Europe, Africa, and Asia, having the back covered with dense, erectile spines and characteristically rolling into a ball for protection.\n\nThe underlying idea is simple and quite clever. In addition to the money received from your customer, you borrow money at market rates and use it-customer's money plus borrowed money-to purchase telecom shares.\n\nAnd to what purpose? If the share price rises by January 1, they will be worth enough for you to be able to pay what you owe the options holder together with the money that you borrowed plus interest. If the price falls, that is a pity, but then the options holder has no demand against you, and the proceeds from the sale of the stock should suffice to pay back what you borrowed.\n\nIn sum, to insure against loss in a telecom stock transaction, some of the stock is purchased. No matter how things develop, you have placed a bet on both a rise and a fall in the stock price.\n\nMathematics comes into play in the determination of a fair price for the option, and how much stock the bank should purchase. Based on the \"natural law of financial markets\", namely, that there can be no profit without risk, the amount in question comes from solving a simple equation. What makes things complicated is that one must keep track of the markets throughout the option period. As stock prices and interest rates change, one must determine whether some of the stock should be sold or more money borrowed for an additional purchase.\n\nA Hedge for One Thousand Shares\n\nLet us look at hedging through a concrete example. It is January. You would like to take out an option for the purchase of one thousand shares of Intergalactic Enterprises at the end of the year. If purchased today, the cost of the shares would be 10 000 euros. However, the price at the end of the year is uncertain. It could be 16 000 euros, but it could just as well be only 8000, depending on a host of factors. (For the sake of simplicity, let us assume that one of these prices will obtain at year's end and that we will do no trading during the year.) Come December, you will have 12 000 euros available, and if the price is 8000 euros, all will be well. However, if the price is 16 000, you would like the bank to make up the difference. How much should the bank ask you to pay for such an insurance policy, and what should it do with the money that you pay?\n\nThe bank officer from whom you are seeking to purchase the option calls down to the credit division and learns that the bank's internal interest rate is 6%: for a distribution of E/1.06 euros today, one has to pay back E euros at year's end. With this information, the options contract can be drawn up. The bank requires you to pay, in return for their guarantee,\n\n5000?\n\n4000\n\n1.06\n\n? 1226\n\neuros. This number does not include the bank's fees, which are where its profit is realized. We are ignoring this issue.\n\nYou sign on the dotted line, and this is how things then develop. The credit division immediately turns over 4000/1.06 ? 3774 euros to the bank officer, who now has available 1226 + 3774 = 5000 euros. She uses this money to purchase 500 shares of Intergalactic, and then forgets about the whole matter until December.\n\nSuppose that the shares have risen. The bank's portfolio for this transaction is now worth 8000 euros (recall our assumption that if the stock rises, one thousand shares would be worth 16 000 euros; the bank purchased only 500). The bank pays you the contracted 4000 euros, and with the 12 000 euros that you had budgeted, you can now purchase 1000 shares of Intergalactic for 16 000 euros. With the remaining 4000 euros, the bank officer repays the credit division.\n\nIf the share price has fallen, then the bank's portfolio is worth only 4000 euros, which is just enough to settle with the credit division. You, the option holder, get nothing, since your 12 000 euros is more than enough to purchase the shares.\n\nThe moral: with a hedging strategy, you were able to insure a risk of 4000 euros relatively cheaply (1226 euros), since 4000 is the amount you would have been short if the stock price had risen."

      "text": "An Option to Supercharge Your Gains\n\nPuts, calls, strike prices, expiration. If you don't get options, I don't blame you. But if you shy away from these instruments out of fear, you're missing out on a rare chance to increase your trading gains.\n\nLet me show you how…\n\nYes, option investing can be intimidating. After all, the financial press blames derivatives (like options) for a major part of the financial crisis of 2008. Options move violently — and they can expire completely worthless. It's no surprise, then, that most investors avoid options at all costs.\n\nBut when used intelligently, options can significantly increase your profitability by magnifying stock gains while limiting risk to your initial investment (unlike traditional leverage, which can actually leave you owing money).\n\nTo be sure, options can be incredibly complex. Today, we'll just look at an overview of how options work — and how they apply to your next trade.\n\nHow Options Work\n\nBasically, an option is a contract that gives its owner the right to buy or sell a stock at a predetermined price on a predetermined date. Buying call options gives you the right to buy shares of a stock at that price, whereas buying put options gives you the right to sell them at that price.\n\nTime is an important factor for options. Options expire on the third Friday of each month (unless it's a holiday, in which case they expire on the preceding Thursday) — that date, known as the expiration date, is a major contributor to the option's value. The further that date is from now, the longer the stock (known as the \"underlying\") has to increase in value. That potential value (known as extrinsic value) decreases as time passes.\n\nAn option's real value is the difference between the strike price (the price you can buy or sell on the contract) and the price of its underlying stock. For an oversimplified example, let's say that today is Jan. 1, and you own $10 March call options on General Electric. If GE currently trades for $15, the difference between the $10 strike price and $15 share price is the stock's intrinsic, or real, value.\n\nIt's the option's real value because it's the gain you'd book if you exercised the option today — think about if you use the option to buy GE shares for $10 and then resell them on the market for $15. That's a $5 per share profit. But that option doesn't trade for just $5 — because GE still has months to appreciate, the option may cost closer to $6. That possible extra dollar is the extrinsic, or time, value.\n\nOptions are interesting because of the size of their moves. If GE moved $2 higher, the company's stock would have gained 13% — not bad for a blue chip. But our $6 option would have gained more than 33% in real value alone.\n\nThere's a difference between being an options investor and being an options trader. Generally speaking, traders have little interest in holding onto options plays until expiration — I'm a fan of that camp myself. Instead, we aim to buy for a jump in our options' prices and then sell for a gain…\n\nSo, how do you get started in the options game?\n\nTo start, look back at your trading portfolio and see what would have happened if you'd bought an option instead of a stock. By experimenting with how options would have impacted your profits after the fact, you can get a much better idea of how different strike prices and expiration dates impact option prices.\n\nI would strongly advise against adding options to your portfolio until you have some experience paper trading them and understand more of the technical features of options. But as a starting point, experimenting with your past real world trades is a great way to flatten the learning curve.\n\nI'll show you some more options tricks in the coming weeks. If you have any options questions for me, send them to editor@pennysleuth.com"

      "text": "The famous German airship known as the Hindenburg became one of history's most prominent images of disaster when it burst into flames while attempting to land at Lakehurst, NJ, in 1937.\n\nThe doomed airship later became the moniker for a technical tool invented to predict a potential stock market crash.\n\nThe underlying concepts of the Hindenburg Omen revolve around market breadth theories created by Norman Fosback, an investment strategist who co-founded The Institute for Econometric Research in 1971.\n\nThe theory suggests that when markets are hitting new highs, the number of companies posting 52-week highs should be greater than the number experiencing 52-week lows. Conversely, when the market is creating new lows, the number of companies trading at their 52-week lows should outnumber the companies recording new highs.\n\nThere are three technical indicators that, when met, signal a \"warning\":\n\nFirst, the number of NYSE new highs and lows must be higher than 2.8% of the advances plus declines.\n\nSecond, the number of new highs cannot be more than twice the number of new lows.\n\nAnd third, the NYSE composite must be above its 50-day moving average.\n\nAll these conditions were met on July 24, triggering a Hindenburg Omen warning.\n\nWhen that happens, a 30-day cautionary period begins.\n\nA second reading within that time period suggests a 77% probability of at least a 5% decline in the following 40 days.\n\nOver and over again, the Hindenburg has proven to be about as good as it gets when it comes to being able to identify crashes before they happen.\n\nBetween 1985 and 2006, the omen rang the alarm before every stock market crash or panic event, Robert McHugh, CEO of Main Line Investors, told USA Today.\n\nEven better, this signal doesn't come around all that often. It only created a signal on 160 separate days, or 3.2% of the approximate 5,000 days that he studied.\n\nThe signal flashed seven times in 2008, as the S&P 500 posted its biggest annual drop since the Great Depression.\n\nThe last time the Hindenburg alarm went off was in August 2011. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSEARCA:DIA) then proceeded to plunge 16.2% from its July highs.\n\nAnalysts Issue Warnings\n\nThe Hindenburg isn't the only reason to believe the market could be in for a reversal.\n\nRobert Prechter, author of Conquer the Crash, warns that today's economy looks eerily like the Great Depression and deflation will cause financial chaos.\n\nPrechter predicts that the major U.S. stock indexes will plunge below their bear market lows hit in March 2009 during the last financial crisis.\n\n\"For the third time in a dozen years, the stock market is in a very bearish position,\" Prechter told USA Today.\n\nIf he's right, stocks would lose more than half their value.\n\nPrepare Now for Stock Market Crash 2013\n\nWe don't yet have a secondary confirmation of the Hindenburg Omen, so there's still time to get ready for a market tumble.\n\nShorting stocks or purchasing \"put\" options on an index is the most obvious strategy.\n\nYou can also purchase specialized inverse funds like the ProShares Short Dow30 ETF (NYSEARCA:DOG),that actually rises when the big blue chips fall.\n\nFinally, it's a great time to put together a \"shopping list\" of stocks you want to buy, as they become cheap relative to their intrinsic value.\n\nMoney Morning Chief Investment Strategist Keith Fitz-Gerald has strongly encouraged investors to look at \"glocal\" companies as a way to weather even the worst stock market swoons.\n\nThese are large, U.S.-based multinational corporations like McDonald's Corp. (NYSE:MCD) and Altria Group Inc. (NYSE:MO) that rake in profits from global operations but also have a local presence.\n\nAgain, we're not saying you should be market timers. Study after study has shown the dangers of that approach. But the Hindenburg Omen may be suggesting caution is in order, along with a little preparation.\n\nBy being opportunistic, you can take steps to preserve your wealth against a stock market crash and capitalize on opportunity when it knocks"

The other people are the ones that enter the trade only buying the stock for a swing trade or maybe even a trend trade and when the stock is getting mature in its swing they sell calls against it looking for a consolidation when the stock drops you can usually get most the premium in a few days thus enhancing their return while still owning the stock.

Your broker makes money off of your commissions and thus wants to keep you happy so you keep using his service. The broker also wants to you accumulate assets so you generate more commissions for him.\n\nWhat will actually happen if you have long term successful performance is the broker will shop you around to the asset allocators in order to increase your assets under management and thus generate more commissions for his pocket.\n\nYou will become bigger and bigger with almost no initial effort on your part.\n\nYou can be assured that the broker will do this because if he doesn't he knows his competition will and if he doesn't beat them to the punch you will be lured away and he will lose everything.\n\nAs I said on the \"What's the difference between trader and portfolio manger?\" thread: \"Talent is not invisible………There is no invisible white whale in finance.\"\n\nIf your performance is good the broker will be trying his best to keep you rather than steal from you.\n\nThe fact is if you are good your problem will be trying to figure out your asset capacity rather than a broker risking losing your business while he attempts to reverse engineer your methodology"

This tool, consisting of three trendlines, is created by drawing the first trendline from the most recent low to the most recent high when the asset is in an uptrend, and from the most recent high to the most recent low when the asset is in a downtrend. The other two trendlines are drawn with smaller angles in an attempt to predict areas that will act as possible barriers in the event of a retracement.\n\nInvestopedia explains 'Speed Resistance Lines'\n\nSpeed resistance lines are similar in interpretation to the Fibonacci Fan indicator. Many traders will watch for a move below the two-thirds level to signal a continued retracement toward the one-third level. It is important to remember that other technical indicators should be used when the price of the asset is near the trendline to confirm the strength of the predicted support/resistance"

At the basic level the journal is a record or log of trades taken, the day and time of the trade, the entry and exit prices, long or short, size, stops and targets, number of points made, commissions and net profit/loss.\n\nTrading seems so easy on the surface. Forex beginners are told (and believe), \"Just follow the rules of your methodology and trading plan and you are on your way to achieving your dreams. Oh, and by the way, keep your emotions in check.\"\n\nThe Art of War is an ancient Chinese military essay credited to Sun Tzu (also referred to as \"Sun Wu\" and \"Sunzi\"), a prominent military general, strategist and tactician. Regarded as a seminal military manuscript, it was written during what is known as the 'Era of Warring States', which resulted in a unified China under the Qin Dynasty.\n\nBy the end of every year people are making resolutions of all kinds. Let us admit that the majority of these resolutions are not practical since an actual planning has never been involved. Let us then talk about resolutions and goals. This is what forex is about, right? It is about setting goals and actually achieving them. Let us first give a definition of setting a goal.\n\nIs that necessary to keep the stops so religiously even before the forex beginner actually starts live trading ? As a matter of fact, the importance of stops is always underlined, emphasized and highlighted by a thick yellow strip. Is that the crucial key to success?

In some countries, similar shares of stock are known as cent stocks.\n\nConcerns for investors\n\nSince many sub $1.00 stocks are thinly traded, and especially those that trade for fractions of one cent, they are targets for price manipulation. For example, an individual or organization buys up hundreds of thousands, or even millions of shares, then uses web sites, press releases, and e-mail blasts to drive interest to the company.

      "text": "What are Penny Stocks?\n\nBasically, a penny stock is defined as any stock that trades below $5 per share. Many people believe that these type of stocks trade at a share price of less than $1, but in reality the Securities and Exchange Commission uses the $5 threshold. Penny stocks tend to trade infrequently and may fluctuate wildly in price; so if you're new to investing you may be better served focusing on other stocks and investments before dipping your toes in the penny stock pool. For starters, the infrequent trade of penny stocks can make selling your shares more difficult; what's more, it can be hard to accurately price these stocks, so accurate quotes can take some work to come by.\n\nTrading Penny Stocks\n\nIf you decide to trade penny stocks be sure to research the market to see what the demand is for the penny stocks you've selected. Determine whether or not you will be able to successfully sell it in order to close out your position. If you are working with a broker, he or she is legally required by the Securities and Exchange Commission to give you a statement of investment goals explaining why his or her firm feels the determined penny stocks will yield a promising investment for you.\n\nWhen you place an order to buy a penny stock your broker will provide you the offer, bid and compensation on the stock trade. The term \"offer price\" refers to the wholesale price at which the dealer is selling the stock to other dealers. A \"bid\" is the wholesale price your dealer is willing to buy the stock from other dealers. \"Compensation\" is the trade fee a dealer will receive for executing the trade. When it comes to bids and offers, the difference between these prices is known as the dealer's \"spread.\" A profitable transaction occurs when the bid price of your stock is greater than the price of this spread and your dealer's compensation. After you purchase a penny stock, your brokerage firm is required to send you a monthly account statement which details an estimate of the value of each penny stock in your account.\n\nWhether you work with a broker or manage penny stocks on your own, it is worthwhile to do your research and have experience in other types of stocks before venturing into these trades. Many individuals report high gains from the successful trading of penny stocks, but it definitely requires a significant amount of skill and experience to take full advantage of the opportunities penny stocks can offer. For more information, check out the Advisory Services InvestorPlace offers to it users – these services cover a variety of topics and can help you learn more about the topic you're interested in, penny stocks or otherwise.

For instance, you risked 1% of your standard account on a trade, that would translate mean a 10% risk if you had a micro account.\n\nSome traders like to have multiple positions open on different pairs. If a trader of a standard account had 5 trades with 1% risk each, his total risk is only 5%. If the same trader had a micro account with the same position size, his total risk would become 50%. If his trades don't go his way, I bet he'll get margin called!\n\nWho found this interesting?\n\nIndeed. Micro accounts limit exposure and are a great way to familiarise with live trading, particularly for those making the transition from demo trading. Standard accounts take it up a notch, and only really for those with a substantial trading capital and developed trading skills."

      "text": "Screening with the composite indicators\n\nUpdated on 2010-11-09\n\nComposite indicators are very powerful and they can be easily used in the screener tool as trading rules or to display data. The screener basic function is to show you a list of symbols that pass the screen conditions/rules you have specified. If you want to display stocks with an increasing volume then simply adds the appropriate trading rule, for example: volume >= hhv(volume, 10).\n\nThe screener uses an initial list of symbols, calculates, for each symbol, the filter rules you have specified then checks the filter value at a specific date or bar. It will check that value for a specific date if you instruct it to do so otherwise it will check for a bar number (Last bar number minus a lag value - could be equal to zero). These settings can be defined in the \"Screen\" tab of the Screener form.\n\nWhen using composite/index function in the screener, a lot of QuantShare users do not get the expected results when analyzing the screen using the \"Bar\" method.\nFor instance, if they are analyzing 5 stocks and using the \"AddColumn\" function to display the rank of each stock based on the close price value, they may get results that at first appear to be wrong. But these results are not wrong and there is a good reason why they are usually different from what you can expect.\n\nComposite indicators/functions are calculated by dates, which means that, for each trading date, the composite function gets the appropriate values from the stock quotes and then performs its calculation based on these values (from the specified stocks and for the same date). If a stock does not contain a value for that date, then it will not be used (for that date).\nWhen screening by bar, the values displayed by the screener are those from a specific bar number and therefore they are not necessarily based on the same date (Stock1 may have its last bar ends at 10-10-2010 and stock2 may have its last bar ends at 10-11-2010).\nAs a result, composite values that are displayed in the screener grid could be based on different dates and our 5 stocks ranking values may not appear as expected."

      "text": "What You Need to Know About Binary Options\n\nBinary or digital options are a simple way to trade price fluctuations in multiple global markets, but a trader needs to understand the risks and rewards of these often misunderstood instruments. Binary options are different than traditional options. If traded, one will find these options have different payouts, fees and risks, not to mention an entirely different liquidity structure and investment process. When considering speculating or hedging, binary options are an alternative, but only if the trader fully understands the two potential outcomes of these \"exotic options\". (For a overview of exotic options, take a look at Exotic Options: A Getaway From Ordinary Trading.)\n\nWhat Are Binary Options? Binary options are classed as exotic options, yet binaries are extremely simple to use and understand in terms of functionality. Providing access to stocks, indexes, commodities and foreign exchange, the options can also be called a fixed-return option (or FRO). This is because the option has an expiry date/time and also what is called a strike price. If a trader wagers correctly on the direction of the market and the price at the time of expiry is on the correct side of the strike price, the trader is paid a fixed return regardless of how much the instrument moved. A trader who wagers incorrectly on the direction of the market ends up losing a fixed amount of her investment or all of it.\n\nIf a trader believes the market is going higher, he would purchase a \"call\". If the trader believes the market is going lower, she would buy a \"put\". In order for a call to make money, the price must be above the strike price at the time of expiry. In order for a put to make money, the price must be below the strike price at the time of expiry. The strike price, expiry, payout and risk are all disclosed at the outset of the trade. The payout and risk may fluctuate as the market moves, since a call that is \"in the money\" by a great degree stands a good chance of finishing in the money if there is a short time to expiration. Yet, the pay rate out and risk that was locked in by the trader when the trade was taken will stand at expiration. This means different traders, depending on when they enter may have different pay outs.\n\nBinary Option Example A trader is watching the market and based on their analysis predicts the market is going higher, except she is not sure by how much. She decides to buy a (binary) call option on the S&P 500 index. The index is currently at 1105 and she finds a binary option through a broker that offers this strike price and that expires before the end of the day. Since binary options are available on all sorts of time frames - from minutes to months - and with all sorts of strike prices, she has no problem finding one to buy. She finds one that offers a 70% payout if the option expires above the strike price (call option), but if the price is below 1105 at the time of expiry she will lose 90% of her investment.\n\nShe can invest almost any amount she wishes, although this will vary from broker to broker. Often there is a minimum such as $10 and a maximum such as $10,000 (check with a broker for their investment amounts). The trader invests $100 in a call that will expire in 30 minutes. When the 30 minutes is up, she will know if she has made money or lost. The price at expiry may be the last quoted price, or the (bid+ask)/2. Each broker will specify their expiry price rules, and the trader cannot generally cash out or exit the trade before expiration.\n\nIn this case, when the option expired the last quote on the S&P 500 was 1107. Therefore, our trader makes a profit of $70 (or 70% of $100). Had the price finished below 1105, she would have lost $90 (or 90% of $100). If the price had expired exactly on the strike price, it is common for the trader to receive their money back with no profit or loss, although each broker may have different rules as it is an over the counter (OTC) market. Profits and losses are transferred into and out of the traders account by the broker.\n\nThe Upside and Downside There is an upside to these trading instruments, but the upside requires some perspective. A major advantage is that the risk and reward are known. It does not matter how much the market moves in favor or against the trader, there are only two outcomes: win a fixed amount or lose a fixed amount. Also, there are generally no fees, such as commissions, with these trading instruments (brokers may vary). The options are simple to use and there is only decision to make: is the underlying asset going up or down? There are also no liquidity concerns because the trader never actually owns the underlying asset, and therefore brokers can offer innumerable strike prices and expiration times/dates which is attractive to a trader. A final benefit is that a trader can access multiple asset classes in global markets generally any time a market somewhere in the world is open.\n\nAt first glance, it seems like an easy way to get rich, yet there is a downside and one point in particular which violates what is often considered a cardinal trading rule. The major drawback of binary options is that the reward is always less than the risk. This means a trader must be right a high percentage of the time in order to cover losses. While payout and risk will fluctuate from broker to broker and instrument to instrument, one thing remains constant, losing trades will cost the trader more than they can make on winning trades.\n\nAnother disadvantage is that the OTC markets are unregulated, and there is little oversight in the case of a trade discrepancy. While brokers often use a large external source for their quotes, a trader may still find him or herself susceptible to unscrupulous practices, even though it is not the norm. What may also be of concern is that no underlying asset is owned, it is simply a wager on an underlying assets direction. The money invested cannot be withdrawn nor the trade exited until the expiry time/date. However, starting in 2008, some options exchanges such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) began listing binary options. The CBOE is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and so offers investors increased protection compared to OTC markets.\n\nSummary Binary options are an alternative for speculating or hedging but come with advantages and disadvantages. The positives include a known risk and reward, no commissions, innumerable strike prices and expiry dates, access to multiple asset classes in global markets and customizable investment amounts. The negatives include non-ownership of any asset, little regulatory oversight and a winning payout which is always less than the loss on losing trades. Traders who use these instruments need to pay close attention to their individual broker's rules, especially regarding payouts and risks, how expiry prices are calculated and what happens if the option expires directly on the strike price. Traders should read through all the brokers' information, and be aware of all risks before making trades"

This type of Technical Analysis occurs when a shorter and longer moving average cross each other. The supported crossovers are 21 crossing 50 (a short term signal) and 50 crossing 200 (a long term signal).\n\nA bullish signal is generated when the shorter moving average crosses above the longer moving average. A bearish signal is generated when the shorter moving average crosses below the longer moving average.\n\nThese events are based on simple moving averages. A simple moving average is one where equal weight is given to each price over the calculation period. For example, a 21-day simple moving average is calculated by taking the sum of the last 21 days of a stock's close price and then dividing by 21. Other types of moving averages, which are not supported here, are weighted averages and exponentially smoothed averages.\n\nTrading Considerations\n\nMoving averages are lagging indicators because they use historical information. Using them as indicators will not get you in at the bottom and out at the top but will get you in and out somewhere in between.\n\nThey work best in trending price patterns, where an uptrend or downtrend is firmly in place. Using a crossover moving average as an indicator is considered to be superior to the simple moving average because there are two smoothed series of prices which reduces the number of false signals\n\nCriteria that Supports\n\nCriteria that Refutes\n\nMoving averages do well in trending markets but they generate many false signals in choppy, sideways markets"

The ratios you mention above are based on contracts that are actually traded. They are two very different measures.\n\nOverall option trading has actually decreased since the ban probably because the bid/ask spreads are much wider than normal.\n\nThe key to understanding the movement of VIX options is to focus on the underlying, which is VIX futures, not the cash/spot VIX you see quoted. Focus on the futures and you will see that a lot of mean reversion is typically priced in to any strong VIX move, so the futures and options move much more sluggishly than the VIX on the way up -- and on the way back down"

That means that if something overextends, out of its normal movement within the past month, it usually will snap back at least a bit.\nUsing Candlestick patterns such as DOJIs, Evening Stars, Hammers etc. you can set entry and exit points.\nI am not a trend trader but you can figure out 2-3 day trends. predicting more than 1 week trends is useless.\n\nThe rubberband principle makes sense in two ways, both fundamental and technical:\nThe fundamental part is that if two countries or continents are about equal, than there should never be an extrem discrepancy within their currencies in a short period.\nExtreme example: the euro doesn't appreciate to the dollar by double its value over night. the second theory is that enough people have positions they will liquidate to make a profit if there is a strong movement in either direction."

      "text": "Stocks Technical Analysis Trendlines\n\nDefinition\n\nTechnical analysis is built on the assumption that prices trend. A trendline is a straight line that connects two or more price points and then extends into the future to act as a line of support or resistance.\n\nAn uptrend line (figure 4.17) has a positive slope and is formed by connecting two or more low points. Uptrend lines act as support. As long as closing prices remain above the trendline, the uptrend is intact.\n\nA break below the uptrend line indicates a change in trend for the period being considered. In LOCKIT a stock price closing below the uptrend line is a selling signal.\n\nA downtrend line (figure 4.17) has a negative slope and is formed by connecting two or more high points. Downtrend lines act as resistance. As long as closing prices remain below the downtrend line, LOCKIT considers the downtrend intact.\n\nA break above the downtrend line indicates a change of trend for the period being considered. A price closing above the downtrend line is a buying signal.\n\nOne or more big up or down bars at a reversal point (figure 4.18) may be the reason that it is difficult to draw a new trendline from the highest or lowest point.\n\nFigure 4.18: Trendline with big bar at the reversal point.\n\nIn the chart, you mostly will see a sharp V-pattern or, at least, that the last up- or down-move was very big, eventually with a bigger window (figure 4.19).\n\nNinety-nine percent of the time, the move that follows will not be as steep as the new trend start.\n\nIn these circumstances, the new downtrend or uptrend line will have to start with one of the previous or following bars, or at some previous support or resistance level.\n\nA 20 period's exponential moving average or a last pitchfork is generally a good indication for the expected trendline inclination."

      "text": "Contents\n\nThe name \"bourse\" is derived from the 13th-century inn named Ter Beurze in Bruges, Belgium where traders and foreign merchants from across Europe conducted business in the late medieval period. The building, which was established by Robert van der Buerze as a hostelry, had operated from 1285. Its managers became famous for offering judicious financial advice to the traders and merchants who frequented the building. This service became known as the \"Beurze Purse\" which is the basis of the word bourse, meaning an organised place of exchange. Eventually the building became solely a place for trading in commodities.\n\nDuring the 18th century, the façade of the Ter Beurze was rebuilt with a wide frontage of pilasters. However, in 1947 it was restored to its original medieval appearance.\n\nExchanges bring together brokers and dealers who buy and sell these objects. These various financial instruments can typically be sold either through the exchange, typically with the benefit of a clearinghouse to cover defaults, or over-the-counter (OTC), where there is typically less protection against counterparty risk from clearinghouses[1] although OTC clearinghouses have become more common over the years, with regulators placing pressure on the OTC markets to clear and display trades openly.[2][3]\n\nIn practice, futures exchanges are usually commodity exchanges, i.e. all derivatives, including financial derivatives, are usually traded at commodity exchanges. This has historical reasons: the first exchanges were stock exchanges. In the 19th century, exchanges were opened to trade forward contracts on commodities. Exchange-traded forward contracts are called futures contracts. These commodity exchanges later started offering future contracts on other products, such as interest rates and shares, as well as options contracts. They are now generally known as futures exchanges.\n\n^Stock Exchanges are the most publicly recognized places for buying and selling shares. They are easily the single most important component of the secondary market for corporate shares. Over-the-Counter Options. About.com."

      "text": "Butterfly Spread\n\nButterfly Spread - Introduction\n\nThe Butterfly Spread is an advanced neutral option trading strategy which profits from stocks that are stagnant or trading within a very tight price range.\n\nA Butterfly Spread derived its name from the fact that it consists of 3 option trades at once, just like the 2 wings built on the body of a butterfly. This is an options trading strategy where a\nvery large profit is realised if the stock is at or very near the middle strike price on expiration day. When implemented properly,\nthe potential gain is higher than the potential loss, but both the potential gain and loss will be limited.\n\nUnlike many basic\noption trading strategies, you can put on a butterfly spread for a much lesser price than most other strategies due to the fact that\none leg or \"wing\" of the position is a credit spread that offsets much of the price of the other leg or \"wing\".\n\nButterfly Spread - Classification\n\nThe Butterfly Spread differs from the Iron Butterfly Spread in that the iron butterfly spread consists of 4\nstock options trades instead\nof just 3 with a larger potential profit and that executing an Iron Butterfly Spread results in a net credit whereas executing a\nButterfly Spread results in a net debit.\n\nAs Butterfly Spread is a complex options trading strategy comprising of a credit spread on one leg, most brokers will not allow beginner option\ntraders to execute Butterfly Spreads. Only veteran\ntraders with high trading levels are allowed to execute butterfly spreads. You need to check with your broker for the criteria needed to allow the trading of credit spreads or butterfly spreads.\n\nThe Butterfly Spread belongs to the family of complex neutral option strategies, similar to the Condor Spread, Iron Butterfly Spread and Iron Condor Spread.\nEach of them has their own strengths and weaknesses. Here is a table explaining the differences:\n\nCondor Spread\n\nIron Condor Spread\n\nButterfly Spread\n\nIron Butterfly Spread\n\nDebit/Credit\n\nDebit\n\nCredit\n\nDebit\n\nCredit\n\nMax Profit\n\nLow\n\nHigh\n\nHigher\n\nHighest\n\nMax Loss\n\nHighest\n\nHigher\n\nHigh\n\nLow\n\nCost of Position\n\nHigh\n\nNIL\n\nLow\n\nNIL\n\nProfitable Range\n\nWide\n\nWidest\n\nNarrow\n\nWider\n\nThese comparisons are made with the same maximum and minimum strike prices and real values.\nAs you can see from the table above, all of the above complex neutral option strategies comes with their own strengths and weaknesses. Option trading\nstrategies are all about trade-offs. There are no single option trading strategy that has the best of all worlds.\n\nWhen To Use Butterfly Spread?\n\nOne should use a Butterfly Spread when one expects the price of the underlying asset to change very little over the life of the option contracts.\n\nVeteran or experienced option traders would identify at this point that the butterfly spread actually consists of a Bull\nCall Spread and a Bear Call Spread. This is similar to a Condor Spread\nexcept for the fact that the middle strike price has been combined into 1 same middle strike price in order to set up a higher maximum profit potential but a narrower profitable range.\nA Butterfly Spread is really a Condor Spread with a narrower profitable range but a higher maximum profit potential.\n\nThe choice of which strike prices to buy the long legs (trades 1 and 2 above) at depends on the range within which the underlying asset is expected to trade in. The further\naway from the money the 2 long legs are, the lower the risk (as the underlying stock needs to move further in order to exit the breakeven range), and the\nlower the potential profits (as the further in the money options will cost a lot more to buy).\n\nInterestingly, the Butterfly Spread can also be executed by using Put Options instead of Call Options with the same effects. We will use Call Options\nas the standard example here.\n\nButterfly Spread Example :\n\nAssuming QQQQ trading at $43.57.\n\nBuy To Open 1 contract of Jan $42 Call at $2.38\nBuy To Open 1 contract of Jan $44 Call at $1.06\nSell To Open 2 contracts of Jan $43 Call at $1.63.\n\nAs you see above, the cost of putting on a Butterfly Spread is so low that if you leg into the position properly, it could actually end up as a free position and that is what all professional options traders do.\n\nButterfly Spread Legging In Example :\n\nAssuming QQQQ trading at $43.57.\n\nWe shall leg into the trade by buying both ITM and OTM calls first then aim to write the ATM calls at a price that covers the price of the position.\n\nBuy To Open 1 contract of Jan $42 Call at $2.38\nBuy To Open 1 contract of Jan $44 Call at $1.06\n\nWe queued to write the ATM calls at $1.72 instead of its current price of $1.63 and was filled shortly.\nSell To Open 2 contracts of Jan $43 Call at $1.72.\n\nThe butterfly spread was successfully legged into and placed for no cost.\n\nButterfly Spreads can also be established with the middle strike price at a higher strike price than the price of the underlying stock, turning it into a bullish options trading strategy known as the \"Bull Butterfly Spread\". One can also put on two butterfly spreads on the same stock in order to target two different strike prices known as the \"Double Butterfly Spread\".\n\nTrading Level Required For Butterfly Spread\n\nA Level 3 options trading account that allows the execution of debit spreads is needed for the Butterfly Spread. There are brokers who requires level 4 or 5 accounts for Butterfly Spread as well. Please check with your broker. Read more about Options Account Trading Levels.\n\nProfit Potential of Butterfly Spread :\n\nButterfly spreads achieve their maximum profit potential at expiration if the price of the underlying asset is equal to the middle strike price.\n\nFrom the above example : Assuming QQQQ close at $43 at expiration. You will profit from the value of the 2 at the money short call options and you will\nlose the value of the long out of the money call option and the decay of the in the money call option.\n\nDisadvantages Of Butterfly Spread:\n\nAlternate Actions for Butterfly Spreads Before Expiration :\n\n1. If the underlying asset has gained in price and is expected to continue rising, you could buy back the short call options and\nhold the long call options.\n\n2. If the underlying asset has dropped in price and is expected to continue dropping, you could sell the long call options and\nhold the short call options. This action is only possible if your broker allows you to sell naked options"

      "text": "There are four cardinal principles which should be part of every trading strategy. They are: 1) Trade with the trend, 2) Cut losses short, 3) Let profits run, and 4) Manage risk. You should make sure your strategy includes each of these requirements for success.\n\nTrade with the trend relates to the decision of how to initiate trades. It means you should always trade in the direction of recent price movement.\n\nMathematical analysis of commodity price data has shown that these price changes are primarily random with a small trend component. This scientific fact is extremely important to those desiring to pursue commodity trading in a rational, scientific manner. It means that any attempt to trade short-term patterns and methods not based on trend are doomed to failure. It also explains why day trading is darned difficult and why almost no day trader is a long-term success.\n\nThe shorter the time frame in which you examine price action, the smaller the trend component is. Commodity price action is fractal. That means that as you shorten or lengthen the time frame, price action remains similar in behavior. Thus, five-minute charts have roughly the same appearance as hourly charts, daily charts, weekly charts and monthly charts.\n\nThis similarity in chart appearance convinces traders that you can day trade successfully with the same tools you use on longer-term charts. Of course, they try to use much of the arsenal of technical analysis that doesn't work on long-term charts either. Things like Oscillators, Candlesticks and Fibonacci numbers.\n\nHowever, even trend-following tools that work in intermediate to long-term time frames won't work in day trading. This is because the trend component is so very small in short-term data that you must use a highly effective method to overcome the costs of trading.\n\nIn longer-term trading, you can let your profits run. You do it by definition or it wouldn't be long-term trading. In day trading you can only let your profits run to the end of the day. This means your average trade (the average profit of both your winning and losing trades) must necessarily be much smaller than if you could let your profits run for days, weeks or months. However, your costs of trading--slippage, commissions, the bid/asked spread and mistakes--stay roughly the same on a per trade basis. Thus, your day trading system must be much more consistent and robust to stay ahead of the costs of trading than would an intermediate to long-term system. There are few day trading approaches that meet this test.\n\nSince market price action is mostly random, successful trading methods must somehow exploit a non-random feature of market price action. The tendency of most markets to trend is the only possible edge in trading, so a winning approach must harness trend in some way. Tradeable trends do not show up often in the very short term. They certainly are not present every day. That is why the person who tries to day trade at least once every day, and perhaps even more often, is doomed to failure. The more often you day trade, the more likely it is that you will be a long-term loser.\n\nThere is a wonderful fantasy about day trading. You get up in the morning, have a nice breakfast and go to your home office. There you have a powerful computer with fancy software that brings you real-time intraday charts and quotes. You look over the day's market activity and find some promising situations. You watch the markets for awhile until a suitable trade presents itself. You pick up the phone and call your broker to make your trade entry. Then it's time to relax and grab a hearty cup of coffee or a frosty glass of juice while you watch your profits mount. By the end of the day, you are out of your position with a nice profit. Most days are profitable, although not all. You seldom have a losing week. Never a losing month. You make as much money as you need. Some days you don't bother with trading at all. You have better things to do. You play golf, sail, do lunch. You take extended vacations whenever you want. Life is sweet.\n\nThere are plenty of people out there ready to sell you a day trading course or system for thousands of dollars that will show you how to implement this fantasy. The only problem is they haven't been successful traders. They make money only by selling their losing methods to others.\n\nHere's what trading legend Larry Williams said about day trading: \"If you're day trading, you're going to end up frying your brain. When you go home, you're not going to be a nice person to be around. I'm already not too a nice a guy to be around. So when I do a lot of that type of trading, who would want to be around me?\n\n\"All the day traders I talk with are losing money. The oscillators, the supposed support and resistance levels, all that other technical analysis stuff out there doesn't work very well in day trading. Plus I found I make more money by holding overnight and trading out of positions in the next day or two. If I've really got a strong signal, it should last for more than a few hours.\"\n\nGary Smith is the only person with a documented long-term success record in day trading. He made money consistently for over ten years. However, he trades relatively infrequently, maybe once or twice a week. \"Successful day trading is not an everyday affair and not a multiple trade affair,\" he cautions. \"Inexperienced day traders simply refuse to accept this.\" Gary's book, published by Reality Based Trading, is called Live the Dream by Profitably Day Trading Stock Futures.\n\nI have been day trading successfully for the past couple of years using a system that trades on average only two or three times a month. I have also recently published a second day trading system that trades only once or twice a month. Of course, I make almost all my money trading with my more effective long-term systems. For me, day trading is only for fun and for a little diversification. These systems are available from our company.\n\nIf you want to be a successful trader, your best chance is with a long-term, trend-following system. If you must day trade, don't do it very often. The more you trade, the more likely it is you will lose."

The complete lack of market logic is somehow completely not surprising.\n\nAnd while the DXY is higher, the only thing pushing stocks in any direction is the YEN-EUR trade now and every day for the past 3 weeks, yet the carry trade impact on DXY is lost due to GBP and other currency noise.\n\nToo many dollar bears.

I am the one who asked the question about explaining the carry trade. And the reason I said I can understand the other side of the trade is because roughly,you borrow the low interest low currency,and invest it in the high interest rate(or in high risk asset) currency. So for example:if you can borrow at bank rate JPY and invest it in German bonds,at the same time hedging yourself by buying futures JPY,then you locked in on the rate differential . But what dose not make sense is the s&p getting higher because of that. After all the yen is getting higher against the dollar.\n\nTue, 09/08/2009 - 19:54 | Anonymous\n\nwhy complain about the manipulation? They do the same ramp job just about every day at 2:30. Buy 5 SPY calls for a buck a piece at at 2:25 every day and sell them the next day the open and pocket an easy 50/100 bucks.\n\nObama delivers a big speech tomorrow, mkt will close green. count on it\n\nTue, 09/08/2009 - 20:09 | Anonymous\n\nIts very simple, the carry trade is a vehicle for the creation of new money via bond monetization and other forms of debt. Hence open positions that are in the money and yielding income provide margin to pyramid equities where you can also try and squeeze a nice capital gain. Hence money flows into equities. When the EUJY positions become less profitable i.e. the Yen the traders are short of gets stronger, then they have to sell stocks to control their risk or cover their margin. Naturally they could cover their Yen but then they'd lose their position and earning power. Of course a carry trade collapse followed by an equity collapse would mean the dollar carry trade would be under pressure as well, so things could be about to get interesting. These things rarely unwind according to a normal distribution."

      "text": "In the broadest sense, a commodity is anything that has value, from watches to time to oranges. In a more specific market sense, however, it is an item which is roughly the same market value across the board, with no difference based on quality. Watches, for examples, are not market commodities, because a well-crafted, artisan watch might cost a hundred times as much as a cheap, lower-quality watch. Copper, on the other hand, is always roughly the same price at a given time, because copper is always copper.\n\nBecause of this feature, it acts as an excellent investment vehicle, and so fluctuates more or less entirely based on the market itself. A company that mines copper, for example, may gain or lose value based on any number of factors, including the hiring of a new CEO, new legislation in the company's home country, or simply a perceived weakness in the country. Copper itself, however, has a value determined only by the global supply, the global demand, and the amount of investment being shuffled into copper.\n\nMany other things could be considered a commodity as well, but they are not traded on a global spot market, and so aren't usually lumped in with the above items. These include things like rare metals, such as silicon, cobalt, lithium, titanium, selenium, or magnesium, minerals such as bromine or cement, or agricultural products like potatoes, eggs, or flowers.\n\nEach commodity is usually traded on a different market, and in a different currency. Each one also has a minimum quantity that must be purchased on the spot market. For example, the precious metals are traded in units of one Troy ounce, with gold and silver traded on the CBOT exchange, and platinum and palladium traded on the NYMEX, all in US Dollars (USD). Almost all of the industrial metals are traded on the London Metal Exchange, all in USD, and all by the metric ton. Most gasoline and oil futures are traded in minimum quantities of 42,000 US gallons. Livestock, on the other hand, is all traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, in 40,000 pound increments.\n\nGenerally, when the stock market becomes volatile, people tend to move their investments into the commodity markets, because they are less volatile. These markets are viewed as being one of the most efficient sorts of markets, responding rapidly to any shift in supply and demand, reaching an equilibrium point rather easily and without too much drastic fluctuation."

Via Erik Townsend of Financial Sense.\n\nERIK: Now, before we dive into the gory details of what happened that fateful day with the Facebook IPO, I want to start by giving our listeners a sense of some of the background issues that came into play that day. Now years ago, a given stock say IBM stock was only traded on one and only one stock exchange. So IBM's listed on the New York Stock Exchange, so that means the New York Stock Exchange is the only place that you could go to trade IBM shares, but that all changed a few years ago. Please explain to our listeners how and why it changed; what is Regulation NMS and how things work today. [3:45]\n\nERIC HUNSADER: Regulation NMS is what was debated by the industry in 2005, 2006 and was finally implemented and rolled out in the first, second quarter of 2007. At the core of Reg NMS is this concept called the national best bid or offer, which each exchange trading a specific stock would submit their bids and offers; this information would be aggregated by what they called a SIP — there's a lot of acronyms coming up here. SIP stands for Security Information Processor. And one of the formal names or actually implementation of the SIP you might hear is CQS, the Consolidated Quote System. That's the same thing as the SIPs for a specific group of stocks. But anyways, so those SIPs would accumulate the bids and offers from all the exchanges, find the highest bid and the lowest offer and that would become the national best bid or offer so that an order from a customer coming to any exchange would have to trade at the best bid or offer before it could trade at a next lower price. That was called trade through price protection. And that is the core of what Reg NMS is all about. [4:58]\n\nERIK: So essentially what Reg NMS does is it provides the industry with a way to make it possible for a certain stock or other security to trade on more than one exchange. And by having a set of rules that provide, first of all, an advertised national best bid or offer that assures that any buyer or seller can get a price that they know was the best price available and that their trades will execute at that price. So even though there might be multiple bids and asks on different exchanges, the Reg NMS system is intended to make sure everybody gets a fair deal, gets a fair price and all their trades execute at the best available price from any exchange anywhere in the world essentially. [5:39]\n\nERIC HUNSADER: Correct. And by having a SIP that would collect the information from all the exchanges, an investor who wanted to receive and analyze prices on stocks wouldn't have to go to each exchange separately and contract for their data feeds because it would be all available in the SIP. And the SIP would also serve as an audit trail, so that the SEC or anybody could really go back in time and see exactly what happened at a given point in time. [6:07]"

      "text": "Stock Market Education\n\nPeople have come together in markets since the dawn of commerce. Every small town would have a location where merchants set up shop and sold their wares. If you wanted an apple, you only had to present yourself at the stall that sold apples and pay your money. If you didn't want to go to the stall yourself, you could hire a middleman, or broker, to go there on your behalf. The owner of the stall did not necessarily have to be there either. The merchant might hire someone to mind the stall on his or her behalf, another broker, so to speak.\n\nNow you have a situation where neither of the principals to the transaction are present. The actual transaction is taking place at a location, or 'venue', removed from the principals and the trade is being carried out by two proxies, or 'brokers'. The object of all this attention, the apple, will physically change hands and be delivered to the new owner. All that is needed then, is a venue for the trade to take place in, two brokers to carry it out and some object which is the focus of the trade.\n\nStock exchanges are no different and are in fact, just modern day versions of village markets, allowing individuals to buy and sell shares in companies through brokers.\n\nWhen apples were the objects of trade, there was not a great difficulty in transferring the goods. They were simply loaded onto a cart and carried away. However, when individuals started to trade ownership of companies, share certificates needed to be drafted to provide a tangible record of ownership. What's more, share certificates would not rot, like an apple and hence became a preferred vehicle to trade money and make profits.\n\nAs trading flourished, more space and more organisation was required. Brokers banded together and pooled their money to form the early stock exchanges. Such founding brokers were said to have a 'seat' on the exchange and later entrants would need to come up with the required cash to obtain such a seat and have the right to trade on the premises.\n\nThe first North American exchange was established in Philadelphia in the 18th century. The New York Stock Exchange began trading in 1817. 12 years later, in 1829, the first Australian-based operation started up. The first recognisable stock exchange in Australia was the Melbourne-based Brokers' Association in 1859, to be followed by similar organisations in the other states. It wasn't until 1987 that the six state-based exchanges combined to form the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX).\n\nThe member brokers and their employees would gather on the floor of the exchange and call out their offerings. With the advent of the telegraph and later the telephone, brokers could take orders from a long distance, without postal delays. Newspapers began to carry trading results and stock trading picked up. The exchange formed a natural focal point for investors and traders to see what was on offer. Brokers made their money from commissions on stock transactions and it was in their interest to have lots of stock to sell. Companies had that stock and it was in the companies' interest to have access to capital from new investors. If those companies 'listed' with the exchange, they could provide the stock-in-trade the brokers needed and the brokers could in turn act as go-betweens with the investors and traders to provide the companies with the capital they required.\n\nThese days the stock market has evolved into a global network of highly liquid and vibrant market places, all of which can be accessed virtually instantaneously through online brokers such as Spectrum Live"

      "text": "In making decisions about where and when to take a position, investors, traders and analysts use two different approaches: fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Fundamental analysis is the appreciation of the economics underlying a particular trade. If you want to know where to invest and why, you use the techniques of fundamental analysis. Technical analysis is concerned with the when and the how of placing money. It determines the optimal timing for a position and its conclusions about how long to stay in a particular trade have significant importance for the kind of derivatives structure one may use to take a position.\n\nTechnical analysis is an art in which quasi-statistical techniques and formal statistics are used to determine the existence and strength of trends in financial time series and to identify turning points in these trends. If you can do this with a reasonable degree of accuracy, then you can improve your chances of making a profitable trade. Technical analysis is important in the structuring of derivative products because of the leverage involved and because of the inclusion of such features as barriers and compound strikes. Timing is everything.\n\nIn practice, there are quite a few indicators that we can look at and that we can automate to produce trading signals when the rules we specify are triggered. For example, we could design an Expert System that produces a trading signal every time our Moving Average Crossover system indicates that the two moving averages intersect.\n\nThe more indicators we have the better our picture will be. Some indicators are more suited for trending markets while other indicators are oriented towards consolidating markets.\n\nIf we can have a set of indicators that produce a consistent trading signal, then we have reduced the probability of being wrong about the trade.\n\nIf we have five automated trending signals, all of which indicate that our stock is in an upward trend that is a pretty interesting result.\n\nIt is even more interesting if the technical analysis confirms the picture our fundamental analysis paints. If the fundamental analysis suggests that this company is seriously undervalued, we would feel even more comfortable buying it.\n\nIf the technical indicators about the speed of the trend suggest an explosive move, we could use a structure with a highly leveraged payout for an explosive move to the upside. For example, we could use a very low delta call (i.e. a highly out-of-the-money call) on the stock if we thought its price would explode to the upside out of a well-defined range. Not only would we make money on the direction of the spot and the convexity of the spot movement but we would also make money from the rise in implied volatilities.\n\nOr, we could attach a barrier on the downside to our out-of-the-money call if we were confident that spot would not move below a certain level before going higher. This would make the option cheaper and increase the leverage in the structure.\n\nOr, we could attach a binary to the option enabling us to get the out-of-the-money option for free as long as spot did not close below the binary level at maturity.\n\nOne can see very quickly how flexible derivative products enable our investing approach to be.\n\nThe corollary to this argument is that it is dangerous to put on such derivatives structures without some combination of technical and fundamental analysis. Derivatives have the potential for tremendous gains but they require much more homework because of the leverage of the structures, the possibly reduced liquidity and the larger bid/offer spreads involved in transacting them.\n\nTechnical analysis and fundamental analysis are tools that the analyst and the trader can use to reduce the uncertainty involved in taking a position. The skilled trader will use these techniques to wait for the right opportunity and to structure the most profitable derivative strategy to take advantage of it."

      "text": "Trend Trading Blueprint Was The Best Investment I Ever Made!\n\nJohn Chen, the developer of the Trend Trading Blueprint that makes 600-900 pips per week: OK, I've been through this enough times to know what's going to happen...There are only six hours to go until I raise the price for Trend Trading Blueprint. Lots of people will rush in during the last hour and secure a spot. That part is just like clockwork.\n\nThat's fine. I often procrastinate myself. But the next part is just as inevitable - a lot of people will get shut out when the price jumps up -- a lot. They won't be happy. In fact, a bunch of them will be really upset and send me angry emails. But they won't be able to say I didn't warn them.\n\nAnd soon, hundreds of Trend Trading students will be masterfully placing their first profitable trades. And when the pips start pouring in, they'll be thinking one thing:\n\nThe rule about deciding on a trading float is simply that you shouldn't start a live account without enough money to decently manage that account. Just because your broker says you can start a mini-account with a $200 deposit, and trade with a 500:1 leverage, doesn't mean that you should.\n\nWith too little money you will be limited in the trading systems that you can use, and you won't be able to follow a decent money management system. Again it's about allowing yourself time to learn and grow. With too small of an amount to start out, your first few mistakes you make will erase your account and you'll be more likely to give up before you ever learn how to truly earn in the Forex markets.\n\nThere are really no hard-and-fast rules here. For a mini account with 200:1 leverage, $10,000 would be a decent minimum to start.\n\nFor a real Forex account, I wouldn't start with anything less than $50,000. Keep in mind that those are the smallest amounts that I would use. If you can afford to start out with more, you should!\n\nLet's discuss leverage for a moment to gain a better understanding in this area.\n\nBringing Leverage Into the Picture\n\nAlmost all Forex traders employ leveraging when they trade. Unless you're a big bank or a big business, with millions to put on the line, leverage is simply a fact of trading. Most new traders won't have millions they can afford to lose. So, they employ leveraging to allow them to trade at all.\n\nTo clarify what leverage is let's just talk about a trade with one lot in the Forex market.\n\nWe know that one lot of currency is worth $100,000. To trade that lot at 1:1 (with no) leverage you would need to put $100,000 on the line until you closed the trade.\n\nOn the other hand, if you were trading with a 100:1 leverage, it means that your Forex broker will trade that $100,000 of currency if you only put 1% of the money on the line.\n\nIn other words, with $1,000 you now have the power to trade that same $100,000 lot.\n\nLet's assume our 1 lot trade was a winning trade, and we earned 100 pips by the time we closed that trade. To keep things simple we will say that 1 pip is worth $10.\n\nOn the 1:1 trade we made $1000. On the 100:1 trade we also made $1000. The difference in this case is the amount of money we had to invest to earn that money.\n\n$1000 is 0.01 (or 1%) of $100,000. From an investment standpoint we could have earned more money with a low-interest savings account. With the leveraged trade though, $1000 is 100% of $1000. In that case we are actually earning some money.\n\nLeverage allows us to earn more money while only investing a smaller amount. It's simple right?\n\nThe power of leveraging is what makes Forex attractive to so many people. With a small amount to start out they are able to trade large amounts of currency and profit as though they had the full amount on the line. The problem is that, along with huge profits, leveraging can also equate to huge losses.\n\nIf the 1 lot trade we used in the example had been a losing trade (and we lost the same 100 pips) we would have erased our $1,000 in just one trade.\n\nIt's very important to keep potential losses in mind when chosing a broker and the leverage that they allow for. There are now Forex brokers offering 400:1 or even 500:1 leverage. This does allow for traders to move huge amount of currencies with very little money invested, but it also greatly increases the risk involved.\n\nThe biggest problem with huge leverages is that it often attracts newer traders with smaller amounts of money to start out. Just because you can start an account with $5,000 and use 500:1 leverage to trade full lots with only $200 invested for each lot doesn't mean that it's a good idea.\n\nIn the long run you will be much better off with a 100:1 or 50:1 leverage and a larger amount of money to work with.\n\nAt the very most, you should never trade with anything over 200:1 leverage.\n\nTo calculate how much money you can trade with any given leverage you can use this simple calculation.\n\nAs an example if I was using a 200:1 Leverage and wanted to trade 1 lot ($100,000 of the currency pair)\n\n1/200 = 0.005 or ½%\n\n100,000 x .005 = $500\n\nI would need $500 on the line for each lot that I traded. By now you should have a clear understanding of what a trading float is, and also of how leverage works to affect the amount you can trade with that float."

The Channels on the Daily chart below are set to 20 periods so they would represent the high and the low at which the pair traded over the previous 20 days.\n\nAs such, they can be used quite effectively to visually identify levels of Support and Resistance on a chart. The channels can be used by \"breakout\" traders to identify entry levels. This would occur when price \"breaks\" below support in a downtrend or above resistance in an uptrend.\n\nWhen the breakout occurs, this can be taken as an entry signal as the potential exists for price to continue to move in that direction for a period of time.\n\nLet's take a look at the example below of Price Channels on a Daily chart…\n\nAs noted on the chart, the lower channel line represents support while the upper channel line represents resistance.\n\nAs with most every strategy, the first step is to determine the direction that we should trade the pair. In the case of the EURCAD pair we know we want to look for opportunities to short the pair for the following reasons: 1) Price Action is below the 200 SMA and is pulling away from it; 2) at the time of this writing the EUR is weaker than the CAD, and 3) price has been making successively lower highs on this Daily chart since the end of February.\n\nNow that we have determined the direction to trade the pair, we can look to a lower time frame chart to \"fine tune\" our entry. For our purposes on this pair, I prefer the 1 hour chart as we may be close to an entry.\n\nWhen moving down to an intra-day chart (anything below a Daily) we will change the indicator to 55 periods. We do this to slow down the indicator a bit as we have moved to a faster, lower time frame chart.\n\nIf/when price breaks below the lower channel line at 1.2941 a trader could sell the pair. The stop would be placed above the upper channel line at 1.3041. As can be seen, the price channels have provided us with our \"breakout\" entry along with our stop placement.\n\nTo manage the trade as it progresses, a trader would manually trail the stop by keeping it just above the upper channel line. The trade would be closed when price action retraces to the point that it intersects the upper channel line and the stop.\n\nSince Price/Donchian Channels are not an indicator that is built into the Marketscope charting package, instructions are needed to install them.\n\n(MENAFN - Kuwait News Agency (KUNA)) The high ambitions and aspirations of Arab youth, who make up the majority of Arab populations, require access to a high quality education to be materialized, a ..."

      "text": "Trading Key Levels with Price Action\n\nBare bones trading is the simplest way to trade in the Forex market. So what is bare bones in Forex trading? I believe all that's needed is a Daily chart with price action and no indicators. The question now is how do I identify a valid trade setup with entry and exit points? This is where Horizontal or Key levels come in, which is the\"core\" component of my trading strategy. In this article I will be discussing how to identify these levels and why it should be a fundamental part of any trading strategy. I will not discuss signals at this point in time as there will be other articles elaborating on this.\n\nThere are two types of horizontal levels, these are know as support and resistance. Support levels are usually below the current price. Support is the price level at which demand is thought to be strong enough to prevent the price from declining further. Support does not always hold and a break below support signals a new willingness to sell. Once support is broken, another support level will have to be established at a lower level. Resistance is the price level at which selling is thought to be strong enough to prevent the price from rising further. Resistance levels are usually above the current price. Resistance does not always hold and a break above resistance signals shows a new willingness to buy. To draw these lines you will have to connect all the highest highs to establish a resistance level and all the lowest lows for support levels (This is a very basic explanation in how to establish support and resistance levels, further research maybe needed to learn how to identify these levels correctly).\n\nWhy do I trade off these horitzntal levels? Everything starts with horizontal levels and all traders pay attention to these key levels in the market, because they know that these levels are significant and can thus have a strong impact on the direction of price. Below are some of the reasons why and how I could use horizontal levels:\n\nHow are these Horizontal levels formed? The more I study charts the more I see that price never moves in a straight line. Let me illustrate this through the diagram below, here we can see price is in an upward trend and as it makes new highs it also creates resistance when it falls away from these highs, then as it pulls back the previous high / resistance actually turns into support. Old resistance becomes new support in an uptrend, and in a down trend old support becomes new resistance, also known as swing points.\n\nThe way that I take advantage of these horizontal level swing points, is to watch for price action signals forming near them as the market pulls back. Look at the yellow circles in the illustration above, these are the swing points at which I want to watch for obvious price action signals to form. By doing this I'm trading from a point where various confirming signals can be seen within a trending market.\n\nIt seems that I can also trade horizontal lines in a range-bound market with price action, this is also known as channels. This normally occurs when the market has not found a upward or downward trend but finds itself in a range where price often swing between support and resistance. In the illustration below we can see an example of what a range-bound market might look like. When price is obviously bouncing back and forth between a horizontal support and resistance level, we can wait for price to hit one of the boundaries of the range and then wait for price action signals to form there.\n\nTrading with channels as seen above gives me obvious levels to define my risk and reward. Risk is defined just beyond the trading range high or low from the boundary I'm entering near, and reward is defined near the opposite end of the trading range.\n\nIn conclusion horizontal levels are very important in the market, and by combining them with a price action signal allows me to have a very effective trading strategy. Price Action signals will be discussed in future"

The higher the implied volatility, the\nmore the option's time value increases, making an option relatively more\nexpensive.\n\nSince there are many different types of options strategies to implement\nunder various ranges in volatility, using a comparative analysis of the\ntwo types will help you assess the optimal strategy. For example, if the\nhistorical volatility of a stock over the last 90 days is 40%, but the\naverage implied volatility of the at-the-money options is 50%, the market\nis making an assumption that the underlying will move by a greater degree\nthan it has in the past. Therefore, the options will likely be more expensive\nrelative to the past. Thus, you may wish to implement a strategy in which\nyou are going to be a net seller of option premium, or sell a hedge against\na long position to curb the costs.\n\nAlthough historical volatility can be helpful, you can use an implied\nvolatility analysis alone to create very profitable options strategies.\nLet's look at what's been happening lately in the market. For the first\ncouple of months of 2003, the volatility index (VIX) was trading well above\nnormal levels for an extended period of time. This is generally a good\ngauge of fear for the rest of the market, since the VIX represents the\naverage implied volatilities of a series of at-the-money options on the\nStandard & Poor's 100. For the first quarter of this year there was\na lot of focus on the war in Iraq, as well as the SARS breakout. During\ntimes of uncertainty like these, the \"collective conscience\"\nor mass opinion of the market is that bad news can lead to more bad news\nand eventually destructive losses, as we've seen over the last three years.\n\nSince the latter 1990s, the VIX has pretty much stayed in the range\nof 20-30% (see Figure 1). Note how each time it touched the 20% level,\nit was soon followed by a run back up to 30%. This information can be very\nuseful to the savvy options trader who takes on a contrarian approach.\nWhen the VIX sits at a level of 20, the market is generally overbought\nand the majority of the traders have turned bullish. So the basic question\na good contrarian would ask at this point is, \"If everyone has turned\nbullish, who is left to buy?\" From there, you can piece together some\npretty profitable strategies.\n\nFIGURE 1: VOLATILITY INDEX. Since the latter 1990s, the VIX has\nmostly stayed in the 20-30% range.\n\nIMPLIED VOLATITLITY\n\nTo what degree does an increase (or decrease) in implied volatility\nof the underlying affect the four strikes (in particular the strikes of\nthe two short positions) of a long condor structure (made with either call\nor put options)? - R. Marchant\n\nSince the long condor is essentially a long butterfly with two different\nstrikes that make up the short body, the same rules apply to both strategies.\nThey are ideal when the implied volatility is already high. Since the strategy\nis profitable as the time decays in the short options while the stock trades\nin a range, you want that time premium to collapse in the \"body\"\nas soon as possible. This is important, since the body is the most sensitive\nto changes in implied volatility with regard to price (known as vega).\nIf implied volatility continues to increase, this can work against you\nby increasing the length of time it takes to profit. If time decays while\nimplied volatility increases, the two may actually cancel each other out,\nkeeping the position's value stable - which is what we don't want! However,\nif implied volatility comes down after the trade is placed, you can close\nthe position sooner with a profit, provided the stock stays in the range\nsuggested by its risk curve.\n\nKeep in mind that if implied volatility increases on a position such\nas a long condor, chances are the stock is trending down. For the long\ncondor, you want the stock to trade in a range somewhere between the two\nlong strikes on or before expiration. Generally, an increase in volatility\nis an indication of fear priced into the options, which is generally indicative\nof the underlying selling off (though not always). During periods of such\nuncertainty, traders will often buy puts to protect their long stock positions,\nexacerbating a selloff and greatly affecting the condor position."

      "text": "Metatrader Indicator Description: Squeeze_Break.mq4 created by DesO'Regan.\nNotes from the author:\n\nThis indicator is based on a strategy mentioned in John Carter's book, Mastering the Trade. The basic idea behind the strategy is that markets tend to move from periods of low volatility to high volatility and visa versa. The strategy aims to capture moves from low to high volatility. For gauging this he uses two common indicators - Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels (ok, not so common!). He also uses the Momentum indicator to provide a trade bias as soon as the Bollinger Bands come back outside the Keltner Channels.\nThe Squeeze_Break indicator combines this into a signal indicator and has the following components:\n1. A positive green histogram means that the Bollinger Bands are outside the Keltner Channels and the market is lightly to be trending or volatile. The stronger the histogram the stronger the directional price move.\n2. A negative red histogram means that the Bollinger Bands are inside the Keltner Channels and the market is lightly to be consolidating. The stronger the red histogram the tighter price action is becoming.\n3. Incorporated into the indicator is a Momentum indicator. According to the strategy J. Carter goes long when the Bollinger Bands break outside the Keltner Bands and the Momentum indicator is above the zero line. He goes short when the Momentum indicator is below the zero line on the break.\n4. I've also added other indicator info in the top left hand corner to give a broader idea of current market conditions.\n5. The indicator provides audio alerts when a potential breakout is occurring.\nThis indicator tends to be better with the larger timeframes. Personally I don't trade on an alert signal alone. It's just a handy tool for warning me of potential breakout trades."

      "text": "Contango and Backwardation in the Futures Market\n\nIn the any futures market there are several delivery months offered at the same time. As an Example, you can sell or buy gold for delivery in September or December of this year, March of next year as well. Typically the closer months are less expensive than the further out months, and that relationship is commonly referred to as contango market.\n\nYou will also hear a so called cost of carry which is higher for further dated contracts as it relates to the cost of financing, insuring and storing the actual commodity. Most futures buyers can put down his margin requirement and control the contract without having to bring the rest of the money until the futures contract settles. On the flip side, the seller has to insure, store and finance the gold, oil, wheat or whatever the commodity is.\n\nWhen you hear of premiums it is referring to the difference between delivery months. Trades who hedge and actual floor traders watch these premiums closely because they reflect the degree of tightness in the market. When supply is tight or demand rises, traders start paying up for nearby months. As a result the premium further dated contracts shrinks. As the demand grows, the closer dated futures contracts become more expensive that the further dated ones and as a result the markets invert. This is typically one of the fundamental signs of a bull market. It shows that there is a shortage in supply and that futures traders are willing to pay extra to get their material sooner rather than later.\n\nContango and Backwardation\n\nThe next time you're looking at futures contracts online or in the paper look at the closing prices and search for backwardation. As a technical trader it signals for buying opportunities and take long positions in those particular futures contracts.\n\nFor firms that hedge all the time they do not wait for backwardation. They monitor premiums and get the buy indicators from the tightening of widening of them. That is why floor traders have the best ability to pick these signals up. Any speculator will run off the latest price but a trader who is hedging will tell you the latest premium of the furthest away futures contract over the closer ones.\n\nThere is one caveat for this. As you scan for market backwardation there is one area where it is normal. Interest rate futures are continuously inverted since the person holding the cash position keeps collecting interest instead of paying for stocking and finance charges"

      "text": "Deutsche Börse's Hanno Klein, Co-Chair of the FPL Global Technical Committee, expounds on the role of FIX semantics in standardised access to trading and clearing services.\n\nWhy are Interface Semantics Important?\n\nSemantics represent the look and feel of an interface from a nontechnical perspective, but can influence overall implementation and testing effort much more than the syntax. If you will, semantics are the interface language and standardization is about speaking the same language, for example FIX.\n\nThe Difference between the FIX Syntax and FIX Semantics\n\nSyntax is the encoding of bits and bytes on the wire; for example, whether you use ASCII or binary values for numbers or whether you have a FIX tag=value syntax or an XML syntax like FIXML. The syntax consists of messages, components, fields and valid values that are the building blocks for the semantics. FIX semantics is about the business functionality and how it is expressed within the building blocks of FIX. FIX Semantics relates to the elements with which information is conveyed and about the flows through which these elements are passed back and forth between two or more parties. Let me give you some examples.\n\nA combination of \"35=D\" and \"35=8\" is the tag=value syntax for the semantic \"submission of a new order for a simple instrument followed by a confirmation or rejection being returned\". Readers probably know these tags by the more familiar terms NewOrderSingle and ExecutionReport.\n\n59=4\" is the tag=value syntax for the semantic \"order needs to be filled completely upon entry or cancelled immediately\". The FIXML syntax for the same semantic is TmInForce=\"4\".The corresponding term for the order, Fill-Or-Kill (FOK) is a well known part of the FIX language.\n\n\"38=1000|1138=100|1083=1|108 4=3|1085=50|1086=80\" stands for \"reserve order of 1000 that is to be displayed initially with 100 and to be replenished whenever a fill occurs with a randomly chosen quantity between 50 and 80\". Some might be more familiar with the term \"iceberg order\" which is not used by FIX.\n\nThe mapping of semantics to syntaxis not trivial and standardization is about using the same map for the same semantics to ease the burden for the software developer and reduce costs.\n\nHow can FIX semantics be used more effectively?\n\nGreater effectiveness will come through an increasing awareness of the importance of FIX semantics for true standardization. FIX training courses could be offered with a focus on semantics and put less emphasis on the technical aspects of the protocol such as the encoding or the session layer mechanics. Usage guidelines for new and existing functionalities can help to understand the semantics behind FIX message layouts.\n\nWithout semantics it is impossible to determine which FIX fields or valid values will be present in which contexts. The syntax will merely show all possible values of a field, which may be sufficient for the developer, but not for the person who then wants to test the interface."

      "text": "Margin\n\nMargin is a minimum amount of cash and/or securites that must be held in a trading account in order to trade a particular market. For example, in order to trade the DAX futures market, a trader must have at least 10,125 Euros in their trading account. For most day trading markets (such as futures, options, and stocks), the margin amount is set by the exchange that offers the market, but for some markets (such as the forex markets) the margin amount is set by the brokerage.\n\nHow is Margin Set?\n\nMargin varies from one market to another (even for the same type of market). For example, the margin for the ZC (Corn) futures market is $2,025, but the margin for the ZW (Wheat) futures market is $6,075. Margin amounts vary based upon the volatility of the market, and the tick value of the market. For example, the ZG (Gold) futures market moves approximately 200 ticks per day, and is worth $100 per point, whereas the ZI (Silver) futures market moves approximately 500 ticks per day, and is worth $5,000 per point. As as result of these differences, the margin for the ZG futures market is $4,455, but the margin for the ZI futures market is $10,125.\n\nHow is Margin Used?\n\nWhen a trading account is flat (no active trades), it will have its full amount of margin available for trading. When the trader enters a new trade, the amount of available margin is decreased accordingly. While the trade is active, the margin will remain unavailable as it is being used to cover the active trade. When the trader exits the trade, the margin will become available again, and can then be used to enter a new trade on the same market or any other market. If the balance of a trading account drops below the margin amount required for a particular market, the trader will not be able to enter any new trades on that market until the account balance is increased."

That being said, if applied properly, it can increase the profitability of your trading strategy.\n\nThe terms 'leverage' and 'margin' refer to the same concept, just from a slightly different angle. When a trader opens a position, they are required to put up a fraction of that position's value 'in good faith'. In this case, a trader is said to be 'leveraged'. The amount that is required to be put down is the 'margin requirement'. This margin requirement is often referred to as a 'good faith deposit' because the trader generally gets that entire amount back when they close the position. We say generally because it may not be the case in the event of a margin call, details of which can be found by clicking here (Margin Trading and Leverage FAQ).\n\nFor anyone who wants the actual definitions, here they are:\n\nLeverage: The degree to which an investor is utilizing borrowed money, or the ratio of the trade size compared to the amount the trader put aside to open the position.\n\nMargin: The amount of equity that a trader must set aside in order to maintain open positions. This amount is a percentage of the total value of the contract.\n\nWhat does that mean to me?\n\nTechnically, when trading forex, you are using margin to trade on leverage. You can state it in this manner: when you open a contract or 'lot' as they are called, you put down a portion of its value as margin (margin percentage: 2%, 1% 0.5%, etc). You can also state that you opened that 10K lot size trade with leverage (leverage amount, 50:1, 100:1, 200:1, etc).\n\nAnother key point is that the margin needed to open a trade is a requirement of trading, not a cost of trading. If a trader is trading on margin (with leverage) and the position moves against them, the loss would be greater than if the trader was not trading on margin (with leverage). The take-away here is that margin/leverage magnifies both gains and losses.\n\nHere is example using USD/JPY and how the margin is calculated:\n\n1. You have to take the contract value. Let's use a USD/JPY 10K trade\n\n2. That contract is worth 10,000 USD – since that is the first (base) currency in the pair.\n\n3. Then you multiply by the margin requirement:\n\na. At 0.5% margin (200:1 leverage): you multiply $10,000 USD by 0.005 (which is 0.5%) and get $50.\n\nc. At 2% margin (50:1 leverage): you multiply $10,000 USD by 0.02 (which is 2%) and get $200.\n\nHow do I know how much margin/leverage I have?\n\nThat depends on your country of residence. FXCM is regulated in many places around the world, by various regulatory bodies, and each of them are slightly different.\n\nFor FXCM US accounts, the maximum leverage available is 50:1 leverage (2% margin) on the majors, and 20:1 leverage (5% margin) on the exotics. For a full list of margin requirements, please click here.\n\nOn the Trading Station platform (if you are on MT4 click here (MT4 FAQ) for more information) the Simple Dealing Rates window will show you how much margin (MMR) is required to open a trade. Keep in mind that these are for 10K lot size trades.\n\nUS account:\n\nUK account:\n\nAU/NZ account:\n\nIf you have additional questions about how leverage or margin work, please post your question and we will reply with an answer!\n\nA major benefit to the FX market is that it offers some of the highest leverage (lowest margin) of any financial product. This means that you have the ability to open positions significantly larger than in the equities or fixed income (bond) markets.\n\nYou can see in the image below that you can open a 10K lot size EUR/USD position with only $300, or a 10K USD/JPY position with $200.\n\nAre there risks to trading with higher leverage?\n\nYes, there are. Do keep in mind that this is a double-edged sword: while high leverage can magnify your gains, it will also magnify your losses.\n\nLet's use some examples here. You have made 3 successful trades so far, each on a 10K EUR/USD (1 PIP = $1) trade, and booked 30 PIPs each for 90 PIP total, or $90. Now, your next trade you decide to make a 100K trade, where each PIP is worth $10. On this trade, you lose 10 pips (10 PIPs X $10/pip = $100 loss). Now, your winning ratio is 75% (3 profitable trades, 1 losing trade), however your account has a net loss of $10 due to over-leveraging the last position.:\n\nScenario: We have four different traders trading on different levels of effective leverage.\n\nQuestion: What happens to Trader A account equity when the USD/JPY price falls 100 pips against him?\n\nAnswer: Trader A loses 41.5% of his / her with you are following the 10:1 effective leverage rule then that means that you are\n\nTechnically, a margin call is when your Usbl Mr (Usable Margin) reaches zero. What this means is that the equity in your account (funds in addition to the margin deposit) have decreased to zero and your positions are closed automatically.\n\nCan you give me a good real-life example?\n\nAbsolutely! Let's say you are renting an apartment, and FXCM is the building owner. We inform you that the security deposit is $1,000 and monthly rent is $1,500. We both agree and sign the contract. You, as the tenant will pay the $1,500/month rent, and we will maintain the building. This security deposit is a requirement of renting (trading), not a cost of renting (trading).\n\nNow, at the end of the 12 months, as long as you kept the apartment clean and paid the $1,500/month, you will get the $1,000 back. However, if you stop paying the rent or leave things broken, you will likely get back less than the $1,000 deposit.\n\nIt is the same idea in Forex trading. If you have additional funds (Usbl Mr – Usable Margin) in your account, there will be no issue. If you do not have additional funds, the account will be margin called and as much of your deposit (margin) returned as possible.\n\nI got margin called, why do I still have funds in my account?\n\nLet's use this screenshot to illustrate exactly what happens.\n\nYou will see that the Usd Mr is $7,500. In the event that this position moves against me to use up the rest of the $42,179.87 in the account, then all positions are automatically closed. Now, there should be about $7,500 left in the account – we say 'about' because of the position size and the chance that the exact price that would get me out with precisely $7,500 may or may not be available when the margin call occurs.\n\nIf you have additional questions about how leverage or margin work, please post your question and we will reply with an answer!\n\nIt has been said that good traders ask how much they can make, while great traders ask how much they can lose.\n\nOne of the greatest concerns traders have about leverage is that a sizable loss could result in owing money to their broker. At FXCM, your maximum risk of loss is limited by the amount in your account. All accounts are tracked by our \"Margin Watcher\" feature. With the Margin Watcher feature, if account equity falls below margin requirements, the FXCM Trading Station will trigger an order to close all open positions at current market rates. FXCM has a policy that if your account has a negative balance, we will automatically credit the account back to zero. We do this so you can fund your account and get back to trading as soon as possible.\n\nHow do I manage my trades?\n\nWe provide many ways for you to manage your positions. The most common ways to do so is to use stop and limit orders on your trades.\n\nThe Usbl Mr is the usable margin you have left in your account, to either sustain against losses or to open new positions.\n\nThe Usbl Mr, % is the percentage of usable margin (Usbl Mr/Equity or 42,179.87/49,679.87 = 84.9%) that your account has left before a margin call. When this percentage gets to zero, all your positions will be closed (margin called) because the account has insufficient equity to support the open positions.\n\nI got margin called, but I still have funds in my account, what happened?\n\nMargin calls happen when all additional funds (those beyond the Usd Mr – Used Margin) are depleted. The additional funds are those that were put aside to hold the positions open. In the following image, the Usd Mr is $7,500, and most likely what your account would have when a margin call occurs.\n\nLet's say that this position moved against me by $42,179.87 (or just under 422 PIPs with this 1,000K position, being $100 per PIP) and my Usbl Mr gets to zero. The positions are all liquidated at the best available rate, and I am left with about $7,500 in the account.\n\nI was margin called, but I do not have the entire margin back, what happened?\n\nWhen an account is margin called, the positions are closed at the best available rate. If the rate that would get you out with 100% of your margin is not available, your trade will execute at the next best price. Let's use an example here.\n\nI have $500 in my account. I open a long 10K EUR/USD trade at 1.3500 (requiring $300 margin, since I'm in the US). So, I have Usd Mr of $300, and Usbl Mr of $200.\n\nOn this trade, each PIP is worth $1.00, since it is a 10K EUR/USD trade. Now, the market rate is currently 1.3310, and I am down $190. There is a news release, USD interest rates are better than expected, and the EUR/USD drops from 1.3310 to 1.3270 (30 PIPs beyond where I'd be margin called).\n\nNow, my account should have been margin called at 1.3300, but since that price was technically non-existent, the position is closed at 1.3270. My account balance now is $270. I lost the first $200 from the position moving against me 200 PIPs (at 1.3300), and another $30 due to the news event's gapping (to 1.3270).\n\nThis is how it is possible to get back less than 100% of the Usd Mr on a trade during a margin call.\n\nIf you have additional questions about how leverage or margin work, please post your question and we will reply with an answer!\n\nAll positions are closed to reduce the chance of your account going into a negative balance. If your account does have a negative balance, we have a policy that will automatically credit your account back to zero.\n\nFXCM closes all positions (instead of the biggest loser, or largest trade) because we do not want to make trading decisions for you. Clients have the ability to use stops and limits to decide how to manage positions, and reduce the likelihood of a margin call.\n\nThe margin required to open a trade is available on your Trading Station platform. Click on the Simple Dealing Rates window in the upper left of the Trading Station, and look at the MMR column.\n\nThese are margin requirements on a 200:1 leverage account (currently available through the UK or AU).\n\nThese are margin requirements on a 50:1 leverage on majors and 20:1 on exotics account (currently the maximum available in the US).\n\nHow are margin requirements calculated?\nThis is a very common question that we get, and using an example is usually best.\n\n1. You have to take the contract value.\na. Let's use a EUR/USD 10K trade.\n\n2. That contract is worth 10,000 Euro's – since that is the base (first) currency in the pair.\na. You can multiply the number of Euro's by the exchange rate (let's say 1.4000) to find the number of dollars – 10,000 Euro's X 1.4000 rate = $14,000 USD.\n\n3. Then you multiply by the margin requirement:\na. At 1% (100:1 leverage): you multiply $14,000 USD by 0.01 (which is 1%) and get: $140.\ni. FXCM has an added buffer to allow for the rate to move, but keep the MMR consistent.\n\nb. At 0.5% (200:1 leverage): you multiply $14,000 USD by 0.005 (which is 0.5%) and get $70.\ni. FXCM has an added buffer to allow for the rate to move, but keep the MMR consistent.\n\nc. At 2% (50:1 leverage): you multiply $14,000 USD by 0.02 (which is 2%) and get $280.\ni. FXCM has an added buffer to allow for the rate to move, but keep the MMR consistent.\n\nHere is another example using USD/JPY:\n\n1. You have to take the contract value.\na. Let's use a USD/JPY 10K trade.\n\n2. That contract is worth 10,000 USD – since that is the base (first) currency in the pair.\na. Let's say the exchange rate for USD/JPY is 80.00. To find the contact value in Yen, simply multiply the exchange rate by contract size: 10,000 (size) X 80.00 (rate) = 800,000 JPY.\n\n3. Then you multiply by the margin requirement:\na. At 1% (100:1 leverage): you multiply $10,000 USD by 0.01 (which is 1%) and get: $100.\n\nb. At 0.5% (200:1 leverage): you multiply $10,000 USD by 0.005 (which is 0.5%) and get $50.\n\nc. At 2% (50:1 leverage): you multiply $10,000 USD by 0.02 (which is 2%) and get $200.\n\nd. NOTE: since the first pair in the quote is USD, the MMR does not have a built in buffer (assuming you have a USD denominated account).\n\nI hope this helps with some questions you may have, and if you would like to know more, please let us know!\n\nIf you have additional questions about how leverage or margin work, please post your question and we will reply with an answer!\n\nAt FXCM we display as much information as possible to you on the Trading Station II platform. One of these pieces of information is the PIP cost. This is visible in the Advanced Dealing Rates window and the Simple Dealing Rates window:\n\nHow do I calculate pip cost?\n\nPIP cost is somewhat complicated to calculate, but let's go through it step-by-step. First, we need to establish some general guidelines:\n1. The base denomination of the account is USD\n2. Each lot size is 10K or 10,000 units\n3. A PIP is the 4th decimal on all pairs, except JPY, where it's the second decimal.\n\nNow, we will calculate the value of one PIP on a EUR/USD 10K trade. We start with 10,000 and multiply that by 0.0001 (since that is the 4th decimal and exactly 1 PIP). 10,000 * 0.0001 = 1 unit of the second (or cross) currency listed. This means every PIP is worth $1 on EUR/USD in a USD denominated account.\n\nLet's say you are using a GBP denominated account to trade EUR/USD. Simply take the value of 1 PIP of EUR/USD, which is $1 USD, and divide that by the rate for GBP/USD. We are dividing here because a pound is worth more than USD, so we know the answer has to be less than 1. With GBP/USD at a rate of 1.5500, we get: 1 / 1.5500 = £ 0.64516. This means in a GBP denominated account, each PIP on EUR/USD is worth £ 0.64516, with GBP/USD trading at 1.5500. As soon as GBP/USD moves, the value of each PIP on EUR/USD (in that GBP denominated account) will change.\n\nHere is another example. Let's go back to the USD denominated account. Now we are trading USD/CHF using a rate of 0.9655. Again, we start with 10,000 and multiply that by 0.0001 (since that is the 4th decimal, and exactly 1 PIP). 10,000 * 0.0001 = 1 unit of the second (or cross) currency listed. This means every PIP is worth 1 CHF on USD/CHF in a USD denominated account. From here, we take that 1 CHF and divide by the exchange rate of 0.9655 (since USD is currently more valuable than CHF). 1 / 0.9655 = 1.04. Meaning that every PIP on USD/CHF at 0.9655 is worth $1.04 in a USD denominated account. Keep in mind that if the USD/CHF rate moves, the PIP cost will change accordingly, however the calculation remains the same.\n\nIf you were using a CHF denominated account, each PIP would be worth 1 CHF regardless of rate, because that is the cross (second) currency in the pair, and is how the PIP value is determined.\n\nFinally a JPY example. We are still using a USD denominated account, and are trading USD/JPY. USD/JPY is currently 83.10. Now, we take a 10,000 position size, and multiply by 0.01 (Since this is a JPY pair, the PIP is the second decimal) and have a value of 100. This means that for every PIP (second decimal) movement on USD/JPY, that is equal to 100 JPY. Now, we need to convert those 100 JPY to USD. To do so, we take 100 and divide by the USD/JPY rate (since USD is currently more valuable than JPY). 100 / 83.10 = $1.20 USD per PIP with USD/JPY at 83.10. Keep in mind that if the USD/JPY rate moves, the PIP cost will change accordingly, however the calculation remains the same.\n\nThis information is displayed in the Advanced and Simple Dealing Rates window, as indicated in the images above.\n\nNow, if you are holding positions through significant movements, let's say you buy USD/JPY at 83.00 and sell at 90.00 in a USD denominated account, the PIP cost is changing the entire life of the trade. This is taken into consideration when calculating the P/L on the trade. So, the PIP cost you see in the dealing rates window is the PIP cost at the current rate, however would not necessarily be the same PIP cost at the opening of your position.\n\nIf you have additional questions about how leverage or margin work, please post your question and we will reply with an answer!\n\nSettlement in Leveraged Trades\n\nHi\n\nI'm new in FX trading and is still trying to adjust my knowledge from stock trading to FX.\n\nHere's my question: When I used to trade M'sian stock using leverage, e.g. 4:1, on a trade requiring MYR1k margin, I was required to liquidate the trade before T+4 settlement day, else I would need to pay the entire MYR4k.\n\nIs there similar settlement requirement in leveraged FX trading when one is holding onto the trade for long period, assuming there is no margin call within that period?\n\nThe settlement is fundamentally similar to equities trading, however there are some notable differences. The best answers would be available at our Margin Trading and Leverage FAQ section. This will answer your questions about minimum margin requirements, leverage available, and margin calls.\n\nThank you again for your post, and if you have additional questions, please feel free to email me, post them here or on the Margin/Leverage FAQ section.\n\nThank you for being a part of our trading community!\n\nWant to discuss how our resources can help you reach your trading goals?

      "text": "Margin call: two words that no investor ever wants to hear. It means your broker requires you to deposit more cash or securities into your trading account to cover losing positions and losses.\n\nWhile education and a sound risk management strategy are critical to achieving any level of success in forex trading, they are equally valuable to helping avoid a potential margin call. OANDA has always encouraged a prudent, risk-adverse approach to foreign exchange trading.\n\nTwo years ago, the team at fxLabs created and implemented \"smart\" account statements for OANDA's trading clients. The purpose was to provide our customers with detailed performance data on their trading activity and personalized analysis on losing trades to help them understand why their strategies may have failed to match their expectations.\n\nWhile implementing the account statement analysis, we processed tens of thousands of transactions to identify similar trading strategies and highlight any common errors traders may be making that result in margin calls.\n\nThe graph pictured above illustrates a typical month's worth of transactions on fxTrade. It revealed that out of every 1,000 accounts with a 50:1 leverage, 302 accounts (or 30 percent) received at least one margin call in the time period specified. Comparatively, out of every 1,000 accounts with 10:1 leverage, only 23 accounts (or 2.3 percent) were subjected to a margin call. This latter group of accounts trading on 10:1 leverage received a margin call 13 times less than the accounts with a 50:1 leverage.\n\nThe term \"leverage\" is often used to describe margin requirements. For example, leverage of 50:1 corresponds to a margin requirement of two percent (one divided by 50 is 0.02 or two percent). A two percent margin requirement means that if you wish to open a new position, you must have two percent of the size of that position available as margin.\n\nThere are significant risks involved when trading with a highly leveraged account. While margin allows traders to make bigger trades and to potentially make significant profits, it can equally increase the chance of a large loss. That in-turn can trigger a margin call if funds in an account drop below the minimum required level.\n\nTo ensure clients can cover any losses they may incur, OANDA requires sufficient collateral or margin. Although there is no minimum deposit required to open an fxTrade account, the margin available in each account will limit the size of the positions the account holder can open.\n\nLowering leverage does not necessarily prevent margin calls. But as the statistics show, it can reduce your chances of being margin called since higher leverage imposes a higher margin requirement when placing trades.Subsequently, this helps OANDA clients to maintain the margin in their accounts in order to support their open positions and to reduce the potential of incurring losses.\n\nWhat methods do you use to ensure you're never caught in the unfortunate position to receive a margin call? What rate of leverage do you consider to be ideal? Please share your comments in the box below.\n\nLeverage trading is high risk and not suitable for all. You could lose all of your deposited funds.

      "text": "Forex Foreign Exchange\n\nForex is the abbreviation for a powerful market known by the name of foreign exchange. It is a global trade market that runs throughout the day from dawn till dusk except for the weekends. As the term suggests, a particular currency is traded against another currency. This type of currency trading became popular as people started investing in companies that are based in foreign countries. When this type of investment happens, the foreign currency has to be converted into local currency before being used. This paved the way for foreign exchange.\n\nForex trading can be done by anyone from any part of the world. All that is needed is a trading account which can be easily got from an online forex broker. Once you get to know how to trade, you should start trading. The best way to start your forex trading is to find out information about the best performing currency pair. If you need any help regarding this, you can definitely rely on your forex broker. There are different terminologies in foreign exchange. There is something known as a forex signal. These signals can aid you a lot if you know how it works and how it affects a particular currency pair. These signals are just graphical representations which can be interpreted and used for trading. Forex signals are provided by forex experts and mostly these are based on Fibonacci series.\n\nIf you don't have time to carry out the trading manually, you can also use a forex robot. These forex robots are automated forex trading software that can enter and exit out of the trade at specific period. You can also set the currency pair to trade. But, it is advisable to trade manually whenever possible as forex software can break down or malfunction at any point of time. Also, if you set the parameters incorrectly, you can lose a lot of money.\n\nWith such huge potential, forex market is also serves as a treat to scammers. There are lots of websites online that advertise to provide you with signals that can help you earn a lot. Once you buy that particular signal from them, you may see that those signals are of no help to you. This kind of cheating exists in all fields and forex is not an exception. So, before you invest in a forex related business, you should verify whether you are investing in a genuine business."

      "text": "Analyst or Trader?\n\nTrading is composed of two separate, but equally important tasks, namely market analysis and trading. Market analysis is the technical or fundamental analysis of a market's price movement, and trading is the placing of buy and sell orders to make trades. Most traders do not consider the difference between market analysis and trading (usually to their detriment), but being aware of the difference can make a significant improvement to your trading (or at least help you avoid making a significant mistake).\n\nAnalyst or Trader?\n\nMost traders consider themselves to be traders, and perform their analysis and make their trades themselves, but not all traders are proficient at both tasks. Some traders are very good market analysts but are very bad traders, and vice versa, some traders are very bad market analysts but are very good traders.\n\nMarket analysis and trading are very different tasks and require different psychological traits. For example, market analysis as an isolated task is neither profitable nor unprofitable (i.e. market analysis itself neither makes nor loses trading capital), so it does not have any of the associated emotions (e.g. fear or greed). On the other hand, trading as an isolated task is either profitable or unprofitable (i.e. making a trade will either make or lose trading capital), so the emotions that are not applicable to market analysis are very relevant to trading.\n\nIt is therefore very possible (even likely) that one trader could be an excellent market analyst, but could fall apart under the pressure of making trades (i.e. placing and managing their orders), while another trader could be a terrible market analyst, but have a psychological profile that is well suited to making trades.\n\nTrading Partnerships\n\nOne solution to overcoming the differences between market analysis and trading is to find your opposite and form a (potentially very profitable) trading partnership. For example, if you are a market analyst (i.e. you can identify when and where to make profitable trades), forming a partnership with a trader (i.e. someone who is unable to perform correct market analysis, but can make and manage trades without succumbing to the emotional pitfalls) could be significantly profitable for both of you.\n\nIf you are an analyst, finding a trader could be as simple as finding a broker that will execute your instructions (e.g. make a long trade at this price, with this target, and this stop loss), because you will be one level away from actually making your trades. If you are a trader, finding an analyst could be as simple as subscribing to a trading service that provides analysis and / or trades that you can make yourself."

      "text": "Trading Strategy in a Bear Market\n\nThe term bear market refers to a market condition in which the prices of securities are falling. This type of market is generally associated with investor pessimism. Most investors agree that a bear market occurs when prices decline at least 20 percent over a two month period. Below are some trading strategy tips to remember during a bear market so that your portfolio remains healthy.\n\nBuy Puts\n\nBuying puts is a typical bear market trading strategy. It gives investors a limited downside and, if done correctly, it also gives a high chance of reward. The maximum loss for investors using this trading strategy is the amount paid for the contracts. For investors to earn rewards, they need to correctly anticipate the date stock prices begin falling, as it will need to fall prior to the expiration date.\n\nSell Naked Calls\n\nSelling naked calls is a trading strategy that has high risks and limited rewards so take caution when considering this option. Investors that sell naked calls collect a premium for the sale of the contracts with the thought that the stock price will remain under the strike price past expiration. This will effectively make the stock worthless and the premium is kept by the original investor. If the price exceeds the strike price, investor losses can add up quickly.\n\nBear Call Spreads\n\nThis trading strategy incorporates low risk but limited reward and is created by selling at-the-money calls while also buying the same number of out-of-the-money calls. Investors employing a bear call spread trading strategy want the stock to fall below the strike price of the calls sold prior to expiration in order for the investor to keep the premium.\n\nBear Put Spreads\n\nA bear put spread trading strategy is created by buying at-the-money puts and selling out-of-the-money puts. The potential loss for investors applying this trading strategy is limited to the cost of initiating the trade.\n\nPut Back Spreads\n\nWhen investors are expecting a large drop in an already hostile market, they utilize a put back spread trading strategy. It involves selling a put at strike price while buying other puts at lower strike prices. This method, though it has very little risk involved, also has limited rewards for those who are successful.\n\nSynthetic Shorts\n\nFinally, a synthetic short is a trading strategy that mirrors short selling a stock. It is created by buying at-the-money puts and simultaneously selling an equal amount of at-the-money calls with the same expiration date.\n\nIn times when most investors have lost confidence in the market and it is heading towards being labeled a bear market, you are still able to make returns on your stocks. Follow the above trading strategies for successful trading."

      "text": "Options Trading & Analysis\n\nOptions Insider Awards: Product of the Year\n\nTwelve expiration dates a year just didn't seem like it was enough. Why not make it 52?\n\nWhile some people think that they're a recent phenomenon, the CBOE announced the first option to have a weekly expiration, SPX, on September 9, 2005. With a lifespan of only a week, weeklies gave investors a new way of trading options around specific news or events. Due to their brief lifetime, weekly options have less time value. This keeps the option premium down relative to a similar option with a longer time to expiry, so the options offer extra leverage; just a small movement in the underlying value can generate an attractive return.\n\nBased on the chart below, it looks like patience was necessary to see Weekly options become a bona fide success (click to enlarge):\n\nWhat spurred the sudden interest? Well, On June 4, 2010 CBOE introduced weeklies on a bunch of ETFs and equities, and shortly thereafter it expanded their lifespan by a day. Now you can find them everywhere. CME. Eurex. ISE. They're everywhere. What does this mean? Opportunity.\n\nThese supercharged options are not for the faint of heart, but do provide some tremendous potential.\n\nOne might expect that the longer the time to expiration the larger the time premium -- and you would be right. Longer dated options have greater extrinsic value than their shorter dated cousins. What is interesting about this feature of time decay is that it accelerates as time passes, so that an option that has 60 days to expiration might decay at a rate of $.03 per day, whereas an option with 7 days to expiration might decay at a rate of $.10 per day. In other words, a short term asset wastes away very quickly. In fact, weekly expiration options decay so fast you can actually see it.\n\nSo, congratulations weekly expiration options. You were a landslide winner in the first annual Options Insider product of the year awards."

Successful trading involves continuously educating oneself about the new technology available and fine-tuning one's insight and understanding of the ever-changing markets. The stock market is a sophisticated playing field with high stakes and ever changing methods and the need for keen hindsight as well as foresight. Successful mentors can be of great assistance, as can the knowledge that the stock market puts you up against well-versed individuals that know and understand the market logarithms and algorithms. It may not be a simple venture, but with the insight and mentoring of successful traders it can be profitable and rewarding. Numerous 'top-notch' traders that are highly seasoned and successful with the stock markets can offer a plethora of advice to new and advanced traders alike.\n\nStock Education and Planning\n\nThe ability to educate oneself and maintain a level of updated and current knowledge and understanding of the market, from valuable tips to current trends will be of utmost benefit for trading success. At any given time, a change is taking place in the financial/political markets. That change could be the key to profit. It is crucial to stay abreast of factors or events that impact the market and take advantage of the opportunities that are out there. Traders should conduct their business and make critical financial decisions with clarity, always. Find a comfort zone – choose times when you are clear and stress-free, develop a comfortable area in which to work, limit the size of your trades to levels that cause you no undue stress or fear, and venture into markets for which you have an educated understanding. Develop a strategy and master it – there are many strategies but traders must identify a method that they find comfortable and stick with it. Have a structured plan from entry to target to stopping point.\n\nTraders should always know something about the commodity by keeping up with news sources and current information, set a profit goal, and know when you will cut your losses and stop. Learn from your own successes and mistakes with self-analysis. By conducting a 'post-trade' assessment, even keeping a post-trade chart, you may more readily identify good decisions as well as errors. Always learn from your past and apply the lessons to the present trading scenarios. Exercise discipline and patience as you continue to learn and stay abreast of new methods and technology. Stay focused and determined, even in the face of a loss.\n\nAdvice of the Pros\n\nTaking advice from those who have found their own keys to financial success and trading profit is a great way to broaden your horizons. Of course, tease out the practices and suggestions that you are most comfortable with and move forward with confidence. Additional tips from some well-versed trading pros include a variety of pointers and approaches that could improve your trading game! Start with some advice on cutting losses – numerous traders will tell you to cut your losses and cut them quickly. Although losses are part of trading, one should always limit losses and when you do encounter them, accept them and move forward.\n\nPart of minimizing loss and investing without fear would be to employ a good risk management plan. Have that stop, or point at which you know you will exit, pre-determined and be self-disciplined enough to act upon it when you need to act upon it. Do not attempt to 'fight' the market, for the market will inevitably win, and if it is time to get out then get out. Be patient and avoid rash decisions like selling something that shows profit or hanging on to something that shows loss. Your expectation in position sizing and your 'risk to reward' ratio are a critical part of your plan, as well.\n\nUnderstand what some call the \"15 Minute\" Rule – which is that if your stock surpasses the high in the first 15 minutes, it is likely to keep moving up for the day, and vice versa if your stock fails the low in the first 15 minutes, it is likely to continue downward for the day. The caution here is that is your 10-day expected movements must have a slope (cannot be flat) for the 15 minute rule to hold true. Some of the seasoned pros in the stock market arena may tell you to minimize your emotions and never purchase high and then relinquish low – basically don't panic but if it doesn't feel right, you might want to remove it. Maintaining your capital is just as important, even more so, than seeing capital appreciate. Never buy on margin, follow the trends, and always be ready to adapt to the change because inevitably there will be change.\n\nWhat do you think of this financial article?

      "text": "Ascending Triangle Stock Chart Pattern\n\nAn ascending triangle pattern is one of the most popular stock chart\nformations\nemployed by investors who follow technical analysis. Ascending triangle\npatterns offer the investor an additional edge to help beat the market. When\nused incorrectly, ascending triangles chart patterns can contribute to further losses.\nThis article will help you get started in using ascending triangle patterns to help\nimprove your investing results.\n\nDescription of Ascending Triangle Chart Patterns\n\nThe classic ascending triangle pattern used by technical analysts has a\nhorizontal trend and another trend that slopes up, forming a triangle.\n\nThe horizontal trend forms when the price has rises to this level at\nleast twice. The price does not have to actually touch the horizontal\ntrend, though it should come close. This trading action comes from the behavior of\nsellers who overcome the buying volume, when the price reaches the horizontal trend.\nNew buying steps in as the price retreats to push the price back up again. On\neach dip the buying overcomes the selling at a higher low, as interest in the\nstock grows. These higher lows form the rising trend.\n\nThe rising trend of the ascending triangle is defined by at least two price declines creating higher\nlows. While the price does not have to touch the rising trend, it should come\nclose as this is an indication of the underlying buying strength of the stock\nprice pattern.\n\nVolume normally declines over the life of the ascending triangle chart as the selling pressure tends\nto diminish. This decrease in volume helps to open the door to the breakout.\nBreakouts take place when the price closes above the horizontal trend. Ideally,\nthe breakout is accompanied by higher volume, though it is not required, as much\nof the selling pressure has been removed by the repeated moves up to the\nhorizontal trend.\n\nBreakouts on an ascending triangle pattern should take place more than half way through the\nformation of the triangle and\nbefore reaching the apex.\n\nOften the price will re-test the horizontal trend, giving investors another\nopportunity to buy. In the example of an ascending triangle below, there were two re-tests that held.\n\nTrading Ascending Triangle Chart Patterns\n\nWhen the price pierces the horizontal resistance we have a breakout of the\nascending triangle. In some\ncases we will see above average volume on the breakout as traders are buying.\nHowever, it is not necessary. If the volume is at or below average and the price\nbreaks up, it is likely the selling pressure has diminished. This allows any\nbuying to push up the price of the shares. This is one of the few situations\nwhen we can have a move up with below average volume.\n\nInvestors should look to buy on the initial break. However, you can also wait\nfor the re-test as another re-entry point. Unfortunately, the re-test does not\nalways take place, so you cannot count on it.\n\nMany investors use the measured rule to estimate the gain they expect from\ntrading the ascending triangle pattern. The measured rule calculates the difference of the low\npoint of the ascending triangle chart and the horizontal trend. Then add this\ndifference to the horizontal trend to calculate the exit target. In the sample\nchart above the low is approximately 32.80 and the horizontal trend is 36.20.\nThe difference is 3.40 (36.20 - 32.80 = 3.40). Add this difference to the\nhorizontal trend 36.20 and you get 39.60 as your target. (36.20 + 3.40 = 39.60).\nThis target can be the first exit where many investors will sell half of their\nposition to capture the profit and use the money to invest in other\nopportunities. The remaining half is covered by a trailing stop that is above the\nbreakout and just below a support level, allowing them to capture any further\nmove up.\n\nRisks using Ascending Triangle Chart Patterns\n\nThe success of the ascending triangle stock chart pattern is closely aligned with buying on the\nup side breakout of the horizontal resistance. Investors who enter before the\nbreakout assume higher risk primarily from a premature break either up or down.\n\nPremature breakouts on an ascending triangle chart occur the price rises through resistance before the pattern\nhas had a chance to develop. The price can break down through the rising trend\nending the validity of the pattern before it develops. The ascending triangle\nchart is prone to these type of failures, which is why an investor should be\nsure the ascending triangle pattern fully develops before making a commitment.\n\nMany investors and investing sites will classify a stock pattern as an ascending triangle,\neven though it fails to meet the specific guidelines. When this occurs, it is\nmore likely the pattern will fail. It is tempting to call a pattern an ascending\ntriangle even when it does not meet all the criteria. When investors take this\naction they are creating additional risk of a bad trade. There is enough risk\nwhen investing in the stock market. Why add to the risk with an improperly\nclassified ascending triangle chart pattern.\n\nTo avoid these risks take the time to properly identify the ascending\ntriangle stock chart. If the pattern fails to meet the criteria review\nother possibilities including an head and shoulder tops and rising channels.\n\nWhile the ascending triangle is a popular stock chart pattern, it does not\ntranspire that often. When you find an occurrence, you should follow it\ncarefully as the pattern produces some of the best results.\n\nIf you are interested in a free monthly newsletter on the stock market trends,\nplease send an email to\nservice@tradingonlinemarkets.com with your email address stating you wish to\nreceive the Free Monthly Newsletter and you will be added to the list.\n\nEach of our portfolios have beaten the market since our inception, thanks in\npart to our use of the chart patterns like the ascending triangle.\nRequest a free four-week trial membership to the\nPremier Membership.

This is not the same as a loss, but it is lost money. The only scenario in which this isn't true, is if the price is never going to recover to the previously established market value and your new selling price is representative of the true market value. Then you haven't lost anything at all.\n\nHowever, if things are selling for 100, and you settle for 50, there's no reality where it isn't true that you didn't just lose 50. That 50 is represented in a value that describes why you didn't sell for 100. Impatience, ignorance, or anything in between is worth that value you sacrificed from"

This is how the structure of the stock market looks like:\n\nBy its very nature, the stock market tends to be very monopolistic. There is only one entity, one specialist that controls prices. All trades must go through this specialist. Because of this, prices can easily be altered to benefit the specialist, and not traders.\n\nHow does this happen?\n\nIn the stock market, the specialist is forced to fulfill the order of its clients. Now, let's say the number of sellers suddenly exceed the number of buyers. The specialist, which is forced to fulfill the order of its clients, the sellers in this case, is left with a bunch of stock that he cannot sell-off to the buyer side.\n\nIn order to prevent this from happening, the specialist will simply widen the spread or increase the transaction cost to prevent sellers from entering the market. In other words, the specialists can manipulate the quotes it is offering to accommodate its needs."

      "text": "\"Hit the bid\" is a slang term that is used in investment circles to describe a situation in which one broker is willing to sell an asset at a price that is extended by a different broker. Usually, this means taking up an offer from another broker that is currently the best possible bid considering the current condition of the marketplace. In effect, the bidder who is trying to sell the asset decides to commit to or hit the bid of the other broker as the means of effecting a transaction between the two parties.\n\nThe general idea behind a hit the bid strategy is to lock in the best possible price for an asset that an investor wishes to sell. To that end, the broker who is managing the sale on behalf of that investor will often set an ask price that is based on factors such as the current market price and the future potential of the asset to gradually increase in value. With that ask price in mind, the broker will make the rounds to see what type of price the market will bear. Often, the best possible price will equal the current market price associated with the security. At other times, the best price may be more or less than that market price. The broker will sort through all possible bid prices for the security, then focus on the highest bids that other brokers are willing to pay for the security. In this manner, the broker is able to obtain the best possible price for his or her client.\n\nOne way to understand what happens in a hit the bid scenario is to consider an asset that the investor is willing to sell at a price of $100 US dollars (USD) per share. The broker will let the price be known and identify offers from other brokers who are acting on behalf of their clients. If no one is willing to pay the $100 USD per share, but there is one who is willing to pay $99 USD per share, the selling broker will consult with the investor and, if the offer is acceptable, proceed to hit the bid and arrange the deal with the buying broker.\n\nMany brokers hit the bid every trading day. Depending on the type of investment involved and how much in demand that security happens to be, sorting through possible bids may take some time. This is particularly true if the asset in question is perceived by investors as having a significant amount of potential for growth, either in the short-term or the long-term. If there is relatively little interest in the asset that the investor wishes to sell, the broker may find that identifying the right bid to hit can be managed quickly."

You mean to tell me that HFT rig the market and pocket the difference??? Why, that should be illegal... Wait we are talking about wall street, right? Illegal only counts if you can prove it in a court of law. And then they will admit no wrong doing and then pay a fine that is 1/100000 what they have made from performing the illegal activity.\n\nBig surprise..the system is rotten down to its very core. The exchanges in their rush to become public companies and maximize revenues (to maximize share price and bonus pools), made a deal with the devil and have actually designed their systems to the flash traders specs. This 'controlled chaos' normally allows the flash traders to profit while not being noticed by the average investor (with the exception of enhanced market volatility) but for these cretins it's not enough...they have to rig the game so far in their favor that straight shooting investors lose it all. Shame on all of these gentleman. Here is a clear case where intervention is required by a public advocate...and we need it soon. If confidence is not restored quickly we are in for a long winter's night.\n\nDelayed reporting, out of sequence trades, volume, price reporting and other shenanigans have been going on for years now and it has never been limited to the HFT crowd. The exchanges are where the blame goes.\n\nIf someone wants to make a case for manipulation, simply watch an overall market chart for a few months. Take note of the following: one, the number of days that start with a great deal of selling early in the morning that stops about 8:45 EST and then rebounds to nearly where the market opened. Then, the market usually remains fairly flat until 1:30 or 2 EST and then it either rockets upward or drops. Or, two, there is a big spike in the morning and then trading remains fairly flat for the rest of the day.\n\nI am not heavy chart watcher but I have just noticed these trends developing since the crash of 2008. Perhaps I am making a mountain out of a molehill but it does appear odd to me.\n\nI guess one of the HFT must have installed an upgrade that screwed up the system on May 6th. Oops...their bad.\n\nRe: \"...Then, the market usually remains fairly flat until 1:30 or 2 EST..\", it could be my imagination, but I also happened to observe that the market is usually in a bit of a daily douldrum during the lunch time hours from 1200 to 1315. Traders go out to lunch. So if you are bottom fishing a particular stock, you might want to catch it during this period.\n\nI call them Dr Zeus days. Pop-en-dropalous and the reverse Drop-en-popalous. Then there is the 3 to 4pm express elevator. Somedays it goes up and some days it goes down. Basically all the little retail investor is left with is the crumbs......\n\nC'mon.... didn't you see the \"lead\" to this story months ago when it was revealed that G/S had a plug into the line on which every trade is communicated prior to the official execution site, thereby giving them nanoseconds worth of \"advance\" notice?\n\nIf G/S has this, one might ask if they are the \"rogue\" traders.\n\nIf not, there is another leak between the traders and the execution point?\n\nHow many rogues do we need to spoil the barrel that is already filled with bruises from being pushed around, hither, thither, and yon?\n\nIt's not just Goldman...it is every major bank, investment bank and brokerage. They all have these connections to the exchanges. Another great bastion of free market capitalism ruined by a bunch of greedy scumbags where being a billionaire is simply not enough...they want to be own your house, your car, and your future.\n\nWhat is the effect on an investor who buys and sells infrequently? He/she may lose something in the execution of the purchase or sale, but if this takes place no more than quarterly, is it likely to have a material effect on investment performance.\n\nWhile having illegally manipulated markets is criminal, and should be treated as such, as a practical matter does this affect investors who are not trying to out-trade the brokerage houses on a day to day basis?\n\nwhoever THEY are... we retailers are gamed... look at the large spikes on the intraday quote charts that usually goes away within a few minutes... or those executed trades I get back daily as they are listed as 32.2299 (rounded up as 32.23) or 16.0399 (RU as 16.04) for example, of course THEY pocket the small difference like the banks that round off the 1/100 which makes no difference to the individual retail customer but it's still robbery when it involves millions of transactions.\n\nGiant skimming operation, aided, abetted and encouraged by the SEC who defends their \"constituents\", the various exchanges, HFT trading operations, Goldman etc. Anyone except the individual investor who doesn't generate enough volume for the SEC to be concerned.\n\nWhat I want to know is why TYP, the 3x Tech Bear ETF printed .15 on May 6th, down from the $8 I paid for it that day when it should have been a moonshot. I believe QID also saw similar action.\n\nIt's little wonder why the average retail investor is saying \"screw the markets, I want return OF capital over return ON capital\" and running to bonds, cash, and gold.\n\nThe fact that 70-80% of all trading volume is \"black boxes\" trading with one another is indicative that on that fact alone the equity markets are overvalued.\n\nHFT needs to be heavily regulated, especially with regard to how they send fraudulent orders never intending to have them filled.\n\nAnd while they're at it, they need to outlaw (or refuse to provide legal cover for) naked CDS transactions. If you don't have an interest in the underlying asset, you shouldn't be able to bet on it's default.\n\nThat's so blatantly, and obviously, simple that the British learned that lesson in 1746 when they passed the Maritime Insurance Act that prohibited naked insurance contracts on maritime shipping.\n\nUntil these two factors are resolved/eliminated, I doubt I'll ever again find myself becoming a long-term investor. I'll stick to day-trading so I can sleep at night.\n\nOn the subject of naked CDS', you are absolutely correct. In essence these are illegal insurance contracts. You have to have an insurable interest for example to purchase any insurance contract on a house or someone's life...why ? Because if you did not...it would give any unscrupulous scoundrel a reason to bump you off or burn down your house. AG Cuomo was going to go after these as illegal insurance contracts but got cold feet once he realized his running for governor money would be cut off from his Wall Street buddies if he did...end of story. These things will once again bring the capital markets down...within the next 3 to 5 years IMHO.\n\nI'm a firm believer a computer is only as good/smart as it's programmer. To that, you make a great point (thumbs up click). However, in this case, the computer (aka-HFT) is functioning fine as an evil, corrupt, capital sucking greed box...like its programmers.\n\nthe 'fault' clearly is with the exchanges. i will bet within a year or two, there will be some actually advertising they DON'T all ow HFT, and the gov't will force them to advertise how much activity and payments go to thee entities. once the gov't goofs figure out mom and pop have left the rip off casino, they'll force those skmbg azzholes who run the TSX et al to put in print how it actually runs. once that happens , the jigs up.\n\nI think a big reason that the government can't/won't crack down on HFT is that they're afraid that people that trade in milliseconds won't trade in seconds so volume will plummet and so may the prices.\n\nAs was mentioned earlier, HFT dominates the volume but they've also scared out a lot of retail investors which gives them more power.\n\nHold on a sec - hasn't one of the hallmarks of the last 18 months been strangely low volumes for the amount of movement we've seen? Particularly, strange days when the market went in reverse of what the current news would have expected.\n\nIf so, that means according to your reasoning that this phenomenon is wielding highly disproportional power to swing the market - meaning that the market is functioning for the profits of the few irrespective of the natural market flow that may be normally contributed by the many, so to speak.\n\nSomeone noted a while ago that the market movements often \"smell\" and another asked the question about the government running the market trends...\n\nPut that all together.... and one has to ask who is controlling the market."

To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers, click the \"Reprints\" link at the top of any article.\n\nETFs: Analyze to profit\n\nThe top-down exchange-traded fund (ETF) strategy is designed to make consistent profits in both up and down markets. Based on a summary of this approach, most traders can get off the ground quickly. The top-down approach consists of three main steps, detailed in \"Going with the flow\" (below).\n\nThe first step is to determine the overall trend of the broad market: up, down or sideways. This is done through some basic trend analysis on charts of the major indexes, the time frames of which are dependent on whether a person is a daytrader, swing trader or longer-term position trader.\n\nThe second step is to identify the industry sector indexes (including commodity and currency indexes) that are participating most strongly in the prevailing market trend. In a bull market, we would seek sector indexes showing the most relative strength to the major indexes. In a bear market, we would look for indexes with the most relative weakness.\n\nFinally, the third step is to determine which specific ETF family is performing best within that particular sector index. For example, if semiconductors were a strong index, we would compare the relative performance of all semiconductor ETFs to see which one within the sector is performing the strongest.\n\nGetting technical\n\nThe first step requires basic technical analysis that seeks to determine whether the S&P 500 or Nasdaq is in a dominant uptrend, downtrend or is range-bound. The time frame of the charts analyzed is dependent on the trader's preferred holding period. If your trades are focused on, say, an average two- to five-week time horizon, you could use the daily time frame. Longer-term investors might use a weekly chart instead. Ultra short-term traders could use an intraday hourly chart time frame (or less).\n\nNext, look for a series of at least two consecutive higher highs and higher lows (to basically define an uptrend) or two consecutive lower highs and lower lows (to determine a downtrend). This is just as easy as it sounds. A simple strategy is always best because it is most easily followed with discipline. We can see this analysis in \"Going higher\" (below), taken from a recent up trending period of the broad market. The point is marked where the S&P 500 confirms a new uptrend, after breaking out above a sideways range on its daily chart.\n\nThe second step in the top-down strategy is to determine which indexes are showing the most relative strength or weakness to the broad market. There are two basic ways to accomplish this. The first way, which is probably easiest for traders just starting out with this strategy, is to compose a series of percentage-change charts, each of which compares the relative value of a particular index to the benchmark S&P 500 index. With this type of chart, we are not interested in actual prices; rather, we only want to see how an index has performed relative to the broad market. \"Around the world\" (below) shows a view of numerous sector indexes along with their relative performance to the S&P 500. These charts show relative price comparisons over the past 10 days.\n\nClick chart to enlarge.\n\nJust a quick glance at this screenshot shows that gold, Treasury bonds, and the U.S. dollar (each highlighted with a pink rectangle) are currently exhibiting the most relative strength compared to the S&P 500. Conversely, highlighted with a blue triangle, both the oil service index and solar energy index show the most relative weakness. The former indexes may be potential buy candidates on a pullback, while the latter may be potential short sale candidates when the indexes bounce into resistance.\n\nThe other way of finding relative strength or weakness among various sector indexes is by using a quote watch list that includes numerous indexes, sorted by their relative performance to the S&P 500. This is a better method for traders who are good with numbers, after they have gotten the gist of the method above.\n\nNarrowing down\n\nOnce the strongest index has been identified (for going long) or weakest index (for selling short), drill down to the third step of the top-down strategy to see which specific ETF family associated with the index is showing the most relative strength or weakness to its corresponding index. Depending on the popularity of the index, there could be as little as just one ETF associated with the index, or there might be as many as 10 or more ETFs. To do so, we again employ percentage-change charts to overlay various ETF ticker symbols against each other.\n\nIf, for example, we determine the Biotech index ($BTK) is showing the most relative strength, then overlay the tickers of the main ETFs in that sector. \"Finding the trade\" (below) compares the relative performances of several different ETFs in the biotech sector.\n\nUsing the percentage-change chart to compare relative price performance of various ETFs within a particular index, it only takes a quick glance to determine which individual ETF is showing the most leadership (relative strength) to the actual index during any time interval of analysis. On the chart, First Trust Biotech (FBT) is slightly outperforming the actual $BTK Index. Conversely, the Biotech HOLDR (BBH) is the biggest laggard, registering only half the gain of the $BTK. Although both FBT and BBH are biotech ETFs, there was a huge difference in terms of relative price performance. Without using this type of chart to spot the most relative strength, you could easily make the mistake of buying the laggard. Conversely, if trying to determine relative weakness, it's equally imperative to make sure you are selling short the weakest ETF within the weakest sector index.\n\nBecause there are more than 700 ETFs in the U.S. market, it's easy to be overwhelmed when it comes time to decide on the specific issue to trade. The Morpheus ETF Roundup, a free download, is a compilation of the main ETFs by sector and sub-sector, simplifying the process of zeroing in on the most relevant ETFs for relative price comparisons (download Futures 2010 ETF Guide).\n\nWhen scanning for potential plays, first filter out any ETFs with an average daily volume of less than 100,000 shares. Although ETFs are synthetic instruments, and liquidity is therefore not a direct concern, lightly-traded ETFs frequently have large bid-ask spreads. Furthermore, there is usually a suitable, less thinly-traded ETF with a similar portfolio composition.\n\nBeyond the average daily volume requirement, simply choose the ETF with the most relative strength/weakness or chart pattern, rather than subjectively deciding which ETF group you prefer. Nevertheless, it's important to realize commodity, leveraged and inverse ETFs are not created equally. For example, there are several different ETFs designed to track the price of the crude oil futures contracts, but some track more closely to the underlying commodity than others.\n\nIt's a similar situation with leveraged and inverse short ETFs. Because these types of ETFs rely on a daily portfolio rebalancing of derivatives to arrive at their share price, they will rarely track exactly in sync with the underlying index they're designed to follow, especially over the longer term. As with the commodity ETFs, some ETF families track more closely to the index than others. As mentioned earlier, a percentage-change chart that overlays the various ETFs of a particular sector with the index they're designed to track is the quickest and easiest way to determine which ETF is the best to choose.\n\nThis article covered the basic steps to get one started with sector trading of ETFs, based on a relative strength top-down technique. A future article will demonstrate a preferred technique for determining the most ideal entry and exit points after the proper ETF is selected.\n\nDeron Wagner manages the Morpheus Capital hedge fund and is the author of \"Trading ETFs: Gaining An Edge With Technical Analysis.\" He also edits the Wagner Daily newsletter.

      "text": "Looking to do more research in lines and line movement. What's the relationship between opening and closing? All i've read is that if you can beat the closing line consistantly you will be profitable. What does the movement mean throughout the day? How can it give an edge?\n\nCan anyone point me in the direction of a reliable source of information on this topic?\nThis forum is loaded with talent and I'm hoping to tap into your knowledge to continue to grow as a bettor.\n\nI believe there is a thread in the So_money section discussing this topic but I could be wrong, I'd start there, but here's my 2 cents.\n\nAs far as I've been told, line movement is based on the market. Now the market is affected by a ton of factors: injuries, trends, amount of $ bet on one particular side, the bookmakers opinion of the game, etc..\n\nI'm not positive, but pretty sure the majority of line movements are created by too many bets on one side. Bookmakers attempt to limit risk by trying to get an even split on games so they don't take huge hits. However, that's not exactly black and white. Sometimes, if they feel they have a great read/inside info they will hold on a number even as the bets pile up on one side.\n\nThere are just a ton of factors that go into line movement.\n\nIn the NFL, the way I get the best number is by creating my own power ratings before lines are released. Then when the lines are released, I immediately know if the line is pretty good or crazy. Sometimes I'm wrong on the line being off, but the majority of the time the line moves in my favor.\n\nI find being prepared pre line release to be one of the best tools to get the best number possible.\n\nJS has a great start to this thread, and I will add-on to what he has.\n\nLine movement is indeed keyed by the amount, or volume, of money being place on a side or total. Thinking of it in a logic way, if you risked losing 5,000 dollars with Side A, and only 2,500 dollars with Side B, wouldn't you want to do something to decrease the risk on Side A, or in a sense, get them as close to even as possible? Oddsmakers adjust odds to better even out the money, and they profit through the juice you lay. In sports with key numbers, such as the NFL, the oddsmaker will carefully monitor money around key numbers so that they don't expose themselves to middles or huge losses on one side. I hope that makes sense.\n\nThroughout the day, odds can move for a variety of reasons, as JS mentioned. One aspect he didn't hit on is headfakes by those looking for a better number. The daily movement doesn't apply to all sports, specifically the NFL, but for NBA and NCAAB, and I suppose baseball lines too, it does. For example, I have the game between Team A and Team B capped at a total of 178, and the opening total is 179. Clearly, the difference on the opening number is not high enough to warrant an under play, but I know if I can move that line up three or four points, the play is a go. It is my understanding that if a syndicate or tout service finds itself in the above situation, it will tell it's customers to bet, say, 100 dollars on the over, to move it up to a better number, and than once it hits the desired number, bet 200 or whatever increased amount on the under now that they have the number they deem desirable for a play on the under. Does that make sense?\n\nJS is correct in saying having your numbers beforehand is absolutely vital, as even missing a point or two can make a huge difference. I like to have my NBA numbers ready to go by 10 p.m. EST so I can immediately check out the overnight lines, and then watch where they go in the morning. Some will hit the overnights right away, but I'm not confident enough in my numbers yet to do so. However, like I said, if you have the total 190, for example, and the overnight is 193, but you wake up and others have moved the line to, say, 191, you've already missed the value you saw the night before, therefore, in most cases, making it a no play, for me anyways.\n\nFinally, there is no opening and close relationship, other than the fact the market will try and take advantage of the opening number so that they are not stuck with an undesirable number when it closes. Does this mean all closing numbers are undesirable? Absolutely not. But are they in most case? Pretty much.\n\nFeel free to inquire about any of the above, as I'm drained and sorta rambling, or ask any new questions the above or JS bring about."

I for one am interested in finding out as much as I can about investing including foreign currency. I plan on creating a good amount of passive income by buying, selling and speculating on foreign exchange and re-investing the profits.\n\nThere is so much information on the interwebs about what automated tool there are to buy or what to look out for in different markets.I personally get very overwhelmed with how much is out there, and I know the same is true for other people. There is just simply too much information to go through it all. Many people give up entirely at that point and miss out on a lifetime of potential earnings simply because they find the whole thing too intimidating. What if there was something more steadfast and reliable that could keep you informed on what is going in on the markets? What if you could absorb all of the economic data from Europe as well? Well, the great thing is that something like that exists' like NEO (\"I know Kungfu\") you can drip feed only the most pertinent information and metaphorically 'download' (or channel into perhaps) this into your brain whilst you trade .\n\nThe Alpari Squawk news feed is basically an audio stream – it's something that gives you updates, data schedules, and info about major upcoming events and release times. It helps keep you informed on what is out there and provides a better source of news that can help you make better decisions when you trade foreign exchange. This can potentially save you a lot of research time which is always a very good thing, as time is money. It saves a lot of hassle by letting you know what's going on in the economic world so that you can make the best informed decision possible when buying and trading. The best part? All this is free as long as you have an account with the 3rd party (or broker) offering the service.\n\nKeeping people informed on what is going on in the markets is of vital importance. In a world where one false move can cost you hundreds or even thousands, having anything that can give you an edge in the markets can be awesome indeed! If you are interested in more market analysis, the website Alpari can provide more information to help out with every trader's need.It can also direct you to other resource tools that help with technical analysis- If you have no idea what I've been talking about for the last 5 mins then I'd recommend checking out their video tutorials for a bit of insight.

      "text": "A simple moving average is formulated by adding up the last X number of market days' closing prices and dividing that total by X.\n\nFor example, if you wanted to calculate a stock XYZ's 3 day simple moving average. You would add up 3 day's closing prices. Let's say XYZ's closed at, 10, 11 and 12 the last 3 days. These prices added together equals 33. We then take that number an divide it by the number of days used, which is 3. So, you would plot 33/3 (= 11) over 3 days on the chart to show the moving average.\n\n($10+$11+$12) / 3 = $11 (3-Day Simple Average Price)\n\nYou might be saying, \"Okay, great I know how to calculate a simple moving average now. So what, my charting tool already does that!\" Well, this way you should hopefully have a better understanding of how the SMA works and therefore have a greater ability to use it to help with your technical analysis.\n\nSimple Moving Average Example\n\nThe above chart shows 3 examples of simple moving averages. Obviously, the closer the time span gets to 0 days, the closer it represents the actual price chart, and the faster it responds to price trends. The opposite is also true, the greater the number of days used to calculate the SMA the less quickly it responds to the current price trend.\n\nWith looking at the simple moving average in the above chart, you will notice how it has the ability to quiet out some of the \"market noise\" and give you an easier way to predict future price movements."

The tree shakes, and it shakes bad. Speculators all around drop to the floor as if they were over-ripened fruit long past its due date.\n\nWhat can a reasonable trader do in a day like this? It's actually quite simple, if care was taken before this day came, one would have a few short hedges in place, and obviously, one wouldn't have any excess exposure. Also useful, one would have compiled a \"to buy\" list. So in a day like this, one could remove a bit of short exposure and add some positions from the buy list. Say, Exelon (EXC), because of the natural gas (UNG) thesis. Or other more common stocks, such as Intel (INTC) or Apple (AAPL). If one is going to buy those stocks, might as well do it in these dips, and not when they're flying high.\n\nThe stocks on a \"buy list\" need two things:\n\nThey need to be fundamentally sound and fairly valued, where the only thing missing is the buying dip;\n\nA thesis for them to resume their upward trends once the dip is gone.\n\nI've already talked about how I expect natural gas to go up in price during 2012 and 2013, so that's the thesis for Exelon. As for stocks like Apple or Intel, one just needs to remember that Bernanke is not going to sit tight forever with the market going down the tubes and employment numbers also turning weak again. So, as the stock market drops, long exposure needs to be built up slowly for the inevitable QE-fed rebound.\n\nBut not exposure in any kind of stock. One needs to buy quality. There are still stocks, such as Salesforce.com (CRM) or Amazon.com (AMZN) that trade entirely on hope, not fundamentals. Those might rebound as easily as the other stocks, but they also carry the risk of permanent and heavy losses. One day, they'll fall and not come back. They'll fall 50% and not come back.\n\nFor now, Intel and Apple don't share those risks. For instance, in Apple one has the near certainty that it's about to launch their smart TV. The chatter is building up strongly, and it can't be long before it's announced. That, along with China, will provide it with enough ammunition to come back from even a substantial rout in the market.\n\nConclusion\n\nDays like today are days where you should remove some of the short exposure and build some long exposure in quality stocks. If you don't have a \"buy list\" set up already, you should use some time to build one, so that when faced with days like these, you do some buying"

      "text": "Options Brokerage Information\n\nLet's Talk About Binary Derivatives\n\nWhat Are Binary Derivatives? There is a great deal of confusion over binary derivatives these days. What are these unique products and how can you incorporate them into your trading strategy?\n\nIn short, binomial derivatives are designed around a simple yes/no proposition. To use a sports analogy, think of them as over/under contracts. These contracts have a designated payout value and specific conditions that must be met in order to receive that payout. If those payout conditions are met, then the owner of the contract receives its full value. If not, then the contract expires worthless. It's a very simple and direct way to trade.\n\nLet's take a look at an example:\n\nBinary Example You believe that inflation in the U.S. will be high this year, so you purchase a binary derivative on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for $36. The terms of this contract state that it will pay out its full value of $100 if the 2007 CPI is above 2%. There are only two potential outcomes for this contract, which is why it is known as a binary derivative.\n\nThe final CPI number for 2007 is above 2%. In this scenario, the payout conditions of the contract are fulfilled and you receive the full $100 value of the contract. This results in a profit of $64 before taxes and commissions.\n\nThe CPI number for 2007 is below 2%. In this scenario, the payout conditions of the contract have not been met and the contract expires worthless. This results in the loss of your initial $36 investment.\n\nOptions Or Futures? Are binary derivatives options or futures? The actual definition of these products is open to interpretation. It all depends on how the contracts are structured. Thebinary nature of these products means that they will perform in manner similar to options. However, they may also have marginrequirements that are very similar to futures.\n\nWe saw this options/futures debate play out over the past year when the CBOE and CME clashed over their new binary credit derivatives. The problems began when the CME chose to designate their binary credit derivatives as futures, thereby allowing them to apply for CFTC approval. The CBOE had similar binary credit derivatives, but their contracts were designated as options. This forced them to apply to the SEC for final approval of the products. As any observer of the derivatives world knows, this put them at a severe competitive disadvantage to the CME.\n\nThe CBOE argued that the CFTC has no jurisdiction over binary credit derivatives because these products are, in fact, options. However, the CFTC disagreed and approved the CME's binary credit futures earlier this year. This back and forth debate highlights just how confusing and contentious it can be to classify binary derivatives.\n\nTerrorism & Event Derivatives Everyone wants to make a killing in the market, but only the sickestamong us mean that literally. The furor over the Defense Departmentísproposed ìTerrorism Futures Exchangeî back in 2003 was proof of that.Although the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA's)exchange was a very interesting idea, it was scrapped because of thenegative stigma associated with speculating on human life.\n\nWhile theìTerrorism Futures Exchangeî never came to fruition, itís very publicdemise didnít put an end to speculating on questionable events. Anumber of people in the derivatives community picked up DARPA's ball and ran with it. In fact, several derivativesexchanges have staked their futures, pun intended, on these extremelycontroversial products.

      "text": "What's the best way to solve this?\n\nCould you post an example, where you consider tick data not to match OHLC of a bar?\n\nHere are two examples (Barchar and IQFeed).\nIf you look closely, many opens and closes of adjacent bars do not line up.\n\nThese are time (5-min) bars, constructed from the underlying tick data.\n\nThe tick data is a record of last traded price and volume at each time a trade is transacted. As trades occur whenever a marketable order crosses a resting limit order, ticks will occur unevenly spaced in time (i.e. whenever two \"traders\" trade) and potentially with gaps between adjacent ticks (e.g. in the simplest case, if bid and offer stay the same, and if a trade at the bid is followed by a trade at the offer, then there will be a gap between adjacent ticks equal to the spread, etc).\n\nA time bar's OHLC reference the price of the first tick (open), the price of the highest tick (high), the price of the lowest tick (low) and the price of the last tick (close) between two points in time. As these ticks can occur with gaps between them, there is no reason that the price of the last tick of one bar (close) has to be at the same price as the first tick of the next bar (open).\n\nIndeed, these ticks can occur at any time within this interval (i.e. they don't have to be evenly spaced out over the time interval), or even not at all (in which case, there will be no time bar for that interval). For example, if a time bar just had a single tick in it, then that bar's OHLC would be a single price. And there is no obligation for that price to be the same as the previous time bar's close.\n\nOne can construct different bar types (e.g. range bar, renko brick, median renko brick, etc) that have different rules, which might specify that an adjacent bar/brick must begin where the previous bar/brick ended... but I haven't seen that done with time bars (which is not to say that it isn't done ... just that I haven't seen it).\n\nFor time bars, no, that's incorrect. The interval between time bars have nothing to do with ticks. When one closes, the next opens. It's that simple. With time bars, there should be no gap between sequential closes and opens. They should be exact. The close of one and the open of the next is exactly the same point because it's based on time, not ticks."

Short selling is a strategy employed by investors who believe a stock or other financial instrument will soon fall in price. Politicians and regulators feared that short sellers would drive down the stock price of financial firms, worsening their already weak condition. However, short sellers and other market participants were expressing their judgment regarding the health of these companies--a judgment that governments wished to suppress.

Each option has a different set of risks and rewards, and they each offer different advantages to the trader. Once you understand the intricacies of the available investment options, you can make the best decision for your portfolio.\n\nTrading stocks\n\nEquities such as common and preferred stocks give you shares of ownership in a business, and they technically give you the right to vote on issues that affect the future of the company. Shares can be public or private, with private shares not requiring approval by a regulatory authority. Public shares have disclosure requirements and are regulated by the government. They are also the ones that are listed on the stock exchanges and are thus completely liquid at a fair market value. The prices of shares are set by the buyers and sellers, and can fluctuate throughout the day, the week, and the year.\n\nFrom an investing point of view, equities can be a profitable short-term or long-term investment. In the short term, you can sell the stocks for a profit when the price rises. From a long-term perspective, you profit from potential dividend payouts, as well as appreciation of the stock price.\n\nOpting for options\n\nAn option contract provides you with the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying stock at a specific price (strike price). The contract for the option is very specific, and it has a set price and expiration date. The risk with options is that it can lose value, either when it is significantly out of the money (far away from its strike price), or when it expires. You can decrease the risk with options by trading spreads, which hedge a put (right to sell a share of stock at a fixed (strike) price) or call (right to buy a share of stock at a fixed (strike) price) against each other to protect you from major fluctuations in the underlying stock price. While options are not for everyone, they are an excellent way to leverage a lot of stock for a fraction of the stock's price. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) provides a market for equity options and is an excellent source of information about option trading as an investment strategy."

      "text": "What is spread betting?\n\nWhat is spread betting?\n\nSpread betting is a way to take a position on whether you think a market will go up or down.\n\nYou can spread bet on a huge range of financial markets from all around the world, including individual shares, stock indices, commodities and currencies. And unlike conventional trading, spread betting is a leveraged product, which means you only need a small initial margin to access a much larger portion of a financial market.\n\nWith each market you are presented with a 'buy' and a 'sell' price either side of the underlying market price. The difference between these two prices is the spread. If you think the market will move up, you open your spread bet at the 'buy' price, also known as going long. If you think it will go down, you open at the 'sell' price, called going short.\n\nThe more the market moves in the direction you predicted, the more profit you make. Conversely, the more the market moves in the opposite direction, the more you will lose.\n\nHow do I open a position?\n\nYou open a position by choosing a market, such as the FTSE® 100, and then deciding whether to 'buy' or 'sell'.\n\nIn this example, the FTSE® 100 price is 5149/5150. This means the 'sell' price is 5149 and the 'buy' price is 5150. You believe the value of the index will rise and 'buy' at 5150.\n\nHow is the size of my position determined?\n\nBecause financial markets are measured in points, you must decide the amount you will earn or lose for each point the market moves. In this case you specify £2 per point.\n\nYour profit or loss is the difference between the opening and closing prices of your position, multiplied by the amount per point that you set.\n\nDo I need a deposit?\n\nThe size of your margin varies from market to market. In this case you need 40 times your stake, which is £80. Your margin is only a small percentage of your total exposure: this is called leverage, one of the key benefits of spread betting.\n\nIt's important to understand that spread betting can lead to losses that exceed your initial deposit, though you can cap your potential losses by using a stop order. This means your position will close automatically if your stop is reached. Please note that only guaranteed stops will protect you from slippage.\n\nHow long will my position be open?\n\nYou can close your position at any time. If left open, your position will close automatically on its expiry date and at its current market level.\n\nIn this example, the price of the FTSE® 100 starts to rise. It eventually reaches 5275/5276. You believe it will continue to rise, so you keep your position open. Unfortunately, the price falls and your profit starts to decrease, so you decide to close your position and take your profit. The price is 5250/5251, so you 'sell' at 5250. The difference between the original 'buy' price and the 'sell' price is 100 points. At £2 per point, this means you earn £200 profit.\n\nWith each market you are given a 'buy' and 'sell' price either side of the underlying market price: this is known as the spread.\n\nIf you think the market will rise, you open your spread bet at the 'buy' price. If you think it will fall, you open at the 'sell' price.\n\nYou also decide the size of your position – the amount you will earn or lose for each point the market moves.\n\nThe more the market moves in your favour, the greater your profit. Conversely, the more the market moves against you, the greater your loss.\n\nA tax-free way to deal on financial markets†\n\nAny position you open is a bet, so your profits are free from capital gains tax.\n\nLeveraged access to the markets\n\nUnlike conventional trading, spread betting is a leveraged product. This means you only need a small initial margin to gain full exposure to an underlying asset's movements.\n\nRelated info"

      "text": "How to trade forex?\n\nYou can read more about how to trade forex while watching this video, or refer to the text below if something in the video remains unclear.\n\nYou trade currencies in pairs\n\nAll currencies are traded in pairs and each currency has an official abbreviation, for example GBP for British pound, USD for US dollar and EUR for the euro.\n\nThe \"base currency\" is the first currency in the pair and the \"quote currency\" is the second currency. These are commonly referred to as the bid and ask price.\n\nPrice differences create trading opportunities\n\nYou can trade currencies because the values of currencies change. The exchange rate tells you how much of one currency you need to pay to buy one unit of another. In forex trading, exchange rates are displayed as the bid and ask price for a currency pair.\n\nThe difference between the bid and the ask price is known as the spread and it's how your broker generates much of its revenue. Spreads can vary from broker to broker, so look out for tight spreads in order to minimise your trading costs and maximise your profits.\n\nKnow what's behind the spread\n\nIt's important for you to understand how spreads are measured. For example, if GBPUSD has a bid price of 1.5530 and an ask price of 1.5533, the spread is three points. Although in forex trading, most people call them pips.\n\nA point or pip is the smallest movement up or down in the price of a currency.\n\nYou can trade in bullish and bearish markets\n\nWhen you trade forex, you're buying one currency and selling another at the same time which means you can speculate on rising and falling markets. This is one of the major advantages of forex trading.\n\nYou are likely to hear forex traders talk about bullish and bearish markets. When a market is rising or believed to be about to rise we call it \"bullish\"; when it's falling or believed to be about to fall it's called \"bearish\".\n\nHow you can place your first trade\n\nFirst of all, consider whether the currency you wish to trade is likely to rise or fall. This forms the basis of your trading strategy.\n\nIn a buy position, you believe that the value of the base currency, in our example the euro, will rise against the quote currency, the US dollar.\n\nLet's assume the price of the EURUSD is 1.3038 on the bid price and 1.3040 on the ask price. Therefore, the spread is two pips. When you buy, your trade is entered at the ask price of 1.3040.\n\nLater you decide to close your trade and the bid price of the EURUSD pair is 1.3072 and the ask price is 1.3074. Your trade has gained 32 pips. If each pip was worth one US dollar, you would have made a USD32 profit.\n\nNow let's see what happens with a sell position. You believe that the value of the base currency will fall against the quote currency. Using the same example, this means you believe the price of the euro will weaken against the US dollar.\n\nThe current value of the EURUSD pair is 1.3038 on the bid price and 1.3040 on the ask price. As you're selling, your trade is entered at the bid price of 1.3038.\n\nLater in the day, you look at the position and the EURUSD is now at 1.3072 on the bid price and 1.3074 on the ask price. Your trade has lost 36 pips. You decide to close your position at the current price of 1.3074 and accept your losses. If each pip was worth USD1, you would have lost USD36.\n\nFind out more about related topics by visiting our other videos and fact sheets"

      "text": "Related Topics\n\nWhen you buy stocks it is very important to understand average directional index.\n\nAverage Directional Index\n\nThe Average Directional Index (ADX) was developed in 1978 by J. Welles Wilder as an indicator of trend strength in a series of prices of a financial instrument. ADX has become a widely-used indicator for technical analysts, and is provided as a standard in collections of indicators offered by various trading platforms.\n\nCalculation\n\nThe ADX is a combination of two other indicators developed by Wilder, the positive directional indicator (abbreviated +DI) and negative directional indicator (-DI). The ADX combines them and smooths the result with an exponential moving average.\n\nTo calculate +DI and -DI, one needs price data consisting of high, low, and closing prices each period (typically each day). One first calculates the Directional Movement (+DM and -DM):\n\nAfter selecting the number of periods (Wilder used 14 days originally), +DI and -DI are:\n\n+DI = 100 times exponential moving average of +DM divided by Average True Range -DI = 100 times exponential moving average of -DM divided by Average True Range\n\nThe exponential moving average is calculated over the number of periods selected, and the average true range is an exponential average of the true ranges. Then:\n\nADX = 100 times the exponential moving average of the Absolute value of (+DI − -DI) divided by (+DI + -DI)\n\nVariations of this calculation typically involve using different types of moving averages, such as a weighted moving average or an adaptive moving average.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe ADX does not indicate trend direction, only trend strength. It is a lagging indicator; that is, a trend must have established itself before the ADX will generate a signal that a trend is underway. ADX will range between 0 and 100. Generally, ADX readings below 20 indicate trend weakness, and readings above 40 indicate trend strength"

      "text": "Pages\n\n10/10/08\n\nAs panic sellers and shorts drive the market lower, be on the lookout for pricing craziness on deep in the money LEAP calls on stocks that are especially volatile. It may be possible to buy a stock and sell a deep in the money covered call for a very small net debit or even a net credit.\n\nHow would this work? Check out ESLR. As I'm writing, it's trading around $3.08 a share. The January '10 2.5 call's bid is $2.10, and the ask is $3.30. Writing a covered call for a net credit (i.e., money being deposited into your account) is unlikely here. However, a small net debit is possible. For example, if I buy 100 shares for $3.08 and sell a covered call for $2.50, the entire transaction will cost me $0.58 a share, or $58 (plus commissions). If ESLR trades for $2.50 or higher at expiration in 2010, the shares will be called and $250 will be deposited into my account. So, max loss here would be $58 plus commissions. Max gain, about two years out, would be $192. That's more than tripling the money I put at risk. I think it's worth it, and have an open limit order for a net debit of $0.6 a share.\n\nIf you think this is worthwhile and wish to try it yourself, please consider that there's a strong possibility that you'll lose all the money you put in. So, if you decide to play, risk only a small amount.\n\nDon't try to buy the shares and then sell the call (this may get you a better deal--and is the only way to get a net credit--but you can also end up having a larger debit than you planned). Your broker should give you the ability to both buy shares and sell calls at the same time--you just have to specify the net debit from your account. If your broker doesn't have this function, you should switch brokers.\n\n10/8/08\n\nI sold GE on Monday for around a 36% loss (it's a little less because of dividends). I wrote numerous times how I thought the company was unfairly punished by the market. Some people called GE \"an unregulated bank.\" They were right. I was wrong. I sold because I think the stock will continue going lower. I also think there's a possibility there will be a dividend cut.\n\nAnother thing that motivated me to sell was the CEO coming out on CNBC to say that things were going well, considering the current economic environment. He talked up the stock. A few days later, GE announced a $12 billion share offering and a $3 billion loan from Warren Buffett with 10% interest. Immelt had to have known about this when he went on TV to talk up his stock. There goes my trust. New rule of thumb: whenever a CEO goes on TV to say things aren't as bad as they appear, things are probably worse (think Bear Sterns). That said, I'm looking to buy GE back later this year or next year, probably for a lower price. If anyone benefits from the eventual recover, it'll be GE, supposing it survives.\n\nJNJ and PG: They were doing just fine until this week. I'm keeping these guys for now. They might go lower, but I think they're great companies with bright futures. I'm a little worried that Cramer keeps recommending them, though. That's rarely a good sign.\n\nESLR: This is one volatile stock. I'm looking to buy back my calls for lower than I sold them. I'm also looking to sell my October puts, perhaps rolling them farther ahead. If this company survives, I think it'll turn out to be a great investment.\n\nCPSL: Why do I own this piece of crap? Great earnings growth, and it's in a country that will be the world's economic superpower in the future. CPSL is also very volatile, and I bought it to write covered calls. When it was trading in the $4 range, the 5 strike calls a month out went for $30 to $50. So why is CPSL trading below book value now? There's the general sell off. Also, CPSL is in the steel industry, which is certainly out of favor. Chinese stocks are particularly loathed right now as well. Lastly, the company has negative cashflow. That's never good. If it survives, I think it'll be a great investment. The company is boosting production and has a decent order backlog. I'm looking to buy back my calls for a lower price, wait for a rebound, and sell the calls again for a higher price.\n\nPM: While its share price is down significantly, my favorite tobacco company is expected to post good earnings on October 22. We'll see if people around the world started smoking more because times are tough. The firm's European sales will probably be poor, because of the Euro's weakness against the dollar and lower sales volume. Although I may change my mind, I want to keep this company for as long as possible. As long as there aren't any dividend cuts, I'm probably not going to sell. I might pick up a few more shares, depending on how much further the stock falls.\n\nI've been making some decent gains with puts in the last few weeks. I'm waiting for a rally to buy some puts on SPY and QQQQ. We haven't had a sustained rally (that's longer than a couple of days) in quite some time. Below are charts of the Dow from 1929 to 1933 and the NASDAQ from 2000 to 2003. There were a few pretty good rallies during the huge drops.\n\nI'm pretty sure the general direction of the market will be down for some time. That's why I'm not buying calls. I'm being careful with puts as well, because I don't want to buy just as a rally gets underway. While I'm waiting for a rally, I'll by trading the SPY 72 March put. My plan is to buy it around $1 and sell around $2 a couple of more times.\n\nI'm also looking to buy puts on companies that will probably go out of business if the economy continues to suffer and the credit markets remain frozen. I'm thinking of companies with massive debt, low margins, and a reliance on the consumer. RHD is a great candidate, but I'm too late to this one. Avis (CAR) is an example of companies that I don't think will survive if times get tougher.\n\nI'm also watching Whole Foods (WFMI). It's got obscene evaluations. I think the stock should be trading at $10 a share. I'm looking to buy puts four to six months out if WFMI rebounds to $20 a share or higher.\n\nMy investment portfolio is about 40% in cash at the moment. I keep track of my trades in the lower right portion (under \"free stuff\") of this blog.\n\n10/5/08\n\nA few weeks ago, I wrote about UST (UST) as a stock to watch. It was supposed to be purchased by Altria (MO) before year's end for $69.50 a share. UST closed at $64.90 a share on Friday, after Altria announced that the deal may be put off until 2009 because of the deepening credit crisis. Altria will pay UST $300 million if the deal does not close by January 7, 2009. (Shareholder and government approval are required for the purchase agreement to close.)\n\nLet's say you anticipate that the deal will go through as planned, and you buy UST for $65 a share. You can potentially make $5.13 a share, or 7.89% if there's a $0.63 UST dividend payment in December [$69.5 - $65 + $0.63 (possible December dividend) = $5.13 max gain].\n\nIf the deal falls apart, UST will most likely drop. The question is how low the stock will go. UST traded between $50 and $56 in the few months leading up to the announcement of the deal. Shortly before Altria's buyout offer, UST traded around $54 a share. It seems likely that if the deal falls apart, UST will drop back to that level, or go lower. So let's say the max loss would be $15 per share minus any dividends received, if UST falls to $50. Unless you're very comfortable with risk and are very confident the deal will go through, buying at $65 is probably not worth it.\n\nThere's a safer way to play this, though with a smaller potential reward. The UST Jan '09 65 strike put's last ask on Friday 10/3/08 was $2.45 (it can probably be purchased for a lower price). If you buy UST for $65 a share, and get one Jan '09 65 put for every 100 shares at $2.45, your max gain will be $2.05 a share ($2.68 if there's a $0.63 dividend in December). That's not a bad couple of months' gain in a bear market. Ideally, you can buy the 65 puts below $2.45 and UST shares below 65.\n\nIf the deal falls apart before the January 16, 2009 expiration, the most you can lose is your put premium (plus broker commissions), as you'll have the right to sell your shares for $65. If UST pays a dividend in December and you close your position after the ex-date, your loss will be offset by the dividend amount.\n\nThis trade is worth it if you're willing to risk $2.45 for a reasonable chance (analysts think there's a 70 to 80% chance the deal will be consummated) to gain at least $2.05 and maybe $2.68 (minus commissions).\n\nAnother trade if the deal falls apart (but this one is much riskier and you'll have to watch it very closely) is the following. You buy UST shares and puts as described above. If the deal is canceled, UST starts falling, and you think it'll fall further, you might consider selling your shares for market price and keeping the puts, to sell later for a higher price. This would possibly offset losses more, and may even result in a gain, depending on how early after the deal cancellation you sell and how low the stock drops afterward. (For example, you'll make money if you sell UST at $60 and sell the puts later when the stock drops to $50.)\n\nYet another possibility is if the deal falls apart, but you think UST is a good long term hold with a decent dividend, sell the put when you think the stock won't fall further and keep your shares.\n\nIf you're a speculator who thinks the deal will fail, consider buying puts. Your potential gains will depend on which strike you buy and how low UST goes. Your maximum loss is the put premium.\n\nAll of the above assumes that the deal will either fall apart or be closed before January 7, 2009. That is, I assume the deadline won't be extended.\n\nSimilar things can be said about Anheuser-Busch (BUD), my other stock to watch, but I don't think it's worth pursuing. The brewer is supposed to be bought by InBev for $70 a share before the end of the year. BUD closed at $65.10 a share on Friday. Its January puts are much more expensive. The deal's price tag is almost five times bigger than Altria's, and at least three of InBev's financiers are experiencing problems.\n\nThe market is full of bargains right now, and investors are starting to nibble. But as no one knows where the bottom is and the market can go much lower, consider buying long term puts when you go long a stock. If it's a great company selling for a bargain basement price, the additional cost of a long term at the money put is a reasonable expense. You'll curb your potential gains somewhat (though they will still be potentially unlimited), but you'll know exactly how much you can lose.\n\nIf you own stocks that you're thinking of selling because you can't bear the possibility of more losses, see if it's worthwhile to buy puts on them instead"

      "text": "Right, but the CALMAR ratio is over 7 (196% gain in less than a year vs. 26% drawdown). Granted, that's over a smaller time period than CALMAR typically measures, but I have decent trade data going back to 2009, although the strategy has evolved since then, so that data would need to be re-checked under the current strategy.\n\nMy bet sizes are typically bigger, yielding deeper drawdowns, but going in the opposite direction and making the bets smaller to avoid those drawdowns is easy enough. If, all things being equal, you could get a 98% gain with a 13% drawdown, or 49% with 6.5% drawdown, by cutting bet size in half or by 3/4, I would think that would be attractive. I ran the same outcomes with 1% at-risk per trade and got a 43% return with a 4.9% drawdown.\n\n1.96/0.26=7.53 calmar ratio.\n\nQuote from logic_man:\n\nLogic_man, let me invite you to be a World Cup Advisor.

This is probably the fastest way to further monetize your success than seeking the 1 in a million chance with an institutional investorComing from a Jack Hershey supporter, don't pay any attention to this.\n\n4% drawdown is reasonable up until 5-10% depending on leverage factor.\n\nI think you may have misread the trading frequency. The trading frequency is actually closer to 150 trades per year. And, yes, the strategy has evolved somewhat so that the actual data I have is for just under a year, but the strategy could easily be backtested going back as far as there was 1-minute data for any market you'd like to test. Since it is an algorithm and not discretionary, there would be no barriers to backtesting it via computer code.\n\nAs for scaling into positions, you could definitely do that. As I mentioned, a trade trigger also triggers an initial stop and one could buy or sell at any price between the trade trigger and that initial stop. If your trade trigger is long and your trade experiences \"heat\", that just means you can buy more."

      "text": "In a previous article, I explained how one aspect of the stock market works, in the plainest language I could. After talking to a few people, I realized that there was another, more basic function of the market, that a lot of people are confused about, and that is shorting stocks, or selling short. A lot of people don't really understand how you make money off of a stock losing money. In fact, it is very counter-intuitive (at least to honest people), so I want to try to illustrate it as simply as possible, with as little Wall Street jargon as I can. It really isn't that complicated, but the way people talk about it makes it seem a lot more cryptic than it really is. So, let's look at how you 'short' a sale.\n\nSay you are a camera buff, and have lots of friends who are camera buffs and professional photographers. One of your friends has so much equipment, he could never use even half of it. He has one lens in particular, that you are really interested in. The reason you are interested, is because it sells on Ebay for as much as $2,000, but you have heard a rumor that it is about to be replaced by a newer, better version. You know that when the new lens is released, the value of the current lens will drop through the floor, because everyone will be selling them to get the new one. So, you get an idea. You get your friend to rent you his lens for $10 a month, with the promise that after a set amount of time, for this example let's say three months, you will return it (or one just like it if something happens to it) to his collection. As soon as he rents it to you, it immediately goes up on your Ebay page for sale, and you end up getting $2,000 for it. Two months later, the new lens you heard rumors about comes out, just like you hoped it would. As you predicted, the old lens plummets in value, as everyone unloads them, and you are able to buy one for $500. You then return the $500 replacement to your friend, and walk away having made $1,500 on your $30 rental fee. You have just completed your first successful short.\n\nOk, I've been doing a lot of research on the financial sector, and what caused the financial collapse a couple years ago, and I think there is something I need to explain, because people seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding about what really happened, and what caused it. Now, this is all pretty complicated, so to try and make it clear, I'm instead going to create a hypothetical situation, which illustrates the problem, instead of going into details about Credit Default Swaps, Collateralized Debt Obligations, and all that sort of thing.\n\nSo, say you are really hungry, but you don't have any money until payday a week from now. So, you get an idea that you will go to one of those restaurants that will give you the meal on the house, if you can finish their giant steak. Of course, you don't want to get in trouble if you can't finish it, so you ask a friend of yours to loan you the money for the dinner, just for the night, and promise you will give it back to him tomorrow, plus another buck on payday, just for the trouble of loaning you the money. You are pretty sure you can eat the whole steak, at which point the meal will be free, and you can give your friend his money back, and even if you can't the worst that happens, is you pay him back everything on payday. Still, to put his mind at ease, you tell him that if for some reason you can't pay it tomorrow, then you will give him a dollar for every day you don't pay him back. So far, so good, right? Your friend likes the deal, because no matter what, he gets extra money, and if you keep his money longer than you promised, he actually makes more than if you pay it when you say you are going to. As long as you don't lose your job, or welsh on the deal, then everything is good. Nothing too complicated.\n\nSo, you go to the restaurant, you eat your meal, and let's say you don't actually finish it, and have to take a little longer paying your friend back. No big deal. You pay him back, and he is happy with the money he got. Normally, this would be the end of it. However, he happens to have a friend who is a natural born trader, who notices that he got a pretty good return on investment, and thinks there has to be a way to turn this into a real revenue stream. So, he starts taking out ads in papers, offering to provide this same service to anyone. He quickly learns that he needs to be careful who he offers to do this for, but on the whole, he makes money at it. Enough money, in fact, that he sets up a company to do this, and starts hiring people. Pretty soon, there are competitors, and several companies vying for this business of making loans to people to cover their meals, for an interest rate. Problem is, there is plenty of demand, after all everybody needs to eat, and everybody is short of cash once in a while, but there are a limited number of people who are a safe-enough bet, that you aren't going to lose your shirt. Because unlike a friend, they have a lot less reason to actually pay the business back. So, all the companies trying to do it, are basically trying to go after the same safe customers.\n\nWhen Android started out, it was treated as little more than a joke. A great many people dismissed it as an irrelevant experiment, by a company blindly casting around for any way to grow their business beyond their core competencies of search and advertising. Back then, Android's claim to openness was undisputed, and treated if anything, as one of the many reasons not to take it seriously as a contender, because it was so clearly some wrong-headed amateur hour OS, from a company who didn't 'get' the market. Now it is the predominant smartphone OS in the world, and practically all anyone can talk about is whether or not it is really \"open.\" Problem is, that is a trick question, and it can't be answered, until you figure out what is really meant by the people asking it. Open is a vague word, that can mean many different things, depending on your point of view, and for the most part, anyone asking if Android is open, is doing it more as a ploy to forward an agenda, than as a serious question.\n\nTo get the actual technical question out of the way, Android's source code is open. You can go right now, download it yourself, and start working on your own version of Android. It might not be the up-to-the minute latest version, but it is still, undeniably, the source code of the OS, there for you to use how you see fit, with no restrictions. You can design your own device around it, and distribute that device in any way you wish, without having to ask permission from a single person, or pay a single license fee. That, in and of itself, is a radically different model from a great many software products, and to most people, meets the minimum requirement by which you can reasonably claim your software is open.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, and the Soviet Union was still around, I used to regale people with hyperbolic tales of a dystopian future, which I was sure was what lay down the path for America. I would plead with people to recognize the little things, which were the first baby steps toward a society that was the antithesis of everything people said set America apart from the \"evil empire\" of the USSR. I talked a lot about slippery slopes, and unintended consequences to well meaning laws. I carried predictable trends to absurd extremes, to try and illustrate a point. Yet never did I actually expect those dark scare tactics to be so oddly prophetic. I never actually expected that America would become a country with tens of thousands of state video surveillance cameras at intersection, or where the state would charge you fines for not living a 'healthy-enough lifestyle', or where smoking a cigarette was illegal. Sure, I might have told people they could look forward to a future where they couldn't board a plane, train or bus without presenting their papers, but I didn't actually expect it to happen. I certainly never seriously predicted that America would become a secure Homeland, where citizens were denied the right to travel because their name was on a suspicious persons list, or where women are required to be felt up before they are allowed to get on a plane. Even in my most elaborate Kafkaesque vision, I never expected the state to issue software for handheld computers to aid citizens in informing on their neighbors. I never even imagined that the US would have more of its citizens incarcerated than any other nation on Earth. It never occurred to me that people would be arrested for exercising their first amendment rights without a permit, or that American citizens would only be able to gather, under the watchful eye of armed troops in full body armor. No, I never actually expected the bleak reality of my imagination, to become the world I actually lived in.\n\nThe reason I never expected it to actually happen, even though I could see the writing on the wall, was because deep down, I really believed that once it became blatant enough for the average American to notice, they wouldn't stand for it. I believed that Americans were, by nature, freedom-loving people, with a healthy mistrust of authority. The very reason for all my dreary prognostications of doom and gloom, was because I honestly believed that if you could just shock people into seeing the disconnect between the rhetoric of freedom, and the developing reality, then they would snap out of it, and choose liberty over oppression. I thought that ingrained in the American psyche, was the idea that it was better for a hundred criminals to go free, than for one innocent man to be imprisoned. I had always taken it as a comforting article of faith, that Americans were the ones who would purposely do the stupid thing they knew was bad for them, rather than submit to to someone telling them they had to do what was good for them. I had never questioned that Americans were the people who would die to protect your right to say the most offensive shit imaginable, no matter how much they hated you for saying it. In my imagination, Americans were the type of people who would go back to a barter economy, before they would stand for businesses reporting their cash transactions to the FBI. In short, I apparently completely misjudged the culture in which I grew up.\n\nI was reading a fascinating interview a Facebook friend sent me, and started to reply to him, but realized it was a long enough topic to deserve a post. One of the things I saw mentioned in the interview, was a concern, which I have heard voiced quite a bit around the world, that people fear 'the Internet' will soon be under siege by corporate forces, who will seek to \"own and control it.\" Now I don't know if it is because I have actually been involved in the Internet industry for so long, or if it is because I am American, and we have a bit of a head start on a lot of the world when it comes to the Internet, but for whatever reason, my perspective puts me in the unenviable position of delivering an uncomfortable message to the everyone. I'm afraid that fight already happened around the turn of the century, and the corporations already won.
