{"text":"June 30, 2009\n\nThe question is whether the Amsterdam ship Westfriesland, listing in the Staat van Oorlog te Water for the year 1633 is the same ship that served in the First Anglo-Dutch War. The size of 180 lasts is plausible. The armament is even not that dissimilar. The main issue that the Westfriesland would be 20 years old or more in 1653. The Noorderkwartier ship Eenhoorn, built in 1625, was still in service in 1652 and 1653, so the Westfriesland being the same as the ship in 1633 is possible.\n\nWednesday, June 10, 2009\n\nI noticed a little piece of trivia. The ship Profeet Samuel, hired by the Admiralty of the Noorderkwartier, was a vessel of 200 lasts, according to my calculations. The broadside weight of the Profeet Samuel was only 104 pounds. The Profeet Samuel fought in the Battle of the Gabbard (the Zeeslag bij Nieuwpoort) and was heavily damaged. The Profeet Samuel was finally discarded and the crew moved to the newly hired ship Mars in July 1653.\n\nWednesday, June 03, 2009\n\nIn the past, we had been confused about the ship Engel Gabriel (from 1636), which was number 16 in Vreugdenhil's list of Dutch ships. We now understand that the Engel Gabriel of 1636 was the jacht commanded by Gerrit Veen. It was NOT inservice until 1653. There were at least three ships named Engel Gabriel in service in 1652-1653. One was the ship commanded by Isaac Sweers, with 36 guns, that was sunk by gunfire in the Battle of Portland. Another was an Amstederdam Director's ship commanded by Bastiaan Bardoel. The third was a ship hired by the Admiralty of Amsterdam that was commanded by Adriaan van den Bosch (or Bos)."}
{"text":"Titanic Archive\n\nRMS Titanic, popularly known as \"Titanic\", was a passenger liner that struck an iceberg on her first voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City, and sank on the 15th day of April year 1912, resulting in the deaths of 1,517 people in one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history.\n\nTitanic is the largest passenger steamship in the world, the Olympic-class RMS Titanic was owned by the White Star Line and constructed at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, Ireland.\n\nIt was built in Harland and Wolff Ltd's Queen's Island shipyard in Belfast for the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company, commonly known as the White Star Line. This ship was registered at 46,328 gross tons with a length of 852.5 feet and it was the largest ship ever built during that time. After launch on May 31, 1911, Titanic completed and delivered on the 2nd day April year 1912 to its owners. On April 10, 1912, Titanic sailed from Southampton for New York, calling at Cherbourg in Northern France and Queenstown on the south coast of Ireland\n\nAfter setting sail for New York City on April 10, 1912 with 2,223 people on board, she hit the iceberg four days into the crossing at 11:40 pm on April 14, 1912. Titanic sank at exactly 2:20 am the following morning. The high casualty rate resulting from the sinking was due in part to the fact that the ship carried lifeboats for only 1,178 people. The sunk loss 1,503 lives. Only 703 were saved.\n\nA disproportionate number of men died due to the \"women and children first\" protocol that was enforced by the ship's crew.\n\nTitanic was designed by experienced engineers, using some of the most advanced technologies and extensive safety features of the time. Adding to the ironic nature of the tragedy is the fact that the liner sank on her maiden voyage.\n\nThe high loss of life, the media frenzy over Titanic's famous victims, the legends about the sinking, the resulting changes in maritime law, and the discovery of the wreck have all contributed to the enduring interest in Titanic.\n\nThis website is the most complete repository and resource about Titanic.

There are a few other nautical locations where vessels' crews have been known to inexplicably vanish without a trace.<\/p>\n\nThe Bermuda Triangle\n\n<p>The Bermuda Triangle, a region of the western part of the North Atlantic Ocean defined by points in Bermuda, Florida and Puerto Rico, has a long-standing reputation for mysteriously swallowing boats, ships and even airplanes. Some people even claim that it contains a wormhole into another dimension, while others believe that the <a alt=\"((CONLINK|1140|area%20is%20a%20UFO%20hotspot))\" href=\" is a UFO hotspot<\/a> and that aliens are abducting the lost sea vessels.<\/p>\n<p>The area first attracted attention in December, 1945, when five United States Navy planes vanished during a training exercise. Before losing radio contact and disappearing somewhere off the coast of southern Florida, the flight leader was reportedly heard saying: \"We are entering white water, nothing seems right.\"<\/p>\n<p>The 14 men in the planes were never heard from again. Even spookier, a search-and-rescue aircraft with 13 men onboard was dispatched to locate the missing planes, but that aircraft and its passengers also inexplicably disappeared. Ever since, the disappearances of vessels in the area, including the SS Marine Sulphur Queen, a tanker carrying a crew of 39 in 1963, and the collier USS Cyclops with 309 crewmen in 1918, have been blamed on the Bermuda Triangle.<\/p>\n\nThe Sargasso Sea\n\n<p>The only \"sea\" without shores, the Sargasso Sea is a region in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean that is <a alt=\"((CONLINK|542|surrounded%20by%20ocean%20currents))\" href=\" by ocean currents<\/a> . These currents deposit marine plants and garbage into the Sargasso Sea, causing it to be full of <em>Sargassum<\/em>, a genus of dense, brown, invasive seaweed. Because of the seaweed buildup and the isolation created by the currents, the sea remains eerily warm and calm, despite being surrounded by the freezing and choppy waters of the Atlantic Ocean.<\/p>\n<p>This eerie calmness contributes to the area's mystery, as several ships have been found drifting crewless through its peaceful waters. In 1840, the French merchant ship Rosalie sailed through the Sargasso Sea and was later discovered with its sails set but without any crew members on board.<\/p>\n<p>In an effort to explain the mysterious disappearances, nineteenth-century lore told of the Sargasso Sea's carnivorous seaweed, which was believed to devour sailors whole, leaving only the ship.<\/p>\n\nThe \"Devil's Sea\" of Japan\n\n<p>The Devil's Sea, also known as the Pacific Bermuda Triangle, is a region of the Pacific around Miyake Island, about 60 miles south of Tokyo. The area is also known as the Dragon's Triangle because of <a alt=\"((CONLINK|4|ancient%20legends%20about%20dragons))\" href=\" legends about dragons<\/a> that lived off the coast of Japan.<\/p>\n<p>During the late 1980s, author Charles Berlitz wrote the book \"The Dragon's Triangle\" about paranormal phenomena that he believed occurred in the Devil's Sea. He wrote that after Japan lost five military vessels with carrying a total of more than 700 sailors during the peacetime years between 1952 and '54, the area was officially declared a danger zone. Investigations into Berlitz's claims later found that the military vessels were actually fishing vessels, some of which had vanished outside of the Devil's Sea.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, investigators pointed out that during the time period that the ships went missing, hundreds of fishing boats were lost around Japan every year due to weather conditions and piracy \u2014 not because of supernatural activity or mythical sea dragons. But the Devil's Sea's reputation as a dangerous and eerie area lives on.<\/p>\n\nThe Michigan Triangle\n\n<p>The Michigan Triangle is found in Lake Michigan, whose shoreline spans the states of Illinois, Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin. Located over central Lake Michigan, the area has been blamed for the mysterious disappearances of ships' crew members and entire airplanes. Some have reported that while sailing over the Michigan Triangle, time seemed to stand still, slow to a crawl, or speed up.<\/p>\n<p>In 1937, the disappearance of Captain George Donner from his boat cemented the Michigan Triangle's status as a strange place. During a routine coal delivery, Donner gave his crew orders to wake him when the ship drew into port. When they came to his freighter cabin three hours later, Donner had vanished \u2014 despite the fact that his cabin door was locked from the inside.<\/p>\n<p>In 1950, the Northwest Airlines Flight 2501 <a alt=\"((CONLINK|246|disappeared%20as%20it%20flew))\" href=\" as it flew<\/a> over the Michigan Triangle on its way from Seattle to New York City.

{"text":"The Pamir was built at the Blohm & Vass shipyards in Hamburg, Germany. She was launched July 29, 1905. She had a four-masted barque and a steel hull. She was 375 feet in length, a beam of 46 feet, and a draught of 23.5 feet. Her top speed was 16 knots but usually cruised at 8 to 9 knots. She was the fifth of ten ships and was commissioned on October 18, 1905 by the Laeisz company in the South American nitrate trade.\n\nBy 1914, she had made eight trips to Chile and between 64 to 70 one-way cruises to Valpara\u00edso or Iquique. During World War I, she stayed in port on the Canary Islands. Because of the war, she did not return to Hamburg until March 17, 1920. On July 15, 1920 the Pamir left from Hamburg and went to Naples as a war reparation for Italy. Unfortunately, the Italian government was unable to find a proper crew, a deep-water sailing ship crew, actually, so she was laid up near Castellamare, the Gulf of Naples. In 1924, the Laeisz company bought her back for \u00a3 7,000. The Pamir went back into the nitrate trade, but in 1931, she was sold to Gustaf Erikson's Finnish shipping company to work in the Australian grain trade.\n\nWhile in port in Wellington during World War II, the Pamir was taken as a war prize by New Zealand on August 3, 1941. After about ten voyages for the New Zealand ensign, she eventually made her way back to Wellington in 1948.\n\nIn 1950, a German ship owner saved her and the Passat from the scrapyard by purchasing them. The German owner modernized the Pamir by giving her an auxiliary engine and then used her as a cargo and as a sail-training ship on route to Argentina. In 1954 both ships were bought by a German consortium, made five voyages, and were decommissioned in 1957 because they were not profittable any longer. The Pamir's journey was just beginning.\n\nOn August 10, 1957, the Pamir set sail for Hamburg for the final time. She left Buenos Aires with a crew of 86, including 52 cadets. Her cargo included 3,780 tons of barley. On September 21, the Pamir was caught in Hurricane Carrie. This was before the ship was having shortened sails. Hatchways and other openings had not been closed, so considerable amounts of water could have been let into the ship. Another theory is the ship had leak that let a large amount of water in. However the water got into the ship, it still shifted the cargo in the ship, thus aggravating the Pamir. For whatever reason, the captain did not order the crew to flood the ballast tanks. By this time, the Pamir's lifeboats were flooded and therefore, they could not be deployed. The Pamir was able to send distress signals before capsizing at 13:03 in the middle of the Atlantic. What was found were three damaged lifeboats and numerous sharks. The United States Coast Guard cutter, Absecon, organized a nine-day search for survivors, but all they found were four crewmen and two cadets alive from two lifeboats."}

{"text":"For 100 years now, the Titanic has had a gripping, almost mythical pull on society's collective curiosity.\n\nBut for a select few, their interest in the ill-fated ship that took three years to build and three hours to sink goes much deeper - approximately 12,500 feet deep, to the bottom of the ocean floor where the ship lies.\n\nFor around $60,000 you can dive to the actual wreck site of the Titanic to commemorate the 100th anniversary of its April 15, 1912 sinking.\n\nThe Bluefish, a company specializing in unique and sometimes out of this world travel, is sponsoring four trips to the wreck site this summer. They've also sponsored trips to outer space.\n\n\"The fact that it's the 100th anniversary, that's one thing that makes it a grand expedition to take. But more people have been to the top of Everest or space than have been to the ruins of the Titanic. Space isn't going anywhere and neither is Everest, but you've got about 20 to 25 years left to visit the Titanic,\" said Steve Sims, with The Bluefish.\n\nThe ship, thought unsinkable at the time, plunged to the bottom of the North Atlantic after hitting an ice berg and breaking apart. More than 1,500 people died in the icy waters. Around 700 survived.\n\nIf money isn't an object, time definitely is.\n\nAge, pressure and the ocean itself has corroded the once-grand liner. Scientists say bacteria are eating away of what remains and the ship may be little more than rust on the ocean floor by 2030.\n\nThe trip to the wreck site is made in a small submersible that fits a pilot and two passengers. The units are built to withstand the intense pressure of deep ocean travel and air is recycled much like on an airplane.\n\nAbout 2 1\/2 hours into the trip, the bow comes into breathtaking view.\n\n\"You'll be about 15 feet away from it, so to say you're close is an understatement. You'll really be that close,\" Sims said.\n\nAnd with the physical closeness comes an emotional closeness. Amid the deteriorating frame of the ship are the relics of lost lives and the historic can turn heartbreakingly personal very quickly.\n\n\"They've been able to research how pressure and the lack of sunlight holds some things together and rips others apart. You'll see toothbrushes, porcelain, shoes just strewn across the floor.

{"text":"Havenbedrijf\n\nHet havenbedrijf\n\nZeeland Seaports\n\nSince 1998 the ports of Vlissingen and Terneuzen have been operating under a single port authority: Zeeland Seaports. Before this merger, the ports were managed separately. Read on to find out how this came about.\n\nTerneuzen port authority In 1960 the then Minister of Transport, Public Works and Water Management announced the intention to manage the harbours, quays, unloading sites and associated works and land along the Dutch section of the Ghent-Terneuzen Canal as a single port area. This was to be done by means of a public body, within which the municipalities located along the canal would work together. For this purpose a study committee for the Port Authority of Terneuzen - Canal Zone Zeeuwsch Vlaanderen was set up in 1961, in which all the parties involved were represented. The study committee wrote in 1963 that purposeful, intensive and flexible port management was required, which could only be achieved by forming a Port Authority for Terneuzen.\n\nVlissingen port authority Following a letter from the Director-General of Public Works and Water Management dated 28 November 1961 to the Provincial Executive of Zeeland, a study committee was set up to examine a joint scheme for managing the Zuid-Sloe port and industrial area. Various parties were involved in this committee, which presented on 19 March 1964 a draft joint scheme for the formation of Vlissingen Port Authority to the Minister of Transport, Public Works and Water Management.\n\nUnder the Act of 10 September 1970 and the Act of 8 April 1971, the Terneuzen Port Authority and the Vlissingen Port Authority respectively were formed. Municipalities, the Dutch Government and the province cooperated within these joint schemes.\n\nThe formation of these new port organisations was an immediate success. Over the years, throughput in the Zeeuws-Vlaanderen port area grew from 3 million to 11.5 million tonnes per annum. Throughput of the Vlissingen port area increased from just under 1 million to almost 13 million tonnes per annum. The number of jobs in both port areas together rose to almost 13,500.\n\nA single Port Authority In 1994 the Dutch Government announced its intention to end its participation in the Zeeland port authorities. It also urged for the merger of the two port authorities into a single port authority. The merger process was formalised in 1998 and the new Zeeland Seaports became a reality on 1 January 1998."}

{"text":"Freight\n\nship, master, agreed, damages, voyage, liable and time\n\nFREIGHT, is the consideration money agreed to be paid for the use or hire of a ship, or, in a larger sense, the burthen of such ship. The freight is most fre quently determined for the whole voy age, without respect to time ; sometimes it depends on time ; in the former case it is either fixed at a certain sum for the whole cargo, or so much per ton, barrel, bulk, or other weight or measure, or so much per dent. on the value of the cargo. If a certain sum be agreed on for the freight of the ship, it must all be paid, although the ship when measured, should prove smaller, unless the burthen be war ranted. If the ship be freighted for tran sporting cattle or slaves, at so much per head, and some of them die on the pas sage, freight is only due for such as are, delivered alive ; if for landing them, it is due for all put on board. When a whole ship is freighted, if the master suffer any goods besides those of the freight to be put on board, he is liable for damages. If the voyage be completed according to the agreement, without any accident, the master has a right to demand the freight before the delivery of the goods ; but if such delivery is prevented by negligence, or accidents, the parties will be recipro cally responsible in the following man ner: If the merchant should not load the ship within the time agreed on, the master may engage with another, and re cover damages. If the merchant recal the ship after she is laden and sailed, be mast pay the whole freight ; but if he unload before the ship has actually sail ed, he will in such case only be respon sible for damages If the merchant load goods which are not lawful to export, and the ship be prevented from proceed ing on that account, he must neverthe less pay the freight. If the master be not ready to proceed bn the voyage at the time stipulated, the merchant may load the whole, or part of :tee cargo, on board another ship, and\ndama ges ; but any real casualties will release the master from all damages. If an em bargo be laid on the ship before she sail, the charter-party is dissolved, and the merchant pays the expenses of loading and unloading ; but if the embargo be only for a short limited time, the voyage shall be performed when it expires, and neither party is liable for damages. If\n\nthe master sail to any other port than that agreed on, without necessity, he must sail to the port agreed on at his own expense, and is also liable for any damages in consequence thereof. If a ship be taken by the enemy, and retaken or ransomed, the charter-party continues in force. If the master transfer the goods from his own ship to another, with out necessity, and they perish, he is responsible for the full value, and all charges ; but if his own ship be in immi nent danger, the goods may be put on board another ship, at the risk of the owner. If a ship be freighted out and home, and a sum agreed on for the whole voyage, nothing becomes due until the return of such ship. If a certain sum be specified for the homeward voyage, it is due, although the correspondent abroad should have no goods to send home. A ship was freighted to a par ticular port and home, a particular freight agreed upon for the homeward voyage, with an option reserved for the corres pondent to decline it, unless the ship ar rived before a certain day. The master did not go to the port agreed on, and therefore became liable to damages, the obligation being absolute on his part, and conditional only on the part of the freighter. If the goods be damaged without fault of the ship or master, the owner is not obliged to receive them and pay the freight ; but he must either re ceive or abandon the whole ; he cannot receive those that are not damaged, and reject the others. If the goods be da maged through the insufficiency of the ship, the master is liable for the same : but if it be owing to stress of weather, he is not accountable. If part of the goods be thrown overboard, or taken by the enemy, the part delivered pays freight ; the master is accountable for all the goods received on board by him self and mariners, unless they perish by the act of God or the king's enemies. The master is not liable for leakage of liquors, nor accountable for contents of packages, unless packed in his presence.\n\nFrom \"American Edition of the British Encyclopedia\" by William Nicholson (1818)"}

{"text":"Admiralty Actions\n\nAdmiralty arrestment is a type of diligence relating to the arrestment of ships and cargo on board ships for debt due. Generally, arrestment of a ship prevents it from sailing to its next destination until the arrestment is recalled or the debtor provides alternative security. Admiralty arrestments are relatively uncommon but may be for claims of some considerable value.\n\nThe term 'admiralty' relates to the right and power to apply the law over maritime property.\n\nWhilst most admiralty actions in Scotland are raised in the Court of Session, local sheriff courts also have jurisdiction within their own areas. Generally, jurisdiction for an admiralty action may be where the defender (debtor) has his residence or place of business. It may also be where the cause of the action arose, in a court which has already heard an action relating to the same incident and where jurisdiction has been agreed or a ship owned by the defender has been arrested to found jurisdiction.\n\nThere are three types of admiralty arrestment -\n\nArrestment on the dependence - used to secure a claim against the owner of a ship. Unlike other forms of arrestment on the dependence, the ship does not have to be in the hands of a third party in order to be arrested - it can be arrested in the hands of the owner.\n\nArrestment in rem - an arrestment carried out to enforce a claim against the ship itself or against some other piece of maritime property. Generally, arrestment in rem may only be used to enforce a maritime lien such as, for example, claims arising as a result of a collision or claims by crew members for wages due for service on a particular ship. Arrestment in rem also founds jurisdiction against the vessel.\n\nArrestment to found jurisdiction - an action brought specifically to establish jurisdiction in Scotland but not having the effect of detaining the vessel. Unless followed by arrestment on the dependence, the vessel is free to sail.\n\nBefore carrying out an admiralty arrestment, the pursuer (creditor) must obtain a warrant to arrest by presenting a summons to the relevant court, setting out the case for arrestment. Once the warrant is granted the arrestment is carried out by an officer of the court (a Messenger at Arms or a Sheriff Officer) who physically attends the vessel."}

{"text":"One-Man-Torpedo\n\nThis piece of equipment is a typical example for the improvisations which the German armaments industry had to come up with as WW II dragged out. For the soldiers each undertaking was a \"suicide mission\". Operations were only conducted at night. Only few crew members survived. The Torpedo-Research Institute at Kiel-Eckernf\u00f6rde was in charge of the development of the one-man torpedoes. First a German G7e standard-torpedo was simply attached to the bottom of another with the top torpedo equipped with a cabin for the driver in place of the ordinary explosive device. The driver was sitting under a dome of acrylic glass which afforded relatively good visibility at all sides. The craft was unarmed, apart from the torpedo, and not submersible. The driver fired the torpedo via a simple back-front-sight device. At that time the unit was nicknamed \"Neger\" (which means \"Negro\") inspired by its black color and the name of one of its designers, navy colonel Richard Mohr (in German \"Mohr\" is another word for \"negro\").\n\nStarting in 1943, about 200 \"Neger\" units were built, but successes were minimal. According to researches conducted after the war the \"Neger\" was responsible for the demise of three minesweepers and one destroyer as well as damage caused to one cruiser and one destroyer. The great problems with this primitive piece of weaponry soon led to a larger, submersible version called \"Marder\", as it is shown in the museum. Here the submersible is slightly larger than the attached torpedo. The \"Marder\" was deployed, for instance, against the allied troops during the Normandy Invasion.

{"text":"TOPICS\n\nBook Excerpt: \"Making a Difference\" by Captain Sully\n\nCaptain \"Sully\" Sullenberger responsible for \"Miracle on The Hudson\" shares an excerpt from his new book \"Making a Difference: Stories of Vision and Courage from America's Leaders.\"\n\nExcerpt from Chapter 1:\n\nAdmiral Thad Allen\n\nThad Allen, U.S. Coast Guard commandant, was among the millions of television viewers who watched in horror as Hurricane Katrina ravaged coastal areas of Louisiana and Mississippi as well as the city of New Orleans in September 2005. The three-star admiral saw news reports of floating bodies, flooded homes, despondent families, and lawlessness gripping the city, and his mortification turned to anger. He asked other senior Coast Guard officers, \"Why isn't somebody down there being the face of the federal government, standing in front of the Superdome, talking to CNN?\"\n\nThe next thing he knew, Admiral Allen was in New Orleans, serving in just that role, one for which this son of a Coast Guard chief damage control man was very well suited.\n\nLooking back, Allen, now retired from the Coast Guard, remembers the depressing and confused scene in Washington just prior to his deployment to New Orleans: \"I was at the Pentagon, and they were talking about invoking the Insurrection Act and sending the troops in,\" he says. \"There was this huge amount of frustration.\"\n\nFinally, one week after the Category 3 hurricane with 110 mph winds hit near the Louisiana-Mississippi border, Allen was appointed deputy to Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) director Michael D. Brown. That assignment put him in charge of the Hurricane Katrina search and rescue and recovery efforts in the Gulf. His orders: \"Just get to New Orleans and figure out what's going on. Stabilize the situation.\"\n\nA realist, the Coast Guard admiral told his wife, \"'There's no guarantee this is going to be a success. In fact, there's every reason to believe this will be a miserable failure and nothing can be done at this point.' My wife reminded me that for the last thirty-something years, I've told everybody that my favorite definition of leadership is the ability to reconcile opportunity and competency. So it's kind of like: If not now, when? If not you, who?\n\n\"'Okay,' I said. 'I'll go.'\"\n\nLeading in Chaos\n\nWhile many in the federal government were castigated for the slow response to Hurricane Katrina's destruction, Thad Allen garnered almost universal praise for his leadership in response and recovery efforts along the Gulf Coast. He received similar praise for his command performance during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010.\n\nIn fact, Admiral Allen has served in leadership roles during some of the country's most recent challenging times. He also commanded the Coast Guard's Atlantic forces in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, when every U.S. port was considered a target.\n\nKnown to his men as \"the Schwarzkopf of Connecticut,\" Allen worked wonders inside his organization, too. He led the massive effort to update the service's antiquated command and logistics organizations, another major achievement of his thirty-nine-year Coast Guard career.\n\nI met Admiral Allen in Pentagon City, Virginia, at the offices of the RAND Corporation, where he is a senior fellow. Allen is a large, powerfully built sixty-two-year-old with a neatly trimmed mustache flecked with gray. His ruddy cheeks and well-weathered face mark him as a man who has spent much of his adult life on the sea. Allen was casually dressed for our meeting in a striped rugby pullover over a crisp white dress shirt. The former college football star gave me a very firm handshake. Allen still carries himself with a middle linebacker's barrel-chested confidence. He speaks in a gravelly voice, and his pale gray eyes are warm and curious.\n\nWhen you consider the intensity of his experiences and the success he has had in leading rescue and recovery efforts in the most extreme situations, it is no surprise that Allen exudes a high level of self-confidence, but it clearly comes from his strong values, determination, and inner strength. He is also a leader who carefully picks his team and then gives them his complete trust.\n\n\"When I said yes, I'd go to New Orleans, the next thought was 'Okay, we can do that, but how?'\" he recalled. \"On my way to the airport, I called five people that I knew, to build a cadre around me in New Orleans. And I told them all the same thing. When they answered the phone I said, 'Find me in New Orleans in twenty-four hours.' That's all I told them. And of course it was almost impossible to get to New Orleans at that point.\"\n\nAllen flew to Baton Rouge later on the day of his appointment to FEMA. Arriving after dark, he was told that he couldn't get a helicopter to New Orleans until the next morning because of ongoing rescue operations. \"First thing in the morning, I met with the folks from Louisiana, and it was clear that there was not a lot of understanding of what was going on or the magnitude of the situation,\" he said.\n\nAllen was mortified after his initial aerial view of the devastation. \"As I flew in over New Orleans, I saw it was clearly filled with black water and there were still helicopters buzzing around. This is a week after the hurricane hit. I realized that at the national level, we had gotten this wrong in terms of the problem. We thought that we were dealing with a hurricane, and had it just been a hurricane, that probably would have been okay, but then Ground Zero would have been Bay Saint Louis in Waveland, Mississippi, which is where the eye came ashore.\"\n\nAdmiral Allen, who currently teaches a course in leadership at George Washington University, told me that, in a moment of crisis, he often returns to the writings of Peter Senge, a scientist and lecturer at MIT's Sloan School of Management, who wrote of the importance of grasping the unique aspects of each challenge rather than relying on preconceived \"mental models\" based on ingrained assumptions, generalizations, or past experience.\n\nFor Allen, in those chaotic hours of September 2005, Senge's concept of viewing a situation with a fresh eye was crucial to comprehending the scope of the Hurricane Katrina catastrophe. \"It allows you to create a framework to make decisions, even if it's one that you kind of makeup yourself: 'I see this, and so I think this is what's going on,' \" Allen told me.\n\nThe aftermath of Hurricane Katrina was much more widespread and devastating than his superiors had initially grasped, and the response was disorganized, undisciplined, and sorely lacking in resources.\n\n\"I realized as I flew into the city that I wasn't dealing with a hurricane. I was dealing with a weapon of mass effect that had been used on the City of New Orleans without criminality,\" he said. \"And that became my mental model, my way to orient myself. It allowed me to explain a bunch of things. They had lost continuity of government in the City of New Orleans without decapitation. Usually when you lose continuity of government, you lose your leadership. They hadn't lost their leadership. They had a mayor and a governor, but forces had been flowing into that city for over a week. Those who'd come to help weren't working for anybody; they were self-deployed.\"\n\nThe Coast Guard would save thirty-three thousand people and earn a presidential citation for its efforts, but at that point, a week after the hurricane hit, there was no \"scripted, coordinated, or controlled\" response from the myriad rescue forces that had descended upon the region. Admiral Allen quickly formed a plan of attack with another much-acclaimed leader of the response, U.S. Army Lieutenant General Russell L. Honor\u00e9, \"the Ragin' Cajun\" who commanded Joint Task Force Katrina.\n\n\"We came up with a way to divide the city into sectors, then take his forces with rubber boats and high-water vehicles, and basically, we decided to go through the city and touch every house,\" Allen said. \"We called it a 'Hasty Sweep.' . . . We provided the capability, capacity, and command and control the [rescue and recovery forces] didn't have, to allow them to be effective. That was the solution, ultimately, that worked in New Orleans.\"\n\nAllen took command of all search and rescue operations, reporting directly to U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, who reported to President George W. Bush, because \"That's about the only way you could do that and then make it happen quick enough.\"\n\nBy the end of the week, the White House team recognized that Allen was the man everyone looked to as the leader along the Gulf Coast, so they made it official. He was named to replace FEMA's much-criticized Mike Brown as head of the entire federal response.\n\nSharing the Vision, Providing Context\n\nOnce Allen had taken command, he was concerned that widespread criticism of the federal government's initial slow and disorganized response was damaging morale among those in the trenches who were scrambling to do better.\n\nAt that moment, Allen's military aide-ironically enough, named Katrina-was standing right on his shoulder and she asked, \"'Okay, Admiral, what are you going to do?' I told her, 'I'm going to do the first thing that any new commander does.' And Katrina says, 'What's that?' I said, 'I want an all-hands meeting.' She says, 'Sir, there are four thousand people in this building.' I said, 'Find the biggest place you can and get as many people as you can there.' Turns out there was a big, open area down on the first floor and we got about twenty-five hundred people in it,\" Allen said. \"I went down, and there was a sea of humanity.\"\n\nHe noted that one of the similarities between the hurricane and the later BP oil spill was that \"the people on the ground who actually had to do the work were having their morale seriously degraded by the reporting in the press on the ineptness . . . or the public grieving that was going on. Whether it was the perception of a lack of responsiveness of the federal government or BP's role, the people who were most critical to solving the problem felt they were just getting hammered in the press every day. Whether you were a rig worker working for BP or a FEMA relief worker, all you heard was your organization getting dumped on, and that has a really, really corrosive effect on morale.\"\n\nAllen described the scene that day: \"I walked in that room and I looked around, and what I saw was twenty-five hundred faces that were almost dragging on the ground. I got up on a desk at the joint field office and grabbed a megaphone.\" After explaining that he'd taken command and that he planned on setting up a two-man leadership team for the entire Gulf Coast region, from Louisiana to Florida, \"then I said, 'I'm going to give you an order. Everybody in the room here-you need to listen to me-this is an order. You're to treat everybody that you come in contact with that's been impacted by this storm as if they were a member of your family-your mother, your father, your brother, your sister. That's what I want you to do. And if you do that, two things will happen: Number one, if you make a mistake, you will probably err on the side of doing too much. And number two, if anybody has a problem with what you did, their problem's with me, not you.'\n\n\"At that point there was a collective sigh that probably would have blown the doors off the place-metaphorically- and then people began to weep, because nobody had told them what was important, what was valued, what their roles should be, and that their boss was behind them,\" Allen recalled. \"In a very simple and direct way, I was able to tell them that.\"\n\nIt was a textbook case of a leader taking charge of an organization dangerously spiraling out of control. And in a broader sense, this was a leadership moment for which Allen, like me and like so many others thrown into challenging situations, had been preparing his whole life. Thad Allen, who was born while his father was \"underway\" in a Coast Guard cutter, was groomed to be a man of action.\n\n\"I think I'm the only enlisted brat that ever became the commandant,\" he noted.\n\n\"That probably gave you a different perspective on the service,\" I said.\n\n\"Everybody says to me, 'You must have gone into the Coast Guard because your dad was in the Coast Guard,\" Allen replied. \"And frankly, the reason I went to the Coast Guard Academy is, I thought I was too small to play Division I football. I walked on the varsity in my freshman year and I was a captain my senior year. As a result of all that, I ultimately became the commandant. So I tell everybody, if I'm ever going to write an autobiography, I'm going to call it Accidental Admiral.\"\n\nLike mine, Allen's formative years had been shaped by parents who'd struggled through financial hardships and World War II, so I asked him if he felt a strong obligation to serve his country.\n\n\"Early on, I went to the academy and my goal was to spend five years, serve my commitment, and get out,\" he replied. \"And frankly, I was a handful early on. I had a bad temper. It was exacerbated by the fact that, in my junior year at the Coast Guard Academy, my older brother died from an overdose of heroin in Tucson, which significantly impacted my dad and almost led me to leave the academy. In fact, I ultimately stayed at the academy because I thought if I left after that, it would just break my dad's heart. That's probably another reason I'm still around and ended up doing what I was doing.\"\n\nAllen came to love the Coast Guard, from its history to its unique Principles of Operation, which include the principle of on-scene initiative, a vital part of his approach to leadership. It means \"if you're there, you have the capability, you should do something,\" he said. \"Also, we have the principle of restraint. We are not an overwhelming military force, we deal with our fellow citizens, and you need to treat them with respect when you go on board a boat.\n\n\"One of the things we are really good at-and this is an 'Allen-ism'-is being bureaucratically multilingual,\" he added. \"We can talk military to military, we can talk incident command system to local fire chief, we partner across the federal agencies, we can work with state and local governments. We are really good at partnering and collaboration.\"\n\nWhen individuals, departments, or organizations act in isolation without regard to their impact on others, it is known as a silo mentality. I noted that Allen seemed to be a leader who specialized in breaking down silos and organizing a united front when faced with chaos. He agreed, and then mentioned an early experience that helped form his approach to leadership under fire.\n\nThe \"pivotal event\" in his Coast Guard career came immediately after his graduation from the Coast Guard Academy, and ironically enough, it was a seminal aviation accident that many of us in the airline industry have used as a teaching example for years, one that eventually caused my profession to change the way we teach cockpit leadership.\n\nEastern Air Lines Flight 401, a wide-body jet flying from New York City, crashed into the Everglades about eighteen miles short of the Miami International Airport runway, on December 29, 1972. One hundred and one people were killed immediately. Two others died of injuries later. Seventy-five people survived, thanks to rescue efforts by air boaters who'd been nearby and the swift arrival of the Coast Guard, including twenty-three-year-old Thad Allen, who was assigned to the Coast Guard air station at Opa-Locka.\n\n\"I actually ended up getting on the first or second helicopter to arrive on the scene,\" said Allen. \"I was in the wreckage for about twenty-four hours, hauling survivors, bodies, doing whatever needed to be done. There were about six of us who got in, and then they couldn't bring anybody else in, so we were the first ground team that was there. So, yeah, that was a pretty substantial event in my life.\"\n\nAllen said the experience of being involved in a massive rescue operation under such horrific conditions-some rescuers sustained burns from jet fuel burning in the swamp-taught him the value of first responders and clearheaded crisis leadership at a very young age."}
{"text":"Titanic's unsinkable stoker\n\nTitanic was celebrated as the biggest, safest, most advanced ship of its age, but it was a lowly stoker in its boiler room who truly deserved the name 'unsinkable'. John Priest survived no fewer than four ships that went to the bottom, including Titanic and its sister ship Britannic.\n\nJohn Priest was one of more than 150 'firemen', or stokers, whose job it was to keep Titanic's 29 colossal boilers at steam, day and night, for the entire journey.\n\nHe had worked his entire life as a member of the so-called 'black gang', toiling in the bowels of steam-powered ships. It was back-breaking work, often done stripped to the waist due to the ferocious heat of the furnaces.\n\nTitanic being tugged out to Sea from Belfast\n\nEven in a state-of-the-art vessel like Titanic, the work was still done by muscle power alone. More than 600 tonnes of coal a day were needed to propel what was then the world's biggest ship through the ocean. 'Trimmers' wheelbarrowed coal from the bunkers to the firemen who maintained the furnaces. Both were relatively skilled jobs, with the trimmers having to ensure the weight of the coal was evenly distributed so the ship stayed balanced, or 'trimmed', while the firemen needed to feed just the right amount of coal into the flames to keep the ship at the required speed.\n\nArthur John Priest: 1887 - 1937\n\nSurvived the Alcantara when it was torpedoed by the German raider \"Grief\" in February 1916.\n\nSurvived the Britannic when she hit a mine and sank in November1916.\n\nSurvived yet another sinking on his final ship the Donegal in April 1917.\n\nWas awarded the Mercantile Marine Ribbon in 1917, for his services during the war.\n\nWith the coal strike of 1912, the black gangs were hit hard as ships stayed in port and men were laid off. Priest was one of the lucky few to find a job on Titanic as it prepared for its maiden voyage across the Atlantic. He was perhaps fortunate to have already served on Titanic's sister ship Olympic and was a fireman on board when it was holed below the waterline in a collision with the Royal Navy cruiser HMS Hawke in 1911.\n\nThe Olympic crash wasn't Priest's first brush with disaster. He had previously worked aboard a ship called the Asturias that was badly damaged in a collision on its maiden voyage. But this was an age when accidents, near-misses and sinkings were relatively common.\n\nEven so, the remainder of his career at sea was to be a remarkable tale of survival against the odds. He would claim in later life that men refused to sail with him because he brought bad luck. It's hard not to see their point.\n\n\"Start Quote\n\n\"I shall never forget the sight of that lovely big ship going down and the awful cry of the people in the water and you could hear them dying out one by one\"\"\n\nEnd QuoteArchie Jewell, Titanic survivor\n\nWhen Titanic hit an iceberg just before midnight on Sunday 14 April 1912, many of the passengers and crew were unaware that anything was amiss until the engines stopped. In the very bowels of the ship, Priest was off duty and resting between shifts.\n\nThe odds against his survival were steep, due to his both his physical and social position within the ship. The route to the deck took him and other members of the black gang up through a maze of gangways and corridors before they could reach the deck. By the time they emerged into the freezing night air, most of the lifeboats had already gone.\n\nThose firemen who survived - 44 in all - swam for their lives through water just marginally warmer than freezing, wearing only the shorts and vests they worked in. Small wonder that Priest suffered frostbite.\n\nAnother survivor, a lookout by the name of Archie Jewell, wrote to his sister describing the moment Titanic sank.\n\n\"I shall never forget the sight of that lovely big ship going down and the awful cry of the people in the water and you could hear them dying out one by one; it was enough to make anyone jump over board and out of the way. I can't help crying when I think about it.\"\n\nThe 'Great War'\n\nWhen World War One broke out in 1914, merchant vessels, and their crews, were required for the war effort to serve in convoys and as hospital ships. By 1915, Germany had unleashed its U-boat fleet in a bid to choke off Britain's supply lines. The toll on the merchant fleet was horrendous.\n\n\"Start Quote\n\nI stood at the bulkhead with the other stewardesses, watching the women cling to their husbands before being put into the boats with their children\"\n\nEnd QuoteViolet Jessop, Titanic survivor\n\nPriest was among those who went to war, serving aboard the armed merchant vessel Alcantara. In February 1916, Alcantara intercepted the German raider Grief, which was disguised a Norwegian ship. As Alcantara approached, Grief opened fire. There was a short, ferocious, close-range battle, at the end of which both ships were sunk.\n\nMore than 70 of Priest's shipmates were killed and he only narrowly escaped, with shrapnel wounds.\n\nWhen he returned to work, it was aboard Britannic, Titanic's other - even bigger - sister, which was serving as a hospital ship ferrying wounded soldiers back to Britain through the Mediterranean. Having already survived a collision on Olympic and the loss of Titanic, it must have been with no small amount of trepidation that he joined the third of the celebrated White Star Liners.\n\nJoining Priest on board were two other Titanic survivors; Archie Jewell, the lookout, and Violet Jessop, a White Star stewardess who was now serving as a nurse.\n\nIf Priest did feel any nervousness, it was entirely justified. On 21 November 1916, the great ship struck a mine and sank near the Greek island of Kea. Once again, he emerged from the very depths of a foundering ship alive.\n\nIndeed, the majority of the ship's crew were evacuated safely, but two of the lifeboats were lowered into the sea too early and were sucked into the ship's still turning propellers, killing 30 men. Among those pulled into the blades was Archie, who somehow survived.\n\n\"... most of us jumped in the water but it was no good we was pulled right in under the blades...I shut my eyes and said good bye to this world, but I was struck with a big piece of the boat and got pushed right under the blades and I was goin around like a top...I came up under some of the wreckage ... everything was goin black to me when some one on top was strugling and pushed the wreckage away so I came up just in time I was nearly done for ... there was one poor fellow drowning and he caught hold of me but I had to shake him off so the poor fellow went under.\"\n\nViolet was also in danger of being pulled into the propellers, but dived clear and was sucked underneath, striking her head on the keel. She was rescued by another lifeboat.\n\nAfter Britannic, Priest would achieve one final escape from a sinking ship. On 17 April 1917, he was a fireman aboard the hospital ship Donegal when it was torpedoed and sunk in the English Channel. He suffered a head injury and would not serve again during World War One. Fellow Titanic and Britannic survivor Jewell was among the 40 men who went down with the ship.\n\n'Unsinkable'\n\nPriest's is an amazing story of human endurance. He worked his entire life in extraordinary conditions in the belly of the ship, where fires and explosions were common. He was often at the very worst part of a vessel from which to escape and yet he survived an astonishing litany of torpedoes, mines, icebergs and collisions to live out his days spinning tales in the pubs of Southampton.\n\nHe died in 1937, on dry land. Truly, the name \"unsinkable\" applied rather better to him than it did to the mighty Titanic.\n\nThe fate of other ships in Titanic's story\n\nCalifornian, controversially failed to come to Titanic's rescue, torpedoed and sank off the coast of Greece during WW1, November 1915; 1 killed\n\nBritannic, the sister ship of Titanic, hit a mine and sank off the coast of Greece, November 1916; 30 killed.\n\nIn all White Star Line lost 13 ships during WW1\n\nCarpathia, rescuer of the Titanic survivors, was torpedoed and sank off the coast of Ireland, July 1918; 5 killed\n\nLusitania, owned by White Star rivals Cunard, was torpedoed and sank off the coast of Ireland, May 1915; 1,198 killed. Titanic was built in part to compete with Lusitania, whose sinking helped bring the United States into WW1"}
{"text":"The Giuseppe Garibaldi class were a group of armoured cruisers built in Italy at the end of the nineteenth century. Ten ships were built for both the Regia Marina and for export.\n\nDesign and history\n\nRight elevation and deck plan as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1902\n\nThe design was a private venture by the Italian firm of Gio. Ansaldo & C., which was hoping to profit from the need for the world's navies to modernize towards heavily armoured steam warships.\n\nDesigned by Edoardo Masdea, the Garibaldi-class cruiser was a hybrid between a cruiser and a battleship. With a maximum speed of 20 knots (37 km\/h) the design was slightly slower than contemporary cruisers, but was both heavily armed and armoured, in a package with very low displacement and moderate dimensions.\n\nThe design was so popular that between 1894 and 1902 ten cruisers were purchased by four different countries; the first five by the Italian Navy, four by the Argentine Navy and one by the Spanish Navy. According to Brassey's Naval Annual, Spain was planning to acquire a second \"Garibaldi\"-class cruiser, to be named Pedro de Aragon. These plans were shelved after the Spanish-American War and the subsequent downsizing of the Spanish Armada.\n\nTwo of the Italian ships ordered in 1902 were sold to the Argentine Navy before completion as the Mitre and Roca; they were renamed as the Rivadavia and the Mariano Moreno. The Argentines in turn sold them to the Imperial Japanese Navy before final completion in 1904, and they were renamed the Kasuga and Nisshin\n\nThe class was unusual in that they did not have a uniform main armament. Some had single 10-inch (254 mm) guns in gun turrets fore and aft; others (including the Kasuga) had a mixed armament of a single 10-inch (254 mm) gun in one turret and another turret with twin 8-inch (203 mm) guns. A third variation (including the Nisshin) was a uniform armament of four 8-inch (203 mm) guns, twin gun turrets fore and aft. The Cristobal Colon was fitted with defective 10 inch guns which were removed before it was committed to combat. Therefore, it only went to battle with 10 smokeless powder Armstrong six inch guns mounted in the hull (5 on each side)."}

{"text":"William Beardmore Jr. acquired Parkhead Forge almost by default. A steel making company in Glascow, Scotland, Parkhead Forge was having trouble. They failed building appropriate armor plate for the HMS Black Prince (sister ship to HMS Warrior, still on display in Portsmouth), and called in William's dad to help out. He became a partner in the company (owned by Robert Napier's shipbuilding concern, who made the first iron ships for the Royal Navy) and brought his sons in. In the end, William Beardmore Jr. was the last man standing after retirement and deaths of the other partners. He acquired Parkhead Forge from Robert Napier in 1886 and started a steel making, shipbuilding, and armaments empire that lasted forty years, till the world wars had run their course.\n\nBy 1900, Bearmore expanded into shipbuilding himself, taking over Robert Napier's concern at Govan and building a huge works at Dalmuir near Glascow. The Dalmuir works first ship was the HMS Agememnon, which served the Royal Navy till after WW1, and was the first of many warships to come. The Beardmore works covered 45 acres and employed 40,000 people in the run up to WW1. Ships built included such as HMS Conqueror and other dreadnaught class ships, and possibly the world's first aircraft carrier, the HMS Argus. He built ocean liners, hospital ships, destroyers and more.\n\nThe company sought to diversify early in the game and started building submarines (they completed 13), automobiles (Arrol-Johnston car works), airships (4 dirigibles, including the R34, which made the first ever east-west crossing of the Atlantic Ocean), motorcycles, ships guns and munitions, tanks, railroad locomotives, marine engines, aircraft, if it could move or shoot, William Beardmore wanted to build it.\n\nAfter WW1, things didn't go so well for Beardmore's concerns. The whole world's need for anything shrunk during that time, and Beardmore's started operating a loss. He was forced out of the company by 1930, and parts of it continued till the final piece was laid to rest in 1972, when Parkhead Forge was razed to build a shopping center, which is still there and called \"The Forge\". The steel output from that forge fed the huge shipbuilding industry that had grown up around Glascow, which eventually had built over 25,000 ships.

{"text":"September 11th\n\nMajor Speeches\n\nVideo Footage\n\nUSS Arizona History\n\nSome sections from The University of Arizona Library\n\nBuilding and Launch\n\nThe construction of the USS ARIZONA (BB39), named for the 48th state in the\nUnion, began on March 16, 1914, when the keel was laid. After a year of intense\nlabor, it was launched\non June 19, 1915, as the second and last of the\nPENNSYLVANIA class battleship, which formed the next step of the US Navy's response to the naval\narms race that had begun in 1906 when the Royal Navy completed the HMS\nDreadnought.\nThe launch was a grand affair, and Miss\nEsther Ross\n, daughter of an influential\npioneer citizen in Prescott, Arizona, christened the ship with the traditional\nchampagne. The\nbattleship's commissioning took place on October 17, 1916, under the command of\nCaptain John D. McDonald.\n\nDuring 1917 residents of Arizona organized a state-wide fund\nraising effort to pay for a silver service to present to the Arizona.\n\nOn Nov. 16, 1916, the ARIZONA departed on its shakedown cruise and training\noff the Virginia Capes, Newport and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Two months later it\nreturned to Norfolk, Virginia to conduct test-firing of its guns and\ntorpedo-defense exercises. On December 24 it entered the New York Naval Shipyard\nfor a post-shakedown overhaul.\nArizona experienced considerable problems with her engines during her\ntrials, to the extent that the blades were stripped from one her turbines,\nrequiring months in dry dock to replace. The work was finished in completed April 3, 1917.\n\nDimensions of The Ship\n\nThe dimensions of the ship were quite impressive for the time. Its overall\nlength was 608 feet (two American football fields long) with a beam of 97 feet 1\ninch. It displaced 31,400 tons with a mean draft of 28 feet 10 inches. The\nARIZONA's four shafts were driven by four paired Parsons turbines and 12 Babcock\nand Wilcox boilers that developed 33,375 horsepower, enabling a top speed of 21\nknots. The designed complement was 55 officers and 860 men. The ARIZONA was\nwell-armed for ships of its period. The original armament consisted of 12\n14-inch 45-caliber guns; 22 5-inch 5 1-caliber guns; four 3-inch 50-caliber\nguns; and two 21-inch submerged torpedo tubes. It was protected by 18 inches of\narmor at its maximum thickness. The ARIZONA and its sister ship PENNSYLVANIA\nrepresented a modest improvement of the previous NEVADA-class battleships:\n\"length and displacement were somewhat increased and two additional 14-inch guns\nwere shipped, the main armament now being arranged in four triple turrets . . .\n\" (Stern 1980:30). The significant change was concentrated in the firepower of\nthe vessel: The ARIZONA's four turrets (labeled No. 1, 2, 3 and 4) each mounted\nthree 14-inch naval guns.\n\n1918-1941, Service\n\nDue to the scarcity of fuel oil in Great Britain during the war, the modern oil\nfired boilers on the Arizona prevented her from joining the other U.S.\nbattleships serving in the European\ntheater.\n\nIn November 1918 the Arizona sailed for Europe\nto join Battleship Division Six serving with the British Grand Fleet, one week\nafter the signing of the armistice.\nOn December 12, she put to sea to rendezvous with the transport\nGEORGE WASHINGTON that was carrying President Woodrow Wilson to the Paris Peace\nConference. President Wilson carried a bold proposal intended to ensure a\nlasting world peace. In his outline for world cooperation, Wilson proposed 14\npoints to act as guidelines for a peace without victory and a new world body\ncalled the League of Nations.\nThe Arizona was part of the honor escort that arrived at Brest, France the next day with the\npresident. The President and his plan arrived in good order on\nDecember 13, 1918, but the failure of nations to grasp Wilson's ideals lead to\nWorld War 11 -- and the violent destruction of the honor escort USS ARIZONA --\n23 years later.\n\nOn the 13th she sailed from Brest with 238 homeward-bound veterans on\nboard and arrived in New York on the day after Christmas, then continued to its home port of\nNorfolk.\n\nDuring the years between the world wars, Arizona carried on with\nthe routine of a Navy ship in peace time, conducting training, gunnery\npractice, fleet exercises, cruises and routine shipyard maintenance. Among the\nevents of interest during this time were:\n\nIn May 1919 a crisis arose that threatened American lives and property in\nSmyrna, Asia Minor. The ARIZONA was dispatched to respond to the grave situation. The ship\ndisembarked Marines and sailors to protect the American consulate and bring\naboard American citizens. When tensions eased, the ARIZONA was ordered home.\n\nIn June 1919 the ARIZONA entered New York Naval Shipyard for maintenance and\nremained there until January 1920, when it departed for fleet maneuvers in the\nCaribbean. That summer the ARIZONA became the flagship for Battleship Division\n7, commanded by Rear Admiral Eberle, the future chief of naval operations.\n\nIn 1920 the Arizona began to carry airplanes\non board for scouting and spotting the fall of shells from the ship's guns.\nThe ARIZONA continued operations in the Caribbean Sea throughout the winter,\nand during that period made its first passage through the Panama Canal.\n\nOn April 27, 1921, the ship returned to Norfolk from Cuba and was overhauled in the New\nYork Navy Yard. That summer the ARIZONA participated in experimental bombing\nexercises of Navy seaplanes on a captured German U-boat, the first in a series\nof joint Army-Navy experiments conducted during June and July of 1921 to measure\nthe effectiveness of air attack.\n\nOn July 1, 1921 the ARIZONA was honored as the flagship for three-star Vice\nAdmiral John D. McDonald. With the flag came the title of flagship of the Battle\nForce, U.S. Atlantic Fleet. In August the flag was transferred to the USS\nWYOMING and the ARIZONA received a new admiral, John S. McKean, commander of\nBattleship Division 7.\n\nIn September of 1921 the ARIZONA was transferred to Pacific waters. At San\nPedro, California it underwent another change of command, when Rear Admiral\nCharles Hughes became the new commander of Battleship Division 7.\n\nFor the next decade the ARIZONA served as flagship for Battleship Divisions\n2, 3 and 4. A number of distinguished officers served aboard the vessel,\nparticularly Rear Admirals William V. Pratt and Claude Block. During this period\nthe ship sailed twice to Hawaii to participate in fleet maneuvers and practice\namphibious landings of Marines.\n\nIn early March 1924 Madeline Blair stowed away on the Arizona and\nwasn't discovered until April 12th. She was apparently attempting to ride to\nSan Pedro (on the way to Hollywood) and was providing favors to crewmen in\nreturn for shelter and food. She was discovered after a Chief Radioman\nhappened to overhear a sailor remark on her presence. As a result\ncourts-martial of the men involved were held and twenty three men were\nsentenced to prison, the longest for ten years.\n\nIn February 1929 the ARIZONA passed through the Panama Canal for fleet\nmaneuvers in the Caribbean.\nOn May 1, the battleship returned to Norfolk in preparation for modernization overhaul.\nOn May 4, 1929 it entered the yard at Norfolk and was placed in reduced commission until July 1929.\nDuring this modernization the ARIZONA received a massive facelift. The entire superstructure was replaced, including\nthe traditional cage masts which were replaced fore and aft by tripod types.\nNew 5-inch antiaircraft guns replaced the outdated 3-inch mounts. New armor was\nadded below the upper decks to guard against the fall of shot by high-angle\ngunfire and bombs dropped by aircraft. Extra compartments of horizontal armor called \"blisters\" or bulges were\nadded to the outer hull to increase the ship's protection against torpedo\nattack. In an effort to offset the additional weight, a brand-new power plant\nconsisting of modern boilers and turbines was installed to allow it to maintain\nnormal fleet speed. The engines were upgraded with new geared units, and the\noriginal boilers were replaced with six Bureau Express three-drum boilers. The\nARIZONA's fuel capacity was increased from 2,332 to 4,630 tons of oil.\n\nOn March 1, 1931 modernization was completed, and the ARIZONA was placed in full\ncommission once again.\n\nOne of the more significant events in the ship's history took place on March\n19, 1931 when the ARIZONA embarked President\nHoover for a\n10-day inspection cruise to Puerto Rico and St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands,\nthen transported the President to Hampton Roads at the end of the month.\n\nOff to California\n\nOn August 1, 1931, The ARIZONA left Norfolk for the last time and remained in the\nPacific for the rest of its operational life.\n\nOn March 10, 1933 the Arizona was anchored at San Pedro when the\nLong Beach earthquake struck. The ship provided a shore party that helped\npatrol the area, provided communications, set up first aid stations and\nprovided food and shelter for those made homeless by the earthquake.\n\nThe Warner Brothers movie Here Comes the Navy used the\nArizona as one of it's locations during spring of 1934. The film\nstarred James Cagney, Pat O'Brien and Gloria Stuart. The movie was one of the\nnominees for the Adademy Award in 1935.\n\nOn September 17, 1938, Rear Admiral Chester Nimitz hoisted his flag as commander of Battleship\nDivision I, with the ARIZONA serving as his flagship until\nMay 1939. His successor, Rear Admiral Russell Willson, assumed command in San\nPedro, California.\n\nHawaii Operations\n\nAs tensions grew in the Pacific, the possibility of fighting there became more\nlikely, and fleet operations at Pearl Harbor were designed to prepare the fleet for war.\n\nOn April 2, 1940 the ARIZONA moved into Hawaiian waters and\nwas ordered up the coast to be overhauled at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in\nWashington. The work was completed by January 23, 1941. At that time Rear\nAdmiral Isaac Kidd relieved Rear Admiral Willson and took command of Battleship\nDivision 1.\n\nThe ARIZONA returned to Hawaii in February 1941 and trained in those waters\nfor four months. The last voyage to the West Coast occurred in June, and in\nearly July the battleship returned to Pearl Harbor. For several months prior to\nthe out-break of the Pacific War, the ARIZONA's crew underwent intensive\nbattle-readiness drills that often included mock air attacks from the carrier\nENTERPRISE.\n\nOn October 22, 1941, while conducting exercises with the Oklahoma and\nNevada, the Arizona was struck on the port side by the\nOklahoma. A V-shaped hole, four feet wide by twelve feet long was opened\nin the torpedo bulge. The Arizona entered drydock No. I on October 27,1941 for a few weeks for repairs.\n\nSoon after the ARIZONA rejoined the fleet. The ship's exact movements for the\nmonth before the Pearl Harbor attack are not clear, as the ship's log was lost\nin the sinking.\n\nDecember 6, 1941\n\nThe ARIZONA entered Pearl Harbor on December 6, 1941 and moored\non the east side of Ford Island. Later that day the USS VESTAL (AR-15) pulled\nalongside to ready the vessel for repair work scheduled for the following\nMonday. At 10:00 that morning, Admiral Kidd came aboard the VESTAL for a\n15-minute official call. Later the captain of the repair ship, Cassin Young,\nboarded the ARIZONA to discuss the ship's pending repairs with the battleship's\nchief engineer.\n\nMany of the ship's crew had liberty that Saturday. Some of the married men\nhad wives on the island and received weekend passes. Nearly 50 crew members were\nshoreside at the time of the attack. However, a majority of the men had returned\nto the ship by midnight. Eight hours later the ARIZONA would be lying on the\nbottom of Pearl Harbor with the bodies of most of those men.\n\nDecember 7, 1941\n\nStatus of Ship on the Day of the Attack\n\nThe USS ARIZONA's configuration had changed very little since its 1931\nmodernization. However, in April 1939 and January 1941 alterations had been done\nto ready the vessel for war.\n\nIn that effort, an exposed pair of 5-inch, 51-caliber guns was removed so\nthat new 1.1-inch quadruple machine-gun mounts could be installed on the\nsuperstructure deck abreast of the conning tower. Another set of the 1. 1-inch\nmounts was also to be installed on the quarterdeck between the mainmast and gun\nturret No. 3. foundations, ballistic shields, ammunition hoists, and\nready-service lockers were installed. At the time of the attack, those areas\nwere vacant of any armament -- the guns had been scheduled for installation in\nearly 1942.\n\nA variety of 50-caliber machine guns was installed to increase antiaircraft\nfire power. It was quite common to relocate such weapons from time to time to\nincrease their arc of fire. Originally four were placed on the main platforms of\neach mast. In 1939 search lights carried on the funnel were removed, and two\nmachine guns from the mainmast replaced them. In January 1941 at Puget Sound the\nvessel was fitted with a \"birdbath\" platform atop the main-mast director tower.\nThe \"birdbath\" was filled with four 50-caliber guns, two from the foremast and\ntwo from the mainmast. Leaving two guns on the foremast platform and two on the\nfunnel platform, searchlights were placed on the former gun platform of the\nmainmast. Splinter shields were mounted on the superstructure deck to protect\nthe crews manning the eight 5-inch, 25-caliber guns located there.\n\nCoupled with increased antiaircraft fire power was the installation of new\nMark 28 antiaircraft directors that were supposed to increase the firing\nefficiency for the 5-inch 25-caliber guns. The location of the directors was on\nthe range-finder platform level of the bridge. Here adequate support of the\nsuperstructure deck could be found via their heavy wiring tubes. This site\nafforded sufficient sky arc coverage for the directors' use. Early in 1942 the\nARIZONA was scheduled to receive fire control and air search radar equipment. At\nthe time of its loss, most of the structural modifications had been\naccomplished. The ARIZONA was painted in a two-tone gray paint scheme commonly\nreferred to as Measure 14, consisting of an ocean gray (dark) on all hull and\nsuperstructure masses. Haze gray (light) was applied to the masts, yards and\ntowers above the level of the superstructure masses. This paint scheme was meant\nto break up the general outline of the ship at a distance. The hull and\nsuperstructure were meant to blend with the sea, the upper works with the sky.\nIt obviously had no value to vessels in port. A majority of the Pacific Fleet\nwas painted in that manner. The exact date of the order that authorized the\nMeasure 14 scheme is not known, however, a recent discovery of a photograph of\nthe USS UTAH showed this paint scheme being applied in October 1941.\n\nOne other note on the ARIZONA's final appearance: Morning canvas sun\ntarpaulins or awnings stretched above the main deck from the bow to the muzzles\nof gun turret No. 1. Awnings graced the quarterdeck from the break in the deck\nto the barbette of gun turret No. 3. Farther down the quarterdeck, awnings\nstretched from the gun muzzles of gun No. 4 to the stern. Most of the canvas was\ndestroyed by the ensuing fire that engulfed the ship following the massive\nmagazine explosion.\n\nThe Attack and Battle Damage\n\nThe ARIZONA was moored at berth F-7, with the repair ship VESTAL moored alongside.\nJapanese aircraft appeared in the air over Pearl Harbor\njust before 8:00 am on this Sunday morning. The color\ndetail was on deck in anticipation of raising the flag at the stern at 8:00.\nThe Arizona came under attack almost immediately, and at about 8:10\nreceived a hit by a 800-kilogram (1,760-lb.) bomb just forward of turret two on the\nstarboard side.\n\nIn a tremendous blast, the ARIZONA blew up.\n\nWithin a few seconds the forward powder magazines exploded,\ngutting the forward part of the ship. The foremast and\nforward superstructure collapsed forward into the\nvoid created by the explosion and turrets one and two, deprived of support,\ndropped more than 20 feet relative to their normal position. The explosion\nignited furious fires in the forward part of the ship.\n\nJapanese Petty Officer Noburo Kanai, in a high-altitude bomber, had earned the title of\ncrack bombardier while training for the mission. Kanai was credited with\ndropping the bomb that blew up the ARIZONA.\n\nIn an instant, most of the\nmen aboard were killed, either by the explosion and fire\nor were trapped by the rapid sinking of the ship.\n\nThe blast from the ARIZONA blew men off the decks of surrounding ships and threw tons of debris,\nincluding parts of bodies, all over the harbor.\nMany of the survivors displayed remarkable courage in assisting their shipmates to safety. Lieutenant\nCommander Samuel G. Fuqua was awarded the Medal of Honor for his role in\nleading the rescue of other survivors. The Medal was also awarded posthumously to Rear\nAdmiral Isaac Kidd and Captain Franklin Van Valkenburgh. 1,177 of the crew died on the\nship.\n\nSurvivors of the attack also claimed that the ARIZONA was hit by one or possibly two torpedoes. The fury of\nthe attack continued unabated, with the ARIZONA reportedly receiving eight bomb\nhits as it sank. Abandoned at 10:32 a.m., the ship's burning superstructure and\ncanted masts loomed through the smoke that blanketed the harbor.\n\nThe ARIZONA received the most serious battle damage of the ships attacked on\nDecember 1941. The resultant explosion of ammunition and fuel demolished the\nforward section of the vessel, which collapsed inside the hull, and killed most\nof the ship's complement. Six days after the attack, the senior surviving\nofficer from the ARIZONA forwarded the ship's action report to CINCPAC Admiral\nKimmel and noted: \"The USS ARIZONA is a total loss except the following is\nbelieved salvageable: fifty-caliber machine guns in maintop, searchlights on\nafter searchlight platform, the low catapult on quarterdeck and the guns of\nnumbers 3 and 4 turrets\" (Memorandum, Commanding Officer, USS ARIZONA to\nCINCPAC, Pearl Harbor, T.H., December 13, 1941. Copy on file at the USS Arizona\nMemorial).\n\nSalvage\n\nAfter the attack the ship was left resting on the bottom with the deck just\nawash. In the days and weeks following, efforts were made to recover the bodies\nof the crew and the ship's records. Eventually further recovery of bodies became\nfruitless, and the bodies of at least 900 crewmen remained in the ship.\nDuring 1942 salvage\nwork to recover\nas much of the ship as was practical began. The masts and superstructure\nwere removed for scrap and the two turrets aft were salvaged for use at shore\nbatteries on Hawaii. The forward part of the ship had received the most damage,\nand only the guns of turret two were removed while turret one was left in place.\n\nIt was soon discovered that the after part of the ship from the break in the\ndeck to the stern was relatively intact. Removal of safes, valuables and\ndocuments of a sensitive nature had begun by early 1942.\n\nAssessment dives continued to evaluate the feasibility of raising the\nARIZONA. Salvage officers initially considered building a cofferdam around the\nvessel's perimeter, thus sealing the ship off from the harbor to allow the\npumping of water from interior spaces. Examination of the harbor's coral bottom\nconcluded that it was too porous and would not allow this process.\n\nThroughout 1942 and 1943, examination dives continued inside and outside the\nship. Meanwhile, ordnance divers began to remove ammunition and projectiles in\nMay 1942. Eventually guns, machinery and other equipment were removed for use on\nother ships or stations.\n\nThe divers found the interior of the ARIZONA had been severely damaged by the\nexplosion of the forward magazines. Evidence of its power had shown that the\nexplosion had vented through the deck forward of turret No. I causing a\nseparation of the bow and the rest of the ship. Divers found further that the\nsides of the bow had been blown outward almost to a horizontal position. Closer\nexamination of the exterior hull was assisted by jetting away mud with high\npressure hoses. When divers attempted to move forward into the interior of the\nvessel, they found that the main and second decks were blocked with wreckage\nforward of frame 76. The furthest divers could move toward the bow of the ship\nwas on the third deck to frame 66, where the second deck sloped into the third\ndeck. Hatches that had once led to the interior of the ship from various decks\nwere now twisted and distorted. Captain Homer Wallin and his staff found that\ngun turrets No. I and 2, the conning tower and uptakes had fallen 20-28 feet\nindicating a collapse of the supporting structure.\n\nOn May 5, 1942, the toppled foremast of the ARIZONA was cut away and removed.\nThe mainmast was taken away by August 23. Other features removed were the stern\naircraft crane (December 23) and the conning tower (December 30).\n\nThe Navy decided that the Army would receive gun turrets No. 3 and 4 for use\nas coastal defense guns. Two sites were selected: one at Mokapu Head (Kaneohe)\nknown as Battery Pennsylvania and the second at an area known today as Electric\nHill (HEI generating plant) on the western shore of Oahu, up the slopes of the\nWianae Mountains. Only Battery Pennsylvania was completed. A test firing took\nplace four days before the surrender of Japan. Today both sites are abandoned;\nthe guns were removed and cut up for scrap shortly after the war ended.\n\nOne question still haunts visitors to the Arizona Memorial even to this day.\nWhy were the dead not removed? Initially, about 105 bodies were removed but\nbecause the ship was never raised, the remainder could not. The priority at that\ntime was salvage of ships that could be repaired -- the ARIZONA was not in that\ncategory. As a result, the bodies deteriorated to the point of not being\nidentifiable. Even as late as 1947, requests were made in regard to removal of\nthe dead, but rejected. They are considered buried at sea by the US Navy.\n\nOn December 1, 1942 the ship was stricken from the registry of U.S. Navy\nvessels.\n\nBuilding the Memorial\n\nAfter World War II, the wreck was largely ignored, even though the\ndestruction of the Arizona came to symbolize the reason the U.S. was\nfighting.\n\nIn 1950 the tradition of raising and lowering the colors over\nthe ship daily was started, and momentum gradually began to build toward\nproviding a memorial for the ship and those who died on\nher.\n\nIn 1958 legislation was passed authorizing the Navy to erect a memorial and\nallowing it to accept donations toward that goal. Among the many noteworthy\ncontributions were several generous ones from Hawaii's legislature and a 1961\nconcert by Elvis Presley.\n\nIn 1960 construction began and the memorial\nwas dedicated on Memorial Day, 1962.\n\nIn 1961 the USS ARIZONA was altered once more. In order to place the present\nmemorial over the ship, a section of the boat deck that rested over the galley\namidships was cut away. Initially this had been the area of a flag and platform\nfor ceremonies and visits to the site from 1950-1960. This portion of the\nARIZONA was removed to Waipio Point where it remains today.\n\nIn 1980 a visitor's center on shore was\nopened and the Navy turned the operation of the memorial over to the National Park Service. During the 1980's, the Park Service\nconducted a detailed\nsurvey of the sunken Arizona and other sites of historical interest related\nto the Pearl Harbor attack.\n\nAs recounted by William Manchester:\n\n\"Remember Pearl Harbor\" became an American shibboleth and the\ntitle of the country's most\npopular war song, but it was the loss of that great ship which seared the\nminds of navy men. Six months later, when naval Lieutenant Wilmer E. Gallaher\nturned the nose of his Dauntless dive-bomber down toward the Akagi\noff Midway, the memory of that volcanic eruption in Pearl Harbor, which he had\nwitnessed, flashed across his mind. As the Akagi blew up, he exulted:\n\"Arizona, I remember you!\""}
{"text":"Wooden Sailing Ships\n\nHistory of the Sail\n\nIt will never be known when the first people set a sail. All that can be given is an approximate date for the earliest evidence of sail. At present this is provided by a small clay model found in southern mesopotamia which shows what may have been a mast step and also the means of fixing shrouds. The date of the model is about 3,500 B.C. found in southern Egypt. How long before these vague dates the sail was used cannot be known - it may have been several thousand years.\n\nThe square sail and its associated rigging was developed in the east and the Mediterranean in competition, as a means of propulsion, with the paddle and the pivoted oar. Ships grew in size, sails grew in area, and rigging in complexity, the problem being to give adequate strength to rigs composed of fragile sail fabrics and ropes. Square-sailed craft spread over the Aegean and the open Mediterranean between Egypt and Crete, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. The records that have survived of the early sea-going sailors are very sparse: Cretans, Egyptians, Greeks rowed and sailed over the summer seas of these areas, but even the PHoenecians, who rounded Africa and may have reached Britain, left little record of their sailing techniques.\n\nWhen the Mediterranean had become a Roman lake it was dominated in war by the galleys, which carried a square sail for auxiliary propulsion, and in trade by the biggest ships yet built, the grain ships propelled by a single large square sail on the main mast and a second small sail forward to give some assistance to the vessels lumbering manoeuverability. By this time men may have been using sail for six thousand years.\n\nWhen Julius Caesar reached Gaul and Britain he found sail being used in this dim north western area where civilization petered out. But curiously enough yet further north, where the vikings great tradition of seamanship was incubating, the kind of hull and steering arrangements capable of making use of sail in the more southern coasts of Europe facing the Atlantic appears to have declined. Neither the Anglo-Saxons nor the later peoples of the Migration period seem to have used sail in their crossings to the offshore island of Britain.\n\nWhile the Viking galleys with their single square sail reached the degree of performance still to be admired, in the Mediterranean a revolution had occurred in the means of sail setting and handling. The Arabs had created an empire and they soon took over seafaring in the Mediterranean. And the rig that they used , spreading it before them over the whole sea, was not the square rig which had served people of so long in ocean voyaging, but the lateen, a form of fore and aft rig.\n\nThe square sail hung from a yard at its head and with the yard slung before the mast at the mid point of the former. When driving the ship the wind always blows on the same side of the sail. The fore and aft sail in contrast is hinged on the mast in the fashion of a gate, and being free to swing from side to side the wind plays first on one surface of the sail and then on the other, depending on the wind's direction and how the sail is trimmed. A more subtle propulsive power is thus derived. While along the coasts of northern europe the square sail remained dominant, for 500 years the Mediterranean was the sea of the lateen until, in the Medieval period, features of the northern and mediterranean rig were merged to produce the three-masted ship, which has been described as the master tool of western civilization."}

NEW copy, trade paperback.\n(Casemate, 2011).\n6x9, b&w illustrations, 264 pages.\n\nAfter every disaster, someone has something to hide . . .\n\nA few minutes before midnight on April 14, 1912, the \"unsinkable\" RMS Titanic, on her maiden voyage to New York, struck an iceberg. Less than three hours later she lay at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. While the world has remained fascinated by the tragedy, the most amazing drama of those fateful hours was not played out aboard the doomed liner. It took place on the decks of two other ships, one fifty-eight miles distant from the sinking Titanic, the other barely ten miles away. The masters of the steamships Carpathia and Californian, Captain Arthur Rostron and Captain Stanley Lord, were informed within minutes of each other that their vessels had picked up the distress signals of a sinking ship. Their actions in the hours and days that followed would become the stuff of legend, as one would choose to take his ship into dangerous waters to answer the call for help, while the other would decide that the hazard to himself and his command was too great to risk responding.\n\nAfter years of research, Daniel Allen Butler now tells this incredible story, moving from ship to ship on the icy waters of the North Atlantic\u2014in real-time\u2014to recount how hundreds of people could have been rescued, but in the end only a few outside of the meager lifeboats were saved. He then looks alike at the U.S. Senate Investigation in Washington, and ultimately the British Board of Trade Inquiry in London, where the actions of each captain are probed, questioned, and judged, until the truth of what actually happened aboard the Titanic, the Carpathia and the Californian is revealed.\n\nDaniel Allen Butler, a maritime and military historian, is the bestselling author of \"Unsinkable\": The Full Story of RMS Titanic, Distant Victory: The Battle of Jutland and the Allied Triumph in the First World War, and The First Jihad: The Battle for Khartoum and the Dawn of Militant Islam. He is an internationally recognized authority on maritime subjects and a popular guest-speaker for several cruise lines. Butler lives and works in Los Angeles, California.\n\nOn the night of 14\/15 April 1912, a brand-new, supposedly unsinkable ship, the largest vessel in the world at the time, sank on her maiden voyage after ramming an iceberg. Of the 2,223 people on board only 705 were saved. The rest either drowned or froze to death in the icy-cold waters of the North Atlantic. How could this 'unsinkable' vessel sink and how could the authorities allow her to sail with lifeboats for less than 50 per cent of those aboard.\n\nThe authors bring the tragedy to life, telling the story of the ship's design, construction and her maiden voyage, using rarely seen accounts of the sinking from passengers of all classes and crew alike. They tell the dramatic stories of lives lost and people saved, of the rescue ship Carpathia and of the aftermath of the sinking. Never again would a large passenger ship sail without lifeboats for all, nor a radio manned 24 hours per day. Despite the tragedy, the sinking of the Titanic indirectly led to many tens of thousands lives being saved due to new regulations that came into force after the tragedy.\n\nProfusely illustrated with over 300 images (50 in color), including many rare and unique views of the ship, this is as accurate a telling of the story of the White Star Line's Titanic and her sinking as you will read anywhere.\n\n$80.00\n\nThe first fully illustrated version of Archibald Gracie's memoir Titanic Survivor.

One survivor, the author Archibald Gracie, was one of the last to leave the doomed ship, aboard the last lifeboat to leave the stricken vessel. Telling the story of the ship's final days, he was meticulous in his commentary of the sinking and his book, completed just before he died in 1913, is the definitive record of the doomed liner's last few hours.\n\nProfusely illustrated with over 100 rare and little seen images of the ship and of the disaster.\n\n\u2022 Includes a wealth of family photographs and images of the Titanic, some published for the first time.\n\n'We went on the day on the boat train...

The two ships, Olympic and Titanic, were to be followed by a third sister, originally to be called Gigantic, but renamed as Britannic after the sinking of Titanic in April 1912.\n\nJanette and Campbell McCutcheon tell the story of the White Star trio using a fabulous collection of original postcards and photos of the three sisters, only one of which was ever to make a return voyage from New York.\n\nWith the loss of Titanic in 1912, work was suspended on Britannic, but she was to sink on her sixth voyage as a hospital ship, during the First World War.

{"text":"You are here\n\nTobago underwater heritage threatened\n\nFormer curator, National Museum and Art Gallery, Claire Broadbridge believes that the University of Connecticut is being handed carte blanche\u2014the Scarborough Harbour project to chart and possibly recover some of the French, Dutch seventeenth century and British nineteenth century vessels which lie under the silt of the harbour. In a letter, Broadbridge charges that \"this country is being once again sold out to foreign domination.\"\n\nShe states in the letter that \"similar projects in Sweden the WASA Flagship of the Swedish King Gustave Adolph's sunk in the harbour in 1628 and recovered in 1961; the Mary Rose of Henry VIII sunk in Southampton Harbour the recovery and conservation of which is a work in progress.\n\n\"These are of less historical significance than the French and Dutch vessels sunk in the harbour of Scarborough. Hoteliers and restaurants in Tobago should note that these have attracted tourists in tens of millions in a continuing basis while Tobago sits doing nothing for the last decade.\" Broadbridge noted that the project of locating and charting and partially recovering one of these vessels in Scarborough was completed in 1990 to 1997. \"It was directed locally.\n\nAll was charted and admiralty maps of the harbour done. Work was halted in order to plan a Caribbean Institute of Marine Archeology within the University of the West Indies Faculty for Social and Economic Research\u2014Such an institute to serve the entire Caribbean would be very prestigious for Tobago. All funds which have to be garnered for this work would be used for the lasting benefit of Tobago not for the lasting benefit for a foreign university.\n\nAlso the student and staff of this institute would serve as workers on the project.\" She stated that on assuming office, incumbent chairman of the Tobago House of Assembly Orville London chose to halt the project. He even abandoned the satellite components' of the project\u2014a historic James Park Tourism centre and a living agricultural museum in Roxborough.\n\n\"These were an integral part of the Scarborough Harbour Project 1990-2002. These components had been attached to the project in order to geographically distribute the tourist in land from the harbour.\" Facilities for conservation at the docks had been planned to be open to immediate tourist viewing, an explanatory exhibit in the cruise ship reception area was designed, artifacts prepared script and audiovisuals created, Broadbridge indicated. The excavation of one vessel was partially done and filmed.\n\nAll previous foreign consultants had been hired and paid fees by the local director of the project, she said, while the Coast Guard divers were present during dives and all funding was strictly used for the benefit of Tobago.\n\nRampersad: UNESCO concerned\n\nDr Kris Rampersad, chair of the Trinidad and Tobago National Commission for UNESCO, when contacted, confirmed that the Commission was concerned about actions that might endanger these valuable national heritage assets and the lack of understanding and awareness of the issues surrounding protection and development of the heritage assets in the waters of not just Tobago, but also Trinidad.\n\nShe said there was a threat that we may be signing away elements without being aware of it. She stated that it is not clear what the arrangement is between the University of Connecticut and the Tobago House of Assembly or any other entity but that in a meeting late last year with the THA, she expressed such concerns and received an open ear from the THA Secretary for Tourism.\n\nRampersad said, \"These are assets that are part of not just the heritage of Trinidad and Tobago but also of the global community given the historical contexts of the development of our islands and there can be some severe international relations repercussions if this is not handled properly.\n\n\"We are a long way from developing the mechanisms that will ensure that the benefits are secured for Trinidad and Tobago, among which includes training of nationals and developing the human resource capacity to take care and oversee these assets. UNESCO encourages the development of the national infrastructure.\n\nAccording to Rampersad, \"It is in our interest that our local universities take charge of this, and also in developing the kind of targeted heritage and conservation expertise we need locally for not just underwater, but heritage in general as training courses and programmes seem to lag behind the new developments in the global environment in which we now function.\"\n\nIn the case of underwater heritage, she said, \"it may also be in our best interest to develop dive and underwater museum facilities for these assets as is the current trend, rather than trying to bring up artefacts at tremendous costs of maintain them above ground.\" The heritage dive tourism industry is itself a multibillion dollar industry that attracts enthusiasts across the world and can eventually pay for itself in terms of developing the infrastructure and mechanism required.\n\nRampersad said we also need to put in place proper regulations and legislation that will protect our interests. \"It is for us to ensure that our national laws are up to speed to ward off the risk of foreign entities staking ownership claims and other like threats"}

The bulk of his father's $70 million estate went to Neily's brother, Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt I, who then helped Neily by giving him $6 million. However, as a result of his parents' attitude towards his marriage, it would be 27 years after his father's death before he finally reconciled with his aging mother.

{"text":"American Maritime Documents, 1776-1860 - Stein, Douglas L.\n\nThe 1822 edition of The Merchants and Shipmaster's Assistant described the Sea Letter as a document which \"specifies the nature of the cargo and the place of destination,\" and says that is was only required for vessels bound to the Southern Hemisphere. It further \"indicated that \"...this paper is not so necessary as the passport, because that, in most particulars, supplies its place.\" In 1859 the document was defined as part of the ship's papers when bound on a foreign voyage,\"...it is written in four languages, the French, Spanish, English, and Dutch, and is only necessary for vessels bound round Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope.\"\n\nLike the Mediterranean Passport, the Sea Letter was a remarkably standardized document, which changed little during the time that it was used. Usually printed on heavy grade paper, approximately 16\" x20\" in size, the first Sea Letters carried only three languages instead of four. However, they soon became known as \"Four Language Sea Letters.\"\n\nThe statement within the document conveys in part that the vessel described is owned entirely by American citizens, and requests that all \"Prudent Lords, Kings, Republics, Princes, Dukes, Earls, Barons, Lord, Burgomasters, Schepens, Consullors...\" etc., treat the vessel and her crew with fairness and respect. The signatures of the President of the United Stated, the Secretary of State, and the customs collector appear, usually in the middle portion of the document, The United States seal is present, while customs and consular stamps or seals are frequently in evidence.\n\nSea Letters are mentioned in the formative maritime legislation forged by the new Federal governments. Like passports, they provided additional evidence of ownership an nationality, but the criteria by which a shipmaster utilized one document over the other is not completely clear. It was explained at the time that both documents were \"rendered necessary of expedient by reason of treaties with foreign powers,\" a statement which suggests that certain nations required a particular document because of existing agreements with the United States.\n\nIn any case the Sea Letter was valid for only a single voyage, and a bond does not seem to have been required. Neither was it to be returned to the collector when the voyage was completed. Indications are that, as the years progressed, Sea Letters were being used more often by whaling ships than by merchant vessels, perhaps because American whalers fished in areas where this document was preferred as proof of national origin.\n\nBy providing a statement of American property, signed by the President of the United States, the Mediterranean Passport and the Sea Letter were intended to confirm our status as a neutral nation, when international conflict put added dangers on America's commerce at sea. By mid-century, however, much of what had previously threatened our shipping was being neutralized by the expanding power of the United States. In 1831 Congress eliminated the fee required for obtaining a Mediterranean Passport. It was argued a the time that the revenue arising from that source, and the protection which it provided, were no longer objects of any importance. As our merchant fleet became more secure, fewer shipowners and shipmasters considered these documents as necessary to guarantee their rights and safety in foreign lands.*\n\nBoth pieces were considered important parts of a ship's papers in the 1800s. They were kept aboard ship during the voyage and deposited, along with the Registry Certificate, with the appropriate U.S. consular authority anytime the vessel was in a foreign port. The Mediterranean Passport had disappeared from use by 1860, while the Sea Letter was still in evidence several years later.\n\nToday both pieces are considered to be important documents in any maritime collection. However, they are also highly valued by autograph collectors and investors, which keeps many fine pieces in private hands.\n*It is important here to note that both documents were intended only to protect the vessel from capture of destruction by providing American, - i.e., nonbelligerent - ownership. American crew members aboard these ships were still vulnerable to impressment, especially if they did not carry their own personal protection certificates as proof of citizenship."}

The divisions' combat power was also blunted by their losses, and while they both saw action againstforces, they contributed little to Japan's attempt to defend its empire.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Imperial Japanese Navy was the navy of the Empire of Japan from 1869 until 1947, when it was dissolved following Japan's constitutional renunciation of the use of force as a means of settling international disputes...\n\n-Foundation:During the Meiji Restoration, the military forces loyal to the Emperor were samurai drawn primarily from the loyalist feudal domains of Satsuma and Ch\u014dsh\u016b...\n\n(IJA) agreed to establish defensive positions along what was termed Japan's \"absolute zone of national defense\". The zone's perimeter reached from the Marianas Islands and Flores Sea covers 93,000 square miles of water in Indonesia.- Geography :The seas that border the Flores Sea are the Bali Sea , Java Sea , and the Banda Sea ....\n\ns. At this time there were few Army units in the area, and it was decided to move combat unitsto protect the air bases which formed the basis of Japan's defensive plans. The movement of these troops was delayed by shipping shortages, however. Efforts to reinforce the Marianas and Caroline islands were assigned the highest priority, and the units selected for western New Guinea remained in China until April 1944, when ships became available to transport them.\n\nAllied submarines were used extensively during the Pacific War and were a key contributor to the defeat of the Empire of Japan. During the war, submarines of the United States Navy were responsible for 55% of Japan's merchant marine losses; other Allied navies added to the toll. The war againstrelating to ship movements which was collected by intercepting and decrypting\n\nCryptanalysis\n\nCryptanalysis is the study of methods for obtaining the meaning of encrypted information, without access to the secret information that is normally required to do so.

The IJN routinely broadcast the location and intended route of convoys under its protection, and decrypting these messages allowed Allied naval commanders to alert submarines in the vicinity of convoys. The submarine commanders were free to plan their interception and attack where conditions were most favorable.\n\nAnti-submarine warfare is a branch of naval warfare that uses surface warships, aircraft, or other submarines to find, track and deter, damage or destroy enemy submarines....\n\ndoctrine also contributed to Japan's shipping losses. The Navy had placed a low priority on protecting merchant shipping from submarine attack before and during the early years of the war and convoys were not routinely assembled until 1943. The Grand Escort Headquarters was formed in late 1943 to coordinate convoys and implement a standard doctrine. The Escort-of-Convoy headquarters was also established in April 1944 to provide a pool of senior commanders who were available to command convoys, though none had any experience with convoy operations or anti-submarine warfare.\n\nAttacks on merchant shipping during February 1944 led the Japanese to change the composition of their convoys. During this month, over ten percent of the Japanese merchant marine was sunk by submarines and air attack. These losses included several transport ships carrying reinforcements to the Marianas and Carolines. In response, the Grand Escort Fleet Headquarters increased the average size of Japanese convoys from five ships to \"large\" convoys of 10-20 vessels. This change allowed the IJN to allocate more escort ships to each convoy and it was hoped that conducting fewer convoys would also reduce the number of targets available to submarines. While Japanese officers attributed a drop in sinkings during March to the changed tactics, this was actually due to the U.S. Fast Carrier Task Force was the main striking force of the United States Navy in the Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II.The Fast Carrier Task Force was known under two designations.

Seven of the transports were traveling to Manila only and the 32nd and 35th Divisions were each carried by four vessels. Allied code breakers decrypted radio signals relating to the convoy's departure and subsequent intercepts allowed radio traffic analysts follow its progress south.\n\nIntelligence from the intercepted radio signals was used to guide the submarine toward the convoy, and she made contact with it off the northwest coastTommy Dykers\u2014attempted to maneuver into a position to attack the convoy but lost contact when he was forced to evade a Japanese submarine. An aircraft sighted and attacked Jack a few minutes later, but the convoy did not change course. Dykers regained contact at midday after sighting Shiratakas heavy smoke exhaust and surfaced an hour before sunset to get into an attack position. He was forced to submerge, however, when another aircraft attacked the submarine.\n\nJack surfaced again after dark, and successfully attacked after the moon set. Dykers found that the Japanese escorts were alert, and was unable to penetrate the convoy. As a result, he attacked three times by firing a total of 19 torpedo\n\nTorpedo\n\nThe modern torpedo from long range into the mass of ships at the center of the convoy.

All 3,000 soldiers onboard drowned when the ship sank quickly. The remaining Japanese ships continued to Manila, arriving there on 29 April.\n\nManila to Halmahera\n\nThe 32nd Division's destination changed during the voyage from Shanghai to Manila. Imperial General Headquarters was concerned that the increasing difficulty of shipping units towards the front line meant that it would not be possible to complete the planned reinforcement of the \"absolute zone of national defense\" before Allied forces reached the area. As a result, it was decided to use the division to reinforce the Second Army\n\nJapanese Second Army\n\nThe was an army of the Imperial Japanese Army. It was raised and demobilized on four separate occasions.-History:The Japanese 2nd Army was initially raised during the First Sino-Japanese War from September 27, 1894 to May 14, 1895 under the command of General \u014cyama Iwao.It was revived for theNEI)\u2014which were under direct threat of attack\u2014rather than send it to Mindanao.\n\nThe Take Ichi convoy resumed its journey to New Guinea on 1 May. Its composition was now eight transports (one of the Manila-bound transports having replaced Yoshida Maru) under the protection of Shirataka, Asakaze, Shiratsuyu, minesweeper W-22, CH-37 and CH-38. The convoy took a special route planned by the Third Southern Expeditionary Fleet to reduce the risk of submarine attack.\n\nU.S. signals intelligence operators again detected the convoy's departure. On 2 May, analysts estimated its size as nine transports and seven escorts carrying 12,784 troops of the 32nd Division and an unknown number of men from the 35th Division. Decoded Japanese Army Water Transport Code messages also provided the Allies with the convoy's route, speed, daily noon positions and destination. This \"extraordinary intelligence coup\" was passed to the relevant commands on 2 May and the USN positioned submarines to ambush the Japanese ships.\n\nThe Take Ichi convoy suffered a devastating submarine attack on 6 May. On that day, intercepted the Japanese ships in the Celebes Sea\n\nCelebes Sea\n\nThe Celebes Sea of the western Pacific Ocean is bordered on the north by the Sulu Archipelago and Sulu Sea and Mindanao Island of the Philippines, on the east by the Sangihe Islands chain, on the south by Sulawesi, and on the west by Kalimantan in Indonesia Gurnards captain\u2014Commander Herb Andrews\u2014submerged his boat and made a cautious approach to avoid detection by aircraft. He reached a firing position four hours later and fired six torpedoes at two transports. Only one of these torpedoes struck its mark, and a second salvo missed its intended targets but hit another transport. Andrews then turned his boat and fired further torpedoes from Gurnards stern which hit a third transport. One of the Japanese destroyers counterattacked Gurnard and forced Andrews to break off his attack. The destroyer was traveling at too great a speed for its detection gear to function, however, and did not damage the submarine, despite dropping approximately 100A periscope is an instrument for observation from a concealed position.

That night, the submarine torpedoed one of the crippled transports which was still afloat. Gurnards attack sank transports Aden Maru (5,825 tons) and Taijima Maru (6,995 tons) as well as the cargo ship Tenshinzan Marau (6,886 tons). While the rescue effort was relatively successful, 1,290 troops were killed and much of their equipment was lost.\n\nDue to its heavy losses, the Take Ichi convoy was ordered to dock at Halmahera in the eastern NEI rather than continue to New Guinea. The surviving ships arrived there on 9 May. Both divisions and their equipment were unloaded and the convoy sailed for Manila on 13 May, arriving on 20 May without further loss.\n\nAftermath\n\nThe attacks on the Take Ichi convoy blunted the 32nd and 35th Divisions' fighting power. The 32nd Division's combat elements were reduced from nine to five infantry battalion\n\nBattalion\n\nA battalion is a military unit of around 300\u20131,200 soldiers usually consisting of between two and seven companies and typically commanded by either a Lieutenant Colonel or a Colonelattalions. Only four of the six 35th Division infantry battalions which sailed in the convoy reached Halmahera and much of the division's artillery was lost.\n\nThe destruction of the Take Ichi convoy also forced the Japanese leadership to acknowledge that it was no longer possible to reinforce or defend most of western New Guinea. While the Second Area Army\n\nJapanese Second Area Army\n\nThe was a field army of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II.-History:The Japanese 2nd Area Army was formed on July 4, 1942 under the control of the Kwangtung Army as a reserve and garrison force to maintain security and public order in ManchukuoKorechika Anami requested that the surviving ships attempt to carry the 35th Division to New Guinea, this was rejected by Imperial General Headquarters. The losses inflicted on the convoy also contributed to the Imperial General Headquarters' decision to move the perimeter of the \"absolute zone of national defense\" back to a line extending from Sorong to Halmahera. This represented a 600 mi (965.6 km) strategic withdrawal from the perimeter which had been planned in March.\n\nJapanese naval staff officers gathered in Manila in June to analyze the Take Ichi convoy. The officers believed that Japan's communication codes were secure and discussed alternative explanations for the convoy's detection. These explanations included the increase in radio signals at the time the convoy sailed being detected by Allied radio traffic analysts, a Japanese officer in Manila accidentally divulging information and Allied spies working on the Manila waterfront radioing messages about the convoy's composition and departure. The meeting concluded that Allied spies were responsible for the convoy's detection, and the Japanese military's codes were not changed.\n\nSome of the surviving elements of the 32nd and 35th divisions later saw action against American forces. The 35th Division was moved forward from Halmahera to Sorong in small ships during May. The regiment which had been sent to the Palaus in April was also successfully transferred to New Guinea. Elements of the 35th Division subsequently fought in the Battles of Biak\n\nBattle of Biak\n\nThe Battle of Biak was part of the New Guinea campaign of World War II.

{"text":"Size of fleets\n\nFrom Davos chapter it seems that there is plenty of those in white harbor. white harbor population is probably much much larger than it was in the beginning of the books, with Winter setting in the North and all the war refuges.(similarly to the population boos in KL, during the war).\n\nI know I know, I am a great proponent of the 6-10 million population theory myself.\n\nBut we're talking about White Harbour itself, since you can't take tenants off their fields to make a fleet. Rowers traditionally hail from the poor and landless, who aren't required anywhere else - usually a class found in cities.\n\nWhite Harbor is as big as London was in the Middle Ages - or even bigger, given that London had a population of about 40,000 and White Harbor could have 50,000 plus.\n\nPlus Manderly says he has a dozen petty lords and a hundred landed knights as his vassals. His lands are bigger than the entire England.\n\nI think 50 ships are very easily achievable.\n\nAnd this is without the mandate from the King in the North, which would give him access to things like lumber from the Umber and Karstark lands, with other lords tasked to ship it down the White Knife to White Harbor, and maybe even supply excess men to man the ships.\n\nManderly on his own could probably very easily build 50 ships. Manderly with the entire North's support, well, then we would be talking hundreds of ships, should the King in the North so choose.\n\nThe problem is that other than the Iron fleet, Royal fleet and the Redwyne fleet no one has more than the 20-30 ships and while theoretically Manderly can build as many ships as he want, such effort cannot be kept secret and not bring notice from the Iron throne and\/or Boltons\/Frey, who as you recall was watching Manderly like hawks. It would surely bring questions as to why The North which went without a fleet for so long, suddenly need to build one of the biggest fleets, when the North is at war and there is no threat by sea and Winter is coming...\n\nSo I am still in favor of the theory that part of those ships are of his banner men or that they are not all 3 masted war galleys but much smaller version they could scrub.\n\nI don't really see the issue -- Manderly clearly did build all those ships without it being known? Though I expect Varys does know, just never reported it.\n\nIt's entirely possible some of the ships belong to bannermen, but I think the main idea is that most of these ships have been built in the firth with Manderly silver and White Harbor shipwrights, and are part of Manderly's specific building work.\n\nThe boats made in White Harbor include river runners which are \"built tough to brave the swift currents and rocky shoots of the White Knife.\" Warships with a river runner design could be useful in navigating the waters around Skagos.\n\nThis is possible, though I dont think that there are \"Warships with a river runner design\". \"river runner design\" is about maneuverability i.e. smaller boats, with shallow draft. The Ironborn have hundreds of those, though they cant withstand a sea battle against a \"proper\" Warships.\n\nThe North has the biggest coastline of all Seven Kingdoms. In the past they have suffered from Pirate raids from the Sisters, Slaver raids from the Stepstones, wars with the Arryns that included invasions of the White Harbor area by the Arryn forces, wildling raids across the Bay of Seals, not to mention generall piracy in the Narrow Sea, and of course seemningly never ending Ironborn threats in the Sunset Sea.\n\nClearly the North has every justification for maintaining a war fleet, and a sizeable one at that. And in fact, they always had such a fleet - until Brandon the Burner burned all their ships sometime prior to Aegon's conquest.\n\nAs Manderly said when he proposed the construction of the fleet to Robb, they are merely restoring the North's sea power to it's rightful state.\n\n50 ships should be a rather low number to protect such a vast coastline.\n\nIn times of war this could probably easily rise to 100 ships or more, only to go back to a standing fleet of about 50 ships in peacetimeI simply totally disagree with you.\n\nI think all of those ships were built in the last 2 years, and I think it is a feat that is very easily achievable for the richest lord in the North, ruling a city of 50,000 people, with maybe as many more refugees streaming in over the last few months to bolster his manpower.\n\nManderly tells Davos in Dance that his vaults are full of silver - and this is AFTER he has built his 50 ships.\n\nYou say it suspends your disbelief, but I think your disbelief is unreasonable.\n\nBraavos can build 365 ships in a year. Manderly built 50 in a year and a half. Not unreasonable in the slightest.\n\nYour reference to the Lannisters 30 ships is irrelevent. Tywin could build 200 ships if he wanted to. But he didn't have to, because he is part of the Seven Kingdoms, and can call on the Royal Fleet's protection should enemies - which are essentially limited to the Iron Born - threaten his small western coastline.\n\nThe North, in contrast, had just declared themselves independent from the Iron Throne, and thus would have to rely on their own ships for such protection.\n\nEntirely logical that they would wish to construct a substantial fleet as soon as possible. highFree Northman, on 05 May 2012 - 03:18 AM, said:\n\nThe North, in contrast, had just declared themselves independent from the Iron Throne, and thus would have to rely on their own ships for such protection highWho is the ''he'' you are referring to? Davos?\n\nWhy does Manderly want a war fleet? Because it's a time of war.\n\nIs it the fact that he was able to build the ships that you have a problem with, or the fact that he kept it a secret? If the latter, there's a difference between trying to keep it a secret and actually succeeding. Who's to say that word hasn't gotten out? I think the best Manderly can hope for is to hide the extent of his shipbuilding activities.

Clearly, Wyman Manderly has decided it's reasonable to sink vast resources into the fleet.\n\nThe fact that half the fleet is secret doesn't really seem like a problem. The Boltons would seem likeliest to learn about it, with no Varys's in the south, but I dare say that the Boltons aren't known for their spy network nor are they so loved in White Harbor as to have turn cloaks flocking to them. Especially since the question of a fleet desn't really affect them directly. The Manderly fleet is squarely aimed against threats from the south.\n\nIts a fact that Davos think that there are about 50 ships in there, we dont knowSo why they are hidden inside and not patrolling the sea? also as I said before its the timing, you dont go from 0 to 100...\n\nThe Boltons are Wardens of the North in name only. Much like Littlefinger is the Lord of Harenhal.\n\nI dare say Roose Bolton's position is so weak that he is probably just happy that Manderly is on speaking terms with him, nevermind having inspectors checking out Manderly's fleet size and treasury accounts.\n\nManderly is the most powerful lord in the North and he can do what he wants in his own city. The Boltons were in no position to query it, and after the events of Dance are in no position to even set foot outside of Winterfell.Yeah, when was this going to happen?\n\nWhile Roose was in the South, busy slaughtering Northmen at the Red Wedding?\n\nOr while he was stuck south of Moat Cailin, waiting for the Ironmen to be cleared from Moat Cailin?\n\nOr how about after that, while they were desperately trying to rush a wedding between Ramsay and the fake Arya, to try and legitimize their claim to the North?\n\nOr after that, when they were stuck in Winterfell, with Stannis advancing on them?\n\nRoose hasn't even been back to the Dreadfort since he marched south with Robb. And Ramsay is just a slobbering beast, with zero managerial or political skills.\n\nThe first Roose saw of the Manderlys was when they arrived at Winterfell for the wedding to the fake Arya. Before that Manderly was still holding out and publicly supporting the Starks, waiting for his son to be returned to him.\n\nRoose could only confirm his overlordship over Manderly after Manderly graced him with his presence at the wedding.\n\nAnd since then, they've all been stuck behind the walls of Winterfell, waiting for Stannis to come and kill them.\n\nRoose's alliance is so desperate - with nominal control over a junior branch of the Umbers, a forced takeover of the Hornwood lands, and the enigmatic - possibly feigned - support of the powerful Lady Dustin from Barrowton, that he has to pray that Manderly doesn't oppose him.\n\nActually questioning Manderly on what he has been doing for the last two years? Heck, he doesn't have the political clout to even think of doing that.\n\nI see your point, though I disagree, if it was me, this would be the first thing I would do. I hear there is a thing such as ravens to coordinate such thins and Bolton is cunning, calculating, meticulous and fully aware of the love and the loyalty the North bears to the starks...\n\nAnyway, the point was not about Bolton, it was about the supposed size and strength of the fleet. I still think that your estimate is a wild exaggeration and would only come to past if GRRM really want to introduce \"another player\" to make thing more interesting in the Winds of Winter.\n\nI see your point, though I disagree, if it was me, this would be the first thing I would do, I hear there is a thing such as ravens to coordinate such thins and Bolton is cunning, calculating and meticulous and he fully aware of the love and the loyalty the North bears to the starks.\n\nAnyway, the point was not about Bolton, it was about the supposed size and strength of the fleet, I still think that your estimate is a wild exaggeration and would only come to past if GRRM really want to introduce \"another player\" to make thing more interesting in the Winds of Winter.\n\nMy point is only that Manderly only ''officially'' accepted the Lannisters' Warden of the North after his son was returned to him. And that only happened AFTER he \"beheaded'' Davos and mounted his head on White Harbor's walls.\n\nAnd this only happened in the last Davos chapter in Dance.\n\nSo up until Manderly arriving at Winterfell for the wedding, he was completely legitimately still carrying out Robb Stark's orders, whice were to build a new warfleet for the North.\n\nThe secrecy only related to him probably trying to hide the full extent of the new fleet's size. Which could be done by removing one ship at a time from the Harbor at night and sailing it up the White Knife, only to be replaced by a new ship arriving from the shipyards.\n\nOr alternatively sailing a few ships off on some \"patroll'' only for one to be replaced by a newly constructed one on its return, while the one it replaces is sent up the White Knife instead.\n\nIn this way, there would always be more or less 23 ships in the Harbor, with the growing number of additional ones being hidden in various sheltered tributaries of the White Knife, wihc his over a thousand miles long.\n\nIt is obvious that Manderly could not hide the activity at his shipyards - there must be hundreds of laborers involved - or the fact that he was building some sort of warfleet.\n\nBut what he could do, was make the fleet look much smaller than it actually is.\n\nNo one could begrudge the lord of one of Westeros's 5 major ports from maintaining 20 odd ships to protect his coasts - especially in a time of War. They just won't know that the fleet is in truth double that size.\n\nBTW, I believe Davos counts 23 ships exactly, not 50. Manderly later informs him he has as many more hidden further up the Firth. So, approximately 50, but it seems likely many of these have been moved to a secret location.\n\nThat said, it's not as if he has hidden his shipbuilding efforts. Everyone knows. They just don't know how many, exactly.\n\nMatters are complicated by the likely nature of those ships. The Royal Navy appears to be largely made up of multi-banked rowing galleys, which are by their nature purpose-built warships but not suited to sailing in northern waters. In our world galleys worked well in the Meditarranean and to a rather lesser extent in the Baltic, but fared badly in the Atlantic and North Sea. Warships there tended to be cogs fitted with fighting castle and the idea (as with Viking longships) was not to sink the enemy by ramming, but douse them with arrows and then board. This could be done on a ship to ship basis or if the sea was calm enough, by lashing several ships together into large rafts to concentrate both archers and men at arms.\n\nNow the point of this is two-fold. First because they have neither rams nor cannon, they don't need to be purpose built. Its obviously good to a have a core of big ones manned as warships, but this core can rapidly be expanded with STUFTs (ships taken up from trade). Thus Manderley can have relatively few warships built and sitting quietly at anchor, but they don't properly represent the fleet which he can actually float when the time comes."}

{"text":"The Upper Peninsula's Nautical Past\n\nLake Superior, the vast freshwater lake that spreads north of the Upper Peninsula's[1] northern border, has for centuries served as a major transportation route for Native Americans, explorers, tourists, and various industries. Several historic lighthouses dot the coastline, some of which still provide navigational assistance to passing vessels. Despite the presence of such aids, however, shallow reefs and violent storms have led to hundreds of shipwrecks in Lake Superior over the years. Today, numerous maritime museums and underwater preserves reveal this fascinating shipping heritage. Visitors can hit the highlights in a five-day tour of the U.P.'s northern shore.\n\nDay One\n\nFrom the Mackinac Bridge[2], head north on I-75 to Sault Ste. Marie[3], Michigan's oldest city, where you can watch ships passing through the incredible Soo Locks[4] or opt for an up-close view aboard a Soo Locks Boat Tour, which offers a two-hour trip through the American and Canadian locks and along each nation's shore. After lunch, spend the afternoon at the intriguing Museum Ship Valley Camp[5], which contains over 100 exhibits, including two lifeboats from the stricken Edmund Fitzgerald and four aquariums filled with various fish from the Great Lakes region. Head a few blocks east to the River of History Museum[5], which chronicles the history of those who explored and helped to tame the St. Mary's River. Stay overnight in Sault Ste. Marie[3], perhaps at the quaint Longships Motel[6].\n\nDay Two\n\nFollowing breakfast, drive west along the shore of Whitefish Bay. Stop in Bay Mills, where the 1871 Point Iroquois Light Station[7], now a maritime museum, invites visitors to tour a restored light keeper's home and climb the tower for a pleasant view of the river and bay. Next, visit the 1849 Whitefish Point Light Station[8], the oldest operating lighthouse on Lake Superior and now part of a complex that includes the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum[9], which chronicles several tragic shipwrecks, including the Edmund Fitzgerald. Experienced divers might want to take a detour and explore the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve[10], a fascinating area that encompasses 18 excellently preserved shipwrecks in the cold, clear, deep waters of Lake Superior. Afterward, you can stay in a nearby campground or roadside motel.\n\nDay Three\n\nIn the morning, consider joining a guided tour of the 1874 Au Sable Light Station[11] on the eastern end of Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore[12]. Alternately, you can take a narrated glass bottom boat tour of Alger Underwater Preserve[13], which protects a handful of intact shipwrecks near Grand Island[14]. After your boat trip, head farther west along the Lake Superior Shore[15] and spend the afternoon in the historic port of Marquette[16]. The Marquette Maritime Museum[17] is a particularly intriguing attraction, housing an interactive pilot house, several exhibits about shipwrecks, Native Americans, and the U.S. Coast Guard, and an impressive collection of lighthouse lenses; the museum also offers informative tours of the 1866 Marquette Harbor Lighthouse. After dinner, consider staying at the lovely 1896 Big Bay Point Lighthouse Bed and Breakfast[18], one of the nation's few lighthouse inns; hopefully, you've reserved a room well in advance.\n\nDay Four\n\nAfter breakfast, take a leisurely four-hour drive via Country Road-550 and U.S. 41 to the tip of the Keweenaw Peninsula[19]. Here, you can join a narrated round-trip cruise through Copper Harbor's formerly bustling port, to the 1866 Copper Harbor Lighthouse[20], where a host will guide visitors through the historic complex, which includes shipwreck artifacts, a small maritime museum, and incredible lake views. Those seeking a challenge can opt instead for exploring the Keweenaw Underwater Preserve[21], a 103-square-mile area containing at least nine shipwrecks, including the oldest known one in Lake Superior.\n\nFrom Copper Harbor, head south to Eagle Harbor, where the fog signal building beside the 1871 Eagle Harbor Light[22] now serves as a maritime history museum. Exhibits feature the area's past shipwrecks, the United States Lighthouse Service, and the perils facing long-ago lighthouse keepers. As the day winds down, stop for dinner in one of the peninsula's several family-friendly restaurants and head south to Ahmeek, where you can stay overnight in the romantic Sand Hills Lighthouse Inn[23], constructed in 1919 and now serving as a Victorian-style bed-and-breakfast. Reservations might be necessary here, too.\n\nDay Five\n\nTrue history buffs should rise early, head south to Houghton[24], and take the morning boat ride to Isle Royale National Park[25]. Here, you'll encounter a number of historic maritime sites, including the Edisen Fishery[26] and the 1855 Rock Harbor Lighthouse[26], now a museum operated by the National Park Service. Stay overnight in the waterfront Rock Harbor Lodge[27], then return to the mainland via the six-hour Ranger III boat ride the next morning."}
{"text":"Have you ever been on a cruise? I have.If you have, you may have noticed there's a difference between ships of different classes.\n\nBruce is all about studying ships, especially cruise ships. He knows the length and breadth and number of passengers for each one!\n\nI'm sure you're wondering why that might be of interest to him. It's because he dreams of going on a cruise. I should rephrase that. He dreams of going on another cruise. When we've finished booking one, he's lobbying for the next.\n\nI'm not so quick to jump on the ship. (1) I have genealogy work to do (remember those ancestors that keep bugging me?) and it's really hard to do it on a cruise ship. (2) I get seasick, really seasick. We've been able to determine that the bigger the ship (and more modern), the less seasick I get because the newer, bigger ships have big stabilizers which are like giant wings under the water that spread out to keep the ship steady. I kid you not!\n\nSo, I won't get on a cruise ship unless it's at least 900 feet long, preferably 1000 feet. We also get an inside cabin in the middle of the ship so there's less rock forward and back, and side to side. It is cheaper than an outside cabin, so we save money there. Some people hate inside cabins because they need a window looking out. With a window what you see is a lot of water. It's really pretty, but for the increased price I can go up on deck to see it and save money for something else.\n\nOne downside of an inside cabin is that I do need light to wake me up. Without a window our room would stay dark all day and I'd sleep through the whole day. So, we found a solution: At night before we go to bed we turn on our cabin television and put it on the channel with the ship's bow camera (it beams to our TV the things you can see from the bow of the ship), and mute the sound, then as daylight dawns, our cabin lights up as well.\n\nWhy am I telling you all this? Because you really should study the ship on which your ancestor sailed. It makes for great detail, that flesh on the bones stuff we talked about in an earlier post. If you have the number of passengers, the size of the ship, you can determine if your ancestor was crammed in like sardines or had room enough to move around and breathe some fresh air.\n\nThere are some websites that have a collection of ship descriptions, some with images! Here's a few:\n\nAfter this blog posted, Sue McCormick added another site: The Ships List. Sue remarked that \"the Several dedicated people will do lookups for specific ships and specific voyages.\"\n\nIf all else fails, try Googling the name of the ship and see what comes up!\n\nNow that you've spent all this time learning about your ancestor's ship, maybe you can lobby for a cruise so you can \"experience\" some of what your ancestor went through. Just bring along some Meclizine if you have a queasy stomach!\n\n2 Responses to \"Shipshape: The Difference Between Ships\"\n\nI would like to add an additional site which is full of ship information: The\n\nSeveral dedicated people will do lookups for specific ships and specific voyages."}
{"text":"Chung-mu\n\nChung Mu is the given name of great Admiral Yi Sun-Sin who was in charge of naval operations during the Joseon Dynasty. He was given the posthumous title, Lord of Loyalty and Chivalry (Chungmu-gong, \ucda9\ubb34\uacf5; \u5fe0\u6b66\u516c).\n\nBorn in 1545, Yi Sun-Sin was considered a master naval tactician and was largely responsible for the defeat of the Japanese in 1592 and 1598. He has been compared to Sir Francis Drake and Lord Nelson of England. His name is held in such high esteem that when the Japanese fleet defeated the Russian navy in 1905, the Japanese admiral was quoted as saying, \"You may wish to compare me with Lord Nelson but do not compare me with Korea's Admiral Yi Sun-Sin.... He is too remarkable for anyone.\"\n\nYi Sun-Sin's most famous invention was the Kobukson, or turtle-boat, a galley ship decked over with iron plates to protect the soldiers and rowing seamen. It was so named because the curvature of the iron plates covering the top decks resembled a turtle's shell. The ship was 110 feet long and 28 feet wide with a lower deck for cabins and supplies, a middle deck for oarsmen, and an upper deck for marines and cannons. Most of the timber was four inches thick, giving the ship protection from arrows and musket balls. It had a large iron ram in the shape of a turtle's head with an open mouth from which smoke, arrows, and missiles were discharged. Another such opening in the rear and six more on either side were for the same purpose. The armored shell was fitted with iron spikes and knives that were covered over with straw or grass to impale unwanted boarders."}

{"text":"The Associated Press\n\nSince an engine-room fire left the Carnival Triumph powerless in the Gulf of Mexico four days ago, Carnival Cruise Lines officials have been faced with a barrage of questions about the ship and their strategy to safely return passengers to shore.\n\nBelow is a list of questions and answers.\n\nQ: Why did Carnival decide to use the ship when it recently had other mechanical problems, including an electrical problem with the ship's alternator on a previous voyage?\n\nA: Carnival spokesman Vance Gulliksen said repairs on the ship were completed successfully on Feb. 2 and that there was no connection between the alternator's problems and Sunday's engine fire. The National Transportation Safety Board has opened an investigation.\n\nQ: Why did Carnival decide to tow the ship back to Mobile, Ala., instead of to Progreso, Mexico, which was the original plan?\n\nA: In a statement issued earlier this week, Carnival said the original plan was to tow the ship to Progreso because it was the closest port to the ship's location. But by the time tugboats arrived at the ship Monday evening, it had drifted about 90 miles north due to strong currents, putting the ship nearly equidistant to Mobile.\n\nCarnival officials decided to continue north with the currents, instead of trying to tow the ship against them, the statement said. Even if the ship had continued toward Progreso, it would not have arrived until Thursday, which is when it was arriving in Mobile.\n\nDisembarking the ship in Mobile is also simpler for the 900 guests onboard traveling without passports, the statement said.\n\nGulliksen said costs were not a factor in the decisions made about where to take the ship.\n\nQ: Why is Carnival putting cruise ship passengers on buses to Texas and Louisiana when they arrive in Mobile? Why not put them up in hotel rooms in the city and let them rest overnight? Why not fly them out of Mobile instead of busing them?\n\nA: Carnival Vice President Terry Thornton told a news conference Thursday that the New Orleans airport was better suited than Mobile to handle the large number of charter flights that will be required on Friday. He didn't go into details on the numbers, but the company previously said it needed 100 buses to take people to New Orleans from Mobile.\n\n\"It was not logistically possible for us to do the air charter service from Mobile,\" Thornton said.\n\nHe did not elaborate and Carnival spokeswoman Joyce Oliva in Miami could not immediately provide additional details.\n\nQ: Passengers' relatives have complained that Carnival has not been keeping them adequately informed. Why?\n\nA: Gulliksen said the company has tried to keep families updated and established a toll-free number for friends and relatives.\n\nThornton said Carnival officials have provided various telephone helplines for passengers' relatives. He said officials at the company's Miami office had fielded more than 7,000 calls from family and friends.\n\nThornton added that 200 Carnival employees are in Mobile waiting to assist the relatives and that some will board the ship to assist after it docks.\n\nQ: Why has Carnival not done more to explain decisions that so many have questioned?\n\nA: Several crisis-management executives who spoke to The Associated Press said Carnival is being deliberately low-key because there is no ongoing safety threat to its other cruise ships - and because past experience has shown that these incidents don't seem to stop people from taking cruises.\n\n\"I think their PR is low-key because it's appropriate, it's worked in the past and incidents like this have not affected their business,\" said Bruce Rubin, a public relations executive in Miami. \"''I think it could cause some short-term bottom line issues because they are going to take the ship out of service.

{"text":"In 1789 a major sea tragedy occurred which\nled directly to the establishment of a Lifeboat service in Britain. The ship, the\nAdventure, run ashore on the River Tyne in a storm. Thousands of onlookers watched in\nhelpless horror as all the crew drowned, as to go out in that weather would mean\ncertain death. This spurred the members of a social club in South Shields, The Gentlemen\nof the Lawe House, to offer a two guinea reward for the best Lifeboat design. The\ninstigated the construction of The Original, the first Lifeboat built for the job, and not\na conversion. It was built by Henry Greathead, using a design of Greathead`s and local\nparish clerk, William Wouldhave. This 30 foot long boat with 12 oars and carrying 7 cwt of\ncork for buoyancy, served for 40 years on the Tyne, and several others were built for\nvarious places in Britain. However they all operated independently until a member of the\nLifeboat crew on the Isle of Man, Sir William Hillary wrote an appeal to the\nnation in 1823. He recognized the disorganisation and consequent gaps in Lifeboat cover\nand his appeal invoked widespread sympathy for victims of shipwreck, and gained a lot of\nsupport. Thomas Wilson M.P. took up the cause and at a meeting in The City of London\nTavern, on March 4th 1824 the National Institution for the Preservation of life from\nshipwreck was formed (Flag Day) with Thomas Wilson M.P. as chairman, King George 4th as\nPatron and the Prime Minister as President.\n\nIn 1838 it was Grace Darling, the\nworld's greatest lifeboat heroine, whose fame is due to a single act of courage\non 7th September 1838 when she was just 23 years old. The previous night, in\nawful conditions, the SS Forsfarshire had run aground on the Farne Islands where\nGrace's father was the lighthouse keeper.\n\nIn the morning they saw 9\nsurvivors clinging to the rocks and bravely rowed out in the stormy seas\nto save them. The story hit the national newspapers and, to her great\ndistress, Grace became one of the first ever media celebrities of\nVictorian England. She was thought to be the epitome of an ideal girl\n\"pious and pure, modest and yet so brave\". Countless books and\nmagazine articles were written about her, not to mention numerous poems\nand paintings being created in her honour. Boat trips were organised to\nthe Longstone lighthouse for people just to get a glimpse of her.\n\nSadly, Grace was a lot less stronger than\nher reputation. She died of tuberculosis only three years later and was\nburied at her native Bamburgh church. A little museum in the village\nstill displays the original \"cobble\" in which she rowed out\nwith her father to rescue. It is the care of the RNLI.\n\nA monument in the churchyard at Bamburgh was\npurposefully designed to be seen by any passing ship.\n\nIn 1854 the organisation changed its name to\nthe Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI).\n\nThe first lifeboat in Clacton\n\nThe Royal National Lifeboat Institution first placed a lifeboat at\nClacton on Sea in 1878.\nThe boat , donated by the Freemasons of England, was transported free of charge by the\nGreat Eastern Railway to Weeley, the nearest station to Clacton at the time, and from\nthere by\nhorse and cart to the town where a boathouse had been specially constructed at Anglefield.\n(see below)\n\nThe naming ceremony took place on the 10th July 1878 to a alleged crowd of 12,000\nat a time when the population of the new town was only a few hundred.\n\nAn artist's impression of the ceremonial\nlaunching of Clacton's first lifeboat in July 1878. The occasion attracted thousands of\nspectators, and was long remembered afterwards. There were frequent wrecks on the offshore\nsands and the coastguards had previously maintained a rescue boat. This new vessel was a\ngift of the Freemasons to the RNLI and was named Albert Edward after their Grand\nMaster, the Prince of Wales.\n\nMiss Wool, a daughter of the Clacton's first Lifeboat Committee Chairman, named the\nLifeboat \"Albert Edward\" in honour of the then Prince of Wales, later to become\nKing Edward VII.\nThe Prince maintained a personal interest in the boat and at the branches Annual Dinner,\nheld at the Royal Hotel in 1883, presented a joint of beef to the crew.\nIn those early days when called on service, the \"Albert Edward\"\nrequired pulling along\nMarine Parade East and down Pier Gap before being launched into the North Sea.\nIt took six horses to achieve this, the same horses that were used to mobilise Clacton's\nFire Engine, and it was not long before the animals learnt to tell the difference between\nthe\nsound of the fire bells and the rockets. On hearing the sound of one they would set forth\nin the\nright direction unaided.\n\nSuch was the local interest, and to enable\npreparation for the return of the lifeboat, a rocket would be fired as the Albert Edward\ncame into view. The crew hoisted a flag from her topmast to indicate that there were ship\nwrecked souls on board as there was no better way of relaying information in those days.\n\nJust as today, the RNLI provided every\npossible method of procuring a rescue at sea but one Clacton Lifeboatman proved to be\nbetter equipped with something the Institution could not provide. When on service to a\nsteam trawler from Boulogne in 1881, one of the French crew slipped as he was being\ntransferred from the stricken vessel and would surely have perished in the wild sea save\nfor grabbing hold of a Lifeboatman`s beard and clinging desperately until being brought\ninto the safety of the boat.\n\nThe Lifeboat station atAnglefield\nClacton on Sea\n\nThe old boathouse as it is today\n\nBuilt on the corner of Church Road and Caernarvon\nRoad, by A.&E.F.

Many of the leading fishing vessels\nthat plied the waters of the Atlantic and Pacific\nOceans throughout America's early maritime\nhistory called Provincetown home. Her skippers\nwere well known for their skill and seamanship.\nAt the height of the commercial fishing in the\n19th century, Provincetown harbored as many as\n100, 90-ton Schooners and 700 vessels. The port\nof Provincetown was also\nresponsible for three times the catch of any other\nfishing port in New England.\n\nThe\nfirst Great Provincetown Schooner\nRace was held in 2002. Provincetown\nresident Captain John Bennett had been racing\nhis Schooner Hindu in the Gloucester\nSchooner Festival and was inspired\nto organize a schooner gathering in his\nhomeport. Although Captain Bennett did not\nlive to see his dream come to fruition,\nsupported by the Provincetown community,\nthe committee that he had formed hosted\nthe inaugural regatta that September in\nhis honor. All who participated in this\neffort were inspired by Captain Bennett's\npassion for sailing, his love of historic\nSchooners and his philosophy that good fellowship\nand good times are an important part of\neveryone's life.\n\nThe\nfirst event was such a success that its organizers\nwere urged to carry on the tradition and further,\nto expand the event to other vessels, both historic\nand modern.

{"text":"The stories behind our listings, news of exhibitions and some heraldic tales\n\nThe British and the very first Gulf War\n\nPiracy is not a new problem, of course, and sadly it has become a tragically topical one in the Indian Ocean today, but a magnificent silver gilt cup listed for sale at myfamilysilver.com recalls a little known chapter in British Imperial history when a task force was dispatched to eliminate attacks on East India Company merchant shipping in the Persian Gulf. Specifically, the expedition was aimed at the powerful Qasimi (essentially a conglomerate of local tribesmen, fishermen and seafarers) whose vessels had harried British ships in the Gulf for years. A previous British expedition in 1809-10 against Ras al-Khaima, the seat of Qasimi power on the Arabian coast to the east of the Persian Gulf, had subdued but not eliminated the threat. (Today Ras al-Khaima is the principal city of the emirate of Ras al-Khaimah bordering Oman in the United Arab Emirates. )\n\nThe expeditionary force left Bombay for the Gulf on 3 November 1819 and consisted of three Royal Navy ships, six East India Company cruisers (including Glenelg) and 18 transports carrying about 3000 British and native troops, including the soldiers of the 65th Regiment as commemorated on the cup. In addition, the force was bolstered by boats and troops volunteered by allies to the British in the Gulf, principally Shaikh Sayyid Sa'id of Muscat who saw a means of extending his influence in the region.\n\nOn 4 December the British launched a heavy bombardment on Ras al-Khaima which fell 4 days later with heavy casualties to the civilian population. After garrisoning the city, the British turned their attention to extinguishing any remaining Qasimi resistance along the coast, at a high human cost. British casualties totalled no more than a dozen or so soldiers killed in the entire campaign whereas an estimated 1000 local tribesmen were killed. In addition, the British destroyed approximately 200 small native vessels, ending the potential for further harassment at sea but also decimating the local fishing industry for years to come.\n\nBy February 1820, with the mission accomplished, the British force withdrew but not before razing Ras al-Khaima to the ground. The British commander, Major General Keir, negotiated a General Treaty with the ruling Shaikhs, defining future maritime behaviour in the gulf region. Piracy and seizure of slaves were strictly outlawed and a system of flags and passes was introduced to regulate shipping. On this basis, the British continued to trade in the gulf region though critics point out that the Treaty marked an unacceptable \"grab for power\" by the British in the region using Qasimi \"piracy\" as an excuse, the unhappy consequences of which remain to this day."}

{"text":"Cruise History: The sinking of the actual RMS Titanic and the fictitious sinking of the Titan. Was it coincidence?\n\nArt doesn't just imitate life \u2014 sometimes it anticipates it. Fourteen years before the RMS Titanic was built, the American Morgan Robertson wrote a novel called Futility or The Wreck of the Titan (1898) that prefigured the real ship's destiny with remarkable precision.\n\nThe Titanic and the Titan were both triple-screwed British passenger liners with a capacity of 3,000 and a top speed of 24 knots.\n\nBoth were deemed unsinkable; both carried too few lifeboats.\n\nAnd both sank in April in the North Atlantic after colliding with an iceberg on the forward starboard side.\n\nFutility, 1898 Edition About the Titan\n\nMorgan Robertson's novel described the ship's loss. It struck an iceberg and went down in April.\n\nThe Titanic struck an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. on April 14, 1912 and sank a little over two hours later at 2.20 a.m. on April 15, 1912. The novel was republished, after the Titanic sank, with the title Futility and the Wreck of the Titan. Some of the Titan's statistics were changed.\n\nJohn Rowland, Futility's hero, is a disgraced former Royal Navy lieutenant, who's a drunkard. After being dismissed from the Navy, he's a deckhand on the Titan. Then ship hits an iceberg and sinks. There aren't enough lifeboats. He saves a former lover's daughter by jumping onto the iceberg with her. Rowland finds a lifeboat washed up on the iceberg and they're rescued by a passing ship.\n\nCruise line history looks at the Post Office aboard the Titanic. A little known part of the Titanic story.\n\nOn April 9th, 1912 the RMS Titanic struck an iceberg in the Atlantic Ocean and sunk less than three hours later, killing more than 1,500 people. Amongst the dead were five postal workers, British citizens James Williamson and Jago Smith and US citizens William Gwinn, John March and Oscar Woody.\n\nThe doomed postal workers on the RMS Titanic.\n\nRMS stands for Royal Mail Ship, indicating that the Titanic was contracted to carry mail. The Titanic had a Post Office and Mail Room deep in the ship on decks F and G, the blue prints of which are held by the BPMA. The five postal workers were tasked with sorting much of the mail which had been brought on board the ship, 3,364 bags in total, as well as dealing with any letters which were posted on the ship by passengers and crew. [Read more...]\n\nCruise Ship History: Battle continues on fate of relics from doomed ship RMS Titanic. The tragic story of the famous liner just gets more tragic.\n\nThe Titanic was one of the largest passenger ships at its time in 1912. It was captained by Edward John Smith. It left England on April 10, 1912 and docked in France and Ireland before setting sail for New York. There were many immigrants on the ship from Ireland who were leaving for New York. The ship struck an iceberg at 11:40 pm on April 15, 1912. She was hit on the side of the ship and she started to fill up with water. During this time, women and children are put into life rafts. The bottom of the interior of the ship filled up fast and tipped the boat vertically. It sunk to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean on April 15, 1912 at 2:20am.\n\nThe only existing footage of the RMS TITANIC is seen on this excellent youtube video from Aaron1912.\n\nNearly a century after the Titanic struck ice in the North Atlantic, a federal judge in Virginia is poised to preserve the largest collection of artifacts from the opulent oceanliner and protect the ship's resting place.\n\nU.S. District Judge Rebecca Beach Smith, a maritime jurist who considers the wreck an \"international treasure,\" is expected to rule within weeks that the salvaged items must remain together and accessible to the public. That would ensure the 5,900 pieces of china, ship fittings and personal belongings won't end up in a collector's hands or in a London auction house, where some Titanic artifacts have landed.

{"text":"Expeditions and Nature Cruises\n\nThere are still some less explored areas to be visited by the more adventurous, who want to experience them before they are spoiled\n\nPassengers joining expeditions tend to be more self-reliant and more interested in doing or learning than in being entertained. They become \"participants\" and take an active role in almost every aspect of the voyage, which is destination-, exploration-, and nature-intensive.\n\nNaturalists, historians, and lecturers (rather than entertainers) are aboard each ship to provide background information and observations about wildlife. Each participant receives a personal logbook, illustrated and written by the wildlife artists and writers who accompany each cruise \u2013 a fine souvenir.\n\nYou can walk on pack ice in the islands and land masses in the Arctic Ocean and Arctic Circle, explore a huge penguin rookery on an island in the Antarctic Peninsula, the Falkland Islands or South Georgia, or search for \"lost\" peoples in Melanesia. Or you can cruise close to the source of the Amazon, gaze at species of flora and fauna in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands (Darwin's laboratory), or watch a genuine dragon on the island of Komodo \u2013 from a comfortable distance, of course.\n\nBriefings and lectures bring cultural and intellectual elements to expedition cruise vessels. There is no formal entertainment as such; passengers enjoy this type of cruise more for the camaraderie and learning experience, and being close to nature. The ships are designed and equipped to sail in ice-laden waters, yet they have a shallow enough draft to glide over coral reefs.\n\nTravel In Comfort\nDespite being rugged, expedition cruise vessels can provide comfortable and even elegant surroundings for up to 200 passengers, and offer first-class food and service. Without traditional cruise ports at which to stop, a ship must be self-sufficient, be capable of long-range cruising, and be totally environmentally friendly.\n\nLars-Eric Lindblad pioneered expedition cruising in the late 1960s. A Swedish American, he turned travel into adventure by going to parts of the world tourists had not visited. After chartering several vessels for voyages to Antarctica, he organized the design and construction of a small ship capable of going almost anywhere in comfort and safety. In 1969, Lindblad Explorer was launched; it soon earned an enviable reputation in adventure travel. Others followed.\n\nTo put together cruise expeditions, companies turn to knowledgeable sources and advisors. Scientific institutions are consulted; experienced world explorers and naturalists provide up-to-date reports on wildlife sightings, migrations, and other natural phenomena. Although some days are scheduled for relaxation, participants are kept physically and mentally active. Thus it is unwise to consider such an adventure cruise if you are not completely ambulatory.\n\nAdventure cruise companies provide expedition parkas and waterproof boots, but you will need to take waterproof trousers for Antarctica and the Arctic.\n\nSee menu (at left) for more valuable info from the Berlitz Guide available on Seasite.com."}

It still tastes good, although my ecologically friendly spear-fishing techniques of only catching what I want to eat instead of trawling the entire ocean and through the dead stuff that I shouldn't have caught back overboard are deemed as carnage akin to the slaughter of African Elephant or Rhino.\n\nSomewhere along in the last 40 years my ideals became 'non-politically correct'.\n\nWD: If a ship is sunk in international waters, who can claim it?\n\nIf something lays on the bottom of the sea in international waters, it's outside anyone's jurisdiction. Time and time again, this appears to mean that whoever has the biggest guns at the time (real guns of course), they get to recover and keep whatever's recovered (or steal it from the wreck divers who've just recovered it.) Strange, though, how the big guns don't appear until: 1) the wreck has beeen located at often immense expense in time and resources to the salvager, and 2) most of the items have been recovered. (Editor's Note: Legally, whoever discovers the sunken ship first that lies in international waters is considered to have the rights to salvage the ship. )\n\nIf the items are big enough, valuable enough, or just plain politically sensitive, then whole governments get involved in the acquisition of freshly recovered items. Governments are rarely interested in people salvaging worthless rubbish from the ocean floor, and only become involved if it's worth something, apart from in bloody Australia where just entering a sensitive wreck will see you enjoying a free stay \"in the pokey.\" Yes, piracy is alive and well.\n\nWD: Recently, Steve Lloyd found the wreck of the S.S. Aleutian at 220 feet off Alaska's Kodiak island. He is planning to charge clients $4,000 for seven days to dive to the wreck and salvage the Aleutian's artifacts. ( This has archeologists worried. Do you think any Joe Schmoe should be allowed to pay money and mine artifacts of sunken ships? Do these treasures belong to the public or the governement?\n\nSteve should have kept very quiet about the wreck, and with a hand picked crew of divers, he should have salted away the artifacts into his garage for preparation and release to public auction. Then at a public funtion, the government can decide if it values the \"treasure\" sufficiently to pay Steve what he rightfully deserves for finding the booty.\n\nWD: Do governments intervene if it's a valuable ship? Any examples?\n\nCheck out Mike Hatcher's \"Middle of the Gulf\" wreck story concerning the Thai government's intervention into his salvage of a shipwreck in international waters close to Thailand.\n\nWD: What about non-governement ships? Do salvagers have to worry about piracy?\n\nSalvagers always have to worry about piracy. I class piracy as having something I've found taken from me by anyone without giving me it's full market worth at auction. This includes, of course, government, the coast guard, Navy, and other salvagers arriving on site to join the feeding frenzy."}
{"text":"Maritime Law by Barb Karg and Arjean Spaite\n\nMaritime law is defined as the body of law relating to maritime commerce and navigation, and to maritime matters in general. Each country generally controls the waters surrounding it, and their laws apply, but there are vast areas on the high seas that aren't owned or governed by any country. Because of this, the international community has often attempted to work together to form laws that would cover the world's oceans. In 1958, the United Nations Conventions on the High Seas was held, and in 1982 the Convention on the Law of the Sea was convened. These two groups defined piracy as \"an attack mounted for private ends on a ship on the high seas that involves violence, illegal detentions of persons or property, or the theft or destruction of goods.\" The more recent United Nations Law of the Seas defines piracy as \"any illegal acts of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed by individuals for private ends against a private ship or aircraft.\" They also specify that two vessels must be involved in the incident, otherwise the act is one of hijacking rather than piracy.\n\nWhy was there a need for a change in the definition of piracy?\n\nThere are problems with the first definition, including the fact that it states that the attack must occur \"on the high seas.\" Many pirate attacks are much closer to shore, some even occurring on docked boats and rivers. Also, this definition said that the attack had to occur for private gain, and this is difficult to prove given that pirate's identities are typically unknown and the individuals can't be shown to be acting for their own private gain.\n\nThe majority of modern pirates operate out of a specific homeland, and piracy is most common near areas where authorities tend to turn a blind eye to their acts. Most countries have differing levels of laws and law enforcement, and local governments may condone or even participate in acts of piracy. For example, in 1995 the Philippine Coast Guard boarded the merchant ship Kafu Maru, allegedly searching it for illegal firearms. They found no firearms, but did commandeer the ship's cargo of cigarettes and liquor, which was worth over 4,500,000 pesos. The coast guard officers neglected to report that they'd taken the cargo, despite the fact that it was later found in their homes.\n\nOutside of local waters, international maritime laws prevail in any instance of piracy. If a ship on the high seas is suspected of being a pirate ship, it can legally be boarded and seized by any official government vessel. The pirates can then be arrested, and subjected to the laws and penalties of any country that apprehends them."}
{"text":"Talk:USS Wellington\n\nAfter reading this article, I would like to ask if it was ever actually mentioned that it was named after the city of Wellington in New Zealand. I think it could have been easily named after the Duke of Wellington, the famous British Field Marshal that fought during the Napoleonic Wars, unless it being named after the New Zealand city is explicitly mentioned. If, as I suspect, neither is explicitly mentioned, then it should at least state that it could have been named after him. Lord Elessar 267 03:23, 19 July 2006 (UTC)\n\nIt's also worth mentioning, in this context, that the city is itself named after the Field Marshall, so even if the ship were named for the city not the man, it's still commemorating him indirectly.

{"text":"Personal tools\n\nViews\n\nBlack ship\n\nFrom YPPedia\n\nThe black ship, more formally known as El Pollo Diablo (The Devil Chicken), shows up to punish ships when they attack a vessel with a weaker might rating. It fights in place of the attacked ship, mercilessly pummeling the attackers until their ship is full of damage, at which point it will grapple to initiate a sword fight.\n\nContents\n\nEngaging the Black Ship\n\nOne good example of starting a battle with the Black ship is a Grand Frigate intercepting a Sloop. A warning message is given to you like fighting Brigand Kings, sometimes, the Black Ship attacks.\n\nMessages\n\nPlayers receive the following messages when battling the black ship.\n\nWhen a higher power ship attacks a player, the player receives the message:\n\n\"Avast! Those cowardly dogs were nigh upon ye when a thick dark fog swells from the ocean and the Black Ship emerges! The Black Ship bears down upon yer foes and takes yer place in battle.\"\n\nWhen a player is aboard a ship that attacks a lower power ship and the black ship appears, the player receives the message:\n\n\"Dark clouds gather as ye bear down upon yer hapless victims, and from the miasma emerges the Black Ship to take the place of yer target in battle! Arrrrgh! Ye be doomed fer sure!\"\n\nWhen a player is aboard a ship that attacks a lower power ship and the black ship does not appear, the player receives the message:\n\n\"Woe be the crew that spends too much time ganging up on vessels with fewer pirates. There be a legend that a Black Ship sails these waters, evening the score for those that've been wronged.\"\n\nBattling the Black Ship\n\nThe ship is piloted by 159 skellies, goes through obstacles, and knows the opponent's every move. It gets 4 moves per turn, unlike ships similar to it in size. It is also immune to cannonballs and grappling. Basically, it is almost impossible to win against it.\n\nAfter the black ship wins, it takes everything on the other ship except for 5 units of the lowest quality rum that is aboard. This acts as a minor PoE and commodity sink to the economy.\n\nHistorical notes\n\nThe black ship did not always have 159 skellies on it. The Ringers kept changing the amount of skellies aboard the black ship in an attempt to make it truly unbeatable. At one time, there were only eight skellies aboard, due to a booch; it was also vulnerable to cannonfire.\n\nThere have been four iterations of the black ship so far:\n\nFirst variation\n\nThe black ship worked as a normal ship, it could be shot like any other ship, and took damage from rocks if it ran into them. The number of skellies aboard was variable. This incarnation was first defeated when Barrenmore took a full grand frigate out during the Rudder Revolution's 24-hour bash to fight it. [1]\n\nSecond variation\n\nThe black ship was turned into the ghost ship that it is now, it became impossible to shoot it and it went right through rocks. However, this was the booched version that had only eight skellies aboard. Another booch resulted in the skellies' swords decaying into foils after awhile (this affected the land-based skellies as well).\n\nWith release 2006-11-07, the number of skellies aboard was raised to 159 in light of the most recent defeat.\n\nThe black ship has aqua banners. This trivia fact was used during Tedv's Endurance Scavenger Hunt.[2] However, it is possible that the black ship has (unbeknownst to players!) been decorated with furniture by an Ocean Master in one of his or her more whimsical moods.\n\nTips\n\nIt is possible that the Black ship will disengage from battle, provided you can run away long enough. However, this is much more likely to happen in ships with 4 moves per turn. One way to disengage from black ship is to stay one square in front of the black ship, causing it unable to cross through the player ship.\n\nThe Black Ship disengaging.\n\nReferences\n\nThe name El Pollo Diablo comes from the Monkey Island video game series. In its third installment, Guybrush Threepwood is told the tale of a demonic chicken, who comes out when the moon is full to peck those who would eat his lesser brethren. His blood curdling \"cluck\" resounds in the deep jungle...he is \"El Pollo Diablo\"!"}

At the Isle of Wight they embarked two Jesuit priests and nearly two hundred more settlers before setting out across the Atlantic. Since he could not lead the expedition himself, Baltimore sent detailed instructions for the governance of the colony, including commands that his brothers seek any information about those who had tried to thwart the colony and make contact with Claiborne to determine his intentions for the trading station on Kent Island.

Bell grounded on the shallow reef known today as Elbow Reef, located about six miles offshore of Key Largo, Fla., on April 4, 1911. The ship was loaded with coal bound for Vera Cruz, Mexico.

{"text":"Footnotes\n\nIn this gloriously bracing work by the modern master of the genre John Steven Dews, the artist has portrayed five of the greatest racing yachts of their day as they battle for supremacy at Cowes in the summer of 1926.\n\nThe race depicted took place on Tuesday 3rd August, the second that day, and offered a prize of \u00a380 to the winner. Lined up at the start were five of the most notable yachts afloat \u2013 Westward (see below for details), White Heather II (built 1907, owner Sir Charles Allom), Lulworth (built 1920, owner Sir Mortimer Singer), Shamrock (built 1920, owner Sir Thomas Lipton) and the legendary royal cutter Britannia (built 1893, owner King George V). The first yacht over the start line was Shamrock, with Lulworth and White Heather II slightly astern of her but to windward, and Britannia and Westward both on her lee beam. Westward soon gathered pace and was in front as the pack rounded the Solent Bank buoy with an average speed of 11.39 knots. Maintaining the lead once she had taken it, Westward finished first ahead of Lulworth, with the other three yachts following her in quick succession with only 4 minutes and 15 seconds between the winner and Shamrock, the last home.\n\nWestward, 323 tons and the winner on this occasion, was built by the great Nat Herreshoff at Rhode Island in 1910 and was one of the largest racing schooners whose career fell into two distinct phases. Like Britannia, she too had royal connections having been originally purchased at the Kaiser's instigation by a syndicate of German businessmen who renamed her Hamburg. She won all eleven races in her first season and then enjoyed many other successes in the years preceding the Great War. Sold out of German ownership after the Armistice, her new American owner Clarence Hatry restored her original name and his first season in 1920 almost equalled the triumphs of 1910. It was after her sale to T.B.F. Davis in 1924 however, that she finally came into her own when she became a regular challenger to Britannia. Over the years Davis and the King developed a spirited, though very friendly rivalry and Westward became such a prized possession of Davis that he, like George V before him, stipulated in his will that his boat also was to be sunk after his death."}

Let's hope it doesn't come to that.\n\nThe story of this fabled but doomed ship continues to fascinate us 98 years since the tragic event occurred. That we now have such amazing technology at our disposal is asurance that the world will have a permanent visual record of the ship's remains before it ultimately dissolves into the waters that initially consumed it. The 1507 souls who perished that night could never have known how the tragedy captivated the world in the century that followed. Peace to them and to the current expeditiion.\n\nAll famous shipwrecks have both an historical and a human perspective regarding the events that led to the loss of the ship and those aboard. The Titanic wreck fascinates because of the circumstances that surround it: namely the hubris involved in declarations that she was 'unsinkable', the fact that this was the world's largest most luxurious ship making her maiden voyage with many wealthy and famous people on board and mistakes made by the captain Smith who was making his last transatlantic trip after 50 years at sea. The tremendous loss of life led to changes in the way all passenger ships were designed and outfitted with regard to life jackets, equipment and lifeboats.\n\nThis expedition is not for retreival of artifacts, it is for the comprehensive documentation of the ship's fragile condition with high definition 3-D video so that the world will have a record of the ship before it dissolves into the seawater that is slowly claiming it. I'm sure that other famous wrecks such as the Bismarck and the Lusittania will be recoded in a similar fashion in the years to come.\n\nHonestly are we fascinated by the true Titanic or the movie? The Titanic is history and we can't afford to be living in the past. How much more are we suppose to learn from this shipwreck other than she sunk, time to move on, comprende.\n\nWill this expedition respect the Titanic's wreckage and debris field as a graveyard; and if it takes artifacts will it record their locations and conditions as would be done with an academic archaeological excavation?\n\nI really wish they could bring up a section of the ship to perserve it for all man kind to peer into what was one of the most historical ships, I myself am really fascinated with anything historic like this, to think they made something so fascinating back in the old glory days.\n\nthis is the problem with the world today, every thing is a graveyard to be perserved. for what? take the photos and that's that get that salvage off the bottom and not just this ship who's going out there and unless you have a sub and big money nobody is going to see anything but the movies and photos. you found it, yea it sank, people died. 100yrs ago. and in 200yrs someone will get funding from the gov. to go look at the same rust spot on the bottom just to see if it's still there, moving on........\n\nI understand the reverence and historical significance bestowed upon the Titanic, but the unbelievable amounts of money that are being spent to continue to visit the wreckage, diagram it, photograph it, explore it, etc. is staggering. In a time where our country is further in debt than ever before, where other countries are experiencing the same financial woes, why are we spending such astronomical amounts of money to keep analyzing this wreck?? I belive the \"mystery\" has been solved long ago, we know why the ship sunk, we know how many lives were lost, we know what the entire ship looked like before and after the wreck. This money could be focused so much more effectively on researching things that are currently affecting society, like cancer research, AIDS research, finding a cure for these and other diseases. But instead we continue to spend millions on looking at a ship that wrecked decades ago. Ridiculous"}

Ship planks and oar blades discovered in 2006 at the caves of Wadi Gawasis provided a basis for the ship reconstruction.<\/p>\n<p>\"The planks that we looked at from the archaeological site are in great condition,\" said Cheryl Ward, the maritime archaeologist at Florida State University who headed the effort.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\" here<\/a> to see photos and more details about the ship's birth and maiden voyage. <\/p>\n<p>The nearly 4,000-year-old timbers even contained shipworms which had tunneled into the ships during sea voyages, leaving behind tube-like shells that filled up the wood like a sponge. Ward was able to estimate from the shipworms that the ship endured a six-month, 2,000-mile round trip to Punt -- located in modern Ethiopia or Yemen.<\/p>\n<p>A French production company called Sombrero and Co. approached Ward with the idea of recreating the ancient journey for a documentary, and so her team set about resurrecting a ship for the modern expedition.<\/p>\n<p>Douglas fir from North America best resembled the cedar wood used by the Egyptians, in terms of strength and density. Naval architect Patrick Couser drew on better-known watercraft designs from ancient Egypt to design a ship which matched relief images seen on Hatshepsut's funerary temple. <\/p>\n<p>The 66-foot-long by 16-foot-wide ship was completed by October 2008 using ancient Egyptian techniques. Frames and nails didn't enter the equation -- instead planks were designed to fit like pieces of a puzzle. The timbers swelled snugly together after being immersed in the Nile River.<\/p>\n<p>A 24-person international crew eventually took <i>Min of the Desert<\/i> on its maiden Red Sea voyage, after short trial runs on the Nile. Political considerations and the threat of modern-day pirates cut the voyage short after sailing 150 miles in a week, but the ancient Egyptian <a href=\" target=\"_blank\">engineering<\/a> held up.<\/p>\n<p>\"The technology we used had not been applied to shipbuilding for more than 3,500 years, and it still works as well today as it did then,\" Ward said.<\/p>\n<\/div>Sciencealt vehiclesancient egyptarchaeologyegyptreconstructionsreplicassailingshipsMon, 09 Mar 2009 19:10:02 +0000Jeremy Hsu32836 at  Sails for the Filthy Rich\n<div class=\"center"}

{"text":"Purchase Books\n\nNaval Facts\n\nToday we are used to the White Ensign being flown by all ships of the Royal Navy. However in Nelson's Day a different system was in use.\n\nThe Navy was divided into three squadrons Red, White and Blue in order of seniority. Admirals were appointed to these squadrons and therefore their rank and squadron split the seniority into 9 bands with 'Admiral of the Fleet' forming a tenth senior to all others.\n\nWhen reading a novel about the Royal Navy in the Napoleonic era you will usually find a reference to the Articles of War. They were read at least once a month, usually when church was rigged on Sunday, and when punishment was inflicted.\n\nThe Articles were originally established in the 1650s, amended in 1749 (by an act of Parliament) and again in 1757. It is an amazing document to study, and to note the number and degree of offenses which were punishable by death.\n\nWhere books include a reference to an Article you can either read the full text or select an individual Article from the index below.\n\nLetters of Marque \u2013 more properly called \"Letters of Marque and Reprisal\" originated in 1243 when King Henry III of England issued licenses to specific individuals to seize enemy cargoes at sea and split the proceeds from the sale of those cargoes with the Crown. Later, in1354, King Edward III broadened the scope of these licenses to authorize a subject to make reprisals against the citizens and possessions of a hostile nation for alleged injuries perpetrated against the king by that nation. While at the time the reprisal could take place on land or sea, early on the term came to apply only to measures taken at sea. Those in possession of a highly coveted letter of marque became known as privateers, and the practice was quickly adopted by most European maritime nations and became a mainstay of international law.\n\nPerhaps unwittingly \u2013 although probably not \u2013 the Plantagenet king had opened wide a treasure trove of opportunity and profit for the private sector and for the Royal Exchequer. Throughout the Middle Ages enterprising English sea captains operated with the tacit understanding of their king if not his outright commission in harassing the maritime trade of offending nation-states. Things reached a fever pitch when privateers such as Sir Francis Drake seized Spanish ships laden with gold and silver on their return voyage from South America and the Spanish Main. Queen Elizabeth I was only too happy to accept this Midas touch and share in the bounty of the captured treasure and subsequent sale of the seized vessel, its value determined by newly developed Admiralty Courts (also known as \"prize courts\"). The privateer's captain and crew all received a share based on rank, so everyone was happy \u2013 except, of course, the captain and crew of the captured vessel and the Court of King Phillip II of Spain. His displeasure led ultimately to the defeat of the Spanish Armada, one of most colossal and humiliating defeats in military history.\n\nIn fiction books a seaman is often tasked with using the lead to check the depth of water.\n\nTo do so he is stationed in the chains and then swings the lead backwards and forwards to create momentum. During a forward swing he lets go so that the lead flies ahead of the ship giving it time to sink to the bottom. He then starts to haul in the line until the ship sails over it with the lead still on the sea bottom. As the line becomes vertical he looks down and reads off the depth just above the water.\n\nThe line is 25 fathoms long, 20 fathoms of which is marked by different shapes, numbers and colours of material tied at intervals along the line which he must memorise. The materials used were mainly leather, calico and serge. The lead itself was usually around 7lb.\n\nThroughout historic naval fiction novels you will find that the officers are keen to either have their reports appear in the Naval Chronicle or to be named in others reports. Today, thanks to google and the Internet Archive, some of these publications can be read for free online. Links are provided below for those that are currently available.On Royal Navy ships of the sailing era the ships bell was used to tell everyone on board what the time was. Usually a half hour sand glass was used and as the Midshipman of the Watch turned it over the bell was rung a number of times to let the crew know how long they had been on watch and when the relief was due to take over. To allow for any discrepancies in turning the glass the naval day started at noon when the noon sight (the Captain and senior officers establishing when the Sun reached it's daily zenith) could be used to start the daily cycle.\n\nDepending on the number of crew available and the number of trained watch keeping officers, the crew could be divided into two or three watches. Usually it was two, the starboard and larboard watches. The three watch system was more popular with crews as they got a full eight hours off but not as widely used."}
{"text":"Having finished another Alan Lewrie adventure, it is time to take a quick look at the historical incidents that were form a backdrop for the novel.\n\nHow effective was French privateering operations against British commerce? Not very. It was a nuisance, siphoning off numerous minor combatants to protect convoys and patrol against privateers but the losses were minor. As a strategic weapon aimed at the British economy it was an abysmal failure.\n\nThe highlight of Reefs and Shoals is the small boat action on the St. Mary's River. Like so many incidents by Pope or O'Brian or Lambdin this one is rooted in fact.\n\nAlone among the major authors of war at sea during the Age of Sail, Lambdin talks about the necessity of any ship engaging in in-shore operations to have the services of a smaller ship, a tender, to enable it to project power in the shallower parts of the littoral zone. In 1805, the HMS Cambrian (40) under the command of Captain John Poo Beresford was cruising the Bahamas straits searching for French and Spanish privateers. Beresford was an energetic officer who played a small role in US naval history by capturing the USS Waspand recapturing Wasp's prize, HMS Frolic.\n\nOn July 3, after a chase of 22 hours the Cambrian ran the French privateer schooner Matilda into shoal waters presumably in the Little Bahama Banks where Lewrie captures Insolent in Reefs and Shoals. The Matilda was fitted out with 10 long nines. Beresford placed his first lieutenant John Pigot (or perhaps Pigott) in command of her and sent her off to explore the St. Mary's River in search of a Spanish privateer and two prizes. We can infer from the capture of Matilda and the immediate dispatch of Matilda under Pigot that one of the prisoners probably gave valuable information.\n\nPigot arrived off Cumberland Island on July 6 and on July 7 proceeded up St. Mary's River. He traveled 12 miles up the river, probably to the location of the Florida ghost town of Crandall. Crandall at the time had a sawmill and a landing for small craft. The movement was contested with Matilda taking musket and rifle fire from Spanish militia along the banks. Pigot found the privateer and her two prizes (Golden Grove and Ceres) lashed together in a line across the river presenting their broadsides. Pigot dueled with them until Matilda ran aground then ordered his men to the small boats to continue the action. Once he carried the Spanish privateer he used her guns to make the Spanish abandon the two prizes. With the three ships in his possession he turned all their guns on the militia which now numbered about 100 men and had a fieldpiece at their disposal.\n\nThey were quickly routed by the fire from three ships but Pigot found himself stranded by adverse winds. It wasn't until July 21 that Pigot with Matilda and three prizes descended the St. Mary's River to the Atlantic. British casualties were two killed, 14 wounded. Pigot, himself, was shot three times \u2014 twice in the head and once in the leg \u2014 but refused to relinquish command. Spanish naval losses were 25 killed, five of whom were Americans, and 22 wounded. Pigot was promoted to commander.\n\nAt that point, I lose track of Commander Pigot. He may be the Robert Pigot who was commissioned in 1796. Maybe he pursued the rest of his career in anonymity, never again afforded the chances he was given in the summer of 1805, or maybe his luck was simply used up and he died at sea or in some nameless engagement. If anyone has information, let me know.\n\n3 Responses to Lieutenant Robert Pigot on the St. Mary's River\n\nHello Anonymous Blogger,\nI stumbled on \"ageofsail\" while trying to see if there was a recorded version of \"Portsmouth Lass\" online I could listen to. Thanks to your\npost highlighting Douglas Reeman's comments about the song I'm saved a few hours of internet searching, which I can now use looking through the posts of \"Age of Sail\".\n\nAfter a brief look around the site, I look forward to reading Lambdin's Lewerie books as soon as I finish off the final books of the the Bolitho series. I came to Bolitho after racing through the Ramage books, which held my interest despite some flaws. Ramage filled the void of finishing off the Hornblower novels. All of which was triggered by picking S.Thomas Russell's _Under Enemy Colours.\" Love to have your opinion of those two books.\nAny opinions on Adam Hardy. I've read the first of the Fox books and can't decide if it's worth hunting down the rest of the series,\n\nCan someone show me a 9 pound solid still shot that was used\u2026.. Close up so I can see the what this cannon ball looks like\u2026.. I think I have a nine pounder. I have been told by a local museum that it's definitely a cannon ball\u2026. not a shot put or large bearing\u2026.. It's perfectly round\/ made of cast iron\/ It has a faint equator and 90 degrees it has what I have been told is a spue hole\u2026.. It fits all the descriptions I found that shows how a cannon ball was made. There are no numbers on this ball. Were 9lb solid shots used in the civil war? I honestly feel this may be a Long Nine cannon ball\u2026.. But want to see the real thing first close at different angles. I just found this site. Does the weight and diameter have to be \" exactly\" 9 lbs and 4.00 inches in diameter? This ball weighs 8.95 lbs ( I used a post office sensitive scale) and I measured the diameter myself and it was 4.14 inches in diameter\u2026.. Im not an expert here\u2026.but that's the best I can do. I really want to see what the real thing looks like if someone can show me one. I have been told it may be a civil war ball, but it doesn't make sense to use this size ball on a battle field\u2026.. but it makes sense to use it to destroy a wooden ship. I learned a lot from this site and hope to hear from someone\u2026 \u2013 bill Shipley. Tcbnflash4@aol.com\nThank you"}

After being retired from the US fleet, 29 of them were sold to other navies, where they served many more years. Two still exist as museum ships, one in South Carolina, and one in Taiwan.\n\nDescription\n\nThe first ship was laid down in May 1943, while the last was launched in April 1945. In that time the United States produced 58 Allen M. Sumner-class destroyers. The Sumner class was based upon the previous Fletcher class, which were built from 1941 until 1944. In addition to the three twin 5\"\/38cal mounts, Sumners had twin rudders, giving them better maneuverability for ASW work when compared to Fletchers.[1]\n\nService\n\nCooper, Meredith, Mannert L. Abele, and Drexler were lost during the war, and Hugh W. Hadley was so badly damaged by a kamikaze attack that she was scrapped soon after the war ended. After the war most of the class except some of the light minelayers had their 40-mm and 20-mm guns replaced by 6 3-in (76 mm) and the pole mast was replaced by a tripod to carry the heavier radar. One of the two pentad 21-in (533 mm) torpedo tube mountings had already been removed on most to make way for a quadruple 40-mm gun mounting. 33 ships were converted under the FRAM II program, but not altogether as successful as the Gearings."}

{"text":"December 2012\n\nThis is the anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor which occurred on 7 December 1941. The attack was part of Japan's strategy to become the preeminent colonial power in Asia and proved the supremacy of the aircraft carrier over the battleship (though some battleship supremacists influenced both the Imperial Japanese Navy as well as the U.S. Navy during WW II). Slightly over a year before, the Royal Navy launched the first all airborne ship-to-ship attack in naval history, in the Battle of Taranto, with the HMS Illustrious in mid November 1940 \u2014 but it was the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) which first forged the massive over the horizon attack strong enough to overwhelm a target with repeated strikes by using six aircraft carriers. The U.S. Navy learned well from Japan and evolved the carrier strike group into the carrier task force which could mount operations against a target virtually around the clock for days at a time \u2014 a huge logistical victory which few, if any, other countries could do.\n\nThe film Tora!

Hence the U.S. Armed Forces first nuclear rocket weapon system launched from the surface against surface targets was developed.\n\nProfile view of the Honest John, which best shows the distinctive bulbous nose of the weapon, on an M465 launch\/transport trailer \u2014 photo by Joseph May\n\nThe MGR-1 Honest John rocket was one of the delivery systems for nuclear warheads, beginning service in 1953 with about 7000 manufactured. The Honest John was a free flight, solid fueled, spin stabilized surface-to-surface rocket with an unenviable accuracy. Lack of accuracy was made up for with a large nuclear warhead, the W31, with yields varying from 2\u201330 kilotons\/8.4\u201330 KJ.\n\nAnother view of the characteristic nose, note the electrical receptacles within the recessed area \u2014 photo by Joseph May\n\nThe literal pointy end of the Honest John rocket \u2014 photo by Joseph May\n\nLaunching could occur from a truck mounted system or from a trailer mounted system. There were two versions of the Honest John built with the second of which smaller and longer ranged \u2014 the MGR-1A and MGR-1B, with ranges of 15.4 miles\/24.6km and 31.2 miles\/ 49.2km, respectively. Additional warheads were also utilized \u2014 notably a 1500 pound\/682kg high explosive or one with many M139 Sarin nerve agent bomblets. The Honest John last deployment was in 1985, never used in combat, and served in several NATO armed forces.\n\nRockets are made to burn, but the Honest John could be fired only within a specific ambient temperature range and the military saw fit, somehow, to remind trained nuclear weapon crews of it. Apparently no fighting in winter for this Honest John! \u2014 photo by Joseph May\n\nThe Honest John in the images of this post are of the MGR-1B on a M465 launch\/transport trailer \u2014 it can can be viewed at the Armed Forces Military Museum, located in Largo FL.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War the Forward Air Control (FAC) mission evolved into Light Armed Reconnaissance Aircraft (LARA) \u2014 which was a specification issued by the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps for a two crew aircraft which could fly fast, need little room for take offs and landings (including operations from aircraft carriers), able to sustain high G-loads, carry arms (machine guns, bombs, rockets and deployable ground sensors) as well as half a dozen paratroopers and two litter cases.\n\nQuite a specification!\n\nNorth American designed the OV-10 Bronco and satisfied most of the LARA specifications. A twin boom design with a turboprop engine nestled within each boom which together straddle a central fuselage pod. This pod positioned the pilot and observer in tandem at the forward half with a largely void square cross-section rear half intended primarily for cargo. Removable sponsons midway along the fuselage pod each could house a pair of 7.62mm caliber conventional machine guns as well as provide hard points for ordnance. Another intuitive nuance of design by North American is the use of wing spoilers in concert with ailerons to create a incredible roll rate for the Bronco. The rear of the fuselage pod features an outward swinging hatch (opening to the left when looking forward on the one I observed). This area of the aircraft was useful for small cargo weighing up to a bit over 3000 pounds\/~1360kg. Optionally, two litter patients could be carried though no room for a medic to attend except from the observer's rear seat position \u2014 modification was likely required for the medic or corpsman to physically attend to the patients as the pilot seat and observer seat were both ejection seats(with zero airspeed and zero altitude capability).\n\nIt seems as if up to four paratroopers (likely either Pathfinders or Special Forces) could also be deployed for rapid or covert insertion. Each man would have sat facing to the rear in each others lap (except the first man out) with the rear hatch detached and left at the base. The pilot pitching up would have been the preferred way to deploy the small unit having them slide out of the cargo bay. Bronco's did not have jumpmasters and I do not know how the pilot would have signaled to prepare to jump, or jump. I suppose field or hand held radios would have sufficed, or the observer banging on the fuselage, or a maneuver by the pilot perhaps a minute before pitching up?\n\nAside from the LARA missions the Bronco was also an excellent FAC aircraft. Bringing 4 x 7.62mm machine guns to the fray would have been welcomed by most ground unit commanders as FACs were usually on the scene within minutes. The OV-10 Bronco Museum web site has much more information on this remarkable aircraft which continued to serve in many other countries as well as agencies well after the end of the Vietnam War.\n\nNorth American OV-10 Bronco in USAF livery \u2014 photo by Joseph May\n\nThe Bronco's six-o-clock \u2014 photo by Joseph May\n\nView of the OV-10\u2032s twin boom and fuselage pod deign by North American \u2014 photo by Joseph May\n\nThe OV-10 Bronco Association's map of OV-10 Broncos shot down or crashed during the Vietnam War \u2014 photo by Joseph May\n\nDetail of the above map centered on Da Nang and Marble Mountain \u2014 photo by Joseph May\n\nBronco in USMC livery awaiting propellers which are under restoration in the workshop \u2014 photo by Joseph May\n\nCloser view of the Bronco cockpit area under a greenhouse canopy for best observation by the crew \u2014 photo by Joseph May\n\nOnly a short drive from Dallas-Ft.

{"text":"Instantly the British fleet hauled up, steering to the eastward under topgallantsails, with a fine breeze from north by west to north-north-west.\n\nLet us pause here, while we endeavour to explain how it happened that, in a sea so comparatively small as the Mediterranean, two hostile fleets, one of which was so strenuously seeking the other, that other, too, from its immense numbers, spread over so wide a surface, did not come in mutual contact. On the 24th of May, when the reinforcement for Rear-admiral Nelson quitted Earl St.-Vincent off Cadiz, the French fleet was running down the eastern coast of Corsica ; and on the 8th of June, when Rear-admiral Nelson made sail from off Toulon, with a fleet which had only been formed the night before, Vice-admiral Brueys was standing across from Sicily to Malta. It has already been stated, that the French fleet (part of it the day before) quitted the last-named island on the morning of the 19th. Singularly enough, on the night of the 22d, the two fleets crossed each other's track unperceived. That this should have happened, in a case in which one of the fleets numbered, as that of the French then did, nearly 400 sail, must appear strange ; but the surprise will diminish, when it is known-that the spot of intersection was about midway between Cape Mesurata and the mouth of the Adriatic, the widest part of the Mediterranean ; that the British fleet sailed in close order, and had no frigates to spread as look-outs ; and that a constant haze pervaded the atmosphere. Subsequently to the 22d the French steered east, to make the Goza di Candia ; while the British stood southeast, or straight along the African coast. Hence the latter reached its port of destination just two days before the former ; and the British fleet, as it quitted the shore on its departure, was actually seen from the Pharos tower on the morning of the same day, the 30th, towards the evening of which the French fleet made its appearance off the coast of Egypt.\n\nWe have already mentioned that the French fleet anchored in the bay of Aboukir.

{"text":"Knowledge Base\n\nUseful Links\n\nThe SOLAS (Safety Of Life At Sea) Convention is an international treaty responsible for ensuring the safety of merchant ships.\n\nThe Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) forms Chapter IV of the SOLAS Convention and was introduced in stages between 1993 and 1 February 1999. Its creation marked the biggest change to maritime communications since the invention of radio.\n\nWhat is GMDSS\n\nThe GMDSS Handbook, produced by the IMO defines GMDSS as follows\n\nThe basic concept of GMDSS is that search and rescue authorities ashore, as well as shipping in the immediate vicinity of the ship in distress, will be rapidly alerted to a distress incident so that they can assist in a co-ordinated SAR operation with the minimum delay. The system also provides for agency and safety communications and the promulgation of Maritime Safety Information (MSI) - navigational and meteorological warnings and forecasts and other urgent safety information to ships. In other words, every ship is able, irrespective of the area in which it operates, to perform those communication functions which are essential for the safety of the ship itself and of other ships operating in the same area.\n\nComponents of GMDSS\n\nGMDSS consists of several different safety systems based around different communications technologies. These include DSC, NAVTEX and INMARSAT. Click the picture to enlarge.\n\nRequirements\n\nFull operation of the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) is planned for February 1st 1999. Under IMO legislation, all passenger vessels had to be fitted with the necessary equipment by 1995, and all vessels over 300grt to be GMDSS equipped by the 1st February deadline. National administrations are also being encouraged to provide the necessary shore based infrastructure in sufficient time.\n\nBenefits\n\nUnder the GMDSS, all Distress and Safety communication will be automated and watch keeping on traditional voice and Morse code frequencies become history. At the press of a button, a ship can send its identity, position and nature of distress by either satellite or terrestrial communication. It will then be up to a shore based Rescue Co-ordination Centre (RCC) to alert vessels in the area to go to the aid of the casualty. This co-ordinating role of the RCC is a new one. Under the SOLAS 1974 system, ships in the area were required to monitor for distress alerts and then respond directly. The GMDSS now makes this the responsibility of the RCC.\n\nGMDSS also changes the nature of Routine and Safety Radio operation. These become fully automatic, enabling ship's officers with a General Operator's Certificate (GOC) to deal with all incoming and outgoing ship's radio communication. It will no longer be necessary to sail with a specialist radio officer.\n\nThe ICS Approach\n\nIt is extremely important that both ship borne and land based equipment is easy to operate. International specifications for GMDSS have sadly neglected this important aspect. At ICS Electronics Ltd. we have consistently listened to the needs of the operator, and confidently claim our GMDSS equipment is the easiest to use in the world. This saves on training costs and the time required to become familiar with the equipment.\n\nCaptain Coopers speech from the 5th International GMDSS Conference .\n\nOther internet sites with more information on GMDSS are listed on our links page.\n\nWhat is DSC\n\nWhile Digital Selective Calling (DSC) is one of the most important parts of GMDSS, it is the last to be fully implemented. DSC provides a means of automating all day-to-day marine terrestrial calling - making marine radio as easy to use as a telephone. DSC effectively provides the operator with a digital dialling system capable of ringing an alarm at a distant radio station when a call is addressed to that station.\n\nLike a telephone, you do not need to know how the call has been routed or even the frequency or channel being used. All you need is a means of alerting the other party by calling their number, and then a means of talking to them. Under GMDSS, all vessels are allocated a unique Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI), which is a unique nine digit code. The digital calling information is transmitted on specially designated channels. In the case of a VHF radio, this is Channel 70. Channel 70 is dedicated for DSC use and must under no circumstances be used for anything else.\n\nAn added benefit of DSC is that the digital dialling signal can also carry other information, such as your vessel's identity, position and the nature of the call as well as information specifying the channel upon which subsequent communication should take place. The entire message is transmitted in one quick burst, thus reducing the demand time on the calling channel.\n\nIn a distress situation, all necessary information can be sent automatically at the touch of a single button. The vessel's position can be determined from a GPS navigation receiver connected to the radio or entered manually. Its identity is permanently coded into the radio in the form of the allocated vessels MMSI number. The nature of distress can also be selected by the operator if there is time to do so.\n\nUsing digital coding, DSC automates all the radio functions with which existing marine operators are familiar. It also relieves the person at the other end from the tedious task of manual watch keeping. All the old familiar functions are still in place, but they now have English names and are accessible at the touch of a button.\n\nWhat is NAVTEX\n\nNAVTEX is a system for the broadcast and automatic reception of maritime safety information by means of a narrow-band direct-printing telegraphy. NAVTEX provides shipping with navigational and meteorological warnings and urgent information through automatic printouts from a dedicated receiver.\n\nNAVTEX is a component of the IMO\/IHO Worldwide Navigational Warning Service (WWNWS) defined by IMO Assembly resolution A.706(17). It has also been included as an element of the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS). Since 1 August 1993, NAVTEX receiving capability has become part of the mandatory equipment which is required to be carried in certain vessels under the provisions of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS).\n\nHow does it work?\n\nNAVTEX transmissions are sent via a single frequency from localized stations situated worldwide. The power of each transmission is regulated so as to avoid the possibility of interference between transmitters. Users can set their NAVTEX receivers to receive specific message types and reject others. Messages such as navigational and meteorological warnings and search and rescue information are non-rejectable to ensure that ships equipped with NAVTEX always receive the most vital information. Users can choose to receive information from the single transmitter that serves the sea area around their position, or from a number of transmitters.\n\nNAVTEX Coverage\n\nNAVTEX messages are transmitted worldwide from local stations, the number of stations grows month by month. Information about all known NAVTEX stations can be found in our NAVTEX Database which provides , details including name, position, range, and operational status.\n\nWhat is an MMSI\n\nUnder GMDSS every vessel has its own unique Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI). An MMSI is composed of nine digits. A vessel's MMSI is built into the DSC equipment and is not user-changeable. If a DSC unit is moved to another vessel, or the vessel is sold, a technician must re-program the MMSI.\n\nMMSI's can also be assigned to a group of vessels. This can prove invaluable, for example, to fishing fleets and shipping lines to keep in touch with other vessels within that group. A call made to a group rather than an individual MMSI will alert all vessels within that group.\n\nThe Maritime mobile Access & Retrieval System, maintained by the International Telecommunication Union is a searchable database which can be used to identify a vessel or coast stations MMSI number. The database is updated on a weekly basis.\n\nMMSI Format\n\nThe first three non-zero digits of an MMSI number are used to distinguish the country of origin. Leading zero's are used to distinguish between vessels (no leading zero's), vessel groups (one leading zero), and coast stations (two leading zeros). For example:"}
{"text":"May 27, 1941 - The German battleship Bismarck is sunk in the Atlantic by the Royal Navy.\n\n- One of the largest battleships ever commissioned (the largest at the time), The Bismarck weighed almost 50,000 tons and was over 820 feet long. After playing a major role in the sinking the pride of the Royal Navy, the HMS Hood, the Bismarck was made a priority for the Royal Navy and Winston Churchill. Her engagement with the HMS Hood in the Battle of Denmark Strait would ultimately be her only success. Once she was hunted and spotted by the Royal Navy, she was sunk, though the actual reason for her sinking remains a bit of a mystery.\n\nMany thought she was just so shot up by bombs and torpedoes that she just sank but upon closer inspection when its wreckage was discovered by National Geographic explorer Robert Ballard, the torpedo damage had not affected the inner most parts of the ship that would've caused it to sink like a normal ship. It is believe that the destruction of the Bismarck can be attributed to not only the terrible bombardment it took from the Royal Navy but also its poor design that left it structurally unsound.\n\nMay 27, 1937 - The Golden Gate Bridge opens; first to pedestrian traffic and then to automobiles later in the week.\n\n- The steel suspension bridge is 1.7 miles long and spans across the opening of San Francisco Bay to the Pacific Ocean. It has been named one of the modern Wonders of the World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The Frommers travel guide calls the Golden Gate Bridge \"possibly the most beautiful, certainly the most photographed, bridge in the world.\"\n\nmorbid side fact: More people commit suicide by jumping from the Golden Gate Bridge than at any other landmark or one spot in the world. The official number isn't really known but many counts have it at around 1,300 with 1 at least every two weeks. Most people who jump of the bridge die on impact with the water since it is a 245 ft fall to the water but those who don't usually either drown or die of hypothermia. Some have survived though. One man jumped, suffered some cracked vertebrae, but still managed to swim to shore and get in his car and drive himself to the hospital. One woman jumper, on the other hand, survived only to go and succeed on a second try.\n\nMay 27, 1930 - the Chrysler Building in New York City opens to the public.\n\n- Rising 1,050 ft from street to the top of the Antenna, the Chrysler Building was built to be the biggest, most spectacular building in the world. Unfortunately, it only held that crown for one year until the Empire State Building was completed. Over the years other buildings have taken the world's tallest crown but for a time the Chrysler building was #2 in New York, until the World Trade Center knocked it down to 3rd and then after 2001 it returned to it's 2nd spot until the Bank of America tower was completed and knocked it back down to 3rd.\n\n- Star Wars, Sherlock Holmes, Van Helsing, Dr. Frankenstein, and Doctor Who; these are all roles played by the great, great Peter Cushing. If the words \"Hammer Horror\" mean anything to you, then Cushing is definitely no stranger to you and you already know this man was one of the greats. Sure, he never really did the sort of high class work of a Lawrence Oliver or Alec Guinness but that didn't matter. He was the warrior for the forces of good against the best Dracula we've ever had, Christopher Lee. I would say \"in my opinion\" to that but I'm afraid that's just a proven fact. For me, there are few actors that have shaped my love of a genre of film (Horror) than Peter Cushing.\n\n- Originally from a small mining town called Orbiston in Scotland, Busby actually played for two of Manchester United's greatest rivals, Liverpool and Manchester City, before he became manager of United. His managerial stats for United are:\n\nFirst Division (5): 1951\u201352, 1955\u201356, 1956\u201357, 1964\u201365, 1966\u201367\n\nFA Cup (2): 1947\u201348, 1962\u201363\n\nFA Charity Shield (5): 1952, 1956, 1957, 1965, 1967\n\nEuropean Cup (1): 1967\u201368\n\nThough to most he is most notable for being the manager of the so-called \"Busby Babes\" squad from 1955-1958. They were called the \"babes\" because they were a youthful team who had made their way from the youth team to the first team together under the tutelage of Busby and his assistant Jimmy Murphy. The team included such greats as Duncan Edwards, Billy Whelan, and Bobby Charlton. After a European Cup Tie in Belgrade, the plane carrying the whole team crashed on take off from a Munich airport. 8 of the players, along with 3 other club officials and 12 others died in the accident. Only Charlton, hero goalkeeper Harry Gregg (hero because he pulled many people out of the plane while it was on fire, including Busby), and Busby survived the crash. Busby barely survived though, suffering multiple injuries and receiving the Last Rites twice, before he recovered and was able to leave the hospital nine weeks later. He took the rest of the season off to recover before returning to lead the team again, the next season with a whole team based around his only surviving players."}

{"text":"Cape Horn (Scenic Cruising)\n\nCape Horn, the southernmost tip of South America, is where sailors on epic journeys are tested. The rough waters and prevailing winds make this region a place of great beauty and danger. Many attempts to \"round the Horn\" have failed and it has been reported that some 800 ships and 10,000 sailors have gone down trying.\n\nThe route around Cape Horn, prior to the Panama Canal and the transcontinental railroad, was important for trade and passenger ships taking goods and people from either coasts of the United States. It was also an essential supply route for the Spanish empire. Sailing ships had to battle the elements for extended periods, some never being able to round the Horn and forced to turn back or perish. The waters were so treacherous that ships passed this way for centuries before discovering Antarctica, a mere 90 miles to the south.

It's not life of just the history of the ship, it's also a link to everything that has occurred with our service people (and those who's lives have been touched by our service people) to this very day, when one opens their minds to realize it.\n\nMayor, show this ship the respect it deserves, not only as a history lesson, but a lesson that leads one to appreciate the continued service our brave men and women still give us to"}
{"text":"More from our 2012 vacation to South Africa ..a visit to the Danger Point Lighthouse .... a very dangerous coast for ships ...many ships where wrecked there ... at this point was HMS Birkenhead wrecked !\n\nFrom Wikipedia,\nHMS Birkenhead, also referred to as HM Troopship Birkenhead or steam frigate Birkenhead,[3] was one of the first iron-hulled ships built for the Royal Navy.[4] She was designed as a frigate, but was converted to a troopship before being commissioned.[1]\n\nOn 26 February 1852, while transporting troops to Algoa Bay, she was wrecked at Danger Point near Gansbaai on the outskirts of Cape Town, South Africa. There were not enough serviceable lifeboats for all the passengers, and the soldiers famously stood firm, thereby allowing the women and children to board the boats safely. Only 193 of the 643 people on board survived, and the soldiers' chivalry gave rise to the \"women and children first\" protocol when abandoning ship, while the \"Birkenhead drill\" of Rudyard Kipling's poem came to describe courage in face of hopeless circumstances.\n\nComments on this photo:\n\nThis looks like it was a steep upward climb...but seeing another of your photos it was worth the effort.\nGreat notes - thank you\nI love lighthouses - and there are so any to see the world over....\nThanks for sharing"}

{"text":"After the war, the Navy retained 60 Yard Minesweepers (YMS) and reclassified\nthem as Motor Minesweepers (AMS). Then, in the early 1950s, the Navy\nstarted to build new AMSs but, in 1955, changed the designation to MSC and\nsimultaneously reclassified the 60 ex-YMSs as MSC(O)s , where the O stood\nfor Old. The basic design of the new boats had a light displacement of\n390 tons and was 144 feet long. In total, 312 were built, all but 24\nof them being transferred directly to allied navies, and 59 of them being\nbuilt by yards in the recipient countries.\n\nThe Navy also retained 50 other craft - mostly\nLCI(L)s and LCTs - after the war and converted them to Coastal Minesweepers\n(Undersea Locator), or AMCUs: this designation was changed to Mine Hunter (MHC)\nin 1955.\n\nIn parallel with the MSC program, the Navy also built a series of Ocean\nMinesweepers (AM): this designation was changed to MSO in 1955. The\nbasic design of these boats had a light displacement of 630 tons and was 172\nfeet long. In total, 101 were built, of which 65 were for the U.S.\nNavy and 36 were for allied navies: all these boats were built by U.S.\nyards.\n\nIn the late 1950s, the Navy initiated a third\nprogram, to build Inshore Minesweepers, (MSI).\nThe basic design of these boats had a light displacement of 120 tons and was\n112 feet long. In total, 55 were\nbuilt, all but the first two for allied navies: only the first eight were\nbuilt in U.S. yards, the remainder being built by yards in the recipient\ncountries.\n\nAlso in the 1950s, the Navy built a series of\nMinesweeping Boats (MSB) and another of Minesweeping Launches (MSL).\nThere appear to have been at least 54 MSBs and at least 40 MSLs, but the records are very\nsketchy. The standard MSB was 44 tons and 57 feet long, while the MSL\nwas 10 tons and 36 feet long. Any information about these boats would\nbe welcomed.\n\nFollowing this surge of activity in the 1950s and 60s, there was no new\nconstruction activity until the Reagan Administration, when the Navy built 14\nMine Countermeasures Ships (MCM) and\n12 Mine Hunters (MHC). At present, there are no plans for any new\nmine-warfare ships or boats, the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) having taken\nover this role.\n\nType\n\n#\n\nOld Type\n\nOld #\n\nOriginal

{"text":"Lifeboat Heroes\n\nAbout\n\n\"The RNLI has a long and proud history. Since it was founded in 1824, as the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck, there have been countless examples of courage, selflessness and dedication \u2013 qualities still shown by the volunteer crew members, shore helpers and fundraisers of the RNLI today.\" RNLI Website\n\nBen Fogle, seafarer, TV presenter and passionate supporter of the RNLI, looks at what it takes to be a lifeboat hero, one of the brave men and women volunteers of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.\n\nThey are the core of one of Britain's most remarkable charities, founded in 1824 in response to the terrible waste of life that was occurring almost daily around the coast of Britain and Ireland. From that day to this, its mostly unpaid volunteers have performed countless acts of heroism, putting their lives on the line to save others. In all, they've saved nearly 140,000 lives.\n\nBen Fogle gets hands-on with the lifeboat crews, visiting the Poole Lifeboat College to experience sea-survival and capsize training, and testing the new 'Man Overboard Guardian' system in the chilly January waters off Torbay. He goes aboard the William Riley, built in 1909, to find out what it was like to row the early lifeboats, and then compares it with the speed and sophistication of new lifeboats like the Atlantic 85 Inshore Lifeboat, and the groundbreaking Tamar Class all-weather lifeboat.\n\nModern lifeboat heroes such as Mark Criddle, Coxswain of the Torbay Lifeboat who won a Silver Medal forGallantry in 2008, speak of what it means to be always waiting for the call. Ben also recounts the exploits of RNLI legends such as Henry Alexander Hamilton, Ireland's most decorated lifesaver, and the incomparable Henry Blogg of Cromer, 'the greatest lifeboat man of all time'. Then there's the tales of those who didn't come back, including the 'Mexico' disaster of 1886, the worst night in RNLI history in which 27 lifeboatmen were lost, and the loss with all hands of the Penlee lifeboat Solomon Browne in 1981.\n\nWhat Ben discovers in the past and present of the RNLI is a long tradition of commitment, courage and sacrifice, which continues to define this unique British sea rescue service and charity."}

{"text":"Britain's history has been fundamentally shaped by its relationship with the sea \u2013 you won't find too many people here at the National Maritime Museum disagreeing with that statement! Sometimes, when we are particularly enthusiastic, we might even say that 'boats built Britain' \u2013 the title of a recent exhibition here in Greenwich. Of course, this naturally begs the question: what did these boats help to build? Or, to put it another way, what type of British state emerged as a result of the maritime activity facilitated by the boats, ships and other vessels of the great Age of Sail?\nThese are some of the questions that I am currently grappling with as I prepare to give a lecture at Gresham College, in the heart of the City of London, on the subject of 'Britain's global trade in the great days of sail'. The possibilities and profits offered by maritime trade were crucial in defining the country's development as a global power in the Age of Sail. In this lecture, I will be exploring how British overseas trade went hand in hand with Britain's global empire in those eighteenth- and nineteenth-centuries days of the sailing ship.\nPreparing a lecture like this is quite a task. In the space of about fifty minutes, it will cover events in several oceans; a couple of centuries of history; thousands of vessels; tens of thousands of voyages; and millions of people. But it is a fascinating subject and one which I hope can add to the exciting programme of events being organised by Gresham College. Founded in 1597, Gresham College is London's oldest Higher Education Institution and has provided free public talks for over 400 years.\nYou can find out more about the range of events there on its website.

This is where we need you help!\nOur data was compiled by a variety of people here at the Museum over many years and as a result is incomplete.

{"text":"longship\n\nlongship, also called Viking ship, type of sail-and-oar vessel that predominated in northern European waters for more than 1,500 years and played an important role in history. Ranging from 45 to 75 feet (14 to 23 metres) in length, clinker-built (with overlapped planks), and carrying a single square sail, the longship was exceptionally sturdy in heavy seas. Its ancestor was, doubtless, the dugout, and the longship remained double-ended; fully developed examples have been found dating from 300 bc. It carried the Vikings on their piratical raids of the 9th century and bore Leif Eriksson to America in 1000; it was also used by Dutch, French, English, and German merchants and warriors. Some of the 11th-century versions shown in the Bayeux Tapestry have their masts supported by shrouds, implying that their square sails could be manipulated enough to sail with the wind abeam. The introduction of the stern rudder about 1200 led to the differentiation of bow and stern and the transformation of the longship"}
{"text":"Stay informed & engaged\n\nWhat is a knot? Part II\n\nPosted by Waring Hills on August 23, 2010 \u2013 10:14 am\n\nAction between USS Constitution and HMS Guerriere, 19 August 1812.\n\nThe use of the term knot goes back to the day of sailing ships. Sailors would toss over a \"Dutch log\" which had a line attached with knots tied into it at intervals. Through trial and error, seamen found that the 28-second sand glass would do the best job and you didn't want more time, because that would mean more line for the deck hands to haul back aboard ship.\n\nDutch log\n\nBy using the proportion of 28 seconds to one hour and applying the math for proportion to a nautical mile (6,080 feet), an interval was found for the placing of the knots, a knot every 47.25 feet (47\u2032 3\u2033).\n\nHeaving the \"Dutch log\" into the sea, the seaman on the outgoing line would feel for the start knot on the line (Placed so that the log would end up out of the ship's wake). Feeling it, he would shout, \"Start!\" The sand glass would be upended and when the sand ran out, the term \"Nip\" would be shouted. The number of knots that had run through the seaman's hand in that period would give the speed of the ship.\n\nAmerican clipper ship\n\nAmerican clipper ships in the 1800\u2032s could normally sail at 16-18 knots (displaced around 2500 tons) will some exceptional cases of 20 knots. The USS Yorktown (CV-10) at around 27,000 tons displacement could muster 33 knots (38 miles per hour) in World War II and our Nimitz class carriers today at 97,000 tons can achieve speeds of 30+ knots (34.5+ mph)."}
{"text":"Depth charge\n\nThe depth charge is the oldest anti-submarineweapon. A concept of a \"dropping mine\" was first discussed in 1911, and the idea was developed into practicality when the Royal Navy's Commander in Chief, Sir George Callaghan, requested its production in 1914, the design work being carried out by Herbert Taylor at HMS Vernon Torpedo and Mine School in Portsmouth.\n\nThe first effective depth charge, the \"Type D,\" developed in 1916, was a 300-pound (140 kg) barrel-like casing containing a high explosive, usually TNT. A \"pistol\" actuated by water pressure at a pre-selected depth detonated the charge. The \"Type D\" could be detonated as deep as 300 feet (100 meters).\n\nThe first delivery mechanism was to simply roll the \"barrels\" off racks at the stern of the attacking vessel. Later, special depth-charge projectors or \"K-guns\" were developed, which used an explosive propellant charge to hurl charges about 150 feet (50 meters) to the sides of the attacker. K-guns were often used together with stern racks to create patterns of six to ten charges. The attacking ship needed to be moving above a certain speed or it would be damaged by its own weapons.\n\nConventional delivery of depth charges had other problems too, most of which were solved by the use of ahead-thrown weapons such as the Hedgehog. Some Royal Navy trawlers used for anti-submarine work during 1917-1918 had a thrower on the forecastle for a single depth charge, but there do not seem to be any records of it being used in action.\n\nIn 1943, Torpex, an explosive 50% more powerful than TNT, was introduced along with a more streamlined depth charge casing that sank faster.\n\nAlthough the explosions of the standard 600-pound depth charge used in World War II were nerve-wracking to the target, an undamaged U-boat's pressure hull would not rupture unless the charge detonated closer than about five meters. Placing the weapon within this range was entirely a matter of chance and quite unlikely as the target maneuvered evasively during the attack. Most U-boats sunk by depth charges were destroyed by damage accumulated from a long barrage rather than by a single carefully-aimed attack. Many survived hundreds of depth charge detonations over a period of many hours; 678 depth charges were dropped onto U-427 in April, 1945. The U-boat"}

Substantial portions of a steamship were required for boilers, machinery and coal, thus limiting the proportion of the ship's space available for cargo.\n\nCommission appointed\n\nIn 1849 Great Britain appointed a Commission with Admiral George Moorsom as secretary to resolve these problems. The Commission determined that fees should be proportional to the earning capacity of the ship, whether for cargo or passengers.\n\nThe result was called The Moorsom System, which set forth the rules for the measurement of the internal volume of entire ship. The total internal volume was then divided by 100 ft\u00b3 to produce the gross tonnage. Net tonnage was the volume remaining after subtracting the volume of the space used for machinery and other non-revenue producing functions.\n\nThe Commission sought to avoid a significant change in the fees charged to an existing vessel when the new system was implemented. George Moorsom ordered the entire fleet of British merchant ships to be measured according to the new System and then divided the total gross tonnage by the total registered tonnage. The result was 98.22 ft\u00b3 per gross ton, which was rounded to 100 ft\u00b3 per ton.\n\nInternational Convention\n\nWhile the rules for measuring ships changed over the years, the standard of 100 ft\u00b3 per ton remained in effect until a new system was established by The International Convention on the Tonnage Measurement of Ships, effective for new ships in July 1982."}

{"text":"Veteran queen of the seven seas\n\nThe QE2 is due to sail into Liverpool next month for her 40th birthday celebrations. Peter Elson reports on Carol Thatcher's new book on Britain's world- famous liner\n\nSHE is the last great ocean liner conceived in Liverpool for arguably the city's most famous company of all, Cunard Line.\n\nAnd QE2 has a story that mirrors Britain's national fortunes over the last four decades to an uncanny degree.\n\nAgainst all the odds, she has become a symbol of enormous British prestige and perhaps the very last large vessel to truly represent what this island is capable of achieving.\n\nAs they say, God must be a Scouser, because the omens for this much-loved ship did not appear good, yet here she is 40 years on and still sailing the world.\n\nThe blinkered conservatism of Cunard's Pier Head-based senior management was determined to have two transatlantic liners, despite jet airliners hugely eroding the premium passenger market and it was only very late in the day that they were persuaded, by plummeting passenger receipts, to drastically modify the concept to a single ship which could cruise during the winter when the North Atlantic was decidedly unappealing.\n\nSomehow, it eluded these grand old men that passengers were no longer willing to tolerate six days on a liner practically standing on its end during winter crossings, when they could fly to New York at 600 miles an hour.\n\nI remember John Prescott, our former deputy Prime Minister and ex-Cunard steward, telling me: \"Cunard's Liverpool management at that time were useless. They were completely out of touch with what was going on.\"\n\nBut without Cunard's fairly intransigent attitude, we would not have the liner as she is today, with a lineage harking directly back to the PS Britannia, which inaugurated the world's first scheduled transatlantic steamship service from Liverpool's Coburg Dock.\n\nQE2 was branded a white elephant practically from the start by the City of London financial experts. Cunard was in a highly precarious financial position at the time of her conception and the travel revolution was well under way.\n\nHer cost of \u00a329m, in April, 1969, nearly bankrupted Cunard, but she rapidly repaid her investment and regular refurbishments totalling 10 times her original build price have kept her competitive.\n\nThat she was constructed at all remains a miracle. As in much of Britain, industrial relations at John Brown's shipyard on the Clyde were appalling during the middle to late 1960s.\n\nThe joke went that there is another QE2 elsewhere, because so much of the original was pilfered. John Brown won the contract for QE2's building (unfairly over the Tyneside yards, many thought) as its order book was the emptiest.\n\nAs a result of this lack of potential employment, yard workers endeavoured to keep QE2's building going as long as possible through constant strikes. Archaic and counterproductive union practices and inept and heavy-handed management all combined to make the job a nightmare.\n\nAs with the building of RMS Windsor Castle at Cammell Laird, Birkenhead, almost a decade earlier, out of all this strife and mess emerged another beautiful ship.\n\nCarol Thatcher, daughter of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, has just written a first-rate commemorative book about the ship called QE2 Forty Years Famous.\n\nWhile clearly endorsed by Cunard Line and a firm acknowledgement to its long-standing press and public relations team of Eric Flounders and Michael Gallagher, this book is no whitewash. It is, as it announces, a \"warts and all\" view of QE2.\n\n\"QE2 was launched in an era when the airliner was in vogue and carved out a niche for herself transporting the rich and famous in fabulous style.\n\n\"Passengers distinguished themselves by possessing enough leisure time to spare the five days for a transatlantic crossing, as opposed to five hours on an aircraft,\" writes Carol.\n\n\"In her 40 years of transatlantic crossings and world cruises, she has finally achieved legendary status of the greatest passenger liner of all time.\"\n\nAlthough QE2 has had more books written about her than any other liner, excepting Titanic, Carol hopes there is yet more left to say.\n\n\"I hope my main achievement is a comprehensiveness not seen in any other so far, but it also contains much new material \u2013 especially relating to the ship's design and construction.\"\n\nThat's certainly true. Thanks to Liverpool's Cunard fuddy-duddies of the early 1960s, they bequeathed a very special ship indeed (albeit after much painful wrangling) that has stood the test of time.\n\nA time so long, in fact, that transatlantic sea crossings came back into vogue stimulated by the worldwide growth in cruising that was looking for other ocean travel experiences. When Carnival Cruise Lines took over Cunard, it immediately latched onto this market potential and conceived and built Queen Mary 2, the largest ocean liner ever constructed.\n\nQM2 was profoundly based on QE2, but by this time the British shipbuilding industry had practically expired, so she was built in France.\n\nWhich is just another reason why there'll never be another QE2 once she retires to Dubai next year. Meantime, this marvellous book, packed with great stories, detail and photos, will steam on.\n\nONE of the proudest days of Capt Robin Woodall's life was bringing QE2 into the Mersey on Cunard Line's 150th anniversary, in 1990.\n\nThis was the first time that QE2 visited her owner's original base and decades since a Cunard liner had graced the Mersey.\n\nCapt Woodall, who lives in Hoylake, recalls first seeing QE2 in the Clyde, dry-docked in Greenock, on December 17, 1968, still undergoing completion by her builders.\n\n\"Capt Bil Warwick, a very famous Cunard figure from Merseyside, was in charge and I was second junior officer on the four to eight watch, having transferred from the frigate HMS Undaunted.\n\n\"My previous Cunard ship was Franconia, which was much smaller and older. She looked fantastic and I had always wanted to go on the ship ever since she was planned.\n\n\"I don't know how the officers were picked and I wasn't one of the originals, but must have been a first reserve. John Fisher left to become a pilot and I took his place.\n\n\"I was just very proud and happy to be appointed to the ship. After we were commissioned, there was all the turbine engine trouble and we went to Southampton and took the turbines out. I was amazed at how small they were.\n\n\"Bil Warwick was very good at letting the officers play with the ship. As the one and only second officer I was on watch and experienced in the handling of the ship so we learned a lot.\n\n\"In those days, changing course was a big event and she turned very nicely. She was a beautiful mover.\"\n\nCapt Woodall served on all of Cunard's famous postwar fleet, bar Britannic, until his retirement.\n\nHe says: \"Affection for QE2 was always there and has grown. She was built for the North Atlantic and cruising, so she needed a hull like a brick chicken house in Alabama. You always felt very safe in her, even in the worst weather.\n\n\"The worst position in bad weather is running before the wind and there's not a lot you can do, the ship will tend to roll, the faster you go the better. But at times navigationally you were constrained and any ship will roll. The worst roll was about 20\u00b0, but you never worried she wouldn't right herself.\"\n\nFor her first world cruise starting in New York on January 4, 1975, Capt Woodall went to Panama in his capacity as first officer and navigator.\n\n\"Two years earlier in 1973, I went on what I called 'Woody's world walkabout'. My air ticket said 'from London to London via the world', he recalls.\n\n\"This included inspecting the Panama Canal locks and control tower. There was a margin of 2ft 6ins width and 23ft either end on the gates and the bridge wings overhung the lock sides.\n\n\"The worst scenario, if we rolled, was that we would come within six inches of the control tower. On QE2's transit, I was out on the bridge wings and thought 'she's not going to fit', but she did. I was so worried about having made a mistake in my calculations.\"\n\nCapt Woodall was back briefly as staff captain in 1976, and then finally as captain in 1987. He says: \"It was absolutely fantastic it was the end of all my ambitions.\n\n\"As a small boy looking at the Wonder Book of Ships, with pictures of the Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth I thought, one day, I'll go there in command.\n\n\"I was lucky in working under Bil Warwick. He was one of the new breed of captains who were far more outgoing with officers and letting them get on with it.\n\n\"I likewise tried not to lose my relationship with the crew. Cunard only had three liners at that time and so I knew all the officers in this close-knit community.\n\n\"You don't try to stamp your own authority, it just sort of happens. You also got to entertain the passengers in playing the part of the captain that they expect to see, but you're not trained for that.\n\n\"My late wife, Eileen, was a great asset in that respect. The positive role of officer's wives in projecting this image of the company was something Cunard realised, but took ages to do anything about it, although they were allowed to travel from the early 1960s.\"\n\nAnd what about Capt Woodall's favourite home? \"There's a simple answer to that,\" he says. \"Home. It keeps me out of trouble.\""}

Before departure he got a final briefing from men like Schnee and Moehle warning him that his boat was among the slowest, heaviest and easiest to hit in the German fleet. He was told to be very careful in the South Atlantic and that wreckage from sunken ships could be spotted by the strong air cover there for several days. He apparently took these warning very seriously as can be seen from his actions in the on 13 March 1944 where he ordered the machine-gunning of the wreckage of the sunken Greek ship Peleus. These actions killed some of the Greek crew and were unsuccessful and the boat continued on its patrol.\n\nAfter the boat was destroyed in the Arabian Sea (having been beached on the shores of Somalia) on 3 May 1944 the crew was captured by a British landing party the next day. The British found the war diary of the boat, that Eck failed to destroy, and from it they learned of the Peleus affair and later tried Eck and his officers as war criminals.

This estimation was based on the extract from\nthe South Australian, 28 January 1842:\n\n'There is a point known as Alex\nLookout some miles to the east of Hog Bay.

But if you want to explore the Titanic wreck yourself, you can either hire a one-person sub, as James Cameron did last month or explore using Google Earth.\n\nGoogle Earth now has an animated feature that allows you to explore the Titanic wreck. Working with National Geographic and NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), Google Earth lets you travel to the bottom of the Atlantic and explore an animated rendering of the Titanic wreck.\n\nEnter \"Titanic\" in the search box and travel to the site of the wreck, 12484 feet below sea level. Check out the portholes, the propeller, and the underside of the hull. See where the sea life has eaten away at the remains of the ship.\n\nYou can navigate around the ship and see that the two parts of the hull landed quite far apart. The damage to the hull is also visible as you maneuver the image around to see it from all sides. Check out this video showing you the features of the tour.\n\nFor more exploring Titanic, check out undersea images of the remains of the Titanic on Panoramio: Titanic photos. This photo gallery by the NOAA, allows you not only to see incredible images of the Titanic, it also places the images on the Google Earth map so you can see where the remains are.\n\nAfter you're finished exploring the visual images of Titanic, check out @TitanicRealTime on Twitter to read tweets giving you a feel for the events surrounding the sinking of the Titanic as they actually happened. @HistoryChannel is also tweeting real time events from the Titanic sinking today and tomorrow in \"Titanic time,\" which is 90 minutes ahead of Eastern time.

Donovan, U.S. Merchant Marine Academy Professor Emeritus of Maritime History, just released The Box That Changed the World: Fifty Years of Container Shipping - An Illustrated History. This is Donovan's second book and it is a coffee-table book, heavily illustrated and printed in color. The book covers four themes: the transformation of maritime liner service; the development of intermodalism (combining trucks, trains and ships); greater global economic integrations; and trade and wealth creation.\n\nThe use of containers - truck trailer-sized cargo boxes that can be moved by trucks, ships and railroads without being unpacked -- began 50 years ago in Port Newark, NJ. This book, a first history sponsored by and written for the container industry, was released for sale on April 26, exactly 50 years after the first container ship sailed from Port Newark bound for Houston, Texas. This anniversary, and the release of this book, was celebrated at a gala banquet held in the great hall of the Smithsonian Institution's Natural History Museum. The container industry is eager to have its role in the contemporary global economy better understood, which is why it has underwritten the production of this book.\n\nContainerization plays a key role in today's global economy, but its role is not well understood. The use of containers in coordinated freight transportation is called intermodalism -- the integrated and efficient use of trucks, ships and railroads in the global movement of general cargo. Containerization has reduced the cost of moving goods between continents to such a degree that today the world is essentially one big market. Beer from China, Germany, Mexico and Brooklyn are available everywhere at nearly the same price, and the same is true for all the goods sold by Wal-Mart, Target, Home Depot, Lowes, Ikea, and the other big-box stores that bring thousands of containers to America every year. Containers also bring parts from Japan that are assembled into Toyota cars in America. Containerization has transformed global commerce and the way that people in China, India, and other developing countries live, as well as those who shop for goods in developed countries. But because the operations of the container industry take place out of the public's sight, and because the whole system is so new and dynamic, it is not well understood by the general public. The Box That Changed the World tells the story of the origins of containerization and how it has transformed the world we live in during the past fifty years.\n\nIn a recent article in \"BusinessWeekOnline,\" Anthony Coscia, chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, speaking of the man who started containerization 50 years ago, said, \"There are few instances in history where innovation has had such a dramatic impact. Malcolm McLean gave birth to a way of moving goods around the world that promoted global economic development that has been very positive for New Jersey and the U.S. economy.\" Now shipping all sorts of items - from clothing to electronics - in secured metal containers is the norm. Added Donovan, \"It used to be if you took a ship with five cargo holds, it would take two shifts a day of up to 20 longshoremen for a week to unload it. Today, a comparable job would take about 10 hours with three or four container cranes, employing fewer than 20 workers. It makes the whole world like a slick surface: You can slide anywhere at almost no cost. If you have a pool of cheap labor that's ready to work, you simply outsource. The purpose wasn't to disemploy people, but it's the consequence of falling transportation costs. It's transformed retailing,\" he added. \"The big box experience is a product of containerization.\" For more information about Donovan's new book, go to \n\nLeg six of the Volvo Ocean Race kicked off last Sunday, May 7. This is a 300-nautical-mile sprint from Annapolis, MD to New York. Ericsson is currently the leading group, one mile behind the leader. The first 120 miles out of the Chesapeake were critical, as there were few passing opportunities once the competitors exited the bay. The yachts were expected to cross the finish line in Manhattan early Tuesday morning, May 9. Leg six of the Volvo Ocean Race is the shortest of all the legs in this race and, with a rhumb line course that keeps the boats nearly in sight of shore, it will be sailed more like a long in-port race than a short offshore leg. Winds during part of the leg are expected to reach 30 knots out of the north, so the sailors are in for a rough ride, with the winds on the nose and very little chance of sleep. On arrival in New York, the fleet will have a short \"pit stop,\" before embarking on leg seven on 11 May. This 3,200 nm leg will take the fleet across the Atlantic to Portsmouth, UK.\n\nLocal resident, Alan Dinn, a descendent of the Purdy family, of Purdy boat fame, has just finished a fun trip on the newly restored Aphrodite. He took a flight to Bangor, Maine, on a Friday evening, slept aboard Aphrodite, and then joined the crew as they left Brookin, Maine, early the next morning. They arrived at Watch Hill and spent 90 minutes to refuel, etc. Aphrodite cruised at 25-27 knots most of the way south, and other than a brief shower off Point Judith, the crew had great weather and calm seas. To make the trip even better for Alan, he actually got to take the helm for over an hour! Along the way, Aphrodite turned a few heads on her trip. As they came into the Watch Hill YC, the Captain of Aphrodite cranked her up to 37 knots as they came up the channel! That must have been a spectacular sight - and what fun for Alan who has been so involved in the history of not only Aphrodite but all the boats built by the Purdy Boat Company.\n\nThe Cow Bay Cruising Association has published its 2006 Series: Warm-up is May 11 and 18. The Spring Series: May 25 through July 13; the Fall Series is from July 20 through Sept. 7. The series is open to auxiliary powered cruising sailboats, 22 feet or more and equipped with lifeline, running lights (must be on after sunset) and head, whose owners have registered with the CBCA. All boats must be capable of motoring to and from the starting areas. Skippers are strongly requested to be members of the YRA of LIS. Entries must be made on CBCA application and no boat will be scored without a fully filled out and paid up entry form. Current PHRF handicap ratings as assigned by the YRA of LIS will be used. There are five divisions: Division I (fastest rating boats); Division II (the middle rating boats); Division III (the slower rating boats); Division IV (boats rating above 200); and Catamarans.

The construction contracts were awarded to the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company\n\nFairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, which at the time was one of Britain's biggest producers of warships.

It has been a leading operator of passenger ships on the North Atlantic for over a centuryever fitted to a Cunard ship. These engines were also the largest in the world at the time, and still rank today amongst the largest of the type ever constructed. They represent the limits of development for this kind of technology, which was superseded a few years later by turbine technology. In height, the engines reached from the double-bottom floor of the engine room to the top of the superstructure - almost three stories. Each engine had five cylinders. There were two low pressure cylinders on each engine, each measuring 8\u00b42\" (2.48 m) in diameter, and they operated with a stoke of 5' 9\" (1.75 m). Together, the engines could generate 31000 IHP, which produced an average speed of 22 knots (43.1 km\/h), and a record speed of 23\u00bd knots. Normal operating speed for the engines was about 79 rpm. (Note: a modern automobile engine idles at approximately 10 times that speed)\n\nThe two engines were each placed in a separate watertight engine compartment; in case of a hull breach in that area, only one engine room would then be flooded, and the ship would still have power to return to port with the adjacent engine. In addition to this Lucania had 16 transverse watertight compartments, which meant that she could remain afloat with any two compartments flooded.\n\nPassenger accommodations\n\nIn their day, Lucania and her sister offered the most luxurious first-class passenger accommodations available. It wasopulence at its peak\u2014an expression of a highly confident and prosperous age that would never be quite repeated on any other ship. All the first-class public rooms, and the en-suite staterooms of the upper deck, were generally heavily panelled, in oak, satinwood or mahogany; and thickly carpeted. Velvet curtains hung aside the windows and portholes, while the furniture was richly upholstered in matching design. The predominant style was Art Nouveau, although other styles were also in use, such as \"French Renaissance\" which was applied to the forward first-class entrance hall, whilst the 1st class smoking room was in \"Elizabethan style\", comprising heavy oak panels surrounding the first open fireplace ever to be used aboard a passenger liner.\n\nPerhaps the finest room in the vessels was the first class dining saloon, over 10' (3.05 m) high and measuring 98' (30 m) long by 63' (19.2 m) wide. Over the central part of this room was a well that rose through three decks to a skylight. It was done in a style described as \"modified Italian style\", with the a coffered ceiling in white and gold, supported by ionic pillars. The panelled walls were done in Spanish mahogany, inlaid with ivory and richly carved with pilasters and decorations.\n\nDr. Basil Jack Greenhill , was a diplomat, museum director and historian.He went to Bristol Grammar School, before reading philosophy, politics and economics at Bristol University, but his time there was interrupted by wartime naval service...\n\n, in his book Merchant Steamships felt that the interiors of Lucania and Campania represented the ultimate expression of the Victorian age, and remarked that later vessels' interiors degenerated into \"grandiose vulgarity, the classical syntax debased to mere jargon\".\n\nWireless history\n\nIn 1901 Lucania became the first Cunard liner to be fitted with awireless system, followed a few months later by Campania. Shortly after these installations, the two ships made history by exchanging the first wireless transmitted ice bulletin; and two years after that, Lucania made history again, this time by publishing an on-board newspaper based on information received by wireless telegraphy whilst at sea. The newspaper was called Cunard Daily Bulletin and quickly became a success.\n\nFinal days\n\nLucania and Campania served as Cunard's major passenger liners for 14 years, during which time both liners were superseded in speed and size by a succession of four-funnelled German liners, starting with the in 1897. The German competition necessitated the construction of replacements for the two Cunarders, which came to fruition in 1907 with the appearance of the and .

{"text":"Note the position of those shoes. Now think about the position of your feet if you were to lie on the floor, on your side, with your ankles crossed. This is not a coincidence. On his blog, NPR's Robert Krulwich quotes Titanic explorer Robert Ballard:\n\n\"There used to be bodies in those shoes. The body parts deteriorated, and the skeletal remains decalcified. The only thing left are the shoes, and the leather is perfectly preserved.\" The tannin in the shoe leather had apparently resisted the bacteriaWhile the Titanic was certainly a tragedy, it was hardly the worst maritime disaster ever. Not even close, really. You have to wonder why the Titanic dead get all this recognition while more profound disasters go virtually forgotten.\n\nBecause the Titanic was unsolved for nearly a hundred years. I guess I'm 'dating myself' when I say I can remember when they finally found where the wreck was at! Until then it had been a mystery.\n\nredstarr\n\nThere were some very rich and prominent people at the time on the ship. It made for an exciting story. Famous people, regular people, poor people, all on an extravagant ship, plunged into the ocean, some died, some survived, it was a bit mysterious who might have been at fault, corporate greed, human error, nature, fate. It had star power, adventure, tragedy, triumph, and mystery that captured the public's interest and made it a big deal.\n\nWreckrob8\n\nThe Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time. It was on its maiden voyage. Notwithstanding that its passengers included many of the wealthiest people on the planet. That wouldn't cloud people's judgement, would it?\n\nAmbiguity\n\nAgree with all of the above. It isn't hard to understand at all why the Titanic captures so much imagination (if you give it a few seconds thought). Unless, of course, you're just using the story to be a wee bit pedantic (not that that ever happens in the Internet!), or, for some reason, you think numbers are more interesting than the narratives around which we structure our lives.\n\n(Meant to reply to nanuq, by the way.)\n\n royaltrux\n\nAnd radio being so new at the time\u2026\n\nGeekMan\n\nNot to mention of course, that in all likelihood, no pair of boots could independently fall 3.8km through the ocean and come to rest exactly beside eachother.\n\nA human being was their vessel. Their owner is long gone, but those two shoes will be together as long as their last, an eerie tombstone on the sea floor.\n\nmccrum\n\nUnless they were in a non-leather suitcase or other container\u2026\n\n 64k a Day\n\nI am literally having the tears\u2026* jerked out of me* as I type this.\n\nJames B\n\nThat place should be designated something like a grave site, and left alone. I wouldn't want people gawking over my boots in my final resting place.\n\nVicqRuiz\n\nIf the Titanic had sunk in 150 feet depth, she'd have been salvaged to a faretheewell by 1920, bodies or no bodies.\n\nplanettom\n\nI remember reading somewhere that, when people are exploring the ocean floor, the incongruous thing they find most often are lightbulbs. Strangely intact; often they don't seem to break on impact or due to pressure as you'd think they might.\n\nCunning\n\nAre they suggesting the wearer of these boots was lying on their side, with their ankles crossed when they died? Clearly the body would float for several days after death before sinking to it's final resting spot.\n\nsnagglepuss\n\nNot necessarily. They could have belonged to a body that was dragged down with the ship, and never got a chance to bob to the surface before finally settling to the ocean floor.\n\nCunning\n\nIt would not have bobbed to the surface but it would have bobbed to the cabin ceiling. The cabins would not remain airtight at those depths.\n\n Robert Baruch\n\nOr maybe it was one of the people who jumped overboard and froze to death in the sea. I heard something on NPR the other day about a woman who, as a very young girl, was on the ship that passed through the area a few days after the sinking. They stopped to pick up bodies that were still floating there.\n\nsnagglepuss\n\nRight. the cabin could have been flooded, but not in a way that allowed the trapped body to reach the surface. After a few weeks or so, it falls to the ocean floor.\n\nI'm not prepared, really, to think about the specifics of the duel between the pressures down there versus the gaseous swellings of a decomposing body\u2026.\n\ntsol\n\nI remember reading about kayakers discovering a dead body floating just below the surface of the East River (NYC) a few years ago. Apparently the person drowned sometime during the winter and the corpse remained on the bottom of the river for the duration of the cold weather. Then spring came and the water warmed up enough for buoyancy to re-establish itself and the body floated back up.\n\nThe only people dragged down with the Titanic were inside it. There was no \"suction effect\" because the ship sank slowly. The US Senate investigating commission specifically asked survivors in the water, some of whom were literally on the ship as it sank, if there was any such phenomenon and none said there was.\n\nNever meant to sound like I was endorsing the \"sucked down\" myth \u2013 I watch \"Mythbusters\", too, and I understand that it's a falsehood.\nI was talking about people who could have been trapped in their cabins, or entangled in rigging or anything else \u2013 They got just as dead, but the ship itself prevented their corpses from getting back to the surface.\n\nYeesh, people \u2013 This whole debate is getting almost as disrespectful as the \"preservationists\" who have been looting the Titanic's resting place\u2026\n\nDv Revolutionary\n\nIf you aren't obese then all you have to do is breath out and\/or inhale water and you tend to sink. You are no longer buoyant. You are made of bones and muscle and without air in your lungs or a big fat reserve you are denser than water and tend to go down.\nPeople drown and rest on the bottom of whatever body of water they are in. It's the horrible reason we send divers to find drowned swimmers in rivers and lakes. They may bloat up later and float up again or they may not, That depends on what's in their stomach, if it can't be outgassed and if their body is caught on something.\n\nCunning\n\n\u2026and the more I think about it, the more unlikely it seems that the body rested in this position. Don't bodies tend to bloat when submerged? The legs should have been outstretched.\n\n*takes off sunglasses and turns from body* somebody made a titanic effort to make this look like a drowning\u2026.YEAAAAHHHHHHH!\n\n AwesomeRobot\n\nThere's a lot of pressure down there, so I imagine bloating wouldn't really overcome that \u2014 though I'm not an expert in deep sea decomposition or anything.\n\n BonzoDog1\n\nI was going to object to the grave-robbing by RMS Titanic, Inc., but then I found the parent company, Premier Exhibitions, makes most of its money displaying cadavers from China to the public, so what's the use?\nThere oughta be a sea law!\n\n Hamish Grant\n\nsomewhat related, the on-going arrival of leg-and-running shoe combinations washing up on the beaches in British Columbia\u2026\n\nBest theory is that the owners of these feet-and-shoes either fell\/jumped off a bridge, or a boat out at sea and sank, and their bodies were consumed by marine life to the point that the weight of the body could no longer keep the buoyant running shoes below, and the legs separated from the body and floated to the surface, eventually washing up on shore.\n\nDv Revolutionary\n\nPoetic. Don't mention the whale fall sort of scavengers that probably were part of the process, that would make the scene horrific.\n\nJohn Stephens\n\nInteresting. I wonder if any if those shoe pairs were custom work, that could be identified after all these years? Possibly someone would like to know an ancestor's last resting place. And then again, perhaps not. Anyway, I routinely wear my old military dog tags on airplane flights, just in case. Maybe I should tuck a pair in my shoes if I'm ever on a cruise?\n\nxzzy\n\nI don't buy this interpretation, but that's the fun with archaeology.. much of it gets to be interpreted however you like!\n\nI just can't envision how a corpse would naturally settle in such a significant manner and then survive 100 years to be discovered in the same position. I mean, the Titantic sank two and a half miles. The owner of those boots was probably dead within a quarter mile of sea level.\n\nThe other debris in the photo says to me it's the contents of a suitcase that decomposed away. But I guess it's just as possible that it's random debris from the ship that just happened to settle nearby. Again, that's the fun wit archaeology.\n\nGiven that many people will remove their shoes if they must jump into the water, tying their shoes together in order to help hold on to them (or to put them on the deck), I wouldn't necessarily leap to the conclusion that there was a body in them\u2013not without evidence.\n\ndesperado\n\nSo, what you're telling me is that I should keep a copy of my ID in my SHOES, so that I can be identified in 100 years, in the event of death by berg, or some similar cause.\n\nmccrum\n\nBe sure that your ID is made out of similar shoe material or encased in similar shoe-materials. There have been specific instances of paper from the Titanic being brought to the surface, but they are the exception due to protective cases, not the rule.\n\nTouch Sensitive\n\nI don't know why it hasn't been linked, but there's a, 'coat and shoes' release, of a previously cropped photograph. Dating from the late 1990\u2032s. A pair of shoes reinforced by a coat lying face down.\n\nI was convinced this was on the BBC website, but it seems to have vanished. Some of the links may be a tad 'tabloid-ish', as a result. Humble apologies..\n\nYikes. The IrishCentral link includes an article that argues with a straight face that the teaching of evolution led to the Columbine massacre. Not to criticize you, but \"a tad tabloidish\" is putting it mildly.\n\n Rock Hardwood\n\nOn the local news, they had this story, but had a graphic warning, said this might be disturbing.. BODY parts found.. there's no body.. just shoes..\n\nI wonder what the body would have looked like though, under all that pressure.\n\n Red Monk\n\nIs it just me or does that look like a very unnatural way for a set of feet to end up?\n\nfiatrn\n\nAccording to Dr Ballard's book on discovering the Titanic, the cold temperatures keep bodies from producing gas and floating. So instead, people who drowned stayed at the bottom once they sank. And if you take a water logged heavy object and sink it in over 12,000 feet of water, I imagine it can land in any wacky way.\n\nthe FiatRN\n\n Rosin Ffield\n\ni don't feel it is correct that \"the bones decaclified\". Where i used to live they found a wooden boat COMPLETELY intact from prehistoric times. What i think happened is that someone had their shoe-pair tied in a suitcase. In the past people used to tie their shoes one to the other with the laces."}

After the note about Jan Pietersz Deught, who served the Directors of Medemblik, who was chosen as kapitein of the Sint Jeronimus on 23 April 1652, I need to reassess the situation. I also know that Hendrik de Raedt's pamphlet from late 1652 lists a Captain Jacob Pieterszoon Eenarm as captain of a Medemblik Directors' ship of 30 guns and a crew of 110 men. This pamphlet seems to have been one of the sources used in the 1652 Hollandsche Mercurius list that was republished in The First Dutch War, Vol.I. The First Dutch War, Vol.III, page 47, has a letter from Tromp, dated November 16th, 1652, saying that he had ordered the Sint Jeronimus paid off. Dr. Elias, in Schetsen uit de Geschiedenis van ons Zeewezen, Vol.IV, page 27, sayst that the crew rebelled against going to sea in the Sint Jeronimus, and that was what prompted Tromp to order the ship paid off. The ship was apparently was unseaworthy. The date seems to have been about a week earlier than that reported in The First Dutch War. Dr. Elias is silent on the captain's name."}

The engineer and his assistants had their accomodation here.\n\nThe airship was kept in trim with the aid of many 10 cubic metre ballast tanks dotted around the hull. There were two main ballast tanks, each capable of holding up to 100 tonnes of water, fore and aft. The ballast itself was a mixtire of water and an anti-freeze, typically glycol.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, there were controls fore and aft which would have jetissoned all the ballast, all the fuel or all the cargo. There were also 45 parachutes fitted, 15 in each gondola, in the event of an emergency. If a fire broke out on board, the crew could use carbon dioxide or water fire extinguishers. There was also the option to attach hosepipes to the ballast, to use the water for fire-fighting."}

{"text":"Today's submarines run on nuclear power, yet there are so many amazing similarities to the design of the H.L. Hunley with that of today's \"fast attack submarines,\" such as adjustable diving planes; water ballast tanks, equalized for balance; long, cigar-shaped hull; and movable snorkel tubes for drawing air into the sub while submerged.\n\nMuscle, sweat, desperation, and courage.\n\nThe light of a single candle deep in the darkness of the unknown.\n\nThe anticipation of victory fueled this sleek, dark iron sub and innovation navigated it to her target.\n\nSince the recovery of the H.L. Hunley, we have learned that the navigational tools were far more advanced than most experts initially thought. The H.L. Hunley truly illustrates the genius that can be spawned by a desperate time.\n\nDuring the excavation of the H.L. Hunley in 2001, archaeologists uncovered a vertical steering rod approximately 70 centimeters long in the front end of the submarine. It is likely that this\nrod is hinged at its base to a connection device that that runs through a pipe along the interior port side of the submarine underneath the crew bench to the stern area. In the stern, the connection would exit the submarine at some point and attach to the rudder, although further research still needs to be done to document exactly how all of this was interlinked.\n\nThe vertical steering rod is similar to an airplane joystick and could move in two directions from port to starboard side. This could very well be the world's first joystick for navigating a vessel. At present, it appears to be part of an involved system of rods and\/or cables used to connect the submarine rudder while neatly placing it in the limited quarters out of the crew's way.\n\nMaria Jacobsen, Senior Archaeologist on the H.L. Hunley project, noted that from what can be seen, the steering mechanism is both \"simple and elegant representing a design for efficiency and space.\" More and more, the H.L. Hunley is being revealed as an engineering marvel way ahead of her time.\n\nThe two lateral fins, or \"dive planes\", were connected by a horizontal rod. By moving a lever inside the H.L. Hunley the dive planes could be adjusted, changing the sub's underwater position and depth.\n\nWith the incredible fortitude, sweat, fear and courage of the crew, the sub was powered manually by turning a crankshaft which in turn powered the propeller. Imagine turning it for miles. Imagine the thoughts running through your mind as the rhythm of eight iron cranks turned -\n\"the stale air barely keeping the flickering candle alive...\""}

{"text":"An inside look at the science of cleaning up and fixing the mess of marine pollution\n\nRemembering the Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald\n\nToday, November 10, is the anniversary of the wreck of the S\/S Edmund Fitzgerald, the largest shipwreck in the Great Lakes. The ship and entire crew of 29 men were lost in a storm on Lake Superior on November 10, 1975. I remember listening to Gordon Lightfoot's 1976 hit song [leaves this blog] about the wreck, and it still catches my attention when I hear it playing.\n\nThe sinking of the Edmund Fitzgerald, a ship measuring 729 feet long and 26,000 tons, is one of the most well-known disasters in the history of Great Lakes shipping. The ship's remains lie just over the border in Canadian waters at a depth of 530 feet.\n\nMy connection to the Edmund Fitzgerald comes from my work on historic ships that may still pose a threat of oil pollution. The ship was designed to carry taconite (iron ore) pellets, but it carried fuel oil for its engines.\n\nBased on the condition and damage of the ship's hull and the large heaps of taconite around the wreckage, it is unlikely to contain much oil, but we have the ship in our database of potentially polluting wrecks.\n\nThe Edmund Fitzgerald is a reminder that our maritime history is not limited to the marine waters. The Great Lakes are very much a coastline (and shipping hub) of the United States, and just like along our salt water shorelines, NOAA is active in charting, weather, research, and coastal management there as well.\n\nShare this:"}

{"text":"A bridge wing is a narrow walkway that extends outward from the pilot's house on a ship to the outside edges of the vessel. Commonly outfitted with a control panel on each side, the bridge wing provides an optimal visual position for a captain to maneuver the ship when docking. Large ships typically place the ship's wheel and other vital controls in the center of the bridge. This positioning does not provide a good view of the ship's outer hull area for the captain as the ship enters close quarters, such as a crowded port or dock area. By moving to the bridge wing, the captain is afforded a much better view of the proximity of the vessel to the dock.\n\nDue, in part, to the vast length of some ships, many large vessels are equipped not only with propellers to move the ship fore and aft, but devices known as thrusters also are positioned in the hull of the ship to assist in moving the craft from port to starboard and back. This side-to-side motion is commonly required when attempting to dock larger vessels. The main difficulty in this side-to-side movement of the ship is proper vision. The solution to this problem, for many ships, is the bridge wing.\n\nThe bridge wing allows the captain of a ship to get a much clearer understanding of what needs to be done to the ship when entering or exiting a docking position by allowing him to look straight down the side of the hull. While not a complete set of controls, there are enough controls located on a panel on both sides of the ship's bridge wing to enable the captain to use the thrusters and rudder to complete the docking maneuver in most cases. In some circumstances, the outside control panels require a key to enable or disable them, thereby preventing unwanted or unauthorized use from anyone other than the ship's captain.\n\nOn very long cruises, the ship's captain might take the opportunity to stand on the bridge wing and get a breath of fresh air. The area surrounding the bridge wing is very rarely closed in. This area is designed to remain an open area, designed to give a bird's-eye view of the side of the ship's hull, and enclosing the area would be self-defeating. Occasionally, a spotlight will be fitted to the railing of the bridge wing to allow the captain to brighten any dark area, thus providing the best visual picture of the area possible."}

If you HAVEN'T been on a cruise yet, now you will learn what to expect!\n\nA thrifty traveler isn't just someone who wants to get the most out of every travel dollar.

{"text":"There was an hour of intense drama on Ruby Princess last night when a passenger gave the 'Man Overboard' alert.\n\nWhile the way the crew handled the event was nothing but impressive, the reaction of the passengers was fascinating and in some cases, bizarre.\n\nThe captain made an announcement about an hour out of Mykonos, as the sun was beginning to set. \"Man overboard, port side\". I'm on the starboard side. So what do I do? Rush out onto the balcony, only to find that pretty well everybody else on the starboard side had rushed out onto their balcony. I met many of my neighbours for the first time.\n\nEverybody was in a state of mild shock, wondering if it was for real.\n\nBeing a nosy journalist, I went down to the promenade deck to see what was going on. But in under five minutes since the announcement, the crew had sealed the outside decks with 'crime scene'-style yellow tape. All the officers who weren't on the bridge or guarding the doors, where small crowds had formed, were gathered on the port side and a red flare was streaming smoke from a distant spot on the water. One man said excitedly, \"This is awesome,\" as though it was some kind of entertainment that had been laid on. Another guy said to his friend, \"Come on, let's go to the casino.\" A Japanese man turned up with a huge Nikon, full zoom lens attached, presumably hoping for some gruesome action.\n\nMost upsetting was the frightened parents who were running up and down the stairs in panic, trying to remember where they last saw their kids (there are a lot of families onboard with teens who do their own thing on the ship).\n\nMeanwhile, the art auctioneer calmly continued to describe the 'Picassos' in the Explorers' Lounge. The scene was truly surreal.\n\nAt this stage, we still didn't know if there was an actual person in the water and the ship was a-twitter with rumour; it's incredible how quickly untrue speculation spreads, the most chilling part of which was that a child had gone missing. Passenger Services started naming people who should make contact. The captain made a grim-sounding request for the person who had sounded the alarm to identify themselves. A Greek coastguard boat was spotted heading towards us. But by now, the flare had burned itself out and the sun had set.\n\nThe crowds dispersed and people ambled into dinner, where I kept a vigil by the window; at this point, the ship was almost stationary in the water as the search continued. I don't know how you're supposed to react in a situation like this; it seemed like something potentially so enormous and so tragic, but most people just kept on eating. On the other hand, what else were they supposed to do?\n\nEventually, the captain made another announcement and the entire dining room fell quiet; you could have heard a pin drop. The person who sounded the alarm had failed to identify themselves; the crew had done all they could; nobody had seen a person in the water or, indeed, the blue sunlounger which had caught the alarm-sounder's attention in the first place; and we would resume our course to Piraeus.\n\nSo it was a false alarm that turned out to affect a lot of people. The officers, the engine room crew, the dining room service crew, all the passengers who were separated from their family at the time, the Greek coastguard\u2026 I imagine one passenger is feeling very foolish indeed today. But the episode has certainly given me a thorough respect for the intense emergency training that cruise ships' crew receive.\n\n3 Responses to Man overboard \u2013 or not?\n\nI hope this deters others (passengers or crew) from doing this devasting act. Luckily it was just a false alarm. The cruiselines train their crew for just this type of emergency continuely, so we are safe when onboard.\n\nI was also on the Ruby at this time. We had just finished dinner, and after checking on the rest of our party (my sister's husband and 9-yr-old son didn't come to dinner) we headed to the theatre for the nightly show. With 30 minutes to go before the show began the crew started handing out balloons to the audience. Little did they know that what would start out as a few people hitting their balloons to each other would erupt into a full-fledge balloon compact zone. After 10 minutes of chaotic exuberance, the crew took to the stage for an all-in rendition of YMCA. While we still didn't know at this time if someone had in fact gone overboard, we were all feeling much more relaxed. And as the show let out we were all quite relieved to hear it was a false alarm, and that the ship was back on track towards Athens. This is definitely the most bizarre experience I've ever had on a cruise, and one I won't soon forget.\n\nWe were on the same cruise and this incident happened while we were at dinner at a window table\u2026.so we had a first hand view of the proceedings including crew flying through the emerg exit near our table to take up stations. My first reaction was that it was a prank much like pulling a fire alarm. However a few years ago on RCI we did a sea rescue early in the morning off the Bahamas where a wretch, father of two, had run out of gas on a jet ski and drifted out to sea. He was drifting more than a day so was extremely dehydrated. Made CNN news."}
{"text":"Arctic explorer Sir John Franklin set off on May 19th, 1845, intending to map the middle section of the Northwest Passage. Now Canadian officials are using this historic expedition to boost Canada's claims to Arctic sovereignty, hoping that discovering the wrecks will bring international attention to Canada's Arctic history. Additionally, both historical and contemporary searches for these famous ships have led to increased charting of the Canadian Arctic territory.\n\nAlthough interest in recovering the Erebus and the Terror has existed since the ships went missing, the Canadian government has renewed its efforts since 2008, when the recent series of explorations was launched as a collaborative effort between Parks Canada, the Canadian Hydrographic Service, the Canadian Coast Guard, and the Government of Nunavut. [1]\n\nAt the launch of the expedition, the Minister of the Environment (in 2008\u2014now serving as Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs) John Baird stated: \"We certainly think by establishing a long-standing presence in the Arctic that can enhance issues of sovereignty ... Look at the strait (the Northwest Passage) not far from where this ship is\u2026.We think every bit of weight we can put behind our case for sovereignty is important. Adding history to that equation can only enhance that case.\" [2]\n\nCoincidentally, mapping uncharted Arctic territory was also a goal of the Franklin Expedition. Franklin, a veteran of Arctic mapping expeditions, set sail on May 19th,1845 with 129 crew members. [4] The two ships became immobilized in ice floes in 1846 in the Victoria Strait near King William Island. About a year after Franklin's death in 1847, the crew members, suffering from health problems like tuberculosis, scurvy, and lead poisoning, decided to abandon the ships and seek help on foot.\n\nBetween 1847-1887 more than 26 searches for the ships were conducted, but none of the crew members was found alive. Although unsuccessful in finding survivors and shipwrecks, these expeditions produced more detailed maps of the Canadian Arctic. [5] Search missions continued through the twentieth century, leading to the remarkable discoveries of three frozen, mummified bodies, an expedition note, and bone fragments.\n\nIn 1992, the yet-undiscovered wreck sites were declared National Historic Sites of Canada, and in 1997 the UK and Canada signed a Memorandum of Understanding that the ships belong to Canada.\n\nAccording to Baird, the Canadian Arctic lacks some international legitimacy: \"it's certainly part of what we call Canada; others don't necessarily recognize that claim. So we're committed to doing everything we can to have a presence in the north - environmentally, whether it's establishing a long-standing presence and history, whether it's resource-based, whether it's militarily...\" [6]\n\nBy continuing to research and explore the Arctic, the Canadian government is continuing Franklin's mission of mapping remote territory. While Franklin \"had put a roof on the map of Canada, and given a definite shape to the North American Continent\" [7], the Canadian government is ensuring that the \"roof\" of the country continues to be a recognized part of Canada."}

Nathaniel Philbrick now restores this story - which inspired the climactic scene in Herman Melville's Moby Dick - to its rightful place in American history.\" \"In 1819, the 238-ton Essex set sail from Nantucket on a routine voyage for whales. Fifteen months later, the unthinkable happened: in the farthest reaches of the South Pacific, the Essex was rammed and sunk by an enraged sperm whale. Its twenty-man crew, fearing cannibals on the islands to the west, decided instead to sail their three tiny boats for the distant South American coast. They would eventually travel over 4,500 miles. The next three months tested just how far humans could go in their battle against the sea as, one by one, they succumbed to hunger, thirst, disease, and fear.\" \"Nathaniel Philbrick brings an incredible story to life, from the intricacies of Nantucket's whaling economy and the mechanics of sailing a square-rigger to the often mysterious behavior of whales.

Construction (1936\u20131939 America was laid down under the first Maritime Commission contract on 22 August 1938, at Newport NewsFuerteventura, a Spanish Island, is one of the Canary Islands, in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Africa.\n\nA shipwreck or sunken ship can refer to the remains of a wrecked ship or to the event that caused the wreck, such as the striking of something that causes the ship to sink, the stranding of the ship on rocks, land or shoal, or the destruction of the ship at sea by violent weather. [1] There are more than 3 million shipwrecks on the ocean floor, the United Nations estimates. [2]\n\nTypes of shipwrecks\n\nHistoric shipwrecks are attractive to maritime archaeologists because they preserve historical information; for example, studying the wreck of Mary Rose revealed information about seafaring, warfare and life in the 1500s. Maritime archaeology (also known as marine archaeology) is a discipline that studies human interaction with the Sea, lakes and rivers through the study of vesselsThe Mary Rose was an English Tudor Carrack warship and one of the first to be able to fire a full Broadside of cannons Military wrecks that were caused by a skirmish at sea are studied to find details about the historic event and reveal much about the battle that occurred. Discoveries of treasure ships, often from the period of European colonisation, which sunk in remote places, leaving few living witnesses, such as the Batavia, do occur but only very infrequently. A Treasure ship is the name for a type of large wooden vessel commanded by the Chinese admiral Zheng He on seven voyages in the early fifteenth centuryColonisation (also known as Colonization) occurs whenever any one or more species populates a new areaMutiny on the Batavia Departure On 29 October 1628, the newly built Batavia, commissioned by the Dutch East India Company\n\nSome contemporary wrecks, such as the Prestige or Erika, are of interest primarily because of the potential harm to the environment. The Prestige was an Oil tanker whose sinking in 2002 off the Galician coast caused a large Oil spill.Erika was the name of a tanker built in 1975 and last chartered by Total-Fina-Elf. Other contemporary wrecks are scuttled in order to spur reef growth, such as Adolphus Busch and the Ocean Freeze. Wrecks like Adolphus Busch and many historic wrecks such as SS Thistlegorm are of interest to recreational divers who enjoy diving shipwrecks because they are often interesting to explore, provide large habitats for many types of marine life and have an interesting history. Construction The vessel was privately owned and therefore not classified as a Naval vessel.Recreational diving or sport diving is a type of diving that uses SCUBA equipment for the purpose of leisure and enjoyment\n\nVery few shipwrecks are famous catastrophes like the wrecks of the Titanic or Estonia. TheConstruction The Titanic was a White Star Line ocean liner built at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, IrelandConstruction The ship was originally ordered from Meyer Werft by a Norwegian shipping company led by Parley Augustsen with intended traffic between There are also thousands of wrecks that were not lost at sea but have been abandoned or sunk. These are typically smaller vessels such as fishing vessels. These vessels can provide an interesting recreational dive but are usually of little interest to historians. Scuba diving is swimming underwater, or taking part in another activity while using a Scuba set. They may pose a hazard to navigation and may be removed by port authorities. In Canada and the United States a port authority (less commonly a port district) is a governmental or quasi-governmental Public authority These vessels are sometimes referred to as abandoned or derelicts.\n\nShipwrecks and the law\n\nShipwreck law determines important legal questions regarding wrecks, perhaps the most important question being the question of ownership.\n\nThe British Protection of Wrecks Act, enacted to protect historic wrecks, controls access to wrecks such as Cattewater Wreck which can only be visited or investigated under licence. Kyrill While en route from Belgium to Portugal, on January 18 2007, during European windstorm Kyrill, severe galeThe Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 (1973 c33 is an Act of Parliament in the United Kingdom which provides protection for designated wrecks.The Cattewater Wreck is a wooden three-masted skeleton-built vessel one of many ships that have wrecked in Cattewater. The British Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 also restricts access to wrecks which are sensitive as war graves. The Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 (1986 c 35 is an Act of Parliament in the United Kingdom which provides protection for the wreckage of military aircraftA war grave is a place where War dead are buried It may contain either a combatant or a civilian The Protection of Military Remains Act in some cases creates a blanket ban on all diving, for others divers may visit provided they do not touch, interfere with or penetrate the wreck. In the United States, shipwrecks in state waters are regulated by the Abandoned Shipwreck Act of 1987. This act is much more lenient in allowing more open access to the shipwrecks.\n\nFollowing the beaching of the MSC Napoli, as a result of severe damage incurred during European windstorm Kyrill, there was confusion in the press and by the authorities about whether people could be prevented from helping themselves to the flotsam which was washed up on the beaches at Branscombe. Kyrill While en route from Belgium to Portugal, on January 18 2007, during European windstorm Kyrill, severe galeAbstract A European windstorm is a severe Cyclonic Storm that moves across the North Atlantic towards northwesternBranscombe is a village in the East Devon district of the English County of Devon. Many people took advantage of the confusion and helped themselves to the cargo. This included many BMW motorbikes [1] and empty wine casks as well as bags of disposable nappies. ( BMW) (Bavarian Motor Works is an independent German automobile manufacturer founded in 1916 The legal position under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 is that any such finds and recovery must be reported within 28 days to the Receiver of Wreck. The Receiver of Wreck, a post defined under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 is an official of the British government whose main task is to process incoming reportsThe Receiver of Wreck, a post defined under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 is an official of the British government whose main task is to process incoming reports[2] Failure to do so is an offence under the Merchant Shipping Act and can result in a criminal record for theft by finding. [3] After several days, the police and Receiver of Wreck, in conjunction with the landowner and the contracted salvors, established a cordon to prevent access to the beach. Marine salvage is the process of rescuing a ship its cargo and sometimes the crew from peril[4] A similar situation occurred after the wreck of the MV Cita in 1997. On 26 March, 1997, the 300-ft Merchant vessel MV Cita pierced its hull when running aground on rocks off the south coast of the Isles of Scilly\n\nAn important international convention aiming at the protection of underwater cultural heritage (including shipwrecks) is the UNESCO 2001 Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. The 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage represents the international community's response to the increasing looting and destruction of underwater cultural heritage. It forms part of a group of UNESCO standard setting instruments regarding the domain of cultural heritage, encompassing seven conventions adopted by UNESCO Member States, which constitute a coherent and complementary body guaranteeing a complete protection of all forms of cultural heritage.\n\nThe UNESCO 2001 Convention is an international treaty aimed exclusively at the protection of underwater cultural heritage and the facilitation of international cooperation in this regard. It does not change sovereignty rights of States or regulate the ownership of wrecks or submerged ruins.\n\nSalvage of wrecks\n\nOften, attempts are made to salvage recently wrecked ships to recover the whole or part of the ship, its cargo, or its equipment. Marine salvage is the process of rescuing a ship its cargo and sometimes the crew from peril A good example of this was the salvage of the Kaiserliche MarineHigh Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow in the 1920s. The Kaiserliche Marine or Imperial Navy was the German Navy created by the formation of the German Empire.The High Seas Fleet (Hochseeflotte was the main battle fleet of the Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial German Navy during World War I.Scapa Flow ( Old Norse: Skalpafl\u00f3i) is a body of water in the Orkney Islands, Scotland, United Kingdom, sheltered by the islands The unauthorized salvage of wrecks is called wrecking. Wrecking is the practice of taking valuables from a Shipwreck which has foundered near or close to shore\n\nAs a general rule, civilian shipwrecks are considered fair game for salvage; military wrecks, however, remain under the jurisdiction--and hence, protection--of the government that lost the ship, or that government's successor. Hence, a GermanU-boat from World War II still technically belongs to the German government, even though the Third Reich is long-defunct. Many military wrecks are also protected by virtue of their being war graves. A war grave is a place where War dead are buried It may contain either a combatant or a civilian\n\nOlder wrecks are often protected from pillaging and looting through national laws protecting cultural heritage. Internationally they may be protected by a State ratifying the Unesco Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. The UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage, adopted by the UNESCO General Conference on 2 November 2001 (hereinafter the 2001 In this case pillaging is not allowed.\n\ninstability, due to poor design, improperly stowed cargo, cargo that shifts its position or the free surface effect.

A hull is the body of a Ship or Boat. It is a central concept in floating vessels as it provides the Buoyancy that keeps the vessel from sinkingIn Physics, buoyancy ( BrE IPA: \/\u02c8b\u0254\u026a\u0259nsi\/ is the upward Force on an object produced by the surrounding liquid or gas in which it isThe free surface effect is one of several mechanisms where a craft can become unstable and roll-over ( Capsize) Even the hulls of large modern ships have cracked in heavy storms. A storm is any disturbed state of an astronomical body's atmosphere, especially affecting its surface and strongly implying Severe weather. Leaks between the hull planks of wooden vessels is a particular problem.\n\nFailure of pumps can lead to the loss of a potentially salvageable ship with only a minor leak or fire.\n\nFailure of the means of propulsion, such as engines, sails or rigging, can lead to the loss of a ship. An engine is a mechanical device that produces some form of output from a given inputA sail is any type of surface intended to generate Thrust by being placed in a Wind &mdashin essence a vertically-oriented Wing.Rigging (from Anglo-Saxon wrigan or wringing, &quotto clothe&quot is on Sailboats and Sailing ships the collection of When the ship's movement is determined only by currents or the wind and particularly by storms, a common result is that the ship is unable to avoid natural hazards like rocks, shallow water or tidal races. Wind is the flow of Air or other Gases that compose an Atmosphere (including but not limited to the Earth's)A storm is any disturbed state of an astronomical body's atmosphere, especially affecting its surface and strongly implying Severe weather.In Geology, rock is a naturally occurring aggregate of Minerals and\/or Mineraloids The Earth's outer solid layer the ' LithosphereTidal race (or tidal rapid) is a natural occurrence whereby a fast moving Tide passes through a constriction resulting in the formation of Waves eddies\n\nInstability\n\nInstability is caused by the centre of mass of the ship rising above the metacenter resulting in the ship tipping on its side or capsizing. Mass is a fundamental concept in Physics, roughly corresponding to the Intuitive idea of how much Matter there is in an objectThe metacentric height (GM is the distance between the center of gravity of a ship and its metacenterThe common definition for capsized refers to when a Boat or Ship is tipped over until disabled\n\nThis can lead to a sinking if the openings on the upper side of the side are not watertight at the time of the capsise. To remain buoyant, the hull of a vessel must prevent water entering the large air spaces of the vessel (known as downflooding). Clearly for the ship to float, the submerged parts of the hull will be watertight, but the upper parts of the hull must have openings to allow ventilation to compartments, including the engine room, for crew access, and to load and unload cargo.\n\nWind causes waves which result in other difficulties. Wind is the flow of Air or other Gases that compose an Atmosphere (including but not limited to the Earth's)Ocean surface waves are Surface waves that occur on the Free surface of the Ocean. Waves make navigation difficult and dangerous near shallow water. Also, waves create buoyancy stresses on the structure of a hull. The weight of breaking waves on the fabric of the ship force the crew to reduce speed or even travel in the same direction as the waves to prevent damage. Speed is the rate of motion, or equivalently the rate of change in position often expressed as Distance d traveled per unit of Also, wind stresses the rigging of sailing ships.\n\nThe force of the wind pushes ships in the direction of the wind. Vessels with large windage suffer most. Windage is a Force created on an object by Friction when there is relative movement between Air and the object Although powered ships are able to resist the force of the wind, sailing vessels have few defences against strong wind. When strong winds are imminent, sailing vessels typically have several choices:\n\nMany losses of sailing ships were caused by sailing, with a following wind, so far into a bay that the ship became trapped upwind of a lee shore, being unable to sail into the wind to leave the bay. A harbor or harbour (see spelling differences) or haven, is a place where ships may shelter from the Weather or are storedAn anchor is an object often made out of metal that is used to attach a ship to the bottom of a body of water at a specific pointWindward is the direction from which the wind is blowing at the time in questionHeadlands and bays are two related features of the coastal environmentThe terms lee shore and weather or windward shore are nautical terms used to describe a stretch of Shoreline.\n\nLow visibility caused by fog, mist and heavy rain increase the navigator's problems. Fog is a cloud that is in contact with the ground Stratus clouds are usually the only clouds that touch the groundMist is a phenomenon of small droplets suspended in Air. It can occur as part of natural Weather or Volcanic activity and is common in cold air aboveRain is Liquid precipitation. On Earth it is the condensation of atmospheric Water vapor into drops heavy enough to fall often making it to\n\nCold can cause metal to become brittle and fail more easily. A build-up of ice can cause instability by accumulating high on the ship, or in severe cases, crush the hull if the ship becomes trapped in a freezing sea. Ice is a Solid phase, usually crystalline, of a Non-metalic substance that is liquid or gas at Room temperature, such as Ammonia\n\nFire\n\nFire can cause the loss of ships in many ways. The most obvious way would be the loss of a wooden ship which is burned until watertight integrity is compromised (e. g. Cospatrick). History of the Cospatrick The Cospatrick was a Blackwall Frigate of 1199 tons on dimensions of length between perpendiculars beam depth of hold The detonation of cargo or ammunition can cause the breach of a steel hull. Often a large fire causes a ship to be abandoned and left to drift. Should it run aground beyond economic salvage, it becomes a wreck.\n\nNavigation errors\n\nMany shipwrecks have occurred when the crew of the ship allowed the ship to collide with rocks, reefs, icebergs, or other ships. In nautical terminology a reef is a rock, sandbar, or other feature lying beneath the surface of the water (six fathoms or less at low waterAn iceberg is a large piece of freshwater Ice that has broken off from a snow-formed Glacier or Ice shelf and is floating in open water Collision has been one of the major causes of shipwreck. Accurate navigation is made more difficult by poor visibility in bad weather. Also, many losses happened before modern navigation aids such as GPS, radar and sonar were available. Basic concept of GPS operation A GPS receiver calculates its position by carefully timing the signals sent by the constellation of GPS Satellites high above the Earth Until the twentieth century, the most sophisticated navigational tools and techniques available - dead reckoning using the magnetic compass, marine chronometer (to calculate longitude) and ships logbook (which recorded the vessels heading and the speed measured by log) or celestial navigation using marine chronometer and sextant - were sufficiently accurate for journeys across oceans, but these techniques (and in many cases also the charts) lacked the precision to avoid reefs close to shore. Dead reckoning ( DR) is the process of estimating one's current position based upon a previously determined position or fix, and advancing that position based uponA compass, magnetic compass or mariner's compass is a navigational instrument for determining direction relative to the earth's Magnetic poles It consists Logbook was originally a book for recording readings from the log, and is used to determine the distance a ship traveled within a certain amount of timeA chip log, also called common log, ship log or just log, is a Navigation tool used by Mariners to estimate Speed of a vesselCelestial navigation, also known as astronavigation, is a Position fixing technique that was devised to help sailors cross the featureless oceans without having toMarine chronometers were as revolutionary in the 19th century as GPS is today. A marine chronometer is a timekeeper precise enough to be used as a portable Time standard; it can therefore be used to determine Longitude by means of Celestial However the cost of these instruments could be prohibitive, sometimes resulting in tragic consequences for ships that were unable to determine their longitude, as in the case of the ArnistonOverview East Indiaman operated under charter or licence to the Honourable East India Company, which held a monopoly granted by Queen Elizabeth I\n\nEven today, when highly accurate navigational equipment is readily available and universally used, there is still scope for error. Using the incorrect horizontal datum for the chart of an area may mislead the navigator, especially as many charts have not been updated to use modern data. This article describes a concept from Surveying and Geodesy. For other meanings see Datum (disambiguation.A chart or graph is a type of Information graphic, that represents tabular numeric data and\/or functions. It is also important for the navigator to appreciate that charts may be significantly in error, especially on less frequented coasts. For example, a recent revision of the map of South Georgia in the South Atlantic showed that previous maps were in some places in error by several kilometres. South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands ( SGSSI) is a British overseas territory in the southern Atlantic Ocean.\n\nOver the centuries, many technological and organisational developments have been used to reduce accidents at sea including:\n\nIntelligence and better defences to protect the ship from acts of violence, war and piracy\n\nUse of fireproof\/unflamable materials to prevent fires from spreading rapidly, and modern fire-fighting agents such as gases and foams that do not compromise the buoyancy and stability of the vessel as quickly as water.

{"text":"Pages\n\nWednesday, 27 January 2010\n\nOn board a female convict ship to Australia\n\nFrom Syphilis to Scrofula: the diary of a convict ship surgeon\n\n'Men of war bound for the Port of Pleasure' caricature (1791) from the National Maritime Museum\n\nDelving into the lives of female convicts at the National Archives, I came across the medical journals kept by the ship surgeons on transportation ships bound for Australia in the early 1800s. Ship doctors kept detailed notes on the worst cases - and there were quite a few - from syphillis to scrofula. Alongside the common complaints - dysentry, sickness and fever - to be expected on long sea voyages, some of them women suffered from \"hysteria\" or violent emotional outbursts, screaming and shouting.\n\n\"Dirty, lazy women!\"\n\nAs well as listing details of the treatments the surgeons prescribed remedies for the moral character of their patients. One called a less than hygiene-conscious convict, \"a dirty lazy woman\", while praising others for physical attractiveness. The ship surgeons never let themselves forget that the women were criminals and always seem to have been suspicious of their motives. One remarked that his cure for most convict women was to put them on a \"low diet\" (short rations) to weed out the malingerers from the real sick.\n\nMany prisoners were pregnant when they boarded the ship and the journals usually report several births during a voyage. A great deal of these were stillbirths - perhaps from poor conditions in prison and then on the ship but some infants survived to land in the Antipodes with their mothers. On the Mary-Ann, sailing from Woolwich to Sydney in the 1830s, surgeon, William Bland, noted that a baby girl born en route failed to thrive. She survived for four months but cried and grizzled each night, disturbing the convicts' sleep. Her desperate mother, thinking that it might give her little girl some relief, stole a bottle of laudanum from the surgeon's store cupboard. Although she only gave her daughter a small dose, it was enough to kill the infant. Bland noted compassionately that the women was very distressed, as she had loved her baby and had so far been quiet and well behaved. Did she manage to settle in Sydney after losing her child - the last vestige of her old life in England?\n\nYou can find the journals for ships that sailed between 1817 and 53 in series ADM 101 at the National Archives.

{"text":"September 1, 1905: Four ships lost in Lake Superior gale\n\nOn this day on Lake Superior in 1905, four vessels steaming from Duluth and Superior wrecked in a late summer gale. The Sevona left Superior's Allouez ore docks headed for a port on Lake Erie when the storm struck here near the Apostle Island. The Sevona struck the shoals between Sand and York Islands when she broke in two and went down, taking Captain E. L. McDonald and ten crew members with her. Eleven others, including passengers, made it to shore in a lifeboat. Also at the Apostles, the tow line between the steamer Venezuela and the wooden barge Pretoria\u2014both laden with iron ore\u2014snapped, leaving the Pretoria to drift. When she foundered about a mile from Outer Island, her crew of ten climbed into a lifeboat and headed to the isthmus. Only five made it, saved by Outer Island lighthouse keeper Captain John Irvine. Another steamer\/barge pairing carrying iron ore, the Iosco and the Olive Jean, came to an even worse fate. Like the Sevona, they were on the way from Duluth to Lake Erie laden with iron ore, nearing Michigan's Huron Islands when a lighthouse keeper saw the Olive Jeane break up and go under. He never saw the Iosco go down. The next day wreckage associated with the Olive Jeane washed ashore near Keewanaw Bay, and a few days later pieces of the Iosco also were discovered by a tugboat. The Iosco had 19 crew aboard, the Olive Jeanette a crew of seven. All perished.

These men were the forerunner of the modern frogman.\n\nPrime Minister Winston Churchill saw the advantages of the Chariot and indeed encouraged the development of Underwater Warfare through the offices of the Special Operations Executive (S.O.E.). The SOE was formed in 1940 to engage in subversive activity but soon expanded its activities to use university students to invent devilish devices. At an old hotel in Welwyn Garden City the Sleeping Beauty, Welman and Welfreighter submarines were invented and built and then taken to a reservoir in Staines and Tested at the SOE's secret base known as Station VIII.

Klippel is now regarded as one of Australia's greatest sculptors ,and these ship models are highly significant as examples of his earliest work. John C Allcot, who painted the plaster seascape, is recognised as one of the leading Australian artists painting landscapes, sailing ships and steamers.\nAs a boy, Klippel was fascinated by the collection of model ships in the old Museum od Applied Arts and Sciences , precursor of the Powerhouse Museum. He trained a a wool classer, but at the outbreak of WW11, joined the Royal Australian Navy serving first as a seaman on an auxiliary minesweeper, and then as a gunner on a tanker. In 1943, his skill in carving miniature ship models led to his joining the Naval Gunnery Instruction Centre to make scale models of ships and aircraft used to instruct sailors in recognition training to be able to identify different types of vessels and aircraft. In his leisure time, apart from attending evening classes in sculpture, he continued carving models of sailing ships. After the war, he studied at the Slade School of Fine Art in New York, and the following year at the Abbey Arts Centre in London. From 1950 he worked as an industrial designer to produce functional and contemporary furniture. A prototype coffee table of his work is on exhibit in the Powerhouse Museum. Klippel is now regarded as one of Australia's greatest sculptors. He was very prolific, and utilised an extraordinary diversity of materials; wood, stone, plastic toy kits, wooden pattern parts, typewriter machinery, industrial piping and machine parts, as well as bronze, silver, oils, photographs, collage and paper. He is noted for the great diversity of scale of his work, from intricate whimsical structures in metal, to large wooden assemblages. He had completed over 1200 sculptures before his death in 2001.\nJohn C. Allcot , at 16, ran away to sea, first on Mersey tugboats, then as a deck-boy on the barque \"Invermark\", and then signing on in Sydney on the clipper \"Antiope\". He also supported himself by painting theatre sets, obtaining commissions for ships paintings, painting and selling landscapes, and as an illustrator and writing articles about the sea for the 'Sydney Mail'. He gained widespread recognition in the 1920's with a series of oil paintings on the founding of the Australian colonies.In the 1940's he collaborated with Robert Klippel on painting backgrounds for his ship models as in this model of a pilot ship. Allcot used water colour, oils and gouache to paint nostalgic views of sailing ships and steamers for an appreciative market of shipping companies, ship owners, captains and crews, as well as continuing to paint landscapes"}

{"text":"Tom Dudley, Captain of the Mignonette, a 52-foot sailing vessel with a crew of four that capsized five minutes after being struck by a wave in the south Atlantic 1600 miles northwest of the Cape of Good Hope on July 5, 1884, described the scene in the lifeboat three weeks later after Dudley killed Richard Parker, the 17-year-old cabin boy so that he, Edwin Stephens and Edmund Brooks could feed off his uncooked flesh and drink his blood to survive.\n\n\"I can assure you I shall never forget the sight of my two unfortunate companions over that ghastly meal we all was like mad wolfs who should get the most and for men fathers of children to commit such a deed we could not have our right reason.\"\n\nThe three survivors were rescued four or five days later by a passing sailing ship that was en route to Hamburg. After they were dropped off in Cornwall, the three men provided statements describing the decision-making process. The men had only two tins of turnips and no fresh water in the lifeboat.\n\nDudley managed to improvise a sea anchor to keep the lifeboat headed into the waves and maintain her stability. Over the first night, the crew had to fight off a shark with their oars. They were around 700 miles (1,100 km) from the nearest land, being either St. Helena or Tristan de Cunha. Dudley kept the first tin of turnips until 7 July when its five pieces were shared among the men to last two days. On or around 9 July, Brooks spotted a turtle which Stephens dragged on board. The crew were resolutely avoiding drinking seawater as it was then universally held to be fatal and, though they devoured the turtle, they forewent drinking its blood when it became contaminated with seawater. The turtle yielded about three pounds (1.4 kg) of meat each, though the crew ate even the bones, and, along with the second tin of turnips lasted until 15 or 17 July. The crew consistently failed to catch any rainwater and by 13 July, with no other source of fluid, they began to drink their own urine. It was probably on 20 July that Parker became ill through drinking seawater. Stephens was also unwell, possibly having experimented with seawater.\n\nDrawing lots in order to choose a sacrificial victim who would die to feed the others was possibly first discussed on 16 or 17 July, and debate seems to have intensified on 21 July but without resolution. On 23 or 24 July, with Parker probably in a coma, Dudley told the others that it was better that one of them die so that the others survive and that they should draw lots. Brooks refused. That night, Dudley again raised the matter with Stephens pointing out that Parker was probably dying and that he and Stephens had wives and families. They agreed to leave the matter until the morning. The following day, with no prospect of rescue in sight, Dudley and Stephens silently signalled to each other that Parker would be killed. Killing Parker before his natural death would better preserve his blood to drink. Brooks, who had not been party to the earlier discussion, claimed to have signalled neither assent nor protest. Dudley always insisted that Brooks had assented. Dudley said a prayer and, with Stephens standing by to hold the youth's legs if he struggled, pushed his penknife into Parker's jugular vein, killing him.\n\nIn some of the varying and confused later accounts of the killing, Parker murmured, \"What me?\" as he was slain. The three fed on Parker's body, with Dudley and Brooks consuming the most and Stephens very little. The crew even finally managed to catch some rainwater.\n\nDudley and Stephens were charged with murder. Brooks was not charged because he claimed not to have participated in the decision to kill Parker.\n\nDudley and Stephens asserted that they were not guilty by reason of the common law defense of necessity, which was and continues to be a defense to property crimes.\n\nThe legal issue in the case was whether necessity should be recognized as a defense to murder.\n\nThe panel of judges ruled that the common law defense of necessity does not apply to a murder charge, either on the basis of legal precedent or the basis of ethics and morality. Wiki quotes the following language from the opinion. I include it because it is so 19th century and beautiful in its own right.\n\nTo preserve one's life is generally speaking a duty, but it may be the plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it. War is full of instances in which it is a man's duty not to live, but to die. The duty, in case of shipwreck, of a captain to his crew, of the crew to the passengers, of soldiers to women and children, as in the noble case of the Birkenhead; these duties impose on men the moral necessity, not of the preservation, but of the sacrifice of their lives for others, from which in no country, least of all, it is to be hoped, in England, will men ever shrink, as indeed, they have not shrunk.\n\n* * *\n\nIt would be a very easy and cheap display of commonplace learning to quote from Greek and Latin authors, from Horace, from Juvenal, from Cicero, from Euripides, passage after passage, in which the duty of dying for others has been laid down in glowing and emphatic language as resulting from the principles of heathen ethics; it is enough in a Christian country to remind ourselves of the Great Example [Jesus Christ] whom we profess to follow.\n\n* * *\n\nIt must not be supposed that in refusing to admit temptation to be an excuse for crime it is forgotten how terrible the temptation was; how awful the suffering; how hard in such trials to keep the judgment straight and the conduct pure. We are often compelled to set up standards we cannot reach ourselves, and to lay down rules which we could not ourselves satisfy. But a man has no right to declare temptation to be an excuse, though he might himself have yielded to it, nor allow compassion for the criminal to change or weaken in any manner the legal definition of the crime.\n\nDudley and Stephens were sentenced to the statutory death penalty with a recommendation for mercy. Their death sentences were commuted to six months in jail.\n\nThe name of the case is The Queen v. Dudley and Stephens, Queen's Bench Division, 1884. 14 Q.B.D. 273.\n\nWiki notes a circumstance possibly more creepy than the case itself, if such is possible.\n\nIt [the case] became better known in 1974 when Arthur Koestler ran a competition in The Sunday Times, in which readers were invited to send in the most striking coincidence they knew of. The winning entry pointed out that in Edgar Allan Poe's novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket, published in 1838, decades before the Mignonette sank, four men are cast adrift on their capsized ship and draw lots to decide which of them should be sacrificed as food for the other three. The loser was the sailor who had proposed the idea: the character's name was Richard Parker.\n\n21 Responses to Necessity is not a Defense to Murder and Cannibalism\n\nI have always found this historical case to be fascinating, and it speaks to the human instinct to survive. That said, I am not sure I could do this, but how would one know, not having ever been in that position.\n\nAlthough lacking the macabre quality, I'm reminded of the story of a mountain climber's daughter who died on Nepal's Annapurna. Her name was Annapurna. I couldn't find any reference to this event on google. I'm going from memory such as it is.\n\nI'm inclined to think that cannibalism as a psychopathology is archetypal, relating to Saturn possibly combined with Pluto. Just in the last few days, I was thinking about Chronos\/Saturn eating his children, but in a different context \u2013 the two major parties (old) vis-a-vis third parties (new).\n\nWhen Islam was destroying Constantinople in 1452-53, the denizens of that fortress decided, if push comes to shove, they would kill and then eat the older citizens of that besieged fortress (for that time anyone over 30 was definitely older).\n\nApparently that ghastly end did not befall the senior citizens of Constantinople. The huge cannon of a Hungarian genius solved the problem of the breaching of the walls, and the city fell without the eating of its senior citizens.\n\nBut one must definitely ask oneself, whetherI do not believe Hitler has anything to do with whether survival is a legitimate justification for cannibalism or whether euthanasia is a legitimate justification to end a dying person's agony.\n\nNevertheless, I will go off topic to say that I generally agree with your point.\n\nI believe the well-being of the many is more important than the well-being of the few, but I draw the line at sacrificing the few for the benefit of the many.\n\nHitler believed he had legitimate reasons to kill all of the jews. He was wrong, of course. Others, before and after him, have held the same view. Still others have believed and still believe there are legitimate reasons to kill all people with brown skin or all Muslims.\n\nWhat we need to extinguish is the belief and practice that it's OK to hate, exploit and kill others.\n\nCannibalism, when necessary for survival, may be the only permissible exception. It used to be and still may be an unspoken but tacitly acknowledged part of the law of the sea.\n\nWhat happened at sea remains at sea.\n\nPut another way, people are going to do what they believe they must do to survive in extreme situations without regard for whatever the law may be or ought to be.\n\nMy understanding of this case is that the young man who was the victim was within hours of dying from hypernatremia related to drinking sea water. He was severely dehydrated and comatose, so, one could say that the men engaged in an act of euthanasia, or mercy killing. Depending on one's view and take, it may have been better to allow the man to die first, before eating him. On the other hand, allowing the man to have seizures and experience brain damage and coma can be viewed as unnecessary prolonging of the man's suffering.\n\nIt is a case like this that is the subject of historical back-and-forth pondering among ethicists. Should they have allowed the young man to suffer? Well, by law, yes. Were the men self-motivated? Probably, and this is where they got into trouble. Theirs was apparently not a mercy killing. At the same time, their defense was 'necessity,' and this did not work out terribly well, although the judges and fellow community members did exhibit empathy with the men's predicament, and the men were spared execution by hanging.\n\nWhen I got my first computer and had my first experiences with the internet, I joined some discussion groups, and one of them was a medical ethics board. Ethicists fought for days over various topics like this. Just, back and forth, back and forth, page after page after page, interrupted by flame wars and the like, all day and all night. It was really nuts, and so I finally quit the group subscription.\n\nIt was interesting, nonetheless. Some of the topics are really heart wrenching and difficult to sort through. At what point do we abandon life support. Should we do everything we can invasively and against odds, do institute ECMO (a form of cardiopulmonary bypass) in extremely critical and premature neonates. Should we have assisted suicide. How about the concept of a 'slow code.'\n\n\"I do not believe Hitler has anything to do with whether survival is a legitimate justification for cannibalism or whether euthanasia is a legitimate justification to end a dying person's agony.\"\n\nLet me peel away a few layers of this discussion and touch on the core issue my brief remarks attempted to illuminate.\n\nMy point was not about Jews or Slavs or Gypsies or any one particular group or the historic tragedies which might have or will befall them.\n\nThe 'raison de l'existence' of the Fuhrer in this mini dissertation -just read the 'Psychopathic God Adolph Hitler' by Waite-is this:\n\n'Slippery slopes.'\n\nIf a society or any collection of people can decide among themselves who is to live and who is to die for the well-being of the body politic, then what starts off as an appeal through reason to save the many at the sacrifice of the few is the slippery slope which can and too often does ultimately lead to the stygian depths which Adolph proudly pronounced to be the Third Reich.\n\nAnd that is why I said in my last line, \"If only we could see the ultimate outcome of our decisions over time.\"\n\nThat which is intended to give the greatest good to the greatest number of people, if usurped by or delivered into the wrong hands, will give only misery to all.\n\nWhich leads to the next, future dissertation of: 'When is good evil and evil good?'Good question. I think it would depend on the circumstances. I believe we would first have to determine and follow as a guide what the \"well being of the many\" truly means, impartially, before any sacrifice of the few be contemplated. I also propose that the sacrifice of the few would be voluntary and not coerced. This is just an initial thought on a subject that requires a great deal of contemplation!\n\nAs a country, we went through this collectively with the Terry Schiavo case, which became politicized as you probably remember. I imagine it must have been an agony for her family to experience it privately, without having to endure it publicly as well. Having said that, going through this collectively was probably very confronting in a society that is fixated on superficialities, youth, and beauty.\n\nAgain, the Holocaust and Herr Hitler were but props in my little morality play.\n\nIf *one can justify killing another human being to avoid one's physical demise by starvation, then it is just a hop and a skip down the road to doing the same to avoid one's spiritual or historic demise.\n\nFYI: In Polynesia human flesh was referred to as long pork, and housed in very nice, gleaming glass cases at the New York Museum of Natural History is a display of the long tined wooden forks employed to facilitate the consumption of one's fellow man.\n\nFWI chapter deux: I would introduce a modest proposal at this time for your consideration but a dude named Jonathan beat to the punch in 1729.\n\nP.S. * The 'if' is probably where we would find an arena of a difference of"}

{"text":"Wednesday, 18 January 2012\n\nNigerian Navy About\/Jobs & Recruitment - \n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Nigerian Navy owes its origin to the Nigerian Marine. Formed in 1914 after the amalgamation of the then Northern and Southern protectorates of Nigeria, the Nigerian Marine as it became known after 1914 was a quasi-military organization. Its origin lay with the Lagos Marines, which was first established in 1887 by the British Colonial Government. This Force later expanded to become the Southern Nigerian Marine in 1893. A Northern Nigeria equivalent of the same name was formed in 1900. The 2 Marines were merged in 1914 after Nigeria came under a single colonial administration. The responsibility of the Marine included administration of the ports and harbours, dredging of channels, bouyage and lighting. It also operated ferry services, touring launches and other small craft that plied the various creeks and other inland waterways. The Royal Navy provided the necessary military security as part of its overall military defence of the British Empire . Though it performed mostly coast guard functions, the Nigerian Marine saw action in the First World War as part of the British military offensive against German held Cameroon. This organization remained the only maritime outfit in Nigeria until 1955 when the British colonial authorities carried out a major reorganisation of Nigeria's maritime administration in order to improve efficiency. This re-organisation led to the establishment of 3 new organizations to undertake the various functions hitherto carried out by the Marine Department.\n\nThe first of these 3 new organizations was the Nigerian Ports Authority, which was charged with the running of ports and ensuring safe navigation. The second organisation was the Inland Waterways Department, which took over the running of ferries and touring launches. The third organisation was the Nigerian Naval Force, made up mostly of reserve Royal Navy officers and ex-Service personnel who were transferred to the Nigerian Ports Authority from the defunct Nigerian Marine. These officers and men never liked the transfer and pressed the Colonial Authorities to re-constitute them as the nucleus of a future Nigerian Navy. ( Under pressure from them, the Nigerian Naval Force was established on 1 June 1956 as a nucleus of a future Navy. Its primary responsibility was to train the necessary manpower and set up the appropriate infrastructure that will be utilized by the planned Navy. The first basic training establishment to train manpower for the future Navy - the HMNS QUORRA was started on 1 November 1957 with 60 junior ratings who underwent a 6 month basic seamanship course.\n\nOn 1st May 1958, a colonial ordinance formally brought the Nigerian Naval Force under the Naval Disciplinary Act. This act essentially brought the officers and men of the Nigerian Naval Force under the disciplinary procedures and legal regimes applicable to the Royal Navy. The Ordinance tasked the new Navy with the following responsibilities:\n\nTo maintain a Customs preventive patrol.\n\nTo assist in carrying out surveys in the approaches to the ports of Nigeria.\n\nTo train new entries to the Navy.\n\nTo plan and train a future Navy.\n\nIn July 1959, the Nigerian Naval Force was transformed into a full fledged Navy when the Queen of England granted permission for the Force to use the title 'Royal Nigerian Navy'. The title was changed to the 'Nigerian Navy' in 1963 after Nigeria became a republic. The constitutional task of the Navy was expanded in 1964 after the repeal of the 1958 Ordinance. The new law known as the Navy Act of 1964 for the first time tasked the Navy with the military responsibility of \"naval defence of Nigeria.\" Other tasks assigned the Navy by the 1964 Act were essentially coast guard duties namely: assisting in enforcement of Customs laws, making of hydrographic surveys and training of officers and men in naval duties.\n\nThese tasks were essentially routine functions of any Navy. Consequently, the naval leadership began to mount pressure on the political leadership to re-define the constitutional role of the Navy. In 1993, this pressure yielded the desired result and under a new law; the Armed Forces Decree 105 now known as the Armed Forces Act, was incorporated as part of the 1999 Constitution. The Navy was given expanded military and constabulary roles especially in the oil and gas sectors of the Nigerian maritime economy.\n\nThe Vision\n\n\"To emplace a Navy that is adequately motivated and capable of effectively combating the security challenges in Nigeria's maritime domain and in the West African Sub-region to enhance the well-being of the Nigerian people.\"\n\nMission\n\nThe Mission Statement\n\nThe Nigerian Navy shall discharge its constitutional roles and assigned tasks in a professional and responsible manner, consistent with global best practices for the defence and protection of Nigeria's territorial integrity\".\n\nCore Values Of The NN\n\nIntegrity: A quality which all officers and men of the Navy must hold steadfast because the nation has entrusted its maritime security and implicitly, the lives of the citizenry to the NN. The NN shall therefore maintain the strictest integrity and uphold the confidence that the Nigerian people have reposed in it.\n\nProfessionalism: The vagaries of the maritime environment, the sophistication of naval platforms, the constraints imposed on operations under democratic directions\/legal regimes and the imperatives of international norms have all combined to make naval operations more complex than ever before. This demands high professional standards by all NN personnel which shall not be compromised under any condition.\n\nTeamwork: The complex nature of naval operations dictated by environmental factors and political cum legal imperatives makes teamwork indispensable for success. The NN shall continue to promote excellent teamwork at the various strata and with sister services as well as with cooperating agencies in line with its motto \"ONWARD TOGETHER\"."}
{"text":"Excerpt of The Technologists by Matthew Pearl (Page 2 of 4)\n\nBeal stared in astonishment from the railing as a stray breeze parted the fog. The wharf loomed ahead, but it was now clear they were approaching it from the wrong angle, parallel instead of perpendicular. Incredulously, the captain extended his spyglass. A bark flying British colors had wrecked against the tip of one of the piers and caught fire, while another schooner, marked the Gladiator, had drifted against the wharf, where its crew feverishly tried to tow it in. As he watched, fiery debris spread to the Gladiator's sails, which an instant later were wreathed in flames.\n\nAt least half a dozen ships were visible in those few moments of clarity, and all were foundering in various states of distress across the once-orderly harbor, reverberating with shrieking whistles, bells, foghorns, and other desperate signals.\n\nBeal frantically stumbled and slid on his way to the navigational instruments. The needle of the steering compass, held under glass by the wheel, spun around violently, as if bedeviled, while on his pocket compass the needle was 180 degrees off the mark - north was south. He'd sailed by these navigational instruments - finely tuned with the expertise of nineteen centuries - for his entire life as a seaman, and he knew there should be no way for them to fail all at once.\n\nThe pleasure steamer they had crashed into suddenly lurched forward with a boom. In seconds it was entirely underwater. Where it had been, a vortex opened, sucking under those already stranded in the water, and then spitting them out high into the air.\n\n\"To the lifeboats!\" shouted Beal to his thunderstruck crew. \"Find anyone alive and get as far away as you can!\"\n\nII\n\nCharles\n\nSubmerged. As the waves soothed his naked body, his athletic strokes worked in concert with the rhythm of the current. The first week in April had not yet promised any warmth, the water still rather icy. But he willingly endured the chill ripping through his body for the better feeling swimming afforded him. It was a feeling of being alone but not lonely, a sense of freedom from all restrictions and control. Floating, kicking, somersaulting - try as he could to make noise, the water rendered him irrelevant.\n\nThroughout his boyhood in a port town, he'd heard so many people spoken of as \"lost at sea.\" Now it seemed to him the strangest turn of phrase. As long as he was in the water, he could not be lost. He could bask, bathe, disappear, and the water sheltered him as much in Boston as it had back home. Not that he ever felt homesick, as some of the other Institute students did who had come from outside Boston. He still traveled the forty miles back and forth to Newburyport by train every day to keep down living expenses, although it cost him more than an hour each way.\n\nTo his mother and stepfather, the Institute remained a strange detour from his good position at the machine shop, and a daily interruption to his help at home. His stepfather, James, had always been unhappy, plagued by a partial deafness in his left ear that made him shun all society and friends. He worked as a night watchman for a jeweler because he preferred the solitude and uneventful nature of the position. He assumed people were speaking ill of him because he could not hear what they said, which led him to the further conclusion that city life, being loud, was an evil cacophony of deceit. As for his mother, she was a religious zealot of the old Puritan kind who saw danger in urban life and no value to the son's studies in Boston.\n\nEven now, when he was a senior, graduation a mere two and a half months away, they did not accept that he - Marcus Mansfield, of all people! - was a student at a college.\n\nMarcus plunged his head back into the cool water, ears tingling as he surveyed the river - a tranquil and forgiving lane that ran between Boston and Cambridge, lined by a gentle, sloping green sward that would shade swimmers and oarsmen from the hot days to come. Unseen behind the thick weather, above the riverbank and the fields and marshes skirting it, there lurked the crowded brick and iron and gold-domed city, propelling Marcus forward with the powerful thrust of a gigantic engine"}

On March 30th, seventy-seven men went out on the Ice to kill seals. A mighty storm came up while the men were out, that lasted two days, and the men could not make it back to the ship. When the storm ceased, other ships came and helped the crew of the Newfoundland search for the missing men. Seventy two were found dead, and five were missing and presumed drowned. The ship sailed home in sorrow and did not go to the Ice at all the next year. She was considered to be unlucky.\n\nTo break the curse, the ship was rebuilt and changed, so that she would drown no more men. Her new name was the San Blanford, and she was sent to the Ice two years after the terrible storm.\n\nOn the thirtieth day of March, she met up with another ship called the Terra Nova. As dusk fell, a fog rolled in, and the crew of the San Blanford heard the Terra Nova blowing her whistle. This was a signal that she still had men out on the ice. As was customary, the crew of the San Blanford started blowing their whistle, and those above deck could hear voices calling out from the Ice and presumed they belonged to sailors from the Terra Nova. The two ships kept up their signals until 10 pm, when the voices ceased and all were presumed safely aboard ship.\n\nThe next morning, a sailor from the San Blanford boarded the Terra Nova to conduct some business. The captain of the ship immediately asked the sailor what time the members of the San Blanford crew had gotten aboard the previous night. The sailor was puzzled. \"We didn't have anyone out on the Ice, sir,\" he told the captain. But the captain and his crew swore that they had seen several men board the San Blanford shortly before 10 pm.\n\nWhen the sailor returned to the San Blanford, he reported the incident to his captain. The captain took him quietly aside and told him that the report was true. A few members of the night crew had seen five men climb aboard the San Blanford shortly before ten pm. The men were wearing tattered clothing that looked as if it had been ripped and worn out by the waves of the sea, and the crew could see right through their shining bodies. One of the sailors on duty that evening had been on the Newfoundland when she lost the seventy-seven men two years ago that very night. He had recognized the faces of the ghosts as those belonging to the five men who were presumed drowned. Their spirits had finally returned to the ship from which they had been lost and could now rest in peace.\n\nYou can read more Canadian folktales and ghost stories in Spooky Canada by S.E.

{"text":"History of the Monitor\n\nA Revolutionary Vessel\n\nOfficers and turret on board USS Monitor, 1862 (Photo: #NH 61923)\n\nThe Monitor has been called the most famous ship in American history. Its inventor, Swedish-American engineer John Ericsson, was anything but ordinary. The building of iron ships was not in itself revolutionary in the 1800s, but Ericsson was suggesting the use of iron as a protective plate rather than simply as a building material. In 1854 he presented a conceptual design of a steam-powered ironclad ship with rotating gun turret to Napoleon III of France. The concept, rejected by France, was accepted by the United States and would soon become the USS Monitor.\n\nBuilt in approximately 100 days at the Continental Ironworks in New York, the Monitor was a technological feat. It was equipped with an Ericsson-designed propeller, engine and 21 \u00bd foot in diameter rotating gun turret. The turret was the first of its kind and turrets similar to Ericsson's design are still seen on modern warships. In a time when naval power traditionally consisted of wooden tall ships with gun ports, the Monitor was constructed almost entirely of iron. The engineering spaces, crew and officer quarters and galley were all located below the water line.\n\nBattle of Hampton Roads\n\nThe Monitor was launched from Greenpoint, New York on January 30, 1862. The Confederate ironclad Virginia, launched on February 17, 1862. She was constructed over the modified hull of the USS Merrimack. Confederates had salvaged the Merrimack after she was burned and scuttled by Union forces. Because of the threat that the Virginia posed to the Federal fleet at Hampton Roads, the Monitor was ordered to that area in early March following modifications to solve problems encountered during sea trials. She arrived at Hampton Roads the night of March 8. Earlier that day the Virginia had engaged the Federal fleet, destroying the wooden frigates Cumberland and Congress. The Minnesota had been damaged and stranded before the Virginia retired to sheltered anchorage near Norfolk. When the Virginia steamed out to finish off the Minnesota early on the morning of March 9, she was met by the Monitor.\n\nTransverse section through turret. (Photo: Naval Historical Center)\n\nIn the ensuing four-hour battle, the two vessels frequently bombarded each other at pointblank range with no substantial damage to either vessel. However, a shell exploded in the view-port of the Monitor's pilot house, temporarily blinding Captain John Worden. The Monitor's Executive Officer, Samuel Dana Green, assumed command and ordered the Monitor into shallow water, where the Virginia could not follow, to assess the captain's wounds and damage to the ship. The Virginia's captain, assuming the Monitor was withdrawing from battle, withdrew in supposed victory. When the Monitor returned to resume the engagement and found the Virginia gone, her crew also assumed victory.\n\nA Shallow Victory\n\nIn reality, the battle was a virtual draw with neither vessel inflicting serious damage to the other. The Monitor was successful in protecting the stranded Minnesota from destruction, while the Virginia prevented the Monitor from advancing up the James River toward Richmond. Although the Monitor remained in Hampton Roads throughout the spring and summer of 1862, the two vessels never again met in battle. In May of that year, trapped between advancing Union forces and the bar at the mouth of the James River, the Virginia's crew destroyed her to prevent capture.\n\nThe Wreck of the Iron-clad Monitor , off Cape Hatteras, 30-31 December 1862 (Photo: #NH 58758)\n\nWith the exception of the engagement with the Virginia, the Monitor's brief career was uneventful. Shortly after midnight on December 31, 1862, while under tow by the Rhode Island to Beaufort, North Carolina for repairs, the Monitor sank in a storm off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The loss of the vessel known as \"the little cheesebox-on-a-raft\" was described by Paymaster William Keeler in a series of letters to his wife Anna. Keeler's letters provide us with a taste of what life was like aboard the ironclad.\n\nKeeler described the mounting fear of the officers and crew as the vessel took on water and waves broke over the top of the turret, completely submerging the deck. Lifeboats from the Rhode Island removed many of the Monitor's crew during the storm. The rescued crewmen stood on the deck of the Rhode Island watching the red lantern that was hanging from the Monitor's turret as it disappeared behind a wave only to reappear again to the cheers of the frightened crewmen. Finally the lantern disappeared for the last time. Wrote Keeler, \"The Monitor is no more. What the fire of the enemy failed to do, the elements have accomplished.\" Sixteen crewmen lost their lives, most from being swept overboard while attempting to reach the lifeboats."}

{"text":"On the afternoon of Thursday, November 26th, 1914, Winston\nChurchill made the following statement to the House of Commons :\n\n\"I regret to say I have some bad news for the house.\nThe Bulwark battleship, which was lying in Sheerness this\nmorning, blew up at 7.35 o'clock. The Vice and Rear Admiral, who\nwere present, have reported their conviction that it was an\ninternal magazine explosion which rent the ship asunder. There\nwas apparently no upheaval in the water, and the ship had\nentirely disappeared when the smoke had cleared away. An inquiry\nwill be held tomorrow which may possibly throw more light on the\noccurrence. The loss of the ship does not sensibly affect the\nmilitary position, but I regret to say the loss of life is very\nsevere. Only 12 men are saved. All the officers and the rest of\nthe crew, who, I suppose, amounted to between 700 and 800, have\nperished. I think the House would wish me to express on their\nbehalf the deep sorrow with which the House heard the news, and\ntheir sympathy with those who have lost their relatives and\nfriends.\"\n\nHMS Bulwark, a battleship of 15,000 tons, was moored to No.17\nbuoy in Kethole Reach on the River Medway, almost opposite the\ntown of Sheerness, Isle of Sheppy, Kent. It was one of the ships\nforming the 5th Battle Squadron. She had been moored there for\nsome days, and many of her crew had been given leave the\nprevious day. They had returned to the Bulwark at 7 o'clock that\nmorning and the full complement was onboard. The usual ship's\nroutine was taking place. Officers and men were having breakfast\nin the mess below deck, other were going about their normal\nduties. A band was practising while some men were engaged in\ndrill. The disaster struck.\n\nA roaring and rumbling sound was heard and a huge sheet of\nflame and debris shot upwards. The ship lifted out of the water\nand fell back. There was a thick cloud of grey smoke and further\nexplosions. When the smoke eventually cleared, the Bulwark had\nsunk without trace.\n\nThe scene was described by an eye witness, who was onboard a\nship nearby, to a local newspaper:\n\n\"I was at breakfast when I heard an explosion, and I\nwent on deck. My first impression was that the report was\nproduced by the firing of a salute by one of the ships, but the\nnoise was quite exceptional. When I got on deck I soon saw that\nsomething awful had happened. The water and sky were obscured by\ndense volumes of smoke. We were at once ordered to the scene of\nthe disaster to render what assistance we could. At first we\ncould see nothing, but when the smoke cleared a bit we were\nhorrified to find the battleship Bulwark had gone. She seemed to\nhave entirely vanished from sight, but a little later we\ndetected a portion of the huge vessel showing about 4ft above\nwater. We kept a vigilant look-out for the unfortunate crew, but\nonly saw two men.\"\n\nThe explosion was heard in Whitstable, 20 miles away, and in\nSouthend where the pier was shaken by the explosion but not\ndamaged. Ships anchored off Southend holding German civilian\nprisoners also reported hearing the explosion. Residents in\nWestcliffe-on-Sea claimed they saw \"a dense volume of\ngreenish smoke which lasted for about ten minutes\". The\nnearby areas of Sheerness and Rainham took the brunt of the\nblast with reports of damage to property being made. Rumour\nbegan to run wild amongst the residents. Some claimed it was the\nexpected and feared Zeppelin raids commencing, others said that\na periscope had been sighted and the Bulwark had been sunk by a\nsubmarine.\n\nOthers thought that espionage had taken place and\nwere on the look out for suspicious people in town. All these\nrumours were later discounted.\n\nBoats of all kinds were launched from the nearby ships and\nshore to pick up survivors and the dead. Work was hampered by\nthe amount of debris which included hammocks, furniture, boxes\nand hundreds of mutilated bodies. Fragments of personal items\nshowered down in the streets of Sheerness. Initially 14 men\nsurvived the disaster, but some died later from their injuries.\nOne of the survivors, an able seaman, had a miraculous escape.\nHe said he was on the deck of the Bulwark when the explosion\noccurred. He was blown into the air, fell clear of the debris\nand managed to swim to wreckage and keep himself afloat until he\nwas rescued. His injuries were slight.\n\nNone of the Bulwark's officers survived; although 11 of them\nwere recovered for eventual burial.\n\nRescue work continued during the remainder of the week and on\nSaturday November 28th, an inquest was opened at the Royal Naval\nHospital in Chatham. The Admiralty was represented by a local\nsolicitor Mr. E. L. Baker. The Coroner informed the jury that\nthe proceedings were to be kept to evidence concerning the\nidentification of bodies, and that on occasions he may have to\nre-open the inquest for subsequent identification. By this time\nonly 30 bodies had been recovered and 14 could be identified.\nThese bodies were identified by Cooks Mate William Frederick\nCooper who was on sick leave on shore at the time of the\nexplosion. The Chief Surgeon at the Naval Hospital, Percy Minett,\ngave evidence that the cause of death to all of the 30 men was\nburns. He also stated that two of the original survivors,\nPrivate Gilbert Guy and Able Seaman Walter Crow had died the\nprevious night from their injuries without making any statement.\n\nThe Coroner then adjourned the inquest until Wednesday,\nDecember 16th when it was hoped the results of the Admiralty\nCourt of Inquiry would be available.\n\nOn Monday, November 30th, the funerals of 21 of the victims\ntook place in the Naval Burial Ground at Woodlands Cemetery,\nGillingham. The funeral procession left the Naval Hospital\nheaded by the Royal Marines Band (Chatham Division). The bodies\nwere conveyed in five lorries. Following the bodies were private\nmourners and a naval party. All along the route, signs of\nmourning were apparent and flags were flown at half mast. The\nfuneral party was met at the cemetery by Read Admiral E. F. A.\nGaunt and Flag Captain P. H. Colomb representing the Admiralty;\nthe Commander-in-Chief Nore, Colonel A. E. Marchant represented\nthe Royal Marines. Representatives from the local councils were\nalso in attendance showing how the local population felt the\nhorror of this incident.\n\nThe service was conducted by the Rev. R. S. Hartley (Chaplain\nRN Hospital) and the Rev. F. G. L. Cruce (Chaplin RN\nBarracks, Chatham). Following the interment of the bodies,\nthe Royal Marine Buglers sounded the Last Post to close the\nceremony. On Monday, December 1st, the burials of Captain H. C.\nMorton RM and Lt. Cdr. C. M. Queripel took place at St. Nicholas\nCemetery, Rochester and Woodlands Cemetery, Gillingham\nrespectively.\n\nThe Bulwark inquest was re-opened on December 2nd to identify\nand establish the cause of death on Stoker Anthony Eames and\nAble Seaman James Anderson, both original survivors and Reginald\nOverton a boy. Lt. Cdr. Queripel had been identified at a\nprevious re-opening of the inquest.\n\nOn Wednesday, December 16th, the Kent Coroner again re-opened\nthe inquest at Gillingham. Among those present were Rear-Admiral\nErnest Frederick Augustus Gaunt (Commodore RN Barracks, Chatham)\nwho was also the President of the Admiralty Court of Inquiry.\nSurgeon-General A. J. J. Johnston and Mr. G. W. Ricketts were\nrepresenting the Admiralty. Major Cooper Key, Inspector of\nExplosives, Home Office, was in attendance to assist the\nCoroner. Thus the scene was set for the inquest into the tragic\nloss of HMS Bulwark and her crew.\n\nThe first witness was Lt. Benjamin George Carroll, who was\nassistant coaling officer at Sheerness. He stated that he was\npassing down the River Medway on the day in question and saw the\nBulwark lying in Kethole Reach. He was looking at a signal she\nwas flying, indicating the amount of coal onboard, when he saw a\nspurt of flame abaft the after barbette turret. Then the flame\nseemed to rush towards the after funnel and the whole interior\nof the ship blew into the air and everything seemed on fire. He\nadded that the water was calm and there was no tide and saw no\ndisturbances in the water. He finished his evidence by stating\nthat he rendered what assistance he could and was convinced it\nwas an internal explosion that he had seen.\n\nThe deposition of Sgt. John Albert Budd, RM, who was still in\nhospital suffering from burns and a fractured leg, was read out\nto the court. In his deposition he said that he was serving on\nthe Bulwark at the time of the explosion and had been with her\nsince mobilization. At 7.30 he was finishing his breakfast on\nthe portside second mess deck, when he saw a sudden flash aft.\nHe turned and then the deck seemed to open up under him and he\nfell down. He recalled coming to the surface of the water and\nsaw the Bulwark had disappeared. He had heard no explosion.\n\nFinally Rear-Admiral Gaunt took the stand and gave his\nevidence. He stated that exhaustive and scientific\ninvestigations had bee completed. There was no evidence to\nsuggest that the explosion was external; and that everything\npointed towards the explosion being internal. There was no\nevidence of treachery or of loose cordite. He said that loose\ncartridges in the cross ammunition passages had been found.\n\nThe Coroner asked if this had any relation to the cause of\nthe explosion. Rear-Admiral Gaunt replied \"No\". The\nCoroner pressed the point \"There must have been ignition\nsomewhere ?\" The Rear-Admiral replied as follows :\n\"All the evidence we had was that the explosion occurred.\nAfter that there was no proof of the actual cause. There were\nmany possible causes, but no direct evidence and there have been\nmany theories which are untrue.\" The jury were not\nsatisfied with this explanation, even after a Commander Wilton\nconfirmed that every cartridge onboard was traced and that no\nevidence of loose cordite was found. A juror asked the question\nagain, \"We should like to know how ignition occurred\n?\" The Coroner replied, \"That is precisely what we\ncannot solve !\"\n\nThe Coroner, clearly not quite satisfied with the evidence,\nsummed up the findings. He said it was impossible to discover\nexactly how the ignition was caused. The theory of external\nexplosion could be discounted. If the jury were prepared to\nendorse the views placed before them, then their duty would be\nvery simple. A verdict of accidental death was returned and the\ninquiry on the crew of HMS Bulwark was closed.\n\nDuring January 1915 many more bodies of the Bulwark's crew\nwere washed up on the Kent shoreline. Many were identified some\nwere not. Woodlands Cemetery in Gillingham has 82 graves to\nunknown ratings from World War I, they all contain the bodies of\ncrew members from Bulwark. Twelve lie in individual graves, the\n70 are in a large communal grave with those from another\ndisaster in Sheerness the following year. Of those identified,\n67 are buried in Woodlands.\nRead More.."}

{"text":"The oldest scientific agency in the U.S., the Coast Survey, was established in 1807 when President Thomas Jefferson and Congress authorized a \"survey to be taken of coasts of the United States\".\n\nThe history of hydrography is nearly as old as sailing, but in the United States it officially began on February 10, 1807, with the mandate from Congress and President Thomas Jefferson to survey and chart the nation's coasts. The first Superintendent of the Coast Survey was Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler, who brought together mathematicians, cartographers, geodesists, meterologists, hydrographers, topographers, sailors, laborers and administrators with the goal of surveying and charting the coast of the United States.\n\nThe first official hydrographic survey in the U.S. was conducted along the south shore of Long Island in 1834. In 1839, the U.S. government produced its first nautical chart.\n\nEarly hydrographic surveys consisted of depths measured by sounding pole and hand lead line with positions determined by three-point sextant fixes to mapped reference points. Lead lines were ropes, or lines, with depth-markings and lead-weights attached that were lowered and read manually. Lead lines and sounding poles were a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. While the initial depth soundings may have been accurate, they were limited in number, and thus, coverage between single soundings was lacking.\n\nIn 1904, weighted wire-drag surveys were introduced into hydrography. The basic principle being to drag a wire attached to two vessels. If the wire (set at a certain depth by a system of weights and buoys) encountered an obstruction it would become taut and form a \"V\" revealing the depth and position of submerged rocks and other obstructions.\n\nThe 1930's saw the development and implementation of single-beam echo sounders using sound to measure the distance of the sea floor directly below a vessel. By running a series of lines at a specified spacing, single beam echo sounders and fathometers greatly increased the speed of the survey process by allowing more data points to be collected. However, this method still yielded gaps in quantitative depth information between survey lines.\n\nIn the 1950's, 1960's, and 1970's a number of evolutionary concepts were advanced that fundamentally changed how we look at and map the seafloor. Side Scan Sonar technology was developed as a qualitative means of obtaining the sonar equivalent of an aerial photograph and improving the ability to identify submerged wrecks and obstructions. Multibeam swath systems made it possible to obtain quantitative depth information for 100% of the bottom in a survey area. Hydrographic surveying techniques and procedures continue to evolve and The Office of Coast Survey continues to perform research and evaluation of emerging technologies."}
{"text":"In September 1939 Glasgow was part of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron Home Fleet. In November she was operating off the coast of Norway, accompanied by two destroyers in the hope that the German passenger ship Bremen would pass there from Murmansk.\n\nIn February 1940 Glasgow captured the German trawler Herrlichkeit off Tromso. On April 9th, she was attacked by JU 88s and HE 111s and was damaged by near misses near the vicinity of Bergen. On the 11th, in company with the cruiser HMS Sheffield and six destroyers of the Tribal-class, they landed troops near Harstad. On the 23rd HMS Glasgow, HMS Sheffield, HMS Galatea and six destroyers landed the first part of the 15th Infantry Brigade in Andalsnes. On the 29th, she received the Norwegian King Haakon and Crown Prince Olaf onboard, at Molde, and took them to Tromso. On July 16th, the destroyer HMS Imogen was sunk in thick fog off Duncansby Head after being rammed by Glasgow. By November Glasgow was in the Mediterranean where she became a reinforcement of the 3rd Cruiser Squadron based on Alexandria. On the 14th in company with cruisers HMS Berwick, HMAS Sydney and HMS York, they were responsible for the safe delivery of 3,400 troops from Alexandria to Piraeus. On the 26th, Glasgow with the cruisers HMS Gloucester and HMS York put to sea from Alexandria tasked to escort a supply convoy to Malta. On 3 December Glasgow was attacked by Italian aircraft while anchored at Suda Bay Crete, she received two torpedo hits and although badly damaged made it back safely to Alexandria, where temporary repairs were carried out. The cruiser HMS Southampton was redisposed from Indian Ocean convoy work to replace the damaged Glasgow.\n\nIn Janaury 1941 Glasgow left for Singapore, to join the East Indies Fleet where more repairs were carried out to her damaged hull. In February while in the Indian Ocean the pocket battleship Admiral Scheer sank the freighter Canadian Cruiser, however before sinking, the freighter managed to transmit a distress signal which was received by Glasgow, stationed in that area, she also received a signal from the Dutch steamer Rantaupandjang which was also sunk by the Scheer. On the 22nd, the German was sighted by the spotter aircraft from Glasgow, the British C in C East Indies deployed his Task Force to the reported area. On arrival the force searched in vain for the German, who had outwitted them by turning away to the south east. In March Glasgow accompanied by the old cruiser HMS Caledon and two auxiliary cruisers, two destroyers and two anti submarine trawlers of the Indian navy, escorted two troop transport vessels containing two Indian Battalions and one Somali commando detachment, who were landed both sides of Berber Somaliland. The town was taken against only slight Italian resistance, which was soon broken by naval gunfire.\n\nOn 19 March 1942, convoy WS-16 arrived in South Africa from the U.K. with reinforcements. The convoy consisted of 14 ships, Glasgow was one of the units responsible for escorting this convoy on the final leg of the passage. In April Glasgow was docked in the Selborne dry dock at Simonstown, South Africa for temporary repairs, prior to leaving for the USA for permanent repairs. In August, after completion of her repairs she left for the U.K. to join the 10th Cruiser Squadron at Scapa Flow, where she was involved as a covering force for the Arctic convoys.\n\nDuring January \u2013 February 1943 Glasgow was part of the Covering Force for Arctic convoys. In March the German blockade runner Regensburg (8086 BRT) coming from the Far East was intercepted by Glasgow while she was operating in the Denmark Strait. Her crew managed to scuttle the ship and the cruiser recovered six survivors. During June \u2013 July Glasgow was in the Bay of Biscay where she supplied cover for escort groups operating in that area. After this she joined the Plymouth Command. In December she was back in the North Atlantic following the report about the break through of the first blockade runner through the Natal Freetown narrows, the C in C Plymouth, Admiral Leatham, initiated operation \"Stone Wall\", Glasgow and the Royal New Zealand cruiser HMNZS Gambia left Plymouth and transferred to Horta in the Azores, from where they established a continuos patrol, relieving each other for refuelling from a tanker at Horta. On the 26-28th, the Germans brought their 8th DD Flotilla and their 4th E Boat Flotilla into the Bay of Biscay to escort the blockade runner Alsterufer into the Gironde. Early on the 27th, a Sunderland flying boat sighted the blockade runner 500 miles north west of Cape Finisterre, proceeding south east, the \"stone wall\" cruisers as they were nicknamed, were then deployed from east of the position, the German was sighted by a Liberator bomber from a Czechoslovakian squadron, it was then bombed and set on fire. The German Naval Group West only learnt of the loss of the vessel the following morning, with the result that before the German DD Flotilla could return, they were located by Glasgow. In the action which followed Glasgow and another cruiser HMS Enterprise sank the German torpedo boats T-25 and T-26 and the destroyer Z-27. The other German ships managed to escape. Four reached Brest two reached the Gironde and two retired to the South of St Jean de Luz. After this engagement Glasgow returned to Plymouth in spite of several air raids by glider bombs.\n\nOn June 6th 1944 Glasgow was involved in operation \"Neptune\" the amphibious phase of operation \"Overlord\", she made up the Gunfire Bombardment Support Force C for \"Omaha\" Rear Admiral Bryant, in company with the United States battleships USS Texas and USS Arkansas, the French cruisers Montcalm, Georges Leygues, nine U.S. destroyers and three Hunt-class destroyers. On the 25-26th of this month, in support of the attack by the 7th US Corps on Cherbourg, she shelled the German batteries in the town near Querqueville. Glasgow was damaged during this incident. In August 1945 she set sail for the East Indies.\n\nIn 1946 Glasgow was docked in the Selborne dry dock at Simonstown, South Africa. In 1948 Glasgow was transferred to the West Indies. In 1950 Glasgow returned to the U.K. In 1951 Glasgow joined the Mediterranean Fleet based on Malta. In August 1954 Glasgow in company with the cruiser Gambia helped with the withdrawal of the Royal Marine Commandos. In 1955 Glasgow returned to the U.K. where she joined the Home Fleet as Flag Officer D. In 1956 because of the Suez crisis Glasgow was recommissioned, and later that year paid off once more. It was then decided that the cruiser was surplus to requirements and was placed on the disposal list in November 1956. In July 1958 Glasgow was broken up at Blyth by Hughes Bolckow.\n\nNoteable events involving Glasgow9 Dec 1941 At midnight on the 9th of December 1941 HMS Glasgow (Capt. H. Hickling, DSO, RN) in error sank the RIN patrol vessel HMIS Prabhavati with two lighters in tow en route for Karachi, with 6 inch shells at 6000 yards. The vessel was alongside the lighters and appeared to those in Glasgow to be a large Japanese submarine on the surface. HMS Glasgow arrived in Bombay with the survivors on 9th.\nHMS Glasgow had left Colombo for patrol on 6 December 1941, she returned to Colombo on the 25th. The event took place about 80 nautical miles east of Goa in position 15.20'N, 72.29'E.\n(see map)"}

{"text":"Any u guys read this novel about a 2nd Falklands War ? Came out back in 1997, written by an Aussie guy IIRC. From my basic understanding of the story 9which I haven't read for awhile), in the late 1990s the Argies get bold enough to try again and initially manage to seize the islands, including by taking out the very poorly-guarded RAF Tornado-equipped airfields with commando raids, then the RN and USN taskforce steams into battle, and the Brits take pretty heavy casualties.\n\nIf they've got a Nimitz sailing alongside the RN taskforce, how're the Brits going to take heavy casualties? Interesting tidbit is that during the actual Falkland's campaign, we offered to give the Brits a Nimitz-class carrier. They declined, not having the ability to crew it.\n\nInteresting tidbit is that during the actual Falkland's campaign, we offered to give the Brits a Nimitz-class carrier.

{"text":"Oceania Cruises' Nautica successfully evaded an attempt by pirates to seize the ship, the company said today. The statement is as follows:\n\n\"On November 30, 2008, at approximately 0928 local time, 0528 GMT, M\/S NAUTICA was transiting through the Gulf of Aden within the prescribed Maritime Safety Protection Area which is patrolled by international anti-piracy task forces. As the vessel sailed past several groups of non-hostile fishing vessels, two small skiffs were sighted by the Officer on Duty and deemed potentially hostile. The skiffs, approaching from a range of approximately 1000 meters, attempted to intercept the vessel's course.\n\n\"Captain Jurica Brajcic and his officers immediately began evasive maneuvers and took all prescribed precautions. NAUTICA was immediately brought to flank speed and was able to out run the two skiffs. One of the skiffs did manage to close the range to approximately 300 yards and fired eight rifle shots in the direction of the vessel before trailing off. No one aboard NAUTICA was harmed and no damage was sustained.\n\n\"All guests and crew onboard are safe and there were no injuries. All requisite international authorities have been notified and all anti-piracy precautions were in place prior to the event and all necessary measures were taken during the event.\"\n\nThe Gulf of Aden lies between the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea. Bordered by Djibouti and Somalia to the south west, and Yemen, to the north, this waterway is a mere 18 miles wide at its narrowest point (the Bab el Mandab Strait). It's one of the most dangerous places in the world for ships, cargo and cruise vessels alike, to pass through due to increased piracy in the area.\n\nThis is actually the second time this year that pirates have zeroed in on a cruise ship. Le Ponant, a three masted luxury vessel, was seized in April by Somali pirates. That vessel was carrying 30 crew members -- though no passengers -- and after an eight day standoff those onboard were rescued. The ship ultimately was also rescued and pirates were captured.\n\nMost cruise ships that transit this most dangerous of international waterways are equipped with anti-piracy weaponry. A cruise captain whose ship traveled from the Mediterranean to the Seychelles already this fall, told Cruise Critic that particularly effective is a sonic device that is in essence like a heavy duty stereo speaker. It sends a sonic wave out to a directed target, punishing with a sound so potentially powerful that it bursts eardrums and shocks pirates into dropping weapons and losing focus.\n\nIf the Gulf of Aden is so dangerous why do cruise ships continue to sail through it? \"Right now the Gulf of Aden is the most viable gateway between the Mediterranean and Asia says Oceania Cruises' Tim Rubacky. The only other option is to feature itineraries that cruise down the west coast of Africa and there's a reason why few cruise lines offer such trips. It adds an additional 20 - 30 days to an already lengthy trip.\n\nFor instance, next fall, Princess Cruises' Ocean Princess, on its way from Europe to the Far East that skips the Gulf of Aden, will sail two repositionings to get to Singapore, the ultimate destination. The first is a 31-night Dover to Capetown cruise. There are just 13 ports of call on the schedule and most, aside from Lisbon, Le Havre, Casablanca and Dakar, are anything but household names. Ocean Princess will then depart from for a 32-night Capetown to Singapore voyage; with just nine stops on land, sea days again vastly outnumber port calls.\n\nIn contrast, when Oceania Nautica returns to Europe next April, it will do so via a 35-night cruise between Hong Kong and Athens. That's literally half the length of a voyage around Africa.\n\nAs well, the region isn't as risky for cruise ships as it clearly has been for cargo vessels and oil tankers (which is why the occasional cruise ship run-in with pirates makes significantly more headlines). Cruise ships are less of an easy target with significantly larger crew members and less easy-to-access open deck space."}

He had a collection, and many books relating to the subject. I had always thought his interest stemmed from the fact that he was in the United States Navy, wish I had asked more questions!\n\nWikipedia has the following information about the United States Lighthouse Service:. It was the successor of the Lighthouse Board.\n\nIn 1910, 11,713 aids to navigation of all types were around the country. Congress abolished the U.S. Light-House Board and created the Bureau of Lighthouses under the Department of Commerce.\n\nThe Board had hired a number of civilians and many of these experienced people took over the roles that the military officers had been playing. Though initially called inspectors, the civilian heads of the districts changed their titles to superintendent. Also at this time, the placement of aids to navigation along rivers had become the responsibility of the Lighthouse Service, and many of these aids were tended on a part-time basis by local citizens called lamp lighters and lamp attendants.\n\n1716-The Boston Lighthouse was illuminated, making it the first lighthouse established in what would later become The United States.\n\n1719-A cannon was placed near the Boston Lighthouse \"to answer ships in a fog,\" becoming the first fog signal established in America.\n\n1866-By this date, most of the lights that had become discontinued during the Civil War had been repaired and re-lighted.\n\n1876-The Lighthouse Service began installing libraries on all lightships and inaccessible off\u2014shore stations.\n\n1880-Congress asserted that \"masters of lighthouse tenders shall have police powers in matters pertaining to government property and smuggling.\"\n\n1855- The U.

{"text":"The photos you see up top are quite possibly the only known photographic evidence of the actual iceberg that struck the Titanic. Understandably, nobody had bothered to snap any photographs while the ship was actually sinking, so it's impossible to make an absolutely confirmed positive identification. But both photographs feature the telltale sign of a collision with a ship, and likely a recent one at that: a streak of red paint.\n\nThe photo up top was taken by the chief steward of the German ocean liner SS Prinz Adalbert, which on Apr. 15 was sailing through the North Atlantic mere miles away from where the Titanic had sunk the night before. At the time, the chief steward hadn't yet learned of theTitanic's fate, so he wasn't even on the lookout for icebergs. He simply spotted a streak of red paint along the iceberg's base, which most likely meant a ship had collided with it in the last 12 hours.\n\nThis next photo was taken by a Captain De Carteret of the Minia, one of a few cable ships \u2014 vessels ordinarily used to lay deep sea cables, such as those for telecommunications \u2014 sent to the site of the shipwreck to recover corpses and debris. The captain claimed this was the only iceberg in the area, and the red paint was again a clear sign that a ship had recently struck it. There's some disagreement over whether this was the onlyiceberg in the area, but it certainly seems likely thatsomething had hit it, and the odds are good that that something was the Titanic.\n\nFrom conception to sinking, the Titanic really only lasted about five years, although obviously its memory has endured far longer. But by comparison, the iceberg began its slow journey to the North Atlantic over three thousand years ago. Again, we can only guess at the exact details, but the story likely began with snowfall on the western coast of Greenland somewhere around 1,000 BCE. After a few months, this snow has been turned into a more compacted form called firn, which then over subsequent decades is compressed into dense ice by the weight of newer snow on top of it.\n\nThe frozen water in these glaciers is slowly forced further westward toward the sea. When they finally reach the coast of the Arctic Ocean, the lapping tides break off chunks of the ice, and icebergs are calved from the glacier, some 30 centuries after their source water was first deposited. The iceberg that sank the Titanic began its journey as a rough contemporary of King Tutankhamun, entire civilizations rising and falling while it made its slow march to infamy.\n\nBut once all that's done, the iceberg's life was a short one. We know that because the Titanic sank in the North Atlantic, rather than the Arctic, which means the currents must have taken it far south of where it was calved. Starting on the Greenland coast, it would have moved from Baffin Bay to the Davis Strait and then onto the Labrador Sea and, at last, the Atlantic.\n\nThe Titanic iceberg was one of the lucky ones, so to speak, as the vast, vast majority of icebergs melt long before they reach that far south. Of the 15,000 to 30,000 icebergs calved each years by the Greenland glaciers, probably only about 1 percent of them ever make it all the way to the Atlantic. On Apr. 15, 1912, the iceberg was some 5,000 miles south of the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe water temperature on the night of the Titanic sinking was thought to be about 28 degrees Fahrenheit, just below freezing. Such a temperature was of course lethally cold for all those passengers who had been forced to take to the open water to escape the sinking ship.\n\nBut such temperatures are far too warm to sustain icebergs for very long. The average life expectancy of an iceberg in the North Atlantic is only about two to three years from calving to melting. That means it likely broke off from Greenland in 1910 or 1911, and was gone forever by the end of 1912 or sometime in 1913. In all likelihood, the iceberg that sank the Titanic didn't even endure to the outbreak of World War I, a lost splash of freshwater mixed in imperceptibly with the rest of the North Atlantic.\n\nIn Latin, the word 'calculus' means 'pebble,' meaning that small stones were used to calculate things. Calculus is essentially the study of change, and the pebbles represent small, gradual changes that can produce impressive results. The origin of calculus is not the work of a single man, not even the work of the two men pictured above - but like most major discoveries, a gradual build of overlapping discoveries, something very similar to calculus itself. The question over the creation of the branch of mathematics has become one of the fiercest rivalries in modern history - that between Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz.\n\nIn 1666 (and perhaps earlier), when Newton was 23 - he had begun work on what he called \"the method of fluxions and fluents,\" effectively what we know as calculus. Newton's discovery of calculus was mainly a result of practical use - he needed a method to solve problems in physics and geometry, and calculus was what resulted. On the other hand, Leibniz had become fascinated by the tangent line problem and began to study calculus around 1675.\n\nThe ideas of the two men were similar, although it is unlikely that either of them knew the specifics of the other's work. The two men spoke in letters often, and discussed mathematics - and although the Royal Society found Leibniz effectively guilty of plagiarism later, this was not likely the case. Both men came to similar discoveries in different ways - Leibniz came to integration first, while Newton began his work with derivatives.\n\nAlthough Newton discovered the principles of calculus first - he did not publish them until many years after Leibniz did. Leibniz published his first paper employing calculus in 1684, but Newton did not publish his fluxion notation form of calculus until 1693, and a complete version was not available until 1704! Nonetheless, Newton still came to the discovery first - and although both men are officially credited, Newton is the one that most people remember.\n\nHowever, Newton doesn't deserve all the credit here. The famous dy\/dx notation that calculus students have come to love and hate was developed by Leibniz. Although Newton may have come to the discovery first, Leibniz attacked the problems with far better notation - and we have naturally adopted it. Instead of Leibniz's dx\/dt (shown below) notation for derivatives, Newton preferred 'dot' notation:\n\nHowever, this dot notation can become confusing, especially when used for higher order derivatives, so it has been generally dismissed - except for hardcore Newton fanatics who insist on using his notation. Newton did not even have a standard notation for integration, but frequently switched; but Leibniz used the recognizable integration symbol:\n\nThis has developed into a fantastic controversy over the years - and has become as much of a moral question as it is scientific. Many Leibniz advocates belief that Newton doesn't deserve full credit because he didn't publish his findings first - while many others believe that Newton came to the discovery first, so the credit is his. Personally, I have to place myself on the side of Newton - although Leibniz's notation is wonderful, Newton discovered the principles first.\n\nStephen Hawking (b. 1942) - Most well known for Hawking radiation and theorems involving gravitational singularities.

{"text":"Hi guys, I apologize if this isn't the correct location for a topic like this. Basically, my question concerns the sinking a dreadnought battleship. I'll try to give a little background to the inquiry so it doesn't come across as too ridiculous (because I'm sure it will).\n\nI am currently researching information on WWI British dreadnoughts for a novel that I'm writing; I came across these forums during my search, and felt that some members might be able to help me out. The book in and of itself, other than a short scene, has very little to do with dreadnoughts, but I would still prefer it to be as accurate as possible. At the moment, the scene involves two crew mates sinking the ship by setting off an explosion below the deck in the stern.\n\nGiven that the ship is much like the HMS Warspite (03) and armed as if it were commissioned during WWI, how difficult would this be to pull off? Was there anything already in (or near) the stern that could aid them in doing something like this (torpedoes, oil, coal)? In short, if such a feat is too outrageous, I want to scrap the idea right away\u2014but am not knowledgeable enough to know if that is really the case.\n\nI'm no expert on the matter but I would have thought scuttling charges in a single location would be ineffective due to the watertight compartments. Unless the explosion also detonated an ammunition magazine, but if this was in the stern, it would most likely blow that section off - the ship could still be afloat at that point, although it would obviously be missing its propeller and rudder.\n\nThe Queen Elizabeth class ships as initially commissioned did have two rear turrets, so there would have been an ammunition magazine serving them. That would be a little forward of the stern but maybe that would be suitable for your scenario?\n\nA boiler explosion would cripple the ship but not sink it, the easiest method to cause a problem is a coal bunker fire but again thats aggravating to the smooth running of the ship and rarely fatal.\n\nAs has been mentioned above an explosion in one of the rear ammunition magazines is your best bet, preferably while the watertight doors are open.\n\nI'm assuming this is sabotage rather than ammunition mishandling?\n\nIn that case a misfire in one of the guns during a test firing might create a large enoug explosion to set off a chain reaction down the magazine feed but thats a pretty rare circumstance since all the safety cutoofs would have to be locked open or ammunition stacked in the turret, that wasnt unknown in combat situations but might be rare in peacetime training.\n\nOn the other hand gunnery drill was notably lax and inefficient in the Royal Navy pre-WW1 so that sort of mistake might be possible?\n\nThank you guys so much for the quick responses! All of these links\/facts are extremely helpful.\n\nIt seems like setting off an explosion in the rearmost ammunition magazine is the winner (it is sabotage). Assuming the magazine works like the ones here, what would be the simplest way to cause the cordite\/projectiles to explode? In my rough draft of the scene, a pistol is used to detonate the initial explosion; however, that's my imagination thinking in Hollywood-action-flick mode, and I don't know if it is feasible.\n\nIf your guy is any good at chemistry a simple time fuse would do the job. I dont know the exact composition but theres a small charge of explosive, you squeeze one end with pliers or similar, that breaks the glass vial inside the case which contains slow acid which eats through the restaining pin which sets off the charge.\n\nThats more of a WW2 sneaky SOE device but perfectly feasible, cordite or other propellant charges in those days were soft bagged, think of a short bolster pillow stuffed with explosive.\nAll he has to do is secrete the pen sized device on his person as he enters the magazine for whatever excuse, set off the timer and then push it into the explosive charge, preferably round the back out of public view.\n\nHe's then got however long he set the fuse for (theyre chemical not mechanical so its approximate not precise) to make his excuses and get out."}

In 1950 William Watkins Ltd merged with two other operators to form Ship Towage (London) Ltd.\n\nAs a sea going tug Cervia's duties were often dangerous, but on the foggy night of 25th September 1954 she was to experience her darkest hour. Whilst towing the P & O liner Arcadia, stern first, from Tilbury Dock to the Tilbury Landing Stage, Cervia was accidentally sunk with the loss of all five members of the crew. The accident occurred when the Liner's engines were put ahead to avoid a possible collision with another vessel waiting to enter the dock. Cervia was dragged through the wash of the great liner as frantic attempts to release the towing hawser failed, inevitably causing the small tug to be swamped. Two days after the tragedy Cervia was re-floated and brought into Ramsgate to undergo repairs.\n\nFurther mergers eventually found Cervia in the employ of The London Tug Company whom she served until 1972. Sold to the Medway Maritime Museum, Cervia's retirement was to be brief, entering service for the International Towing Company one year later in 1973. Cervia was to continue her towing duties for a further decade until coming into the guardianship of the East Kent Maritime Museum in 1985. Today, having been fully restored, steam tug Cervia takes pride of place in the museum at her permanent berth in Ramsgate's Royal Harbour."}

Showing the size difference between early and later vessels. Photo from Shetland Museum and Archives\n\nFrom around 1880 the herring industry grew rapidly, accompanied by a parallel increase in the already established trend of replacing the Sixareen, which was not a vessel very well suited for herring fishing, with larger decked sail boats. These early boats were generally of forty to fifty foot of keel, and crewed by six, as their predecessors, the Sixareens, had been. They were, however, considerably more expensive to purchase, and consequently outwith the reach of almost all fishermen of the day. This problem was overcome by local merchants and business people investing in a vessel by way of a loan, or by hiring a crew to operate it for them. In these early years the fleet operating out of Levenwick comprised of:\n\nJames Goudie\nJohn Mouat\nHenry Sinclair\nJames Johnson\nGeorge Smith\nJohn Aitken\nWilliam Mouat\nMagnus Colvin\n\nDespite the arrival of newer larger vessels, several of these early boats such as the Maria Elizabeth, Britannia and Lady Mary continued fishing in to the 20th Century. Likewise several of the early skippers continued their careers on the larger, newer arrivals. James Johnson skipper of the Minnie and Attie went on to skipper the Lebanon, John Mouat of the Annie went on to the Superb, Henry Sinclair of the Britannia went on to the Restless Wave, and John Aitken of the Lady Mary went on to the Ocean Bride.\n\nThese newer vessels were mostly of around sixty foot of keel or more, and of the Fifie or Zulu class. The growth in the herring fishery continued over the next two decades and in to the dawn of the 20th Century. At its peak, around the turn of the Century, Levenwick was home port to twenty six vessels, which included:\n\nOf these vessels the Presto, Nellie Jane and Volunteer were former Lowestoft smacks. The Maggie Jane became a total loss as a result of a fire, but was replaced by the Verdant.\n\nAlthough Levenwick was considered the main Dunrossness anchorage, a secondary anchorage existed at Grutness which was considered the home port of the following vessels in the early years of the 20th Century.\n\nPart of the fleet at anchor in Leven Wick in 1922. Identifiable are (l to r) the Majestic (LK1088), Sunshine (LK1104), Comorin (LK1114), Native Queen (LK62), (LK1644), Vicilantibus (LK919) and Esther (LK546).

Showing the Herring Station and at anchor (l to r) the Pansy (LK1109), Shamrock II (LK747), Mina Edith (LK1009), Brothers Gem (LK1103), and Constance (LK664). Photo from Shetland Museum and Archives\n\nThe trend of investment by local merchants and business people in the industry in its earlier years was to continue throughout most of its existence. George Leslie Snr. and George Leslie Jnr. proprietors of Quendale Farm etc, were among the main investors in the industry, being involved at one time or another with, along with others, the Orion, Verdant, Sunshine, Alert, Majestic, Daisy Flower of Quendale, Garland, Mina Edith and Banffshire. John Bruce of Sumburgh was an investor in the Lady Mary, and R & T Henderson were involved with the Maria Elizabeth, Annie, Britannia and Superb. Lerwick merchants also played a part, with such as D & G Kay having a share in the Pansy and Sinclair Johnson being involved with the Seiner and Laurel, among others.\n\nThe lifespan of these newer early 20th Century vessels was very varied, the age of sail propulsion to which they belonged was rapidly closing even while they were still new, the purpose built steam drifter was the rising star. Several of these sail boats converted to one form of motorised propulsion or another during the first decade or so of their lives, with varying degrees of success, while others remained with sail as long as the vessel remained viable. World War I also changed the industry for ever, with markets vanishing never to return.\n\nMost of these boats survived WWI to return to fishing for a few years afterwards, but a number were scrapped in the early 1920's when they were around 20 years old. A few of the more successful vessels went on to have quite extensive careers as motor vessels, some of those were scrapped in the mid-1930's, but among the longest surviving, the Majestic, after spending a few years in service as the packet boat Innovator serving North Isles, returned to fishing as the Norseman's Bride (LK135), ending her career in the 1950's, and the Laurel is believed to have fished her final season in 1955.\n\nMotorised vessels more like those we recognise by the term today were becoming the norm by the time the majority of these vessels had come of the end of their working lives, and those along with motorised land transport and better roads, which were also becoming the norm, gave fishermen greater flexibility as to where they landed their catches and based their vessels. With the result that Lerwick Harbour with its facilities and external connections became the main port for the east coast of Shetland, leaving Levenwick to become what it is today, an occasional anchorage for pleasure craft and shelter. So although Dunrossness still produces successful full-time fishermen today, albeit a great deal fewer than at times in the past, there is little visible evidence of the fact within the district any longer."}

{"text":"Contents\n\nConstruction of the boom commenced in January 1942 and the boom and gates were fully operational by August 1942. For over three years, entry to Sydney Harbour was restricted by the boom net. All vessels including ships, ferries and fishing boats gained access to the harbour via one of three gates in the anti-torpedo and anti\u2013submarine boom which spanned the harbour from Green Point to Georges Head. [4]\n\nOn the night of 31 May 1942, three Japanese midget submarines attempted to enter the harbour in what became known as the Attack on Sydney Harbour.[5][6] On the night of the attack the central section of the net was complete and support piles were in place to the west, but there were gaps of up to 400 metres (1,300 ft) wide on either side of the boom net.[5][7] Material shortages, not lack of interest, prevented the completion of the boom net prior to the attack.[8] The first submarine, the M 27, commanded by Lieutenant Jahai Chuma was the first submarine to attempt entry. The M 27 followed another vessel in the harbour, but at some stage became entangled in the western end of the boom net's central section. Lieutenant Chuma tried to free his submarine by using a sawtooth metal cutter which only entangled it further. By 8.30 pm he had attracted the attention of the watchman for the Maritime Service Board, James Cargill. He rowed across in a boat and discovered the Japanese submarine. Surprised, Cargill radioed naval headquarters. It took him two hours to convince the navy that there was a Japanese Midget submarine caught in the boom net.[9]\n\nAt 10:27 pm Chuma, realising that he had been detected, detonated charges, destroying the submarine whilst killing himself and his crew in the process. The two other midget submarines penetrated the then only partially completed boom net, and attacked shipping for several hours before being destroyed.[10]\n\nThe boom net was removed after the end of the war in August 1945, and by early 1946, everything apart from the dolphins had been removed. The foundations of the winch house are the only remaining evidence of the anti-submarine boom net and they can still be seen on the shores of Green Point, along with other remaining evidence of military installations, such as underground fortifications and bunker complexes.\n\nAdjacent to the winch house stood a stone marker that had existed for 90 years prior to the boom net's construction. Erected in 1850, this was used as a navigational leading mark for the Eastern Channel; it was lined up with the back mark which still stands on the west side of Parsley Bay.[11]\n\nThe Green Point Battery, located near the winch house for the anti-submarine net.\n\nThe western gate was usually kept shut and was only opened for very large vessels that were damaged or under tow, which required the use of the deeper and straighter Western Channel. The western gate was opened by a tug boat. All other ships used the eastern gate, which was controlled by the boom gate vessel. The gate was opened by dragging it back to the hauling-back dolphin using winches housed on Green Point. The small craft gate was lowered to a depth of 5 metres (16 ft) with a winch mounted on board HMAS Kuramia.\n\nThe boom was 1,480 metres (4,860 ft) long, with two gate openings for ships. The gate on the Western Channel was 121 metres (397 ft) in length and was used for larger vessels. The gate on the eastern side of the channel (Eastern Channel) was 91 metres (299 ft) long, and there was another gate for smaller boats located on the western side of the boom gate vessel (tug boat), which was 30 metres (98 ft) long. The vessel used to pull theses gates open was HMAS Kuramia, a converted Sydney Harbour ferry, that had been used for public transportation from 1914. The central and western sections of the boom consisted of some 49 clusters of four piles with the net, which was made of wire and interlocking steel rings about 450 millimetres (18 in) in diameter, suspended between them. The eastern, Green Point, section of the net was suspended from buoys, as were the eastern and western gate nets."}

{"text":"The Titanic: 5 Things You Didn't Know\n\n3- One stewardess survived three major ship disasters\n\nThe expected reaction upon finding yourself on a sinking ship is to start shrieking and doing stupid things. At least one stewardess aboard the Titanic was able to think back to her previous sea disaster experience (and would have the opportunity to hone her disaster skills for future use).\n\nViolet Jessop was on board the Olympic when it collided with the Hawke in 1911, moved to the Titanic and survived its sinking a year later, and finally transferred to the Britannic, which hit a mine and sank in 1916, making her one of the only women in history who had a mental list of \"Things To Remember When Your Ship Is Sinking.\" Incidentally, the first thing on the list was a toothbrush.\n\n4- Intentionally ramming the iceberg may have saved the Titanic\n\nShortly before the Titanic's collision, the nearby Californian contacted Titanic's wireless operator, Jack Philips, to warn him that there was quite a lot of ice around. Philips literally told them to shut up and went back to whatever it was he was doing, which was evidently more important than not sinking ocean liners.\n\nHad theTitanic's captain, Edward J. Smith, merely shouted at the iceberg and plowed straight into it with the same disdain his wireless operator had demonstrated, the Titanic probably would have survived the impact. Only two forward compartments would have flooded, allowing Titanic to stay afloat; instead, the ship's attempt to turn caused flooding in five compartments along its starboard side, more damage than the ship could withstand.\n\n5- A novella published 14 years earlier described a very similar disaster\n\nIn 1898, an American author named Morgan Robertson wrote Futility, or the Wreck of the Titan, a book whose similarities with the actual event are almost creepy. Aside from the obvious -- that the novella is about a similar ship with a nearly identical name -- the fictional ship sails in the same month, is short on lifeboats, and is sailing from Southampton, England, when it collides with an iceberg and sinks into the Atlantic.\n\nUnlike the historical Titanic, the tale of the Titan contains a hero who fights a polar bear while stranded on the iceberg, an addition which would almost certainly improve the quality of the current Titanic narrative.

{"text":"Indian Ocean exhibition sets sail in Exeter\n\nThe maritime traditions of people living and travelling on the major sea routes of the western Indian Ocean are being explored in an exhibition at the University of Exeter, from 16 September to 17 December.\n\nIn the past wooden boats particular to the Red Sea, Arabian-Persian Gulf and western Indian Ocean played a significant role along its busy waterways.\n\nThe boats are known in English as dhows, though it is not a term used by the people of the region. Dhows carried people as passengers, slaves and pilgrims, as well as transporting cargoes, from timber and goats to pepper and incense. They were used in fishing the Ocean's rich waters and in diving for its legendary pearls.\n\nThese distinctive and graceful boats are the focus of the exhibition and an academic conference which takes place at the same time. This is the first time that an exhibition dedicated to the history and significance of the dhow has been held in this country.\n\nIt brings together a wealth of material culture and images relating to shows and the dhow trade, including full size vessels, as well as a range of hitherto unseen dhow models, photographs and artefacts related to dhow construction and life aboard.\n\nSoaring over the exhibition will be four model dhows suspended from the ceiling in all their majestic glory at the University of Exeter's Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies.\n\nTwo full size dhows, originally part of the now closed Exeter Maritime Museum, will form the centrepiece of the exhibit. This is apt because dhows still form an intrinsic part of Middle Eastern identity and cultural heritage, where the dhow is used on stamps, coins and government crests.\n\nThe design of the boats is not merely functional, it also tells much about the, identify of the people who built, own and sail in them according to researcher, Dr John Cooper. He is part of the Maritime Culture of Arabian\u2013Persian Gulf and Red Sea Project at the University of Exeter involved in a three year research programme to investigate the maritime past of the region.\n\nDr Cooper said: 'Dhows remind us of how people even in the very recent past have lived within the great cycles of nature. Navigators had to know their environment inside out. It wasn't just a case of knowing the seasonal wind patterns, they read the stars, the behaviour of animals at sea, wave patterns, the shapes of headlands and mountains, all to find their way from place to place. There was no Sat Nav for them.'\n\nHe added: 'And it's not just the navigators who had this phenomenal technical ability. The builders, even of the biggest and most complex dhows, built these vessels without relying on a single drawing. Their mental agility and planning skills were phenomenal.'\n\nIbn Majid was one such dhow captain, a famous navigator in the 15th century whose incredible knowledge was translated onto the page when he wrote a guide explaining how to navigate the monsoon winds of the Indian Ocean, when best to depart and other invaluable information.\n\nA workshop on the River Dart rather than in the sunnier climes of the Red Sea provides the setting for the creation of several model dhows, being carefully constructed by retired architect Anthony Harrison and professional artist Paul Riley for the exhibition.\n\nThe model dhows were based on scale drawings of real dhows drawn in Yemen and Djibouti by University of Exeter researchers Dr Cooper and his colleague Dr Chiara Zazzaro. The measurements and discussions with traditional boat builders and fishermen were gleamed during a field trip to the region. This type of documentation forms a major part of the research project as many of the skills for building and sailing the wooden dhows are dying out as the faster moving fibreglass boats take over from their wooden relatives.\n\nThe MARES Project is building on Professor Dionisius Agius's previous ethnographic work in the Arabian-Persian Gulf and Oman. His research focused on the history and origin of traditional wooden vessels and their construction, the crew, folklore history, resources, and trade in the Western Indian Ocean.\n\nThe University of Exeter will be hosting a four day conference 'Red Sea V- Navigated Spaces, Connected Places' led by Professor Agius from the University's Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies. It is attracting international expertise from universities around the world involved in this specialised area of maritime research.\n\n'The Dhow Mastery of the Monsoon' exhibition is free of charge and open to members of the public weekdays from 9am until 5pm from 16 September to 17 December at the Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies."}
{"text":"'Sputnik trawler' is a nickname given to two classes of series-built side trawlers. In the mid to late 1950s and early 1960s, these new and revolutionary boats were intended to replace ageing steam trawlers. The little workhorses had to combat the inevitable prejudice against something ground-breaking and also the torrid economic state of the trawling industry in the 1960s. Inevitably, there were casualties. However, removed from their intended role as mini-side trawlers based at the main trawling ports, the sputniks began to turn in some fine performances for skippers belonging to the inshore ports. Sputniks became successful seine netters, pelagic trawlers and scallop dredgers, their performance often enhanced in later years by extensive rebuilding, which left fifteen-year-old vessels looking like brand new boats. Against the odds of the 1960s trawling depression, some of the sputniks even did well as side trawlers and spawned the larger 'Spinningdale' trawlers. The Spinningdales proved an exceptional success as side trawlers and their design was every bit as capable of being adapted to other forms of fishing as the sputniks. Some of the Spinningdales were built as outstandingly successful seiner\/trawlers for inshore fishing, where they were later joined by many sister vessels following the demise of the trawling industry. This book is a memorial to the sputniks and Spinningdales, with brief histories and photographs, and some fine fishermen's anecdotes about the multitude of things these boats did during some of the best years the fishing industry will ever know.\n\nSaving lives from the waters around the coasts of Britain and all Ireland doesn't get any less hazardous. For more than 175 years rescuing sailors from shipwrecks or holidaymakers from small boats has been in the hands of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), which remains a wholly voluntary-funded, non-Government organisation.\n\nNo matter how sophisticated ships have become storms are as bad as ever and ships, it seems, just as likely to get into difficulties, and the lives of crews are still at risk. Cameron's account puts the story into a political and social perspective, and thrills with the stirring and often poignant narrative of the rescues themselves.\n\nIan Cameron was born in 1924 and educated at Oxford University. In WWII he was a pilot in the Fleet Air Arm, and saw service on Atlantic and Russian convoys. A full-time writer since 1956, his books have been translated into fourteen languages.\n\nFor over 180 years images of strong, selfless males have populated the reports and literature of the lifeboat service. What has not been so well documented or recognised are the roles that, right from the very beginning, women have played in working to save lives at sea.\n\nThe stereotypical image is of women waiting in the lifeboat house for their men to return \u2013 brewing tea and giving encouragement and solace to each other. Look more deeply and it becomes clear that women have always been at the heart of the RNLI RNLI operation, undertaking a wide range of tasks which draw upon their distinctive skills and talents. From Victorian times right through to the twenty-first century, women have always been 'strong to save'. The RNLI is alive with outstanding women working alongside equally outstanding men, ensuring that as many people as possible who find themselves in trouble, either on or by the sea, live rather than drown.\n\nIn Hidden Depths: Women of the RNLI, we begin to understand what magnificent feats of strength and teamwork these courageous and dedicated women have performed and still do. Rain speared down from black skies, a howling freezing gale tore at the roots of the fishermen's cottages by the shoreline, a boiling sea was thundering ashore with huge combers breaking over the rocks in a fury of spume. Out there tossing and corkscrewing among the huge waves lay the entire fishing fleet of Newbiggin, among them almost the entire lifeboat crew. Today was to be the day the women of Newbiggin, the fishermen's wives, saved their men folk.\n\nTelling the story of the once-ubiquitous Lancashire Nobby, a handsome sailing trawler that was once found in every harbour from West Wales to the West Coast of Scotland. This inshore boat worked as a shrimper in Morecambe bay working from the fishing ports of Barrow, Morcambe, Fleetwood and Heysham. It was also worked on the Lancashire coast and Liverpool bay, operating from Lytham St Annes, Southport and the port of Liverpool. The Nobby also worked from Rhyl and Colwyn Bay on the North Wales coast, through the Menai Strait and down into Cardigan Bay, operating as far South as Cardigan and Fishguard.\n\nNick Miller has studied the history of the Nobby for the last decade and tells the story in an accessible way. He lives in Barrow in Furness.\n\nCovering the whole of the UK, from Northern Scotland to the South Coast.\n\nThe loss of many ships and men is detailed in Trawler Disasters. Fishing is Britain's deadliest industry \u2013 and many thousands have died in the pursuit of cod, herring, haddock, mackerel and a host of other fish so that we can feast on them.\n\nPerhaps the most famous of recent disasters was the loss of the Gaul, a Hull-based trawler, which disappeared in the Arctic in February 1974. Its story has become one of conspiracy theory, espionage and cover-up and it wasn't until the wreck was found and investigated that many of these theories were laid to rest.\n\nPatricia O'Driscoll and John Nicklin tell the story of the tragic losses of a multitude of ships which were lost in the period from the end of the War until the Cod War, a time when Britain's bountiful seas were being opened to foreign competition after the nation joined the EEC. Fishing once employed over half a million people in the UK and its recent history is one of decline.\n\nIt is still a story of tragedy as men still die and boats are still lost to the elements. Each tragedy hits a port hard, with everyone feeling the loss of one of their own. From the East Coast to the West, from Northern Scotland to Southern England, no part of Britain's coast has been immune to the loss of a fishing boat and its crew.\n\nThis is just the introduction to a two plus hours dvd about the heritage and beauty of Morecambe Bay in the North West of England where I live, just south of the stunning Lake District. It has taken me two years to research, script, film in HD, edit and narrate. I use lots of priceless historical footage from individual donors and film archives, rare Victorian postcards and photography, plus stunning aerial photography of the bay area. Plus, I was given a personal filmed tour around one of the finest Elizabethan houses in the North West, and its oldest topiary gardens in the UK, by the owners Hal and Susie Bagot.\n\nIt will be available shortly, in time for Xmas and Part 2 , will be available from Easter and will cover from Grange over Sands, along the \"Lancashire Coast North of the Sands\", through Ulverston, Barrow and to Walney Island.\nIt is part of a trilogy of \"Our Heritage\" videos that I have produced and copies and further details are available from chris@eventspecialists.co.uk"}

One said \"SOS\" -- save our ship -- but at this point it's not the ship that needs saving, it's the passengers.\n\nThe ship has been without power since an engine room fire five days ago. CBS News reached passenger Jacob Combs on the phone.\n\n\"The really bad part is there was no running water and toilets for almost the first 30 hours,\" Combs said. \"Once they finally did get running water, the toilets only worked in certain places. I would say it's the worst smell imaginable.\"\n\nAboard the Carnival Triumph cruise ship\n\nEmailed photos (above) reveal squalid conditions. Many passengers used red plastic bags as toilets. Hundreds slept in hallways or topside to escape the foul and stagnate air below deck.\n\nCarnival CEO Jerry Cahill insists passengers were never at risk. But 22-year old Leslie Mayberry disagreed.\n\n\"It was leaning to one side it was literally like walking up hill whenever the boat was leaning,\" she said. \"I mean it was very scary,\" Mayberry said. \"I mean a lot of people thought it was going to tip over and sink. And then you look out on the deck and you see the ocean and there is no one, you are just by yourself and you are so alone, even though you are around 3,000 other people on this boat.\"\n\nThe towline pulling the 14-story tall ship snapped, delaying Thursday's operation. It was re-attached, but it will be nightfall before the ship arrives at the terminal. Nellie Betts came from Tupelo, Miss., to meet her daughter.\n\n\"There's no reason why those people should be out there as long as they have. Why? I want to understand why,\" she said. \"What is taking them so long to get them out?\"\n\nOnce the ship arrives at the terminal, Carnival plans to put most of those passengers on a two-hour bus rid to New Orleans or even to Galveston, Texas, but some already are saying, \"no thanks\" - they have relatives picking them up in Mobile so they can go straight home.\n\nI love the photes of the US Coast guard flying in a generator. Where was the Panmanian coast guard where that ship is registered. I only hope the coast guard charges Carnival the king's randsom for it.\n\nOh, sure, as long as you like wading in other folks' excrement and breathing the air from the open sewer on the decks and soaked into some of the mattresses as it dripped from one deck to the other. Bet you would not have lasted ten minutes without squealing like a baby.\n\nSeriously, people thought the ship was going to tip over? Obviously said \"people\" have never been at sea in something other than a luxury cruiseliner. Boats list from side to side because of... wait for it.... WAVES. Cruise ships have stablizers that stick out into the water to make them rock back and forth less, but no engine, no power = no stabilizers.\n\nWhat bothers me about this is not that a ship had a major issue (which could have been a hell of a lot worse) but that they'll build ships (Are we having fun yet?) that packs in 4,000 some folks. WW2 troupe ships ships I can see\/understand.\n\nLets assume there was a real\/major issue ... how would you get all those folks off and into life boats\/rafts. And as far as life boats, just count what you can see 'times two.' Each of those will hold (assuming you launch them in time) maybe 30'ish people. The rest of the 4,000 have to go into the water and climb into a life raft. Why anyone would go on a 'cruize' on a ship like this bugger's belief.\n\nCruising has become hazardous to life and limb. it's for suckers and fools until these ships are registered in the US, Canada. Europe or Japan and inspected by the authorities in those countries. Yeh I know Malta is a lovely place but maybe it and countries like it aren't the best for safety inspections and laws to prevent illness and death on the high seas.\n\nNot to mention dangerous to health. Some of the clowns making fun of the folks who had to deal with this are morons if they believe this was any fun or particularly enjoyable. Or safe. The cruise line should have evacuated all passengers when it happened. Despite the fine print in the tickets, hopefully the cruise line will have to face responsibility"}

On 1 Oct 1936 he took command of the small \"duck\" school boat U-5, commanding her until 2 Feb 1938 (Busch and R\u00f6ll, 1999).\n\nGlattes then served in several staff positions until\nhe began his U-boat familiarization (Baubelehrung) at the AG Weser yard in Hamburg on 18 Nov 1938. On 10 Dec he took command of his first attack boat, the much larger type IX boat U-39 (Busch and R\u00f6ll, 1999).\n\nFirst U-boat to be sunk in WWII\n\nOn 19 Aug 1939 Kptlt. Gerhard Glattes took his U-39 out from Wilhelmshaven in preparation for the possible war in near future. On 14 Sept 1939 while inbound for base after 26 days at sea the boat ran into the British Aircraft Carrier HMS Ark Royal - every submariner's dream target. Glattes carefully set up a very promising attack and fired 3 torpedoes on the carrier and then heard detonations. Assuming a hit they were thrilled but actually none of the torpedoes hit the carrier, all malfunctioned and exploded near the ship (Blair, 1996).\n\nThe 3 escort destroyers, HMS Faulknor, HMS Foxhound and HMS Firedrake, swung into action and through good sonar conditions managed to damage the U-39 enough for Glattes to order the boat to the surface and the crew to abandon ship. She surfaced in broad daylight surrounded by 3 British destroyers who opened fire but promptly stopped when it was evident that the Germans were abandoning ship. All 44 crew members were rescued (Blair, 1996).\n\nGerhard Glattes spent the next 7 and a half years as Prisoner of War (POW), being released on 8 April 1947 (Busch and R\u00f6ll, 1999).

{"text":"was found convenient, particularly in ships of war, to connect the two short decks by a boarded passage on each side, called the gangway; to support which were placed beams, or rafters, that reached right across the ship. This gave to the whole such a continuous appearance, that no person, not otherwise taught would hesitate to call it as our landman did * the upper deck of the ship. And even a marine writer of France justifies the term:-\"On peut regarder les gaillards comme le Pont le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 des vaisseaux, dout une partie est interrompue entre le grand m\u00e2t et le m\u00e2t de misaine; ce qui forme deux demi-ponts au niveau l'un de I'autre.\" \u2020\n\nSome advances have, however, since been made. The French, for instance, were accustomed occasionally to cover with a grating the open space between the two \"half-decks;\" and then it was no longer \"les gaillards,\" or \"les demi-ponts,\" but \"le pont de cailbottis,\" the deck with a grating. \" Je crois donc que les vaisseaux du second rang pourroient avoir trois ponts sans gaillards, on plut\u00f4t les gaillards qui formeroient le troisi\u00e8me pont, seroient joints par des cailbottis, comme on l'a v\u00fb au Tonnant. De tels b\u00e2timens, qu'on pourroit regrarder comme d'ayant que deux ponts, seroient, au moyen du pont de cailbottis, &c.\" \u2021 In more modern times, each passage, or gangway, has in some cases been widened, so as to admit a gun to recoil; or, if necessary, as many guns as the passage, from its length, can receive. But even this, with the English, is not allowed to take from the deck that is underneath, and which is now almost covered from sight, its ancient name of upper. The ship, therefore, should particularity be requisite, not otherwise, has a new deck assigned to her, called the spar deck; a name the origin or application of which every one seems ignorant. If it is because the ship's spare spars are stowed on that deck, so are they in the same place on board every ship ; namely, on each side of the launch, between the fore and main masts. The French say, \"Pont sur gueule,\" which may be rendered, \"the deck built over the mouth of the upper deck,\" commonly called the waist. Why is this not as complete a deck as any in the ship ? Hence, asno one ventures, in common utterance, to speak of a spar-decked one, two, or three decker, a ship of this construction may mount a whole tier of cannon beyond what her denomination expresses and we shall, by and by, have to adduce some very formidable examples.\n\nNot only the three and the two, but the single decked ship feels, and that to a greater extent, the inconvenience of this ambiguous nomenclature.

Rickinson had a heart condition, Blackborow had\ngangrene in his toes several of which were amputated, Hudson was\nhaving a nervous breakdown and suffered an infected boil.\nThere were many other cases of frostbite, dysentery, boils, sores\netc. that meant that both surgeons were best left on Elephant Island\nrather than accompanying Shackleton to South Georgia.\n\nBiography\n\nMacklin was the son of a doctor, he was born in\nIndia, when the family returned to England, they settled in the\nScilly Isles off the coast of Cornwall where his father set up\npractise. After a short spell working as a deckhand, Macklin read\nmedicine at Manchester\nUniversity, it was very shortly after qualifying that he applied for the Endurance expedition.\n\nOn return to England, Macklin Joined the army as\nan officer in the Medical Corps serving in France and Russia during\nthe First World War. He served first with the Yorks later\ntransferring as medical officer to the Tanks. Going to the Italian\nfront with his battalion, he won the Military Cross (M.C.) for\nbravery in tending the wounded under fire.\n\nShackleton invited Macklin to join him again for\nthe Quest expedition in 1922, which like many of the old Endurance\ncrew, he was happy to do so. As the ship's surgeon, on Shackleton's\ndeath at South Georgia, it fell to Macklin to prepare the body\ninitially for transport to South America and then for burial on\nSouth Georgia.\n\nBack home, he moved to Scotland and set up a\npractise in Dundee where he remained from 1926 to 1947.

Wild, Crean,\nMacklin, McIlroy, Marston,\nand Hurley each had charge of a team, and were fully\nresponsible for the exercising, training, and feeding of\ntheir own dogs. They called in one of the surgeons when\nan animal was sick. We were still losing some dogs\nthrough worms, and it was unfortunate that the doctors\nhad not the proper remedies. Worm-powders were to have\nbeen provided by the expert Canadian dog-driver I had\nengaged before sailing for the south, and when this man\ndid not join the Expedition the matter was overlooked.\n\n\"This afternoon Sallie's three\nyoungest pups, Sue's Sirius, and Mrs. Chippy, the\ncarpenter's cat, have to be shot. We could not undertake\nthe maintenance of weaklings under the new conditions.\nMacklin, Crean, and the\ncarpenter seemed to feel the loss of their friends\nrather badly.\n\nRivalries arose, as might have been\nexpected, and on the 15th of the month a great race, the\n\"Antarctic Derby,\" took place. It was a notable event.\nThe betting had been heavy, and every man aboard the\nship stood to win or lose on the result of the contest.\nSome money had been staked, but the wagers that thrilled\nwere those involving stores of chocolate and cigarettes.\nThe course had been laid off from Khyber Pass, at the\neastern end of the old lead ahead of the ship, to a\npoint clear of the jib-boom, a distance of about 700 yds.\nFive teams went out in the dim noon twilight, with a\nzero temperature and an aurora flickering faintly to the\nsouthward. The starting signal was to be given by the\nflashing of a light on the meteorological station. I was\nappointed starter, Worsley was judge, and James was\ntimekeeper. The bos'n, with a straw hat added to his\nusual Antarctic attire, stood on a box near the\nwinning-post, and was assisted by a couple of shady\ncharacters to shout the odds, which were displayed on a\nboard hung around his neck\u20146 to 4 on Wild, \"evens\" on\nCrean, 2 to 1 against Hurley, 6 to 1 against Macklin, and 8 to 1 against\nMcIlroy. Canvas handkerchiefs fluttered from an\nimprovised grand stand, and the pups, which had never\nseen such strange happenings before, sat round and\nhowled with excitement. The spectators could not see far\nin the dim light, but they heard the shouts of the\ndrivers as the teams approached and greeted the victory\nof the favourite with a roar of cheering that must have\nsounded strange indeed to any seals or penguins that\nhappened to be in our neighbourhood. Wild's time was 2\nmin. 16 sec., or at the rate of 10\u02dd miles per hour for\nthe course.\n\nOn the following day Wild, Hurley,\nMacklin, and McIlroy took\ntheir teams to the Stained Berg, about seven miles west\nof the ship, and on their way back got a female\ncrab-eater, which they killed, skinned, and left to be\npicked up later. They ascended to the top of the berg,\nwhich lay in about lat. 69\u00b0 30\u00b4 S., long. 51\u00b0 W., and\nfrom an elevation of 110 ft. could see no land.\n\nNine p.m. that night, the 27th, saw\nus on the march again. The first 200 yds. took us about\nfive hours to cross, owing to the amount of breaking\ndown of pressure-ridges and filling in of leads that was\nrequired. The surface, too, was now very soft, so our\nprogress was slow and tiring. We managed to get another\nthree-quarters of a mile before lunch, and a further\nmile due west over a very hummocky floe before we camped\nat 5.30 a.m. Greenstreet and Macklin killed and brought in a huge Weddell seal\nweighing about 800 lbs., and two emperor penguins made a\nwelcome addition to our larder.\n\nThe apathy which seemed to take\npossession of some of the men at the frustration of\ntheir hopes was soon dispelled. Parties were sent out\ndaily in different directions to look for seals and\npenguins. We had left, other than reserve sledging\nrations, about 110 lbs. of pemmican, including the\ndog-pemmican, and 300 lbs. of flour. In addition there\nwas a little tea, sugar, dried vegetables, and suet. I\nsent Hurley and Macklin to\nOcean Camp to bring back the food that we had had to\nleave there. They returned with quite a good load,\nincluding 130 lbs. of dry milk, about 50 lbs. each of\ndog-pemmican and jam, and a few tins of potted meats.\nWhen they were about a mile and a half away their voices\nwere quite audible to us at Ocean Camp, so still was the\nair.\n\nThe ice between us and Ocean Camp,\nnow only about five miles away and actually to the\nsouth-west of us, was very broken, but I decided to send\nMacklin and Hurley back\nwith their dogs to see if there was any more food that\ncould be added to our scanty stock. I gave them written\ninstructions to take no undue risk or cross any\nwide-open leads, and said that they were to return by\nmidday the next day.\n\nThe next day I sent\nMacklin and Crean back to\nmake a further selection of the gear, but they found\nthat several leads had opened up during the night, and\nthey had to return when within a mile and a half of\ntheir destination. We were never able to reach Ocean\nCamp again. Still, there was very little left there that\nwould have been of use to us.\n\nI called the men together, explained\nmy plan, and asked for volunteers. Many came forward at\nonce. Some were not fit enough for the work that would\nhave to be done, and others would not have been much use\nin the boat since they were not seasoned sailors, though\nthe experiences of recent months entitled them to some\nconsideration as seafaring men. McIlroy and Macklin were both anxious\nto go but realized that their duty lay on the island\nwith the sick men.\n\nAnother fierce gale was blowing on\nApril 22, interfering with our preparations for the\nvoyage. The cooker from No. 5 tent came adrift in a\ngust, and, although it was chased to the water's edge,\nit disappeared for good. Blackborow's feet were giving\nhim much pain, and McIlroy and Macklin thought it would be necessary for them to\noperate soon. They were under the impression then that\nthey had no chloroform, but they found some subsequently\nin the medicine-chest after we had left.\n\nA census was taken, each man being\nasked to state just what he would like to eat at that\nmoment if he were allowed to have anything that he\nwanted. All, with but one exception, desired a suet\npudding of some sort\u2014the \"duff\" beloved of sailors.\nMacklin asked for many\nreturns of scrambled eggs on hot buttered toast.\n\nThere, just rounding the island which\nhad previously hidden her from our sight, we saw a\nlittle ship flying the Chilian flag.\n\n\"We tried to cheer, but excitement had gripped our vocal\nchords.

{"text":"(Under the direction of Professor Timothy Runyan) Department of History, Program in Maritime Studies, January 2005.\n\nThe purpose of this thesis is to document a shipwreck lost within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and through historical and archaeological analysis illustrate that this vessel is the CGS (Canadian Government Ship) Canada, one of the most influential ships in Canadian history. Built in 1904, the cruiser CGS Canada became the first armed, steel-hulled capital ship owned and operated by the Canadian government. This study attempts to fully understand the significance of this Canadian \"first,\" through an exploration of the mix of political and economic factors that led to the ship's construction. These factors include the contentious debate between the governments of Canada and Britain over naval defense, the growing naval threat from Europe at the dawn of the twentieth-century, and the increasing competition over fisheries resources in the North Atlantic.\n\nThis study examines the success of the ship both in design and function. It chronicles Canada's role in both the Fisheries Protection Fleet and as the nucleus of the Royal Canadian Navy. It was the fastest and best-armed ship in the country's Fisheries Protection Fleet and later became an ideal choice for training naval cadets before the creation of the Royal Canadian Navy in 1910. In that role, Canada became the first Canadian warship to be invited to train with the British Royal Navy.\n\nAlso included in this study is the life of the Canada after its service in the Canadian Navy. In 1924, Barron Gift Collier, a wealthy Florida landowner and advertising magnate, purchased the ship and renamed it Queen of Nassau. The ship was converted into a first-class passenger steamer and put into service as an inter-island cruise ship for the lucrative Nassau-Miami route. This study examines the ship's failure in that endeavor and investigates questions surrounding its subsequent sinking on July 2, 1926.\n\nIn 2001, divers discovered an unknown shipwreck in 230 feet of water within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Funded by NOAA, a team of scientific divers led by NOAA archaeologist Tane Casserley has since conducted three archaeological surveys to the site and concluded with a high degree of probability that the shipwreck in question is the CGS Canada."}

Captain Edward J. Smith was in command. During the course of the journey, Captain Smith, aware that icebergs were in the region, altered the course of the Titanic slightly to the south. On the night of April 14, shortly before midnight, the Titanic collided with a gigantic iceberg\u2014although the impact of the collision was hardly felt by many on board. The collision was indeed serious, however, and the ship began filling with water. By midnight the ship inspectors, understanding that the Titanic was doomed, gave the order to start evacuating \"women and children first\" in the lifeboats, and sent out an international distress call.\n\nMany passengers were apprehensive to leave the Titanic at first, not believing that the ship was actually sinking, and a number of lifeboats left the vessel half-filled. Sinking she was, however, and at 2:30 a.m., April 15, the Titanic went down. Passengers still on board had to jump into the freezing waters of the North Atlantic, while those in the lifeboats watched, helplessly, in shock. More than 1,500 passengers and crew lost their lives, mostly due to hypothermia.\n\nThe world's reaction to the tragedy was jumbled and confused. Initially, the press reported that all the passengers were safe and the Titanic was being towed to safety. Once the awful fate of the ship was known, accusations began flying: the ship was going too fast; the British maritime laws were to blame because of negligent lifeboat requirements; surrounding ships ignored the Titanic's calls for help; iceberg warnings were ignored by the crew. The United States Senate, ready to assign quick blame, initiated an investigation the day after the survivors arrived in New York. In addition to those seeking to find fault, there were heartbreaking stories of selfless heroism, grueling sacrifice, families saying goodbye to each other while some departed in lifeboats and others remained on board, the ship's ensemble playing music as the Titanic went down, and outright admiration for the procedures taken by the captain and crew after the deadly collision occurred.\n\nThe sinking of the Titanic was one of the most devastating peacetime maritime disasters in history. In 1985 the wreck's location was finally discovered at a depth of 2.5 miles. We will never know exactly what happened and what could have been done to avoid the enormous loss of life, but the Titanic's fate continues to haunt the public's imagination."}

Queenborough doesn't show up as a Royal Navy lose in the official loss list of RN vessels. The crew is commemorated on the Tower Hill Memorial, which is a memorial to merchant navy war dead with no known grave. If Queenborough had been in naval service, her crew would have been mainly if not entirely Royal Navy Reserve on active duty and commemorated on one of the service memorial, which isn't the case.\n\nWell, we know Queenborough was sunk by gunnery. What that doesn't tell us is the exact nature of the engagement. The odds that Queenborough was armed are approximately zero. The defensive arming of British ships hadn't gotten as far as trawlers yet.\n\nSo presumably U 86 sighted Queenborough, and fired across her bow to get her to stop. If Queenborough ran, she would have been shelled. If she stopped, the crew would have taken to the lifeboat(s) and the trawler sunk (in this case by gunnery, in other cases by scuttling charges).\n\nOne of the common ways you get a missing ship is when the lifeboats from a ship that was stopped and sunk aren't recovered.

{"text":"Under Stuka dive bomb attack in the Mediterranean\n\nThe old World war I battleship HMS Centurion had been reclassified as a convoy escort ship and was at the centre of Operation Vigorous.\n\nThe situation on Malta was becoming increasingly desperate. While it had been possible to re-inforce the islands air defences by flying a number of Spitfires into the island, what was really needed was a significant improvement in the supplies reaching the island. The Royal Navy sought to address this by sending two convoys simultaneously to the island in an attempt to divide the attentions of the enemy. Operation Harpoon left Gibraltar and headed east on the 12th June. This convoy came under attack on the morning of 14th June, when the cruiser HMS Liverpool was torpedoed. For more on HMS Liverpool see Harpoon.\n\nOn the 14th June heading west from Alexandria was another convoy, with a full Royal Navy complement of 7 cruisers and 26 destroyers in escort plus HMS Centurion, whose main armament was now anti-aircraft guns, codenamed Operation Vigorous. Amongst these was the war weary crew of HMS Eridge, under the command of Frank Gregory-Smith. They had been under air attack so often that it seemed only a matter of time before they were hit. There was mounting tension as they reached the point nearest the the Libyan coast where they could expect the attentions of the Luftwaffe. It was from here that \"a seemingly endless procession of tiny black specks\" was now seen:\n\nFirst ten, then twenty thirty forty fifty Stukas took shape, advancing remorselessly towards the convoy. Fire was opened immediately and the deep boom of heavy gunfire mingled with the continuous smack of shell bursts. Smoke and fumes slowly drew a dark screen across the sky through which the rays of the sun, penetrating with difficulty twitched eerie, dancing shadows across the sea.\n\nTwo bombers, reeling drunkenly away from their companions, spiralled lazily seawards in a series of huge loops; the rest of the air fleet advanced steadily towards their diving positions, accompanied by an extending line of shell bursts. At a signal, the bombers peeled out of formation and dived onto the convoy.\n\nThe sharp snap, snap of close range weapons immediately joined the bedlam of the heavier guns and accelerating aero engines. Then the bombs began to burst in and around the supply ships, blotting them from view as wave after wave dived to the attack.\n\nA frightening pillar of flame followed by a heavy detonation suddenly flared up amongst this upheaval. An agonizing few seconds was ended when the supply ship Bhutan, turning helplessly in a wide semi circle with her hull rent by internal explosions, drifted into sight. Leaving a rescue ship to pick up survivors, the convoy pressed steadily westwards under constant air attack which continued throughout the forenoon and aftemoon.\n\nThe enemy was obviously using every available aircraft in a determined effort to claim as many victims as possible before nightfall restricted aerial activity. But, in spite of the number of bombers engaged, they obtained no more hits. As the day slowly advanced, weary cursing, sweating gunners, firing as fast as their ammunition could be loaded, cast many an apprehensive glance at the sun. They dreaded the coming twilight but hoped that the following darkness would bring them a little respite.\n\nAs a blood red sun sank into the sea, a flotilla of E-boats was sighted ten miles north of the convoy. Destroyers on the outer screen immediately turned towards them at high speed, hoping to fire a few salvoes before the faster craft slipped out of range. That, to everyone's relief, was the only twilight activity.\n\nOnce HMS Eridge had become actively engaged, the earlier reluctance to face another Malta run was replaced by a determination to defend the convoy. Now that men had time to think again, their main emotion was a mixture of thankfulness and optimism. The convoy had endured a night and day of heavy bombing but had lost only one ship within the gunnery zone. Malta lay two nights and a day ahead but, so long as our resolute defence was maintained, most of the supply ships should reach their destination"}

{"text":"Our concern\nwith this topic was first to show the\nhistory of lightships. The pictures are chosen freely\nand include different countries. But there are many\nexceptional shapes and kinds of lightships, which we\nwill deal with in another overview.\n\nThe beginnings\n\nThe first original lightship could have\nbeen a particular version of the Roman galley ships. These ships, rowed\nby slaves, had a mast stump with an iron basket , in which possibly\na fire burned at night. These \"lightships\" were meant to deter pirates\nand guide trading ships into the harbour.\n\nBut the actual development of lightship starts in the 15th century.\nThe Dutch had so called lightships positioned outside their harbours,\nwhich only withdrew when the whole fishing fleet had returned home.\nNote that this process was practised daily.\n\nFrom the year 1683 we have similar information. From sun down to sunrise\na ship with a light would have been positioned in the Kattegat.\n\nThe existence of these ships, alas, is supported with few documents.\n\nHistory begins\n\nThe first ship just for this purpose was called NORE and positioned\nin 1731. It was a private ship anchored in the Thames estuary. And,\nto pre-empt it, the history of manned light vessels ended on the 1st\nof April 1994 with the withdrawal of the Belgium lightship from the\nstation WEST-HINDER.\n\nFor nearly 100 years only the British maintained lightvessels, until\nthe idea spread to the European mainland.\n\nMoving to Station\n\nThe first light ships sailed to their positions.\nOnly later did they get towed to their positions by steam tugs. Now\nmost of them received sparse rigging or no sails at all. The first engines\nwere less for moving, but for preventing the ships drifting off station\nin heavy seas and for relieving the tension on the anchor chains. Not\nuntil the 20th century were ships equipped with strong engines, so they\ncan move under their own power.\n\nDifferences at night\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century the number\nof lightships grew to such an extent that differences needed to be instated.\nThe highest number was reached at the beginning of the 20th century\nwhen there were over 350 light ships world wide.\n\nThere were different characters under discussion. Possible variations\nwere: lamps or rings of lamps with fixed lights; on one, two or three\nmasts. For ships with one mast the lights were one on top of the other\nand with some rigging even in a triangular formation.\n\nThe preferred light colour was white, its range was the best . Red or\ngreen light therefore were rarely used.\n\nAfter the invention of lights circling round the mast another choice\nwas the flashing light. The danger of mixing up different stations was\nreduced considerably. The newer light vessels already had fixed lamps\nwhich generated particular characteristics.\n\nHull Construction\n\nThe shape and construction of the hulls had to be different to usual\nships, due to the different stresses these ships had to withstand. Because\nhulls had the tendencies to adapt to running seas and the wind often\ncame from amidships, designers were forced to invent new hull shapes.\n\nThe original light ships were especially stable sailing ships or pilot\ncutters converted for this purpose. All had wooden hulls. In time country\nspecific ship types were developed, which were better adapted to the\ntask.\n\nFrom the middle of the 19th century some iron light vessels were built.\nBut since this material was not reputed to be very durable, builders\nreturned to wooden hulls. From 1861 there was a middle way, composite\nbuilding. The shadows were made from iron and the planking from wood.\nOnly from 1870 ships were completely built from iron. Interesting to\nnote that is was Sweden and Finland who first used this material for\ntheir light ships.\n\nHulls made from steel\n\nWeser III built in 1888 started the iron\nage finally. The ship was redesigned several times and served until\n1977 on several stations. Most of the new builds from 1906 received\nsteam driven propulsion. From 1912 diesel engines with 300 to 500 horse\npower with 9 knots. Several ships were built with this spec. Only after\nWWII two further remarkable new ships were built. First the largest\nlight ship in the world \"Elbe 1\" with 1000t and second the light ship\n\"Borkumriff\". The special thing about \"Borkumriff\" was that\nthe deck housings were made from light metal.\n\nThe actual size and shape of the ships\ndepended on the area in which they served and the advancements of technical\ndevelopment. The largest and most stable ships were stationed at the\nElbe 1 and Nantucket (USA) stations. These stations were troubled by\nparticular formations of nature.\n\nThe light ship days are numbered\n\nThe light vessel \"Borkumriff\"\nwas the last manned light vessel in Germany to be withdrawn from her\nstation on the 15th of July 1988. This station too was now served by\nan unmanned lightship (UFS). The development of UFS goes back to the\nyear 1901. In a German-Scottish co-operation a UFS by the name of Otter\nRock (station name) was developed. This ship was so successful that\nfor decades many examples were built. Here too different hull shapes\nand forms were developed, depending on currents and wave conditions.\nFor the long ocean swells round types were preferred, for the steeper\nharder North Sea swells only oval or hull shaped UFS were suitable.\n\nSo today world wide there are no light ships on the open seas. No men\nwho risk life and health for the good of shipping. They were all replaces\nby UFS full of electronics serving off the coasts.\n\nA word to finish\n\nThe record for durability belongs to the\nDanish copper clad ships of over 100 years of age. Future generations\nwill see how durable the metal and electronics of UFS turns out."}
{"text":"So, I sunk this modern something or other. About 4 tons.\nI put 2 torps in diff spots below the water line on the port side. The ship took about 1.2 hours to sink. The ship was limping away from me under power most of this time. I was just observing. Slowly, the ship kept sinking lower and lower on the port side till the port side railing become submerged. Yet, still the modern merchant sailed on under power, about 3-5knots. Finally, the stern went below the water line and about the same time the ship capsided to the port side. Get the sink message. One small explosion happens as she starts to go under, But then a huge explosion happened after the ship had completely went under.\n\nThen the most amazing thing happened. The ship broke in half from the huge explosion while sinking vertically stern first. The ship was completely under water already at this point. There was enough air remaining in the top half of the ship to shoot the bow of the ship back above the water after the ship broke in two. Looked like the ship was rising from the grave. Then that floating bow section sunk for the second time. Another huge explosion from the bolier after the bow dissappeared then heard loud bulkheads collapsing as she sunk.\n\nDon't know if it would happen in real life or not, but I've read reports of ships sinking in thirty seconds and ships taking 6-8 torpedoes before going down.

As it was sinking, some of the crew on the port side of the poop deck saw the bow of a vessel apparently approaching on a near reciprocal course. Their immediate impression was that a rescue vessel was at hand; however, they were dismayed to find that it was the bow section of the \"FLARE\". The propeller was still turning and had likely caused the stern section to follow an erratic course which returned it to the vicinity of the separated bow section."}

{"text":"Sailing ships\n\nThis history of sailing ships has been written primarily for the general reader, in the hope that the sons and daughters of a naval nation, and of an Empire that stretches beyond the seas, may find therein a record of some interest and assistance in enlarging and systematizing their ideas on the subject, especially as regards the ships of earlier centuries. It is not necessary to look far - no further than the poster-designs on advertisement-hoardings to observe the errors into which our artists of to-day are liable to fall owing to lack of historical knowledge in this subject; and to put (for instance) triangular headsails with a rectangular sail on the \"bonaventure mizzen-mast\" of an early sixteenth-century ship, is an inaccuracy scarcely to be pardoned.\n\nI trust that both the yachtsman and sailorman will find in these pages something of the same exciting pleasure which has been mine in tracing the course of the evolutions through which their ships have passed. Those whose work or amusement it is to acquaint themselves with the sailing ship and her ways, and for lack of time and opportunity are unable to seek out the noble pedigree of what Ruskin truly described as \"one of the loveliest things man ever made, and one of the noblest,\" may care to learn what were the changing conditions which combined to bring about such a highly complex creature as the modern sailing ship. Perhaps at some time when handling a rope, a spar, a tiller or a sail, they may have wondered how it all began; what were the origins of all those various parts of a ships \"furniture\"; why some essential portions have scarcely changed; and how other portions are the outcome of time, experiment, and science. I hope that to neither the amateur nor the professional sailor I shall seem impertinent if I have attempted to tell them something about their ship which they did not know before. But if, on the other hand, I shall have succeeded in increasing their love for the sailing-ship by outlining her career, I trust that this may be allowed to counterbalance the defects which, in a subject of so vast a scope, are hardly to be avoided in spite of considerable care and the generous assistance of many kind friends.\n\nFinally, I make my appeal to the younger generation, to whom ships and the sea have in all times suggested so much that is bound up with adventure and brave deeds. The present moment sees us at a stage in the history of ships when the Royal Navy as a whole, and the Merchant Service almost entirely, have no longer any convenience for sail. There is a dire need in the latter for both officers and men, whilst on shore the conditions of employment are exactly the reverse! Surely it is only by a mutual adjustment of the two that both problems, on sea and land, can possibly be overcome; and it is only by winning the enthusiasm of the boy who is to become father of the man that the sailor's love for the sea can be handed on from generation to generation. We have received from our ancestors a splendid heritage, a unique legacy - the mastery of the seas. That legacy brings with it a commensurate responsibility, to retain what our fore- fathers fought for so dearly. Perhaps to the healthy-minded Anglo-Saxon boy, not yet too blask and civilized to feel no thrill in reading his Marryat, Cook, Ballantyne, Henty, Fenn, or the glorious sea-fights and discoveries in history itself - perhaps to him this book may be of some assistance in visualizing the actual ships of each historical period.\n\nCONTENTS\n\n- Introductory\n- Early Egyptian Ships from about 6000 b.c.\n- Ancient Ships of Phoenicia, Greece, and Rome\n- The Early Ships of Northern Europe\n- The Development of the Sailing Ship from the Eighth Century to the Year 1485\n- From Henry VII. to the Death of Elizabeth\n- From the Accession of James I. to the Close of the Eighteenth Century\n- The Sailing Ship in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries\n- The Fore-and-aft Rig and its Developments; Coasters, Fishing Boats, Yachts,\n- Glossary\n- Bibliography\n\nCHAPTER I - INTRODUCTORY\n\nShort time ago one of our Naval Museums came into possession of a certain model of a sailing ship. She was a fine vessel, one of the first of the old \"wooden walls\" to be built in the reign of the late Queen. The Curator wisely determined to have this model fully rigged with all her spars, sails, and gear, just as the original had been in her days of active service. Every detail was correct; every halyard and brace were made of proportionate thickness. Even the right kind of \"stuff\" was found, after some difficulty, for the cable. An efficient rigger, too, was found, who happened to have served on this same ship.\n\nFinally, when the model was completed the Curator looked at it and said, \"Now it will be possible for those who come alter us to tell exactly how a sailing ship was rigged; in a few years' time there won't be a man alive who will know how to do it.\"\n\nIt is with a similar desire, to preserve all that can be gathered, that an attempt is made in the present book to collect into one continuous narrative the historical data available concerning the evolution of that fast-disappearing object the sailing ship. With the advent of steam was hoisted the signal for abolishing sail ; and although for a long time the famous old clippers put up a keen fight, yet for commercial purposes, when passengers and mails, merchandise and perishable food, had to be hurried from one side of the world to the other without loss of time, it became impossible for a sailing ship, that depended so entirely on the mercy of wind and weather, to compete successfully with the steamship. By 1840, it will be remembered, steamers had commenced crossing the Atlantic, and within the next ten or fifteen years the sailing ship, except for such long voyages as to China, Australia, and other distant countries, was forever doomed. Perhaps these beautiful creatures, oversparred and undermanned though they are nowadays, will be allowed, in spite of competition and low freights, to remain with us a little longer. It is probable that the introduction of the motor, instead of assisting to complete the departure of sails, will help in their being retained : for it has now been found commercially profitable to install the internal-combustion engine in ships of a size not exceeding about seven hundred tons. By this means sail can be used in a fair wind, and the motor can take her along in calms, as well as in tolerable weather against a head wind. In entering harbours and leaving there will also be a saving of the charge for a tug. Perhaps when the marine-motor industry has become more perfect it will be possible to fit a sufficiently powerful motor to a 4000-ton barque.\n\nIf that should be possible, then it would be indeed welcome news to hear that the sluicing ebb of sailing ships and sailormen had stopped. (For, of course, no one nowadays, except perhaps the lady passenger, would ever think of honouring the marine mechanics on board a liner or battleship with the title of \"sailor,\" whose knowledge of seamanship is so elementary that they can as a rule neither sail a boat nor make a splice, let alone go up aloft.) But at present, when it is difficult to get enough officers and men for the steam merchant service, it is doubtful if the sailing ship, except in the case of a few deep-sea vessels and the coasters, fishermen, pilots, and yachts round our coasts, will be encouraged to remain with us.\n\nIn setting forth whatever may be of interest in the following pages I have, following the example of that illustrious Elizabethan, Richard Hakluyt, taken \"infinite cares,\" travelled many miles from port to port to talk with every kind of sailorman deep-sea, coaster, or yacht's hand with fishermen, pilots, shipbuilders, riggers, marine architects, and sail-makers. In addition to this, 1 have been fortunate in gaining access to libraries containing, in various languages and of both ancient and modern date, invaluable accounts of ships of earlier days. The study of coins (curiously overlooked by some writers on ancient ships) has enabled me to submit some definite knowledge concerning craft of the classical age. The study of old fonts in this country, especially in those churches which were dedicated in the name of St. Nicholas, the patron of sailors, has helped to confirm the otherwise scanty evidence for the period between the tenth and fourteenth centuries. But perhaps the most valuable and interesting material is the illustration of an Egyptian sailing ship of the XII. Dynasty. This model, rigged for sailing up and rowing down the Nile, will be discussed in Chapter II. Hitherto we have had to depend for our knowledge of Egyptian ships on the illustrations found on the tombs. Although in recent years some models of boats have been discovered in these tombs, yet that which I am enabled to reproduce (Figs. 5 and 6) is the only one showing the boat properly rigged that has hitherto been unearthed. This model was discovered in the season of 1906-1907 at Rifeh, by Professor Flinders Petrie, and is the finest example that has yet reached England."}
{"text":"There was no \"first\" clipper ship. These legendary \"Greyhounds of the Sea,\" which reached the height of their fame between 1845 and 1859, evolved from\nthe American interest in finding ways to make ships--in fact everything--go faster. Lacking the protection of a great navy, American shipbuilders\nand sea captains knew that sailing at a fast \"clip\" was the best way to elude the enemy warships that had threatened American\ncommerce between 1807 and 1815, the era of the Embargo and the War of 1812. The opening\nof new commercial ports in China in the 1830s and 1840s intensified the quest\nfor speed to overcome both great distances and the tendency of tea leaves\nto spoil if left in the hold for too long. By the mid-1840s Americans were starting to boast of their \"extreme clippers.\"\n\nCompared to traditional sailing vessels, these extreme clippers--so many were built that before long it became pointless to add \"extreme\"--carried a lot of sail in relation to their tonnage. In mariners' language, they were heavily \"sparred.\" Spars were wooden masts, yardarms, or booms that supported the rigging and\nenabled clippers to spread as much canvas as possible in order\n\nto take maximum advantage of the wind, their only source of propulsion. The bows of clippers were unusually \"sharp,\" with little buoyancy. While the barrel-chested bows and wide hulls of traditional vessels pushed the water out of the way,\nthe sharp bows and narrow hulls of clippers knifed through it. The clippers' sleekness translated into an average speed of twelve knots an\n\nhour (a knot is a nautical mile, about a mile and one-eighth), compared to\nsix to eight knots for traditional\n\nvessels.\n\nHad clippers been designed only to carry cargo, their narrow beams would have been a drawback. But in the late 1840s demand\nfor faster passenger ships mounted. British emigrants were heading for Australia,\nand British shipowners commissioned the building of clippers in American\nyards. Then the California gold rush sparked demand for voyages from eastern ports to San Francisco.\nNot all of these passengers were headed for the gold fields. In California's dizzy gold-rush economy, cart drivers, carpenters, masons, and cooks could\ncommand four to five times the daily wages of workers in the rest of the nation. Paying two hundred\ndollars, three hundred dollars, or more for sea passage--close to a year's wages--struck many of them as a good investment.\n\nBefore the end of February 1849, eleven thousand passengers had left on ships from eastern ports to go to San Francisco and the gold fields,\nmost on slow vessels that averaged 157 days for the sixteen thousand-mile\ntrip from New York to San Francisco around Cape Horn, the southernmost tip\nof South America. In theory, it was faster to sail from New York to the isthmus of Panama, the narrowest\npoint of North America; cross the sixty-mile isth-mus by foot, mule, and\nboat; and take a steamship north to San Francisco. But dense jungle, snakes,\nscorpions, armies of mosquitoes, and weeks or months waiting for a steamship limited the appeal of the\nisthmus route.\n\nBy the early 1850s the shipyards of Boston and New York were turning out\nclippers for the Cape Horn route at astonishing rates. Boston's shipbuilder Donald McKay oversaw the construction of thirty-one clippers between 1850 and 1858. The most\nfamous of these was the Flying Cloud, which McKay sold for $60,000 to a Boston ship owner, who almost immediately\nsold it to a New York owner for $90,000. Guided by its captain, Josiah P. Cressy, and its navigator, Cressy's wife Ellen (a masterful mistress of the sextant and other instruments for\nlocating a ship's position at sea), the Flying Cloud made the run from New York to San Francisco around the Horn in eighty-nine\ndays in 1851, a record not broken by any sailing vessel until 1989. At one point on\nthis voyage, the Flying Cloud attained the unheard of speed of eighteen knots an hour.\n\nThe speed of the Flying Cloud and other clippers gripped the public's imagination. A betting industry sprang up around the clippers, with wagers on how many days and hours\nit would take a ship to reach the equator or to drop anchor at San Francisco.\nIn the early 1850s many shipbuilders were concluding that the newly invented\nsteamship, slow and with boilers prone to explode, had reached its limits and that the future, at\nleast for ocean voyages, belonged to the clipper.\n\nThey were wrong. Like the gold rush itself, the reign of the clipper was\nbrief. The invention in 1836 of the steam-powered screw propeller, which\nchurned off a steamer's stern and eliminated the drag-producing side-wheels of the early steamers,\nmade it possible for steamships to average thirteen knots by the mid-1850s.\n\nHowever magnificent, clippers were expensive. Man-aging their immense spreads of sail required relatively large crews of at\nleast sixty, and, running nearly flush to the sea, clippers took a horrific pounding in bad weather. Insurance rates soared by the mid-1850s,\nless because clippers were sinking than because they needed so much repair\nafter each voyage. As interest in the gold fields waned, most of the clippers\nwere shorn of their masts and miles of rigging and converted to barges. The Flying Cloud itself, its masts shortened to make it easier to handle with a smaller crew,\nmet a pitiful end in 1874 when, damaged by a storm while in port, it was\ndeemed not worth repairing. Under orders from the insurance underwriters, a team of workers towed it to sea, doused it\nwith kerosene, set it ablaze, and watched it burn to the water."}

Some are eyewitness accounts, some cover the artifacts and wreckage, some are fictional love stories, and there are even children's books based on the historic event. No matter what the nature of the Titanic book involves, one can be sure that the epic story of one of the largest maritime disasters will be retold with vivid detail. With the 100th anniversary of the Titanic's maiden voyage quickly approaching, expect many more Titanic books to be released to commemorate the event. For a complete list of Titanic books, check out the Amazon store, but here are some of the most famous texts concerning the RMS Titanic.\n\nOur Recommendation:\n\nTitanic: Echo of the Dying Confession\nby Troy Veenstrsa\n\nThink the Titanic hit an iceberg by accident? Do you think that the whole situation befalling the steamship was clearly a situation of being in the wrong place at the wrong time? You might rethink your answer once you read this novel. What if I were to tell you that a book came out 15 year before the creation of the Titanic, which gave the basic step on how to build and sink a ship called the Titan? What would you say if I told you that someone purposely built the ship with its intended flaws all to make the ship easier to sink if struck upon its port or starboard side? What if I were to tell you that things in this world are not always as clear cut as we would like them to be? Titanic: Echo of the Dying Confession is the historical supernatural fiction, based specifically around the factual details in regards to the design, creation, and ultimately the sinking of the steamship Titanic and gives a whole new idea to the question of what was really the cause of the ship being destroyed.\n\nOther Titanic Books:\n\nThe Story of the Titanic as Told by its Survivors\nby Jack Winocour\n\nPublished in 1960, these amazing accounts are gathered straight from Titanic survivors. This Titanic book is the legacy of those who were fortunate enough to get off the sinking ship alive. Told in old speech and adhering to a different set of ethics (a first class woman's life was seen as 6 times more valuable than a third class man's) is beautifully conveyed. The book is also enhanced with old pictures from the time of the tragedy.\n\nTitanic: An Illustrated History\nby Donald Lynch, Robert D. Ballard, Ken Marschall\n\nThe legacy of the Titanic has been captured in film, fiction, music, and basically any other type of art form you can imagine. All of these are brilliantly captured in the Titanic book Titanic: An Illustrated History. Introduced by Dr. Robert D. Ballard the man who discovered the Titanic wreck in 1985, the titanic book is laced with great information and specialized Titanic art by Ken Marschall to help dramatize the event. Great information, photos, and brilliant paintings make this a must read for Titanic book collectors.\n\nTitanic: The Last Great Images\n\nby Robert Ballard\n\nDr. Robert Ballard, the man who brought you the discovery of the Titanic wreck brings you a Titanic book that will visually blow your mind. The advanced underwater photographic technology revolutionized by Ballard's team brings the reader some of the most crisp and clear Titanic images ever captured. The eerie lighting and clear photos give the legendary titanic images a creepy and timeless appeal. These are some of the pictures of the Titanic in her watery grave that are thought of whenever one envisions the Titanic shipwreck. The book offers a haunting visual recollection of one of the largest maritime disasters to ever befall humanity.\n\nA complete history of the largest passenger ship of her time, Titanic \u2013 The Ship Magnificent delves into every detail about the construction of the Titanic. From cobalt blue Spode china and Elkington plate silverware in the a-la-carte restaurant to the design of the boilers and fixtures and fittings on-board the world's most luxurious vessel, they tell the story of a liner built at the peak of the race between the British, French, and Germans to build bigger and better ships.

Note the Japanese flags denoting the 21 vessels the sub had sunk in those patrols.\n\nA 42-year-old Navy captain with no prior experience commanding a submarine led the USS Swordfish (SS 193) on a successful war patrol in the Pacific Theater during World War II.\n\nThe Swordfish, a 1,450-ton Sargo-class submarine, tested Capt. Karl G. Hensel personally and professionally, said George Billy, chief librarian at the Maritime Marine Academy in Kings Point, N.Y., during a lecture at the Navy Museum May 20.\n\nHensel, a strict disciplinarian, had been a submarine school instructor before he became a submarine division commander in 1943.\n\n''He was bothered by the fact that he was sending young commanders on patrol he himself had not been on,\" said Billy, who is researching the Swordfish for a future book.\n\nThe Swordfish conducted its first war patrol the day after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. While patrolling west of the Philippines, the submarine sank four freighters weighing from 3,900 tons to 9,400 tons and damaged a fifth ship. When Hensel took command of the Swordfish on Dec. 17, 1943, the submarine and its crew had destroyed or damaged several Japanese ships throughout the Pacific.\n\nHensel didn't get along with the crew during the first 10 days he was in command, said Billy. The submarine's new commander knew he had to change his attitude if he wanted to retain experienced crew members.\n\nHensel began asking crewmembers their opinion about whatever concerned the operation of the submarine. He also took them into his confidence without lowering his standards. When Hensel took the Swordfish to sea on Dec. 29, 1943, he had a sufficient number of qualified and experienced personnel aboard.\n\nDuring the first few days of the 10th war patrol, Hensel and his crew confronted foul weather and two to three inches of water in the control room. These were minor setbacks compared to what the submarine encountered after reaching its patrol area, the entrance to Tokyo Bay, on Jan. 10, 1944.\n\nThirty-seven minutes after midnight on Jan. 14, Yamakuni Maru, an armed passenger cargo ship was spotted near Tokyo Bay. Hensel ordered the firing of four torpedoes, which sank the Yamakuni Maru. Two days later, the Swordfish sank the Japanese auxiliary gunboat Delhi Maru off Miyake Jima, Honshu, Japan\n\nThe Swordfish sank the Japanese auxiliary gunboat Kasagi Maru 130 nautical miles south of Tokyo Bay on Jan. 27. Its 10th war patrol terminated at Pearl Harbor Feb. 7.\n\n''The 10th war patrol was a morale booster for the crew of the Swordfish,\" said Billy. ''For Hensel, it was proof that he could be a submarine commander and command a submarine during a war patrol.\"\n\nThe Swordfish went on two more war patrols from March to June in 1944 under the command of Lt. Cmdr. K.E. Montrose. On her 13th patrol, which began Dec. 26, 1944, the submarine was ordered to also conduct photographic reconnaissance of Okinawa. It was last seen by USS Kete (SS 369) in the Okinawa area on Jan. 12, 1945.\n\nAll 89 men aboard the Swordfish were presumed lost at sea, including Billy's uncle, Motor Machinist 2 Michael Billy."}
{"text":"Mary Rose sailors' ate a diet of salt beef and biscuits\n\nLondon, June 5 (THAINDIAN NEWS) Various tests on the bones of sailors aboard the Mary Rose, Henry VIII's flagship, have shown that their diet consisted of salt beef and sea biscuits.\n\nThe forensic studies used bones from 80 sailors who were buried in Royal Naval hospital cemeteries. After analysing the bones, experts have been able to ascertain what the 17th and 18th century sailors used to eat. During the late 18th century, 70,000 seamen and marines were members of the Royal Navy.\n\nThe researchers have determined that the Mary Rose sailors used to live off salt beef and sea biscuits. Oxford University's Mark Pollard claimed that an isotopic study of the collagen existent in the bones studied has enabled the university's researchers to discover new aspects of the life and diet of the members of the Nelson's navy. The Mary Rose sunk in 1545.\n\nFeeding such a high number of individuals proved to be an extremely difficult task, which required strictly controlled diets. Other food products that integrated the sailors's diet included flour, oatmeal, and cheese.\n\nThe research findings are consistent with contemporary documentary records contained in a number of manifests and logs of the navy's captain."}
{"text":"In deep water, Titanic needs protection\n\nDate: April 07 2012\n\nRobert Booth, London\n\nTHE United Nations has moved to protect the wreck of the Titanic days before the centenary of its sinking, amid growing concern at its deterioration as a result of tourist visits and exploration submarines crashing into its structure.\n\nThe 100-year-old wreck has been brought under the cover of the 2001 UNESCO convention on the protection of underwater cultural heritage, which gives signed-up member states the right to prevent exploration deemed unscientific or unethical, seize illicitly recovered artefacts and close their ports to all vessels undertaking exploration that is not done according to the principles of the doctrine.\n\nRobert Ballard, the undersea explorer who was part of the expedition that discovered the wreck in 1985, has raised concerns about its condition, and in 2004 undertook a dive that found the mainmast had been destroyed, the ship's bell and light torn off and several holes had been made in the deck. ''When [submarines] bump into things, they can do damage,'' he said at the time. ''When they land, they can do damage. You can clearly see, all over the ship, where the common landing sites are knocking the holes in the deck.''\n\nAnnouncing the application of the heritage convention to the wreck, UNESCO director-general Irina Bokova called on divers not to dump equipment or commemorative plaques on the Titanic, a common practice that is causing conservationists concern.\n\n''The [April 15] sinking of the Titanic is anchored in the memory of humanity and I am pleased that this site can now be protected by the UNESCO convention,'' Ms Bokova said.\n\n''But there are thousands of other shipwrecks that need safeguarding as well. All of them are archaeological sites of scientific and historical value. They are also the memory of human tragedy that should be treated with respect. We do not tolerate the plundering of cultural sites on land, and the same should be true for our sunken heritage.''\n\nThe convention stipulates that underwater heritage should be preserved in its original location in the first instance and that it should not be exploited for trade or speculation.\n\nBut the protections are limited by the fact that neither the US nor Canada is among the 41 signatory states and a number of the tourist and exploration trips chartered to the wreck site 4000 metres under the sea off the coast of Newfoundland come from those countries.\n\nA US company called Bluefish is offering 40 places on two trips to the wreck in submersibles this July, with each place costing $US59,680 ($A58,000).\n\nGUARDIAN\n\nThis material is subject to copyright and any unauthorised use, copying or mirroring is prohibited."}
{"text":"The man who built the Titanic lived for ever in disgrace after fleeing the\nstricken vessel.\n\nAt 1.45am. on April 15, 1912, an hour and a half after the Titanic hit the\niceberg, J Bruce Ismay, president of the company that built the ship, jumped\ninto one of the last lifeboats to leave on the starboard side. At 6ft 4in,\nIsmay towered over the other survivors sitting on the boards, most of them\nLebanese women and children, none of whom had any idea who he was.\n\nThirty minutes later, those few who had been allocated places in the\nhalf-empty boats now rowing away from the sinking ship watched, mesmerised,\nas the she turned on her nose and made her final plunge, taking with her\n1,500 people. \"I know it must have been the most extraordinary sight I shall\never be called upon to witness,\" one survivor recalled. Ismay, however, with\nhis back to the scene, kept his eyes fixed on the distance. \"I did not wish\nto see her go down,\" he later confessed. \"I am glad I did not.\"\n\nHe said he had been helping with the rowing, but this seems unlikely: not only\nwas he facing the wrong way, but he was in no state to do anything physical.\nWhen he left the sinking ship, Ismay stepped into a bottomless well. As I\nexplain in How to Survive the Titanic: the Sinking of J Bruce Ismay, the\npresident's hair apparently turned white overnight, and those on the rescue\nship, the Carpathia, said that his body in the lifeboat was as stiff and\nlifeless as a marble statue.\n\nOn board the Carpathia, while other survivors slept on dining room tables,\nIsmay insisted on a private cabin. Here, he spent the next four days under\nan opiate. Meanwhile, stories about his conduct began to circulate among the\nwidows on board. Some said he had left in the first boat, others that he had\ndemanded his own crew to row him away; while the ship's barber, August\nWeikman, swore that Ismay had been ordered into a boat by the Chief Officer.\n\nIsmay himself would always deny Weikman's account \u2013 a version of his survival\nthat would have rebuffed any accusation of cowardice. In his public\ntestimony, Ismay said that he jumped from the Titanic of his own volition,\nleaving behind him an empty ship.\n\nThe mystery of his actions intensified when Emily Ryerson, a first-class\npassenger \u2013 returning to New York for the funeral of her son and now also\nburying her husband \u2013 revealed that she and her friend, Marian Thayer, had\nmet Ismay on deck on the fatal day and been shown by him an ice warning.\n\"Will you be slowing down?\" Mrs Ryerson inquired. \"Certainly not,\" Ismay\nreplied. Instead, they would be speeding up. Ismay's concern, Mrs Ryerson\nsaid, was with crossing the Atlantic in record time.\n\nThe news of an ice warning came as a shock. \"It was not then the unavoidable\naccident we had hitherto supposed,\" one survivor later wrote, \"the sudden\nplunging into a region crowded with icebergs which no seamen, however\nskilled, could have avoided. It is no exaggeration to say that men who went\nthrough all the experiences of the collision and the rescue\u2026 with hardly a\ntremor, were quite overcome by the knowledge and turned away, unable to\nspeak.\"\n\nThe only person to stand up for Ismay was Mrs Thayer, whose husband had also\ndied that night. It seems that Ismay, who had met Mrs Thayer during the\nvoyage, had fallen in love with her.\n\nBy the end of the week, when the Titanic survivors were ashore, everyone knew\nwho J Bruce Ismay was: he had become, as a headline in the Daily Mirror put\nit, \"The most talked-of man in all the world\". \"Mr Ismay cares for nobody\nbut himself,\" declared one American paper. \"He passes through the most\nstupendous tragedy untouched and unmoved. He leaves his ship to sink with\nits powerless cargo of lives and does not care to lift his eyes. He crawls\nthrough unspeakable disgrace to his own safety.\"\n\nIt was revealed by the Titanic's chief designer that it had been Ismay's\ndecision to limit the number of lifeboats; the davits, fitted to hold 48\nboats, instead carried 16 \u2013 which was still in excess of the British Board\nof Trade's requirements. Why litter the deck, Ismay is said to have argued,\nwhen the ship is herself a lifeboat?\n\nWithin hours of landing in New York, Ismay was called as the first witness at\nthe hastily convened US Senate inquiry into the tragedy. Barely able to\nspeak \u2013 Ismay had never made a public statement in his life \u2013 he described\nhimself as a passenger and not a member of the crew, and thus justified in\nsaving his own life. Ismay's right to live depended on his status on the\nship: the problem was that he slipped through all the catagories. He knew,\nhe said, nothing about navigation, but witness after witness described how\nhe had behaved on board with the authority befitting a captain.\n\nReturning to England following the US inquiry, Ismay was a broken man. His was\nnow, he realised, a posthumous existence; their lives, his wife Florence\nsaid, were \"ruined\". His nightmares woke the house, he received hate mail,\nan old friend turned him away from the front door. Florence decided that the\nonly way forward was to forbid all mention of the Titanic in Ismay's\npresence; he was thus pushed into an even deeper silence.\n\nOther survivors published accounts of the night or told their stories to\njournalists. Putting together a narrative made some sense of it all, but\napart from insisting that he had jumped from an empty ship, Ismay said\nnothing, in public or in private, about his experience. The horror and chaos\nremained unarticulated horror and chaos.\n\nInstead, he wrote to Mrs Thayer, the only woman who \"understood\" him. These\nletters, and the Sanatogen his sister recommended, provided Ismay's\npost-traumatic therapy. \"Any ambitions I had are entirely gone, and my\nlife's work is ruined,\" he confided. \"I never want to see a ship again, and\nI loved them so much. What an ending to my life. Perhaps I was too proud of\nmy ships and this is my punishment.\"\n\nLater, mulling over his feelings for her, he tells her that \"not a single day\ngoes by without my thinking of you. I often think of where our friendship\nwould have taken us if that awful disaster had not taken place, how well I\nremember our conversations when everything looked so bright. You had a very\npeculiar attraction to me and I loved talking to you and hearing you talk\u2026\"\nIt was at this point that Mrs Thayer, who would never remarry, stopped\nreplying to Ismay's letters.\n\nAs John Wilson Foster puts it in The Titanic Complex, we are all on the\nTitanic. The reason we cannot stop talking about the great liner is because\nthe Titanic is about everything; like Noah's ark, our second most famous\nship, she carried the whole world on board.

{"text":"John Tyler and the Princeton\n\nThe day was February 28, 1844, a Wednesday. By all accounts it was a beautiful, cloudless sky despite wintertime in Washington DC. The Potomac appeared motionless, beckoning travel.\n\nLate February 1844 was a time of prospect for President John Tyler. He and his Secretary of State Abel Upshur had just received a verbal agreement that protected Texas from attack and other details that would help in Upshur's longtime goal of annexing Texas, though it was a new one for Tyler. Essentially Tyler went from true reluctance over anything regarding Texas to pure obsession over its annexation.\n\nUpshur, while widely forgotten to most, worked intensely on matters ranging from working with Sam Houston on Texas to the Oregon territory to behind the scenes deal making in Congress\n\nThey had worked out the details over territory, state debts among other Texas matters. Tyler had reason to believe that the tide was changing in the US Senate to help him gain Texas, and perhaps a second term that no one, even Tyler at times, thought was possible.\n\nOn top of all this Tyler was reunited with his romantic interest, Julia Gardiner, who he had not seen in close to a year at that time. Tyler was 30 years her senior. Tyler had lost his first wife, Letitia, in his first year in the White House. Tyler thought Julia to be his fianc\u00e9 and their marriage only a matter of formality as this point.\n\nPersonally and politically Tyler has reason to celebrate, and so he did on that fatal 28th.\n\nTyler, with Julia and her father, parts of his cabinet and other Washington dignitaries such as Dolley Madison and Thomas Hart Benton boarded the navy vessel, the USS Princeton for a trip down the Potomac. In all, around 400 guests were aboard the ship that day.\n\nThe Princeton had only been in service for a little under six months, but was widely considered one of the finest US naval ships. Initially devised by a Swedish inventor, John Ericcson, the ships Captain, Robert F. Stockton, took notice and went forward with designing this state of the art frigate for the US Navy. Ericcson and Stockton worked together on the boat up until the end. Stockton egotistical and proud tried to downplay Ericcson's role as much possible, often taking sole credit when talking with newspapers.\n\nThe ship carried the new naval gun, the Peacemaker, the longest and most powerful weapon built up until that time, also designed by Ericcson. The ship also carried the gun the Orator, or sometimes called the Oregon. That cannon was undergoing fixes and so Captain Robert Stockton decided to show off not only the Peacemaker, but also his ship as a whole. Those on board would witness its raw power firsthand.\n\nThe Presidential affair was a hit. Guests dined on ham and roast fowl with enough wine and champagne to go around. The ship was headed for Mount Vernon, George Washington's home along the Potomac River.\n\nAs the Princeton made its way though the calm waters the band aboard played \"Hail to the Chief\" for the 10th President, a song that Julia insisted on being played at Presidential events. The Princeton fired the Peacemaker several times to the delight of its passengers. The large and ringing explosions would draw \"ooh's\" and \"ah's\" until the cannon balls would land in the water, miles in the distance.\n\nWhile it seemed the events above the deck took center stage, the real party was below deck. Both Upshur and Tyler made toasts and salutes. Upshur's included a call for more alcohol and Tyler is quoted as saying, \"to the three great guns: the Princeton, her commander, and the Peacemaker.\"\n\nNearing mid-day as well as Mount Vernon Secretary of War James M. Porter made one final request for the Peacemaker to be fired. While Captain Stockton initially declined, he gave way to the pressure of Porter and passengers. A great number of passengers filed from below the deck. The site of the great cannon and Mount Vernon were too hard to resist.\n\nAs John Tyler rose to follow up the stairs, his son-in-law William Waller intercepted him. He and Waller decided to sing a bit of an old Revolutionary song and drink a bit more. As Waller belted the words to the tune, the Peacemaker fired once more, again drawing more applause until there were screams instead of cheers.\n\nThe Peacemaker was nowhere in sight as the deck billowed black smoke. It spread so quickly even the President lost visibility below deck. The scene was chaos.\n\nThe Peacemaker had misfired and exploded. This threw large portions of the cannon at those on deck.\n\nPeople from below tried to rush upwards and people on the deck tried to find their way down. In the panic Julia Gardiner pushed through passengers frantically looking for her father who had been on deck to watch the firing. A passenger having seen what remained of her father after the explosion remarked to her, \"my dear child, you can do no good, your father is in heaven.\" It is reported that Julia fainted. Julia's father, David Gardiner, would die shortly after the explosion, bleeding to death after losing both his arms and legs.\n\nThe scene on deck looked more like a battlefield. Blood and limbs lay all over the deck, the smell of smoke and flesh filled the air. Spotted was Secretary of State Abel Upshur, his stomach torn apart. Also on the floor of the deck was Secretary of Navy Thomas Gilmer, whose head had been smashed in by part of the gun. The carnage was nauseating. Bodies of others were found; these included Beverly Kennon, the diplomat, Virgil Maxcy, and Armistead, Tyler's personal valet.\n\nOutside of the six dead, over twenty others were badly wounded (including Senator of Missouri Thomas Hart Benton). The Captain of the ship had burns all over his head; he was heard screaming \"my God! Would that I were dead, too!\" Flags and blankets were placed over the bodies to conceal the horror as best as possible. It is said that as President Tyler took in the scene and saw the bodies of his two cabinet members he wept publicly.\n\nAs the ship made its way back to the dock, Tyler returned to and held Julia while she was unconscious. Tyler commented that, \"Joy is turned into mourning. The morning so bright and cloudless, is succeeded by an evening of deep gloom and sorrow.\" Within three years Tyler lost his President (William Harrison), wife, two cabinet members his Attorney General (Hugh Legare) and other personal acquaintances.\n\nIn fact, just four days after the incident, returning from a burial, the President escaped death yet again. The horses of his carriage had begun a full out sprint waving the carriage out of control. An unidentified citizen stepped out onto the street to slow the horses, seemingly saving Tyler's life.\n\nWashington would be rattled by the events, never experiencing any tragedy like it. It was the worst peacetime disaster up until that point. The city mourned with black for over a week.\n\nWhat seemed a time of great hope turned sour for Tyler. He would end up replacing Upshur with the famous John C. Calhoun, who would continue strong foreign negotiations. However, he would not win reelection, though, he did marry Julia and he would annex Texas a mere two days before departing, something Upshur would have been thrilled about.\n\nUnfortunately we now know that the Peacemaker was not adequately tested before the display that day, perhaps only fired a mere five times. Captain Stockton had rushed along the Peacemaker in order to get credit for the gun (and not Ericcson).\n\n\"Stockton failed to grasp the importance of the hoop design and simply cast a large gun that was thicker around the breech. Fatally flawed, this error meant that the Peacemaker would most likely burst at some point\" historians point out.\n\nStockton was able to avoid punishment for the disaster, and indeed blamed Ericcson for the result of the tragic explosion. Ericcson would be denied any pay for his work on the US ship despite his warnings to Stockton that the gun was not ready. Stockton would later serve under President Polk and assist in the Mexican-American War.\n\nThe Peacemaker had rattled Washington and Tyler. While the incident is almost forgotten by history all together, it is a captivating event.\n\nOn a separate note:\n\nWhat if Tyler had died? He had just finished facing the controversy of whether a Vice President was the rightful successor of a President when Tyler died. Many called him \"His Accidency,\" saying that he was merely \"acting\" President. While Tyler shaped history by brushing off the question and saying that the Vice President is rightful successor to the office, Tyler himself never appointed a Vice President, the first, but not the last, to do so. So then what? This I believe would have forced the issue of line of succession much earlier than the mid-twentieth century. Of course this is all hypothetical."}

As built, Canadian corvettes had light armament, inadequate ASDIC (sonar), radar, and navigation systems, and cramped crew accommodations. Refits solved many of these problems, but Canadian corvettes were modified more slowly than most Allied vessels due in part to Canada's limited shipyard facilities."}

{"text":"On this Date in History: When we think of maritime disaster, one immediately thinks of the RMS Titanic. After all, there have been numerous movies and documentaries that detail and discuss the incident. When the news of the Titanic hit the papers, any other news of the day was lost to the backpages and buried. Hence, when Harriet Quimbybecame the first woman to fly across the English Channel, she had the misfortune of doing so the day after the Titanic sunk. She died not too long after and so most Americans think of Amelia Earhartas the first lady of flight. Back in 1865, the news of the killing of John Wilkes Booth on April 26 dominated the media. So, when the greatest disaster in maritime history took place, it too was left to the backpages and since, like Harriet Quimby, has been largely lost in the conscience of American history. Timing, they say, is everythying.\n\nThe steamboat Sultana was steaming north on the Mississippi River shortly after the conclusion of the American Civil War when three of its four boilers exploded. The Sultana was rated to carry a maximum 376 passengers. On the fateful journey, it was overloaded with some 2200 to 2500 former prisoners of war returning home on this date in 1865 along with the crew and some civilian passengers. The incident occured around 2AM about 7 miles north of Memphis, TN as it moved against the strong Mississippi River current. Many of the passengers were wounded Union soldiers. The deaths of at least 1700 souls was brought about by the fact that the boilers catastrophically failed in the middle of the night, the river current was strong and turbulent and extremely hot water and fire rained on surviors. Unlike the news of the sinking of the RMS Titanic, the Sultana disasterwas relegated to the back pages of most US newspapers.\n\nAndersonville 1864\n\nWhat adds to the tragedy is that the vast majority of those on-board were Union prisoners of war who had been held in the infamous Andersonville Confederate prisonand other prisons such as Cahaba (aka Cahawba). These soldiers, many wounded and extremely frail from their time in horrid prison conditions, wanted to get home as quickly as possible. But, it was not just the desire to get home that resulted in the overloading of the boat. I mean, the Captain could have simply said that his boat was full and told the rest to wait for the next one. But, the policy of the government in providing transportation was to pay 5$ for each soldier transported. Keep in mind that most soldiers received about $15 a month while they were fighting so $5 was a pretty good chunk of change. It was such a good deal for the steamboats that boat captains regularly paid US Army officers $1.15 for every man that officer directed to a particular steamboat. Bottom line is that the more people a captain could stuff on his boat, the greater his profit.\n\nAndersonville Survivor-Many on the Sultana Were Very Frail\n\nNow, the soldiers were loaded on board in Vicksburg, MS for a trip to Cairo, IL and the Sultana was just one of many boats providing transportation. It was the chance of a lifetime for steamboat operators and any delay would result in the potential loss of profits. So, when one of the boilers on the Sultana sprang a leak while in port at Vicksburg, the captain ordered a patch be put on the leak. This was a shortcut and perhaps a fatal mistake. Most researchers suggest that the bulge in the boiler should have been removed and replaced. But that would have taken about 4 days so the captain went the 1-day patch route. If he had waited 4 days, other steamboats would certainly have picked up the precious cargo and there would be no way to make up for the loss as this mass transport would happen just once. Historians Stephen Ambrose and Douglas Brinkleysay that the US Army officers knew of the maintanence issues with the Sultana but were eager to get the $1.15 per man kick-back and loaded the unknowing soldiers on board.\n\nOn April 24, 1865 at about 9 pm, the Sultana cast off from Vicksburg. Captain J. Cass Mason, who is described by the US Naval Instituteas \"respected\" but \"reckless, told an army officer that he'd carried that many men in the past and that the boat was sturdy. Mason was well aware that his boat was extremely overcrowded but did not consider it overloaded. He assured the officer that the Sultana was a good ship and the men were in very capable hands. The officer told Captain Moss, \"Take good care of them. They are deserving of it.\" With that, the ship was on its way to Memphis where on April 26, 1865 it stopped to pick up a load of coal. At around midnight, it cast off again to continue it's journey. The repaired boiler exploded about 2 AM on this date in 1865 and the fact that it was only 7 miles upstream illustrates just how slow it was moving. Between the load it was carrying and the flow of the river against it, it was only able to muscle 3.5 miles per hour. The strain on the patch was too much. It exploded and that caused two others to immediately blow up. Fire raced through the boat, the two smokestacks fell and crushed many on the deck. Keep in mind that a steamboat boiled water to create the steam so scalding water no doubt affected numerous passengers, many of whom were unable to move due to their condition and were in great pain from their wounds.\n\nThe Sultana was but 260 feet long with a draft of just 7 feet. The RMS Titanic was 882 feet long. The RMS Titanic had 2223 passengers and 700 survived the sinking while 1517 perished. The much smaller Sultana carried 2200 to 2500 and 1700 to 1800 were killed in the disaster leaving 500 to 800 to survive initially, but 200 more would die later from their wounds. The survivors of the Titanic were fortunate in that it was a still night with calm seas, but it was extremely cold and the water was freezing. The weather conditions of the Sultana disaster weren't nearly as cold, but the river had a very swift and turbulent current due to spring run-off from melting snow and seasonal rains upriver. Those who escaped the exlosion had to fight the deadly current. The boat itself was not completely destroyed in the explosion and fire but the hulk of wreckage floated downstream before ultimately sinking at Memphis where today it rests covered in mud and covered by the Mississippi River.\n\nSPC Severe Probability Thurs AM to Fri AM\n\n12Z Tue GFS Very Bullish for Rain Midday Derby Day\n\nWeather Bottom Line: I'm not convinced that it's going to be dry for the Kentucky Derby Forecast. The longer range models still show disagreement in that the European model keeps big storms several hundred miles to the West on Friday while the GFS has a cold front draped across St. Louis. Either way, we will get a warming trend ahead of the system beginning on Wednesday. Moisture levels will also be increasing as we head to the low to mid 80\u2032s.\n\n12Z Tue NAM Hold Rain Just West for Oaks Day\n\nI still have an eyebrow raised about the prospects of severe weather around here but I don't see a kicker. Further, the GFS vertical profile prog doesn't really present menacing severe indecies. However, the GFS does throw out a little more than a half inch of rain for Friday afternoon which may mean we have a questionable Oaks Day Forecast. I tend to think that we will be okay for Oaks Day. I\"m not sure if the progression will be as slow as the Storms Prediction Center seems to be going with, which is the European solution. My guess is that the timing of this will be something in between the GFS and European. Any slow down in the GFS solution will result in a pretty good Oaks Day. But, the GFS throws out 2 inches of rain in Louisville from 1AM Saturday morning until 7 pm Derby Day. Even if it's slower, we get rain and t'storms for the afternoon. Every model right now throws out some amount of rain for Derby Day. So, if you are picking a horse early, a good mudder will be a wise decision. However, I think the wisest thing will be to wait to make your wager. There is such disagreement with the data that its difficult to really pin down a firm forecast. While all indications are that we will have low level convergent flow and an increasing jet stream intensity, which would support t'storms, the timing is debatable. Should that scenario play out and some sort of kicker like a shortwave come through the flow, then we're talking severe potential. I have a fair amount of confidence that the rain and t'storm chances will be high for Derby Day. I feel pretty good about the idea that Oaks Day will be warm, breezy and partly cloudy. But, there is enough uncertainty that its probably not a good idea to hang your derby hat just yet."}
{"text":"The Bretagne battleship served the French Navy throughout the bulk of World War 1 and operated throughout the inter-war years and into the early part of World War 2. She was subsequently attacked and sunk by the British Royal Navy in Algeria who feared her - and the French Fleet - falling into German hands. Over 1,000 French sailors went down with her, ending a twenty-five year tenure and causing a national rift between the two nations.\n\nBy this time in history, France was consistently behind in the grand \"Dreadnought\" naval race of the world's militaries. The dreadnought proved the preeminent battleship of her 20th Century, coupling \"big gun\" design with steam propulsion. While the world lay quiet for a time at the turn of the century, the arrival of the dreadnought pushed forth a new weapons race for many of the world powers involved - specifically between Britain and Germany - this also during a time when a nation's power was still measured by strength at sea. Dreadnoughts came to be measured within three categories - Pre-Dreadnoughts, Dreadnoughts and Super-Dreadnoughts. Many of these vessels were ultimately taken to the scrapman's torch following the long and bloody global conflict defined as World War 1 - this was pushed forth by the ensuing Washington Naval Treaty and agreed upon by naval powers the world over.\n\nTo seemingly catch up to the other powers at play, French authorities ordered the design and construction of three battleships to be designated as the Bretagne, Provence and Lorraine - the Bretagne to act as lead to her sister ships. To help cut down on construction time in the shipyard, it was suggested that the new battleships take the most out of the previous Courbet class of fighting ship. The main guns were lifted from the cancelled Normandie-class battleship.\n\nAs it came, the Bretagne was an impressive-looking vessel. She sported a conventional hull with a sharp raised bow. She held two large main gun turrets in twin-mountings forward and two main gun turrets in twin-mountings aft. Interestingly, a fifth turret with a twin-mount emplacement was settled directly amidships for a total of ten main guns. Her superstructure dominated amidships and held her twin masts, bridge and twin funnels. Power was supplied by 18 to 24 boilers and 4 x shaft Parson turbines. All this generated an output of up to 29,000 horsepower giving the vessel a top speed nearing 20 knots. Her length measured in at over 544 feet and she was ranged out to 4,700 nautical miles when speeding at 10 knots. Her standard crew complement was 1,133 officers and enlisted personnel. Armor protection at the belt was 270mm. Her three decks held 40mm each and the casemates were listed at 170mm thick. The turrets each maintained up to 340mm of armor plate while the conning tower measured in at 314mm. In all, she displaced some 26,180 tons on a full load.\n\nArmament centered around the aforementioned main guns, these 10 x 340mm\/45 Modele 1912 series guns, each in twin-mountings per turret structure. This was furthered by 4 x 47mm cannons and 4 x 450mm torpedo tubes for anti-ship defense. Torpedoes aboard battleships were a large part of the armament concerning World War 1 vessels and this thinking carried over some into World War 2 surface warships until ultimately leaving torpedo attacks to dedicated submarine platforms. Additional defense was afforded by the 22 x 138.6 Mle 1910 series medium-class naval surface guns. After 1935, these gun systems were narrowed to just 14 x 138.6mm Mle 1910 guns with 8 x 75mm\/50 Modele 1922 guns to boot.\n\nThe Bretagne was laid down on July 1st, 1912, by the Arsenal de Brest shipbuilder. Upon her completion, she was launched on April 21st, 1913, and was officially commissioned for service in the French Navy in September of 1915. She received her namesake \"Bretagne\" from the French region known as \"Region of Brittany\" of \"Region Bretagne\", the westernmost landmass peninsula on French soil.\n\nThe Bretagne was stationed throughout the Mediterranean during her time in World War 1, from 1916 to 1918. Modernization projects from 1921 to 1923 made her a slightly better fighting vessel and included partial oil firing systems. Further modernization transpired from 1927 to 1930. She underwent yet another program from 1932 to 1935 and added new boilers with 43,000 horsepower output, though her top speed increased only one knot. She would remain in operations across the Mediterranean region at the start of World War 2. Germany invaded French soil on May 10th, 1940, and the French nation capitulated on June 21st, 1940. The fall of Paris left many fighting units cut-off, surrendering or on the run. As such, the Bretagne set sail for the Algerian port of Mers-el-Kebir to join the rest of the surviving French Fleet.\n\nBritain realized the importance of having had lost France as a military ally in mainland Europe. The French Navy could still remain a symbol of power but, at this point, could easily fall into service for the invading Germans or Italians. There was a sense of urgency to assure the British government that, should the French fleet come under direct German threat, French sailors need sabotage their vessels for the greater good. The British Admiralty sent an order to guarantee such action on France's part. Captain C.S. Holland of the HMS Hood - the British capital ship - visited with French authorities and included French Admiral Gensoul. However, any British solution was rebuffed - the French would not surrender their ships to the British, nor join the British as an ally nor surrender their ships to foreign friendly parties in foreign ports elsewhere. After a final message from British Prime Minister Churchill to holland urging a swift end to the matter, Holland set forth a deadline that came and went. Ultimately, he ordered the guns of the HMS Hood to open fire, this on July 3rd, 1940. His crew diligently answered with trained accuracy and expediency. Swordfish aircraft from the carrier Ark Royal directed the action from above and consulted gunnery crews for improved accuracy in their subsequent shots. The HMS Valiant and HMS Resolution were part of the shelling fray.\n\nBretagne was one of the many French Fleet ships anchored in the harbor still. She was also one to take the main brunt of the British salvos and endured the first of such hits onto her design. French sailors were immediately killed or thrown overboard from the blast. Hot oil leaked across the harbor and did more damage to the living who managed a fall into the water. Thick black smoke stifled the air, suffocating those that managed to live between these direct salvos. HMS Hood's shells penetrated through the decks of the Bretagne and struck her magazine, ultimately dooming the ship for good. She listed to one side and eventually settled upside down, reportedly sinking in a short 20 seconds according to eye witness French sailors. Between 977 and 1,012 French sailors went down with the ship (sources vary) in fighting that lasted only one half-hour. Some French vessels tried to manage their way out of the harbor - and some did with success - but the French fleet proved a sitting duck in this surprise situation, caught unawares by the unseen and ultimate British intention"}

{"text":"Defoe Shipyard\n\nIn 1905, Harry J. Defoe organized the Defoe Shipbuilding Company. This shipyard specialized\nin motor works in Bay City, Michigan. After the company's initial endeavors in building\nfishing boats as the Defoe Boat and Motor Works, it shifted paths in 1918 and utilized gasoline\nengines for pleasure crafts. The name was changed to Defoe Shipbuilding Company. Defoe\nShipbuilding quickly became a recognized name and began to acquire governmental contracts for\nNavy vessels and steam chasers during World War I.\n\nThe company's abilities began to grow and the company was able to create ice cutters for the\nCoast Guard. They also expanded to create presidential yachts and other specialty crafts for\ndifferent uses. At the end of World War I, there was an extensive demand for yacht building\nthat occurred between the boom years and the great depression. Although they had to compete\nwith big name competitors for the demand of these ships, Defoe was able to use its unique\ndesign and hand craftsmanship to outweigh the competition. On top of yacht building, the US\nCoast Guard used Defoe's Shipyard to create different steam turbine cutters that were able to\nchop through twelve inches of ice.\n\nBy World War II, all of Defoe's shipbuilding skills went to into war efforts. Defoe Shipbuilding\nwas responsible for building over 150 ships which included minesweepers, fast transports, patrol\ncrafts, and landing crafts. With its highly reputable work, Defoe Shipbuilding was able to stand\nas one of the leading shipyards in the entire country. As war efforts diminished, so did Defoe's governmental and military contracts. Besides having to cut many of the workers\nwho built the steam ships in the shallow waters of the Saginaw River, Defoe was not able to keep any working contracts with the government or local\nindustries. The company shut down production in 1976 after producing no more\ncontractual agreements.\n\nLike many other shipyard industries, Defoe Shipbuilding used asbestos material in the creation\nof its vessels. Below deck in the boilers, around mechanical fixtures, and in other areas is where\nasbestos was most likely used. Workers were prone to inhaling the toxic substance if particles\nwere released into the air. Many individuals that worked on these vessels more than forty years\nago are now developing lung related ailments such as asbestosis and mesothelioma. Those who\nbelieve that they have been exposed to asbestos from this shipyard should seek medical attention\nand testing immediately. Determining whether mesothelioma is present at earlier stages will\nallow the patient to be more responsive to treatment and medication."}

{"text":"Tall Ship\n\nThe Marine Museum gives insight into Marine activity on the north shore of Lake Erie. In the early days, there was an extensive ship-building industry, largely due to the abundant timber supply in the Otter Valley. The landmark lighthouse was built in the 1840's and was restored by Mennonite craftsmen in 1986.\n\nIn 1906, the MV Ashtabula brought bulk coal in hopper cars, and continued making two trips per day from Ashtabula , Ohio, to Port Burwell, until 1958, when she was struck and sunk by an ore carrier, in Ashtabula Harbour.

As the hour approached for the scheduled race start of 1900 local time, the race committee on the start vessel decided there was insufficient wind to get the fleet across the start line and announced a one hour delay. A second hour's delay was also deemed necessary but then the wind picked up allowing the fleet to cross the line at 2100 local time with around 10 knots of wind and a setting sun providing a beautiful setting.\n\nFirst across the line for the Class As was S\u00f8rlandet (Norway), close behind was Lord Nelson (UK) and third Cuauhtemoc (Mexico).

{"text":"Surface warfare\n\nNaval warfare is divided into three operational areas: surface warfare, air warfare and submarine warfare. Each area is comprised of specialized platforms and strategies used to exploit tactical advantages unique and inherent to that area.\n\nModern surface warfare dates from the mid 20th century, when surface, air, and submarine warfare components were blended together as a tactical unit to achieve strategic objectives. The two most important strategic objectives are interdiction and sea control. Interdiction is the process of preventing enemy forces access to or through a location, for example: German naval objectives against Britain in World War II were primarily focused on preventing ships arriving intact with their cargos. Sea control is the dominance of force over a given area that prevents other naval forces from operating successfully, for example: the mission of the allied navies in the Atlantic during World War II was to maintain sea control and prevent axis naval forces from operating.\n\nWhen people think of naval vessels, they usually think of surface ships, such as: battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, and others. Surface combatants also include mine warfare ships, amphibious command ships, coastal defense craft, amphibious assault craft, and many others. An important facet of naval warfare are the support ships: freighters, oilers, hospital ships, tugs, troop transports, and others.\n\nHistory\n\nThe history of naval warfare is the history of surface warfare. Until the advent of useful submarines and aircraft, all naval actions were conducted with surface ships. In ages past, most naval actions occurred to transport armies or army supplies from one place to another. Very few seafaring nations developed specialized ships designed to attack other ships underway until the advent of artillery and naval guns.\n\nWith the advent of naval guns, it became possible to transport a significant battery of guns to a variety of locations and deploy them against enemies who could not transfer land-based guns to counter this mobile threat. Naval warfare, for the next 300 years, was devoted to the development of better guns.\n\nWith the advent of the steamship, it became possible to create really massive gun platforms and to provide them with very serious armor protection. The Dreadnought battleships and their successors were the first heavy capital ships that combined technology and firepower into a mobile weapons platform. However, in the first half of the 20th century, naval strategists and planners failed to take into account the effect of airpower on the effectiveness and useability of large capital ships, such as battleships.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the importance of naval surface power was reduced as air a submarine warfare platforms demonstrated their capabilities. In the 21st century, it has been clearly demonstrated that a modern naval force must be composed of all three platforms (surface, submarine, and air) to be effective in projecting naval power and maintaining sea"}
{"text":"Adventure can be found in one's own back yard or at the\nends of the earth. Jack Keck is pictured at right and\nis a local individual who found adventure in one of the\nworld's most inhospitable places. He grew up in Rogers\nand was the captain of the high school football and\nbasketball teams before graduating in 1934. By the late\n1930s, Jack was serving in the United States Navy. In\n1939 he was ready to leave the service, but his\nselection join an Antarctic expedition led by Rear\nAdmiral Richard Byrd changed his mind \u2013 he was one of\n160 servicemen and civilians selected for the mission.\nEvery man on the expedition came largely from the\nregular Navy and Coast Guard or scientific community,\neach had to be a \"jack-of-all-trades\" and a specialist\nin at least one, and all had to be able to endure trying\nconditions.\n\nExploration of the arctic poles was one of the most\nexciting missions of the U.S. Navy during the 20th\ncentury. In a letter to home dated January 16, 1940,\nJack described his impression of Antarctica: \"Well, Red\nI am just about as far away from home as a fellow of my\nage could get, almost at the jumping off place. Not so\nbad down here, of course it is summer here now, it is\nonly 20 degrees above zero, but it doesn't seem that\ncold, there is ice and snow everyplace, we even got the\nship tied to the ice. Wish I could describe this\ncountry to you, but I don't know how to start, except as\nfar as you can see is just hills of ice with 8 or 10\nfoot of snow, it snowed the first day we was here, but\nthe rest of the time has been nice.\"\n\nTheir\nship was called the U.S.S. Bear and had an equally\nfascinating service life. She was built in 1874 in\nScotland as a sealing vessel and purchased by the Navy\nin 1884. Rigged for sails, the ship also had a diesel\nengine. The Bear was deployed in several arctic\nmissions before being reassigned to the Coast Guard.\nInterestingly, the Coast Guard sold the ship to the City\nof Oakland, California in 1929 for use as a museum, but\nshe was later transferred to Admiral Byrd's 1933-35\nAntarctic expedition. In 1939 the Navy eventually\nrepurchased the vessel for further exploration use.\n\nHis\njournal of the adventure described the ship, crew, and\nwork in Antarctica between November 22, 1939 and April\n20, 1940. During this time, the personnel supported the\nweather and geology studies conducted by the scientists,\nhelped put up buildings, and tested cold weather\nclothing. Many of the entries described the cold\nweather, rough seas, ice, and driving snow. They also\ndiscussed life at the bottom of the world. \"One cannot\nstand straight up in the wind,\" Jack recorded. \"It will\nblow him backwards, he must bend forward to walk. We\nare now going through water where no ship has ever gone\nthrough before. Temperature today 21 degrees. We have\nnot seen the sun for several days. We have plenty of\nbooks and magazines to read. Also, Admiral Byrd gave us\na Gramophone and several records, so when we can't get\nmusic over the radio, we play it.\"\n\nThe\nFebruary 26, 1940 journal entry reflected the sense of\nadventure and danger associated with the mission: \"Was\ncloudy early part of the morning, but was clear by noon,\nso plane took another flight with Lt. Dufek, Snow and\nPerch. Admiral Byrd did not go. He has been feeling\npretty bum the past few days. They went much farther\nthis flight. Saw more mountain ranges. Their radio\nwent out just after they left the ship and was out the\nrest of the flight. They were gone over three hours\nthat we did not hear from them. Everyone was getting\nworried about them. They could hear us but we could not\nhear them. Visibility had decreased a lot and was\ngetting cloudy. After we picked up the airplane we\nheaded east working our way through the ice pack.\nTemperature today 16 degrees, sea calm, but great fields\nof ice all around us. Saw vast numbers of whale. They\ncame within 20 or 30 feet of the ship.\" Jack further\ncommented that the information from the flights would be\nused to make a map of previously unknown land, coast,\nand ocean features.\n\nJack\nstayed in the Navy and retired in 1957. He and his\nwife, Lenora, returned to life in Northwest Arkansas\nwith memories that many people can only dream of. He\nwas avidly interested in nature and worked for the\nRogers Street Department.

{"text":"History of the Great Lakes\n\nVol. 2 by J.B. Mansfield Published Chicago: J.H. Beers & Co. 1899\n\nCAPTAIN EDWARD BABCOCK\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nCaptain Edward Babcock, an old and widely-known lake mariner, was born in Painesville, Ohio, in 1833. He attended the public schools of his native town until 1847, when he commenced his lake career as boy on the schooner Nebraska, with Capt. Normal Richmond, the following season serving on the schooner Matt Root, and in the spring of 1849 shipping as seaman on his first boat, the Nebraska, with Captain Blanchard. On the 2d of July they came up to the bark Sunshine, which had capsized in a squall; the captain and mate were drowned, and the Nebraska picked up the captain's wife, the second mate and five of the crew. In 1850 Captain Babcock shipped on the scow I. C. Pendleton with Capt. David Becker, who lost his life a few years ago, his vessel having taken fire off St. Catharines, Ontario. In the spring of 1851 he shipped as seaman on the brig Iroquois; in 1852-53 in the scow E. L. Herrick; in 1854-55 in the schooner Nebraska, as second mate; in 1856-57 in the schooner Goodell, with Capt. Ras Herrington; in 1858-59 as second mate on the steamer E. B. Hale. In the spring of 1860 he was appointed second mate of the brig Iroquois, and remained on her until May 20, 1861, when she was laid up at Cleveland. Captain Babcock then enlisted in the Twenty-third O. V. I., serving with that regiment eighteen months, and participating in all the encounters in which it was engaged, including the battles at Island No. 10 and Vicksburg. In 1862 he was transferred to the navy, and was promoted to captain of the aftguard of the man-of-war Metacomet, a side-wheel, double-end steamer, which he joined at Mobile. He was with this boat in the engagements at Mobile and New Orleans, and remained on her until the expiration of his three years' term of enlistment, when he re-enlisted for another three years, being assigned boatswain to the man-of-war Michigan, under command of Captain Jewett. He served in that position until the close of 1866, and the year following was appointed boatswain of the revenue cutter Commodore Perry, Capt. D. O. Ottinger commanding, on which he remained two years.\n\nIn the spring of 1869 Captain Babcock shipped on the schooner Harvest Home. In 1870-71 he engaged in the fishing business out of Erie, Penn., and in 1872-73 he was again boatswain of the cutter Commodore Perry. In 1874 he joined the life-saving service as surfman, at Erie, remaining there two seasons, and in that time assisted in the rescue of the crews of the schooner Beels Thompson, which was burned off that port, and the barge St. Joseph. Removing to Cleveland, Captain Babcock there engaged in occupation ashore two years, but in 1878 he joined the Cleveland life-saving service as surfman, and during his connection with same participated in the rescue of the crews of the schooners Moonlight, Baldwin and Cossack. In the spring of 1879 he engaged in the fishing business out of the port of Cleveland, continuing same until, in the fall of 1884, he entered the employ of the Smith Tug Company as watchman, remaining there one year. The following year he engaged as night watchman for the three tug lines, the Black, Red and Independent, serving in that capacity about four years, following which, for another four years, he was watchman for the Red Stack line. In the spring of 1895 he entered the employ of the Cleveland Tug Company as night manager which position he yet retains.\n\nCaptain Babcock is an ardent member of Stedman Post, G. A. R. In 1872 he was united in marriage to Miss Emily Gibson, of Erie, Penn., who died in September, 1895.\n\nCAPTAIN GEORGE FRANCIS BABCOCK\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nCaptain George Francis Babcock is the only original keeper appointed by the United States Government to the life-saving service on the lakes in the Ninth District, when the Cox bill providing for a paid life-saving service first became a law, and he had been for years previous to that in command of a volunteer life-saving crew. He is a man in every way qualified to fulfill the hazardous and oftentimes dangerous duties of his calling. He is stationed at Fairport, Ohio, a locality often subject to the fiercest tempests, and visited by any of the ore and coal carriers, a combination which requires him to be ever on the alert.\n\nThe Captain was born in Fairport, December 20, 1845, and is a son of Joseph and Mary Ann (Allen) Babcock. Previous to the construction of the railroad in Fairport, his father kept a grocery and supply store near the docks, and supplied the emigrants (who, on their way west on the steamer, usually put in at that port) with provisions, etc., and carried on quite a lucrative trade. The mother was born in Pennsylvania, and was of Scotch descent. The grandparents on the paternal side were Daniel and Thankful Babcock, and located at Painesville among the earliest pioneers. They purchased and cleared up a large tract of land. During the war of 1812 great ill feeling existed between the whites and Indians, and several massacres occurred on the island contiguous to Fairport. Daniel Babcock owned a small boat which he used for fishing, and on one occasion when an Indian outbreak was threatened, he conveyed many of the islanders to Cleveland. Many of those who could not thus get passage were killed by the Indians.\n\nCaptain Babcock, the subject of this article, acquired such education as the public schools afforded in his boyhood days, working meanwhile on his father's farm, which consisted of three hundred acres. It was in 1863 that he began sailing, his first berth being in the little schooner Vermont as boy, making but one round trip that season. The next spring he shipped in the brig Sultan, but left her in July to help his father get in the harvest, expecting to rejoin her before she sailed again. When he reached Cleveland she had sailed, which was perhaps fortunate for him, as the brig was lost that trip with all hands except Lee Speers, the mate, who afterward became captain in Alva Bradley's employ. In the spring of 1865 Captain Babcock shipped in the schooner E. C. Roberts with Captain Andrews, closing the season in the scow Marion Dixon. The other vessels in which he sailed were the schooners Industry, Frankie Wilcox, Algerine, J. C. Hills, Indianola, of which he was second mate, the Colorado and H. A. Lamars, of which he was mate. He then started in the fishing business out of Fairport, in which he succeeded in losing the money invested, and again went sailing.\n\nIn 1871 Captain Babcock was appointed assistant to the government light keeper at Fairport harbor, holding that position seven years. He then purchased two boats and again essayed the fishing business, which continued fairly profitable. In 1876 the life saving station was built at Fairport and Capt. D. P. Dobbins tendered him the office of keeper, thus making him keeper of both the lighthouse and life saving station, operating the latter with a volunteer crew for some time. During the twenty-two years that the Captain has been employed in the life saving service, he and his crew have been instru-mental in rescuing over three hundred people on vessels he has gone out to relieve with his crew. The values of vessels, which are too numerous to name in this article, if computed would reach over $3,000,000. One on occasion when the Captain was obliged to make four trips in order to get the perishing crew he broke one of his feet, and it required the utmost fortitude to continue the good work. The Captain keeps a record of all events occurring about his station with the utmost exactitude, and makes a neat daily report in typewriting to the Superintendent of the District.\n\nFraternally he is a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, of the Foresters and of the Independent Order of Good Templars.\n\nCaptain Babcock was wedded to Miss Alice Warren, of Fairport (but a native of Roxton Falls, Canada), on February 2, 1875. The wife's father and three brothers took an honorable part in the Civil War. She died June 10, 1894. The children born to this union were: Eva, David J., Seth W. (who was drowned when six years old), and George F. Captain Babcock has spent the best years of his life in the cause of humanity, and as he has done his work well it is safe to say that he has a clear conscience.\n\nW. I. BABCOCK\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nW.I. Babcock, the efficient manager of the Chicago Ship Building Company, is a finished scholar and a man of national reputation as a naval architect and ship-builder. He has the right to contemplate with pride the many finely constructed steamers that he has designed and launched, some of which have been noted for their speed, and others for their stanch sea-going qualities. Mr. Babcock was born in Stonington, Conn., in 1858, a son of Capt. David S. and Charlotte (Noyes) Babcock, who in 1866 removed to Brooklyn, N. Y., where our subject had the advantage of the excellent public-school system, graduating from School No. 11, in 1872. He then attended the Brooklyn Collegiate and Polytechnic Institute, graduating in 1876 with the degree of B. S., and two years later he was granted the degree of civil engineer by the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, of Troy, N. Y., from which he graduated.\n\nIn 1878 Mr. Babcock became connected with the Morgan Iron Works, of New York, in the machine shop and as draughtsman, remaining with them until the next year, when he became assistant engineer of the Tehuantepec Inter Ocean Railroad Company, in Mexico. In 1880 he was engaged as draughtsman at Roach's shipyard, Chester, Penn., and remained with that concern five years. He was then called to New York to become assistant to the president of the Providence & Stonington Steamship Co., retaining that office two years. It was in 1887 that Mr. Babcock accepted the position of superintendent of the Union Dry dock Company at Buffalo, N.Y., and during the two years he remained with that corporation he designed and constructed several steamers notable for their beauty and speed. In 1889 he accepted the office of manager of the Chicago Shipbuilding Company, and during the ten years that he has directed affairs the company has built some of the finest and largest steel vessels that traverse the lakes. Since October, 1897, they have launched three fine vessels. The towbarges Australia, build for James Corrigan of Cleveland, and the Maia, for the Minnesota Steamship Company, have each a 376-foot keel, 48-foot beam, 26 feet deep, and a gross tonnage of 3,745.17, and a net tonnage of 3,467.89, while the steamer William R. Linn, built for C.W. Elphicke and others, of Chicago, has a 400-foot keel, 48-foot beam, is 28 feet deep, and has a gross tonnage of 4,328.71, and a net tonnage of 3,196.99. The Chicago Shipbuilding Company was organized in December, 1889, under the laws of Illinois, by certain Chicago parties, and parties connected with the Globe Iron Works, of Cleveland, Ohio. The first officers were J.F. Pankhurst, president; W.I. Babcock, manager; Luther Allen, vice-president and treasurer; and J.H. Craig, secretary. In 1892 the Cleveland stock was purchased by Chicago men, and Emmons Blaine became president; W. F. Cobb, vice-president and treasurer; O.R. Sinclair, secretary; and W.I. Babcock, manager. After the death of Mr. Blaine, in the summer of 1892, William L. Brown became president, the other officers remaining unchanged, and all these hold their respective positions.\n\nThe societies of which Mr. Babcock is a member are of a high order, and comprise the American Society of Naval Engineers, United States Naval Institute, Society of Naval Architects & Marine Engineers, and Institution of Naval Architects, of London, England.\n\nIn 1890 Mr. Babcock was united in marriage to Miss Grace W. Kernochan,daughter of Hon. Henry P. Kernochan, of Louisiana, and one son, Irving, has been born to them.\n\nFREDERICK A. BAILEY\n\nFrederick A. Bailey, son of Capt. Joshua Bailey, is a well known steamboat master, and for the season of 1899 has been appointed to the steamer Mariska, of the Minnesota Steamship Company. Socially, he is a Master Mason of Ely Lodge, in Vermilion, and a member of the Ship Masters Association, carrying Pennant No. 958. Capt. Frederick A. Bailey was united by marriage to Miss Marie Martin, of Vermilion, Ohio, the ceremony taking place on September 24, 1890. One son, Charles Albert, has been born to them. Both father and son have fine modern-built homesteads in Vermilion, Ohio.\n\nCAPTAIN JOSHUA BAILEY\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nCaptain Joshua Bailey, who has had quite as varied an experience as any master mariner on the lakes, and who carries his three-score years in a happy way, his good nature being proverbial, was born in Whitby, Ontario, August 28, 1839, a son of James and Rebecca (Ferguson) Bailey. His father was a native of the North of Ireland, while his mother was of English birth. They removed to Canada about the year 1824, locating at Whitby, where they purchased a farm and where they both passed to a better world. Capt. Joshua and John Bailey are twins, and the mother died in giving them birth in 1839.\n\nCapt. Joshua Bailey attended the schools in Whitby a short time, but when eleven years old ran away from home and shipped as cook on the schooner Paragon, Capt. Abraham Fairwell. The next year, 1851, he went before the mast on the schooner Duke of Darlington. On July 4, she capsized off the Highlands of Toronto, her cargo, consisting of forty-five tons of pig iron, having shifted; all of the crew were drowned except Captain Bailey, who succeeded in getting on the yawl, which was floating bottom side up, in which precarious position he passed the entire night. He was rescued the next morning, however, by the steamer Magnet, Capt. Towig, of Toronto. His next berth was before the mast on the schooner James Leslie, closing the season on the schooner New Haven, with Capt. George Stone, with whom he sailed at various times for seventeen years. In the spring of 1852 he shipped on the Canadian barks Alice and Fawn, and, after the latter was stranded, on the schooner Ellington until October, after which he transferred to the schooners Thornton, Lewis Wells, and S. Robinson. In 1853 he shipped on the schooner Queen City, Capt. George Stone, and that winter kept ship and remained with her seven years, making a winter voyage, however, in 1858, from New York to Liverpool, in the Three Bells, of Glasgow, finally reaching the position of mate.\n\nIn the spring of 1862, Capt. Joshus Bailey was appointed master of the schooner F.T. Barney, which he sailed seven years. In 1869 he joined the scow Wellhouse as pilot for one trip, but closed the season as mate of the bark Coyne, going the next spring with Capt. E.C. Roberts, until June, when he was appointed master of the schooner William B. Ogden. In the spring of 1871 he joined the schooner Escanaba as mate, remaining until the Nellie Redington came out new, when he was appointed to her two seasons, making a last trip, however, in 1872. His next berth was on the new steamer E.B. Hale as mate, retaining that office six years, and in 1879 he was appointed master of the schooner Escanaba; but, after sailing her successfully for five years, she stranded on Gull Island Reef on June 18, 1883. The Captain was then transferred to the schooner J.F. Card as master. His next vessel was the schooner Joseph Paige, on which he went as mate; but in September he joined the steamer R. J. Hackett in a like capacity. In the spring of 1885 Captain Bailey became mate of the steamer A. Everett with Capt. Albert Meyers, retaining that position three years. Then followed three seasons, during which time he was mate, a season each, of the steamers Smith Moore, Continental and Mariska, coming out with her new and working in the Globe shipyard at Cleveland during the winter months. In the spring of 1891 he joined the steamer C.J. Kershaw as mate, closing the season as master, and sailing her the following season; then went as mate on her in 1893, but closing the season in the steamer V.H. Ketcham. The next season Captain Bailey entered the employ of the Minnesota Steamship Company as mate of the steamer Maruba, transferring to the steamer Marina, on which he remained two seasons. In 1897 he was appointed mate of the steamer Nyanza; but in July he joined the steamer Senator, and remained with her until the close of the season of 1898.\n\nSocially he is a Royal Arch Mason, and has belonged to Masonic bodies for thirty-seven years.\n\nOn July 24, 1863, in Vermilion, Ohio, Capt. Joshua Bailey was wedded to Miss Louisa Meyers, daughter of John and Persis (Whepley) Meyers, the former of whom was a native of Pennsylvania and the latter of Vermont. The children born to this union are Frederick Albert and Mary Louisa, now the wife of George Randerson, of Cleveland. Socially Captain Bailey is a Royal Arch Mason, and has belonged to Masonic bodies some thirty-seven years. Mrs. Bailey's brother, Albert Meyer, who was a skillful steamboat master, lost his life at the time of the foundering of the steamer Western Reserve on Lake Superior, about sixty miles north of the Sand Hills, and it will be remembered that but one man, a Mr. Stewart, of Algonac, lived to recount the disaster.\n\nCAPTAIN ROBERT N. BAILEY\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nCaptain Robert N. Bailey, one of the family of five sons and five daughters of Alfred and Caroline (Brush) Bailey, and the only one who has in any way become identified with navigation of the Great Lakes, was born at Amherstburg, Canada, November 12, 1854.\n\nWhen twenty years of age he commenced tugging at Detroit on the Oswego, which he wheeled for two seasons, and was also on the Swain in a like capacity for same length of time, after which he was appointed master of the City of Dresden, and sailed her two seasons. The following four seasons he was back again on the Swain as her mate, after which he divided one season on the tugs Gladiator and John Owen. In 1892 he sailed as second mate on the passenger steamer Depere, and in 1893 shipped as first mate to Captain Meikleham on the B. W. Blanchard, which berth he has filled continuously ever since, including the season of 1897. Captain Bailey is a member of Toledo Harbor Masters and Pilots Association, and makes his home with Captain Meikleham at No. 641 West Washington street, Toledo, Ohio.\n\nCAPTAIN THOMAS J. BAILEY\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nCaptain Thomas J. Bailey, captain of United States lighthouse station at Chicago, has in the fifty-eight years of his existence enjoyed a life that has been replete with incident, chiefly on ocean and lake navigation. From earliest recollections it was his ambition to be a sailor, and at the tender age of ten years he abandoned his home in England and ran away to sail the seas, and live his dream.\n\nThe Captain was born in Somersetshire, England, in 1840, the son of Joseph and Mary (Pickford) Bailey. The father was a farmer and native of the same country, the mother being from Witshire. Both parents lived and died in England. It was because he found at home strong opposition to his wishes to become a sailor that young Thomas stole away from his father's home and started for a seaport. He reached Portsmouth via London, and went before the mast on the school brig, serving one year. He was thence transferred to the Rosamond and later to other vessels of the English navy. For more than twenty years he was in the English navy. He served in the Crimean war, and during the Indian mutiny in Field's brigade. He served in China as chief yeoman to Admiral Hope, at which time he was boatswain. From China he went to New Zealand, and was quarterdeck officer of the vessel Cracker. From New Zealand he was transferred to Paraguay, and served through the Paraguayan war. Returning to England, Captain Bailey resigned and came to America. He reached Chicago in 1871 and located on a farm in Will county, near Joliet, and there engaged in farming. But life was not congenial, and he remained there only a short time. Captain Bailey has been in the employ of the British and American governments most of his life. He has been connected with the lighthouse service for a great many years. For three years he was in the lifesaving service at Ludington and White Lake, Mich., and for six years he was subsequently prime keeper of the government lighthouse at Big Point Sable, Mich. From that station Captain Bailey came to Chicago in 1893 to take charge of the government lighthouse station there.\n\nIn 1874 Captain Bailey was married in Canandaigua, Mich., to Miss Mary McClure, a native of Ohio, daughter of Andrew and Elmira (Strong) McClure. Andrew McClure was born in Pennsylvania in 1811; his wife was born in Connecticut, daughter of Capt, David Strong, a sea captain and vessel owner, who sailed from Connecticut, and whose vessel was seized by the French. Captain Strong was confined to a French prison for a year, and his vessel confiscated, like many others at the time, by the French Government. When the indemnity was paid for these seizures the Strong heirs failed to receive their share. The parents of Mr. Bailey moved to Lenawee county, Mich., in 1844, and settled in Adrian. The father died in 1897, the mother in 1892, both at the age of eighty-six years. Since 1893 Captain and Mrs. Bailey have resided in Chicago. Four children have been born to them, Juliett, a stenographer; Fred L., Victor and Winfield. Captain Bailey is a member of the Evening Star Lodge No. 173, F. & A. M., at Medina, Michigan.\n\nThe lighthouse, situated at the mouth of the Chicago river, and of which Captain Bailey has charge, was established in 1859. There are six lights, as follows: One revolving light at the outer breakwater, and one lens and fog signal at the outer breakwater, one fifth-order light and lens light off the south breakwater, and one-sixth order lens and lantern on the north pier, and a fog bell stuck by clock work on the north pier. The lighthouse was built on piers in 1859, and was then all surrounded by water. There was a raised walk from lighthouse to shore, the lake having been filled since then. Originally there was only one light, which has been removed to Twin River, Wis. The present lighthouse was erected in 1859, and is one of the landmarks that escaped the fire of 1871. This is the largest lighthouse on the Great Lakes, and is among the oldest and most prominent. Captain Bailey has a crew of five assistants.\n\nCAPTAIN A. J. BAIN\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nCaptain A.J. Bain was born January 15, 1859, at Stirling, Stirlingshire, Scotland, the son of John and Mary Ann (Tracy) Bain, who brought him to America when he was five years old. His father was a soldier in the regular service of the British army, and as such came from Glasgow, Scotland, to St. John, Canada, from there removing to Kinston, Ontario, and thence to St. John's Newfoundland; he returned to Kingston, was later in Quebec, and in 1871 settled in Windsor Ontario, where he still resides. The mother, who was a native of Londonderry, Ireland, died December 9, 1871.\n\nArchibald J. Bain began his marine life in 1872 as mess-room boy on the propeller Armenia, running between Montreal and Chicago, remaining on her only a short time, however, as he returned to school in the winter. In the capacity of wheelsman he served during different seasons on the Vulcan, I.U. Masterse, Champion and Ira Chaffee, and with Capt. P. L. Millen acted as second mate on the Ogemaw, Iron King, Iron Duke, Iron Age and Joliet. Later he was mate on the C. H. Starke and the Swallow, after which he entered the employ of the Detroit, Belle Isle & Windsor Ferry Co., spending three seasons upon the Sappho and Excelsior in the same capacity, and then taking command of the Arthur Jones for about six months. In March, 1896, he came to the Detroit & Walkerville Ferry Co. and has since acted as mate on the Ariel, alternating watches with Captain Huntoon during the summer season.\n\nCaptain Bain was married, December 9, 1889, to Miss Susannah Haslip, of Dresden, Ont., and they have had children as follows: Elizabeth Pearl, who is attending school at the present time; Agnes Jessie and Emily Haslip, who are still at home, and Susannah, deceased.\n\nCAPTAIN ISAAC GUILBERT BAIN\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nCaptain Isaac Guilbert Bain, son of William and Mary Ann (Guilbert) Bain, was born in County Wicklow, Vale of Avoca, Ireland, November 20, 1850, and like the majority of boys of those times received very little education, in fact only as much as he could pick up while at work.\n\nCaptain Bain began sailing at the age of thirteen, as boy on the steamer Windsor, from Dublin to Liverpool, serving on her a period of about three months. He subsequently went on the steamer Denmark, of the National line, as boy, and afterward as ordinary seaman, leaving her in New York, in 1866, and going to Buffalo; taking to the lakes he shipped as second cook on the Ella Bradbury, and then on the Philadelphia, in 1868, with Capt. Lyman Hunt, where he remained three years, as lookout, then as watchman and wheelsman. After leaving the Philadelphia he went on the propeller Sun with Le Hunt as master, and then on the Idaho, as wheelsman. In 1873 he sailed as wheelsman on the Dean Richmond, which had just been rebuilt, and after two trips was made second mate of her. Afterward he was mate on the Araxes two seasons, and second mate of the Commodore about four months, or until the Chicago was brought out, when he was transferred, and finished that season, as well as the next, on her. He then went into the Commercial line of steamers, and was mate on the Scotia and Russia for seven years, until the line went into the hands of a receiver, when he was appointed custodian, at their old docks in Buffalo, retaining that position a year. At that time he went in the Lackawanna line, with which he has been engaged the past twelve or thirteen years, as mate on the Colorado, Grand Traverse, Journeyman, Elmira, Miami, Scranton, Russia, Lackawanna, Arthur Orr and master of the Newburg, Russia, Barnum and others for several trips. Captain Bain has been rather lucky, never during his career having been in any wreck of any consequence, and through his determined, although jovial, ways made many friends since sailing.\n\nIn May, 1872, Captain Bain was married to Miss Margaret Stoddart, of Kingston, Ont., and six children have blessed their union, two of whom, Sadie, aged seventeen, and Isaac D., thirteen, are (1898) living. Socially, Captain Bain is a member of Erie Lodge, F. & A.M., and of the Shipmasters and Pilots Association, Local Harbor No. 41. He was also a charter member of the Lake Pilots Aid Association, remaining with same until it was disbanded. The family residence is at No. 186 Miami street, Buffalo, New York.\n\nCAPTAIN EDWARD J. BAKER\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nCaptain Edward J. Baker, of the Florence B., the Detroit river mail boat, was born in Detroit in the year 1870. He attended the public schools there, and after leaving school went on the tug Summer as watchman, and remained there all season. The two following years he was wheeling on the S.C. Hall.\n\nAt the age of twenty-one Captain Baker secured his papers as pilot, and was on the S.C. Hall again for four years as second mate. During the early part of the season after which he left the Hall, Captain Baker sailed on the E.G. Lindsay, but was compelled to lay off on account of illness.\n\nDuring 1894 he made several trips on different boats, and in 1895 was assistant on the mail boat Florence B., with which he is still connected.\n\nCaptain Baker was married three years ago, and has no family. He has always lived in Detroit.\n\nCAPTAIN C. R. BAKER\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nCaptain C.R. Baker, one of the younger men connected with the lake marine, has sailed more than half his life and held many responsible posts. He was born in Willoughby, Ohio, February 16, 1867, the son of Edwin Baker, who was a lake engineer for a number of years and is now engaged as engineer of the water works at Willoughby.\n\nCaptain Baker began his sailing career in 1881, having completed the course of instruction in the Willoughby public schools. He was with the schooner Negaunee two years, and with the schooners Thomas Quayle and Ahira Cobb one year each, during the next few years serving for brief periods on the steamers S.E. Sheldon, Wallula, Mitchell and Hesper, and the schooners Erastus Corning, Harvey Bissell, Conrad Reid and St. Lawrence. For some time following he was second mate of the steamer R.P. Ranney, of the E.B. Hale for two seasons, mate of the Henry Chisholm one season, second mate of the Maurice B. Grover one season, and mate of the George Stone for two seasons. During 1896 he sailed the schooner Samuel P. Ely, and the following season was again on the Stone as mate. On November 17, 1888, when Captain Baker was in the Bissell, that vessel went ashore on Point Abbey, in the Straits, in a blinding snow storm. She was scuttled to save her from pounding to pieces and remained there eight days before she was pumped out and released. When the steam pumps were placed on board, it became necessary to close the openings through which the water had been admitted, and this task was delegated to Captain Baker, who was then a seaman before the mast, and Joseph Langdon, the second mate. The work was most difficult and exhausting, as the two men were forced to stand immersed in the icy water and to repeatedly drop below the surface, in order to fasten the bolts at the bottom of the shutter which had been opened. He succeeded so well, however, in spite of all difficulties, that the vessel was pumped out and floated. Captain Baker was mate of the Stone when that vessel collided with and sunk the Kimball in Saginaw bay, April 26, 1895.\n\nCAPTAIN J. BAKER\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nCaptain J. Baker, master of the schooner York State, has had an experience of over a quarter of a century on the Great Lakes. He has sailed to all lake ports, and during his extended service he has ever been a careful and efficient sailor.\n\nCaptain Baker was born in Denmark, in 1853, the son of E. and Jane Baker. The father was a sailmaker and remained in the home of his nativity through life. When but a boy the Captain came to America, and landed at New York. In 1867, when only fourteen years old, he went before the mast, and in 1872 came to Chicago, and for the past twenty-five years has been sailing on the Great Lakes. He first went aboard the schooner Topsy before the mast, and within three weeks was appointed first mate. He remained with her three years, and then went on the Francis Palm, of Detroit, as mate. After serving on various other boats in the same capacity, he sailed the schooner Charles Luling, and remained her master for five years. Then for three years he sailed the schooner Richard, after which came the schooner Mediator. From that vessel Captain Baker took command of the schooner York State, which he has since sailed. He owns an interest in several vessels, and is regarded as one of the careful and promising practical men of the lakes.\n\nHe was married at Chicago, in 1878, to Miss Johanna Platt, a native of Hanover, Germany. Three children have been born to Captain and Mrs. Baker: Nancy, Emma and Eddie.\n\nJAMES W. BAKER\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nJames W. Baker, who for several years was a prominent marine engineer, and is the present engineer of the Ogden school, in Chicago, was born in Sandusky, Ohio, in October, 1855, a son of John M. and Lydia M. (Whitaker) Baker. The father was born in New York, but moved to Sandusky, Ohio, about the year 1835, and there worked at his trade, that of ship-carpenter, dying in Chicago, in 1891; his widow is now a resident of Chicago. They were the parents of three sons: James W., our subject; J. Marr, who was on the tug Relief when she burned, in 1887, on Lake Erie, is now in Chicago; and Arnold R., who also sailed the lakes.\n\nThe subject of these lines was reared in Cleveland, and there learned the trade of machinist and boilermaker after which, in 1870, he commenced sailing the lakes from Cleveland on the tug Belle King, on which he remained eighteen months; then went on the tug Maggie Sanborn, as fireman for one season; then on the tug Amadeus, at that time one of the largest harbor tugs on the lakes. On her he remained some eighteen months and then went as second engineer of the D.W. Wilson in the coal and iron ore trade. After one season on her, he, in the following spring, went as chief engineer of the lake tug Relief, and was on her four seasons. She was burned in 1887 on Lake Erie, off Sandusky, after which Mr. Baker went back to his home in Sandusky, Ohio, where he sojourned some time. He was then licensed chief engineer, and in that capacity went on the V. Swain, of Cleveland, remaining with her two years, at the end of which time he became engineer of the White & Fraint, of Chicago, was on her seven months, and then became engineer of the Fred Kelley, of Cleveland, which brings us now to 1889, the year Mr. Baker left the lakes. In 1887 he came to reside permanently in Chicago.\n\nOur subject's next occupation was as chief engineer for the Gillett Chemical Works, Chicago, where he remained two and a half years; then had charge of the Excelsior Block for about the same length of time, in 1894 receiving appointment as chief engineer of the Ogden school, his present charge.\n\nIn 1880, at Sandusky, Ohio, Mr. Baker was married to Miss Fanny Palmer, of Fort Wayne, Ind. Our subject was formerly a member of the M.E.B.A., No. 4, and was president of the lodge in 1892. He is affiliated with the K. of P., and with the A.F. & A.M., Blair Lodge No. 393.\n\nJ. A. BALDWIN\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nJ.A. Baldwin, chief engineer of the Masonic Temple, of Chicago, is one the prominent and well known men of his profession in the city. He is the eldest child and only son of four children born to his parents, Joel and Angeline H. (Hill) Baldwin, the former of whom was born near Utica, N.Y., and the latter was reared in Huron county, Ohio. The father was a man of fine educational attainments, and in his early life was a prominent and successful educator. Subsequent to his marriage he engaged in the boot and shoe business, in which enterprise he was successful. His death occurred March 25, 1883. Mrs. Baldwin, his widow, is yet living and resides at Benton Harbor, Michigan. J.A. Baldwin's boyhood was spent in Columbia Station, Ohio, where he was born August 26, 1850, and where he received the rudiments of his education in the common schools and by instruction under the tutelage of his father. At the age of twelve years he secured a situation in a shingle factory in his native town, which became the starting point of his mechanical career. In the above factory and in a wooden bowl factory of the same place he was alternately employed until he went on the lakes at the age of sixteen years. His maiden trip was made in the spring of 1867 on the schooner-rigged boat Nellie, commanded by Capt. William Aldridge, on which he remained during the shipping season of that year. Spending the following winter in his native town, he, at the beginning of the lake season of 1868, returned to the Nellie, then under command of Captain Stickney, and later went to the Elyria, Capt. Charles Reed, and still later in the season he went to the steamer George W. Bissell, Capt. George Pringeld as wheelsman. On the former named boats he was a sailor before the mast. At the close of navigation in 1868 he went to Paw Paw, Mich., and attended school the following winter. At the opening of spring in 1869, he secured employment as engineer in a sawmill, and later became engineer of a large furniture factory at Paw Paw, and still later in that year became engineer in a sash and door factory at Decatur, Mich., where he remained a part of the winter following. The spring following (1870) he was employed by R.W. Colburn to run his sawmill near Paw Paw, where he remained during the summer, and in the winter he moved that mill to the north branch of the Paw Paw river, where he operated it in the late winter and early spring (1871), then went to Saugatuck, where he was employed in a sawmill until June, when he went to Muskegon and secured work in a sawmill there for a short time. He then worked as a stevedore, loading vessels in the summer of 1871, then made five trips on the steamer Alpena as watchman, when he quit and went to Black lake and engaged at cutting logs and getting out hemlock bark for a mill that was there until fall. He then took charge of the mill at Black lake, owned by Swarthouse & Mulder, running the same on shares until along in the winter, when he shut down and rebuilt the mill, which he started up in February, 1872, and which afterward he continued to run, having an interest in it. That winter he took up his residence there with his family, and carried on the mill until late in the summer of 1872, when he became a partner with Captain Rowe in the purchase of the tug Hattie May. It was in the spring of this year that he secured at Milwaukee his first papers as engineer from United States Inspector Humes. He then moved to Spring Lake, and towed logs for Cuttler & Savage, mill men, and during the summer traded the Hattie May for the tug Croton, and moved to Douglas, doing general towing on the Kalamazoo river. In the late summer of 1872 he sold the tug Croton to its original owner, for whom he ran the tug as engineer. In the fall he quit the Croton and went to St. Joe, and secured a position as fireman on a passenger engine on the West Michigan railroad. William L. Fitch was then master mechanic of that road. He, however, remained only a short time in that position, when he went on the steamer G.P. Heath, Capt. R.C. Brittain, finishing the season with him. On the last trip of that boat from Saugatuck to Chicago he brought his family, which he settled near Downer's Grove, Ill. In the winter and spring of 1873 he went to Sherman, Mich., where he ran a sawmill, in which he was interested as part owner. Late that spring he returned to Downer's Grove, was taken ill and remained there during the ensuing summer. In the fall of that year he fitted out the propeller Skylark, and ran her for two months from St. Joe to Chicago, spending the following winter at Downer's Grove. In the spring of 1874 he returned to the Skylark, starting on his first trip April 24, and remained on her until July 1, 1874, when he returned and accepted a position with the West Michigan railroad as engineer, which he retained until early in October following when he became ill; recovering early in December, he went to Sand Lake, Mich., where for most of the winter he was employed in shipping lumber and scaling logs. In February of 1875, he again returned to the West Michigan Railroad Company, where he remained until he accepted a position on the tug Fannie Shriver in April, Captain Boswell commanding, for Captain Robbins, owner, and remaining on her until in the fall when he passed one month on the Messenger, of the Graham & Morton line, spending the following winter in Paw Paw. In February, 1876, at St. Joe he began putting machinery in the Sweet Brothers, owned by Henry Grimm & Co., Captain Myers sailing her. On the Sweet Brothers he remained until in the middle summer. In November he returned to the Skylark, aboard which he finished the season. The next February he again fitted out the Skylark and went across the lake with her in March, and was a week in making the trip owing to the great quantity of ice in the lake. On the Skylark he stayed all that season, and during the winter of 1877-78 ran a sawmill at Paw Paw. In the spring of the latter year he returned to St. Joe, where he ran a fish tug, and afterward was on the riverboat Union, on which vessel he was employed as engineer until late in the season. He then returned to the Skylark, finishing the season, and afterward removed her machinery, refitted her and remodeled her into a passenger boat - W.H. Williams becoming her owner - finishing her that winter. In the spring of 1879 he brought her (the Skylark) out as chief engineer, running her a short time and then came to Chicago and went on the canal and river boat, the H.P. Heath, steamer -running on the Illinois river and canal - Captain Nicholson owner. Later that year he went on the Niagara, Captain William Neadder owner, a similar boat on the Illinois river and canal. In the winter of 1879-80 he was employed as engineer in a coal mine at Beardstown, Ill. In the spring of 1880 he returned to the Niagara, remaining on her that season, and during the winter of 1880-81 was with the N.K. Fairbanks Company, as steam fitter.\n\nThe following March he fitted out the Niagara, a river steamboat, at Havana, Ill. On June 22, he became assistant engineer on the Mary Jarecki, running between South Chicago and Escanaba, continuing on her until September 4, when he was scalded by the bursting of a throttle, and returned home. When recovered he returned again to the N.K. Fairbank Company, with whom he remained throughout the rest of that year. In February, 1882, he went to Benton Harbor and fitted out the propeller Skylark, then owned by the Graham & Morton Transportation Company, first under Captain Stines and then under Captain Randall, and afterwards Capt. Wm Boswell, remaining on her until December following, when he returned to Chicago, and entered the employ of the N.K. Fairbank Company for the winter. In March of 1883, he was employed in putting new machinery in the City of St. Joe, a passenger boat, Captain Elton in command, which when completed he ran as engineer during the season, under Captain Stines. In the spring of 1884 he went on the passenger boat Lora, as engineer, finishing on her the lake season of that year, again returning to the N.K. Fairbank Company, and then to the Chicago Sugar House Company, 12th street, for the winter (1884). The year 1885 he was again on the Lora in his old capacity, spending the following winter in Chicago with the N.K. Fairbank Company as steam fitter. Early in the spring of 1886 he was employed by the owners of the Lora to refit her, and afterward he assumed his old position on her till the end of navigation of that year. During the winter of 1886-87 he was employed by Tobin & Hamler, who were building new boilers for the steamer Puritan, and at Benton Harbor the next spring he fitted out three boats for the Graham & Morton Transportation Co., and during the following season served aboard the Lora, Puritan and other boats of the same line as chief engineer of that line. During the winter of 1887-88 he rebuilt the machinery of the steamer Puritan, and when navigation opened he went on the latter boat, serving as chief engineer throughout that season. That fall he quit the lakes, went to Kansas City, Mo., to accept the office of chief engineer of the \"Midland Hotel\" of that place, remaining there creditably filling his responsible position during the year 1889 and until 1892, inclusive. On January 1, 1893, he accepted the position of constructing engineer for the Williams Engine Company, of Beloit, Wis., remaining with the firm until it went out of business late in August, when at the instigation of the above company he made arrangements with the Benton Harbor and St. Joe Electric Railway and Light Company to rebuild their plant, which he accomplished in a highly satisfactory manner, finishing his work in February, 1894. When navigation opened that spring he went out on the steamer Reed, running between St. Joe and Milwaukee, quitting her the last to July to go to Kansas City, Mo., to accept the position of constructing engineer for the Link Belt Machinery Company, of Chicago, and put in new boilers in the \"Midland Hotel\" plant, for the Grand Avenue Hotel Company, of which he was constructing engineer. In the spring of 1895 he returned to Chicago, and late in April went in partnership with Ben Haskell, of Glenn Pier, Mich., bought the steamer Yattow, which they later chartered to a steamship company on Lake Erie, running between Black river and Cleveland, Ohio, and later they chartered the steamer Root, which they put in the fruit-carrying trade between Glenn Pier and Chicago, closing the steamboat business October 1. He then returned to Chicago, and in November went to work for Wells & French as chief engineer of the street-car shops, where he remained until July 20, 1896, when he accepted the position of assistant engineer on the steamer Tioga under Charley Cushane as chief, Captain Wilkie in command, running between Chicago and Buffalo in the package trade. The Tioga was laid up in Buffalo the last of the year, and Mr. Baldwin returned to Benton Harbor January 1, 1897, then went to Chicago and later fitted up an ice plant for Swift & Co., at Calumet Lake, running the same until the middle of February, and soon after he appeared in Kansas City as a witness in an important case affecting the Midland Hotel Company. Returning to Chicago he was engaged in overhauling an ice plant, and later became assistant engineer of the Chicago Stock Exchange, having night charge of the plant until the last of June, when, on July 1, he was called to fill the responsible position of chief engineer of the Masonic Temple, where since by the engineering skill displayed he has won an enviable place among the men of his profession.\n\nOn September 13, 1869, he was married at Paw Paw, Mich., to Miss Libbie Button. Mr. Baldwin has filled many important positions of responsibility and trust, and he has received from his employers many testimonials certifying to his ability as an engineer, his integrity as a man, in whom great trusts may safely be imposed, and to the faithfulness of his character and entire freedom from questionable habits.\n\nCAPTAIN T.G. BALDWIN\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nCaptain T.G. Baldwin, the subject of this sketch, is one of the younger shipmasters of the Great Lakes, one who has already evinced a fitness and adaptability for the responsible work, a fact due to his tastes for the life, and to the study necessary to the thorough mastery of the duties connected with navigation. His father was one of the most successful and best known captains of the lakes, and emulation may have been an incentive in the rise of the young captain. During the past season he has been master of the J.C. Ford, of the Vandalia line, under charter of the Graham & Morton line.\n\nThe grandfather of Captain Baldwin was Thomas Baldwin, a Yorkshire Englishman, who, early in the present century, migrated to America and settled on the west banks of Lake Chautauqua, Chautauqua, Co., N.Y., and who later in life removed to Michigan, locating near Birmingham, where he engaged in farming (his life pursuit), and where he remained through life. He was a sturdy character, of firm principles and sterling traits. He reared the following family of children: Stephen, now a millionaire of Detroit, Mich.; James, a farmer; George, father of our subject; Cooper, a Michigan farmer; William, also a farmer of Michigan; Charles, a traveling man; Anna, Mary and Sarah.\n\nCapt. George Baldwin, the father of our subject, was born in Chautauqua county, N.Y., June 6, 1820, and when a boy moved with his parents to Michigan. He did not take kindly to the routine of agricultural life, and at the age of twelve or thirteen years he went to New York and shipped for a short time on a sailing vessel. He then entered the United States navy and shipped for a three-years' cruise around the world. His connection with the Great Lakes began about 1837, when he shipped around the lakes to Chicago and began sailing on schooners, passing the winters as pilot on the Mississippi river. During the year 1847 he engaged in the government survey of the Great Lakes, and it was about 1860 that Capt. George Baldwin began sailing steamers. He first became mate of the Ottawa, then went in like capacity onto the Allegheny, serving for four years, when he acted as her master for three years. In the year 1871 he brought out the City of Traverse, at that time the finest passenger steamer on the lakes and owned by the Hanna Lay Lumber Company, of Traverse City. Captain Baldwin remained in command of the City of Traverse until 1885, when he retired from the lakes. It was during November of that year that his wife and life companion passed away. She was, at the time of their marriage, a Miss Margaret Corbett, of Manitowoc county, and the children born to this union were Capt. T.G.; Omar, deceased; Charles and Lillie. Capt. George Baldwin died February 7, 1891, and with his departure from life there passed away one of the most efficient and best known lake shipmasters of his day. For about a half century he had sailed the lakes, and the conditions of his life had developed in him a strong and interesting character. He lived in Chicago until 1881, when he bought a fruit farm near Traverse City, and there in comfort and comparative retirement he passed the remainder of his life.\n\nCapt. T.G. Baldwin, son of the preceding was born in Chicago, August 2, 1856. He was educated in the public schools of the city, graduating from the Foster school in 1870. His education was supplemented by a commercial course in St. Ignatius College. Since his boyhood days Captain Baldwin has been a close and discriminating reader of current liter-ature and news, and is known as a well-informed man. His career on the lakes dates from 1870, when, as a lad of fourteen, he shipped on the G.J. Truesdell as porter. The next season he went with his father on the City of Traverse, and remained on that vessel for many years in various positions, from watchman to mate, and it was while acting as second mate of this boat that he passed his examination and was made first mate; and the following season was granted a master's certificate. In 1885 he succeeded his father as master of the City of Traverse, continuing in command until the vessel was sold, June 19, 1887. The balance of the season he was mate of the Gill.\n\nIn 1888 he brought out the Petoskey, of the Seymour Transportation Company, and ran her for one season. The season of 1889 he began as wheelsman on the Jay Gould, on Lake Superior. After three trips he was appointed second mate of the City of Duluth, and after one trip was made mate, serving the balance of the season. The following two years Captain Baldwin conducted a meat market business at Traverse City, but in 1892 he returned to the lakes as mate of the Lawrence. In July of that year he went onto the City of Charlevoix as mate for the balance of the season, and in 1893 went as mate of the City of Traverse, the boat on which he spent about twenty-two years, and ran as such for five years. In the spring of 1898 Captain Baldwin was appointed master of the J.C. Ford, of the Vandalia line, under charter by Graham & Morton, which vessel he commanded through the past season.\n\nCaptain Baldwin was married to Miss Ella Meaney, of Chicago, and has one daughter, Lillian G. He is a charter member of the F.& A.M., of Traverse City. In his work on the lakes he has been quite successful. Though comparatively young in years he is possessed of the same admirable and sturdy qualities which gave to his father such marked eminence among lake mariners of a generation ago.\n\nHORATIO F. BANGS\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nHoratio F. Bangs is the only son of Horatio E. and Susan (Flagg) Bangs, natives of the State of Ohio. The father, who died about ten years ago, was formerly a prominent and wealthy grain merchant of Toledo, Ohio. There is also a daughter named Sarah.\n\nHoratio F. Bangs was born at Toledo, October 13, 1873, and attended the public school of that place until 1887; the following year he took the finishing course at the Toledo Business College, then began tugging, firing for three years on various tugs about Chicago, after which he commenced steamboating, oiling on the Owego for one season. He fitted her out next spring, and shipped on the Yuma, on which he was oiler for two months, the balance of the season serving on the Marina. In 1893 he filled a like position on the Arthur L. Orr for seven months, and after she was laid up finished the season on the Thomas W. Palmer. He received his first issue of license in 1894, and was appointed second engineer on the Lewiston, putting in that season on her, and the following ones on the Elphenmere, and John Pridgeon, Jr. For the season of 1897 he was second engineer to Al Stewart, of the Northern Queen. Mr. Bangs holds three issues of license. Socially, he is a member of Local Harbor No. 1, M. E. B. A., is unmarried and makes his home at No. 168 Glenwood Avenue, in Buffalo, New York.\n\nCAPTAIN G. C. BARNES\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nCaptain G.C. Barnes, of Cleveland, Ohio, is a native of Belmont, Ohio, born in 1839, and on the paternal side is of English descent, and on the maternal side of Scotch extraction. The town of Barnesville was named after his grand-father, who settled there in 1800. Mr. Barnes is a representative man of Cleveland, and is of fine physique and six feet two inches in height. He has served one term in the city council, and while an incumbent was appointed on several important standing committees. He is a business man of untiring energy and enterprise, together with manifest integrity and fair dealing.\n\nMr. Barnes came to Cleveland in January, 1875, and acted as the agent of the Aetna Grate Company for fifteen years, with an office with the Globe Iron Works Company. He then organized the Chase Machine Company, of which he became president and treasurer. He enlisted in the Second West Virginia Cavalry, Company C, August 12, 1861, taking an honorable part in all the battles and skirmishes of that famous regiment, and was discharged June 27, 1865. He is active in Grand Army interests, and has served as commander of Memorial Post, and is now a memeber of Army and Navy Post. He is also a Knight Templar Mason.\n\nIn 1875 Mr. Barnes was married to Miss Kate Fox, of Allegheny, Penn., and has one son.\n\nWILLIAM C. BARR\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nWilliam C. Barr, the engineer for the Public Lighting Company, Detroit, is the son of A. F. and Sarah (Smith) Barr, and was born August 16, 1854, at Detroit. His father, who was a native of Pennsylvania, died at Ypsilanti, Mich., in 1860; he was a physician all his life.\n\nWilliam Barr spent the first two years of his life at his native place and then removed with his family to Port Huron, where he attended school until he reached his sixteenth year. In 1872 he went sailing, and for a number of years following devoted the greater part of his time to marine work. He first shipped on the propeller Montana, out of Buffalo, on which he remained one year, as oiler, and he then served two years as second engineer in the W.L. Wetmore and Sparta, transferring to the Lady Franklin as chief in 1876. For three years following he acted as chief on the John Owen, and he also held that position on the Iron Age, Iron Duke, S. J. Macy, Manistique, Gettysburg and Emily P. Weed. At the close of his service on this boat he abandoned sailing and embarked in the sand-dredging business under the name of the Detroit Sand & Gravel Co., in 1895 taking his present position with the Public Lighting Company.\n\nOn December 27, 1892, Mr. Barr was married to Miss Dorothea Luther, of Springfield. Ill. Fraternally he is a member of the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association No. 87, and of the Engineers and Mechanics Clubs.\n\nC. L. BARRON\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nC.L. Barron, Detroit, Mich., chief engineer of the steamer City of Milwaukee, was born on the Michigan side of the St. Clair river. His parents, Benjamin and Catharine (Yax) Barron, were French Canadian, the former a native of Montreal, and the latter born on the St. Clair river. The father was a blacksmith by occupation, and carried on that business at Marine City, formerly Newport, Mich., where he settled and raised his family, and at which place his death occurred in 1855. His wife died two years previous.\n\nOur subject passed his boyhood at Newport, where he received training in the common schools, and there learned the trade of a blacksmith with his father. At the age of twenty years he entered the machine shop of E.B. Ward, in Newport, where he remained three years and completed his trade. At about this time, Mr. Ward built and ran the largest line of boats on the lakes. Newport being then headquarters for steamboats, and at this point he established large repairing and erecting shops. In 1855, on leaving these shops, young Barron sailed on the steamer Huron as second engineer, his first experience in steamboating. The Huron was the property of Mr. Ward, and ran between Detroit and Saginaw. The following season (1856) he took charge of the steamer Samuel Ward as chief engineer, and was with her two years, running the same route. The three seasons following he was on the steamer Ruby between Detroit and Lexington, and then for eight years he was with the steamer Susan Ward, owned by E. Ward & Strachan, of Detroit, which was in the trade between Detroit, Saginaw and Toledo. He was then on the propeller Annie L. Craig for four seasons, which ran between Buffalo and Chicago. >From the Annie L. Craig he went to the steamer Dove, which ran between Detroit and Amherstburg, and remained on her three years. After this he took charge of Capt. Darius Cole's line of steamers - the Alpena and Green Bay City, plying between Bay City and Alpena. He remained with Captain Cole six years. For a period of ten years following he was in the employ of John P. Clark as chief engineer on the steamer Pearl, which plied between Put-in-Bay and Cleveland. From the Pearl he went into the service of the D. & M. R. R. line, taking charge of the City of Milwaukee, and has been with her for the past ten years, it being understood that when the boat was leased to the Graham & Morton Transportation Co., that the engineer and captain were to go with her.\n\nIn 1891 he moved from Detroit to Grand Haven, where he remained till 1896, when he removed to Benton Harbor, still remaining in charge of the steamer City of Milwaukee, running between Benton Harbor and Chicago in the interests of the Graham & Morton line.\n\nDuring the year of 1854 Mr. Barron was married to Miss Clarissa, daughter of William C. and Catherine (Droulard) Crampton, the former a native of Vermont and the latter of Canada, and to this marriage were born the following children: William, Charles, James, Kate, Carrie and Ella, all of whom are living. The mother of these children died September 2, 1893, and in September 1895, he married his second wife, Mrs. Mary O'Dell, of Detroit, born in that city of Irish descent, and on December 9, 1897, a son named Robert was born to them.\n\nOur subject is now in his forty-second year of service of sailing on the lakes, during which time he has encountered many storms, but met with no serious accidents. He also possesses forty issues of license as marine engineer, the last one being for five years. He is hale and hearty, and to all appearances is good for many years more of active life.\n\nSocially, he is a member of Star Lodge No. 13, of Detroit, A.O.U.W.; of Crescent Lodge (sick benefit) of the same city; of the National Dotare of Grand Haven, and the M.E.B.A., No. 3, of Detroit. In politics he is a Republican. He resides at No. 122 Church street, Benton Harbor, Michigan.\n\nCAPTAIN JOHN BARROW\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nCaptain John Barrow has had an eventful career both on the Great Lakes, and on shore since retiring from seafaring life. He was born in Cleveland in 1836, his father being Capt. Richard Barrow, and at the age of fourteen he went on the lakes as cook of the schooner Mary, which was commanded by his father, remaining on that vessel for two years. His next employment was as porter on the Telegraph, and later he served as wheelsman on that vessel until 1857. He began the season of 1859 with his father on the schooner Union, but left that boat in July of that year and shipped in the North Star. The following spring he again shipped on the Union, and there remained until she was sold in August, 1864, when he secured a berth on the yacht Octava, Captain Goulder in charge, to New York, arriving there in January, 1865, and returning home by train. He then purchased the schooner Eagle, which he sailed during the seasons of 1865 and 1866, and the following year was mate of the Mountain Maid for a short time, but on August 7, 1867, retired from the lakes to become a member of the Cleveland police force, with which he was connected for the long period of twenty-eight years, resigning in July, 1895. For the last thirteen years he had served as lieutenant, and, as he was always prompt and faithful in the discharge of his duties, he proved a popular officer.\n\nIn 1860 Captain Barrow married Miss Katherine Hartman, of Columbus, Ohio, who died in 1889, and five years later he wedded Miss Margaret Mapes, of Detroit, by whom he has a daughter.\n\nCapt. Richard Barrow, father of our subject, was born in 1800, in Kent, England, and sailed on the English Channel for a number of years previous to coming to the United States in 1831. He was married in 1818 to Miss Mary Slatter, of England, by whom he had seven children: George, Richard, Ann, Sarah, Joseph, Thomas, and John. In 1836, with his son Richard, he purchased the sloop Wave, and the following year commenced trading with the fishermen and Indians on Lake Huron. In 1842 he bought the Friendship, sailing a part of the time as a packet boat, and later he purchased the sloop Emma, which he also ran as a packet boat until the fall of 1848, when he built the schooner Mary, running it for several years on the Cleveland-Port Stanley route. Selling the Mary in 1852, he purchased the steamer Telegraph in Detroit, which he sailed until August 2, 1858, when she collided with the schooner Marquette, and sank forty miles off Cleveland. In the spring of 1859 he built the schooner Union, sailing her until his death, in June, 1861.\n\nFRED B. BARROWS\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nFred B. Barrows, one of the prominent marine engineers of Duluth, and a descendent of old New England stock, learned the machinist's trade in the employ of the Minnesota Iron Company, at Minneapolis, in which city he also acquired his public-school education. His parents, Daniel and Armenia (Luce) Barrows, removed to that locality in 1857, from Stowe, Vt., where Fred B. was born in 1851. Mr. Barrows is an engineer of unusual attainments, and in addition to his marine work has had a wide experience with the intricate machinery of some of the largest flouring-mills in and about Duluth and Superior. His ancestors came to the American colonies in the year 1636 first locating near Boston, Mass., after some years removing to New Hampshire, where the grandfather raised a family, some of his sons going to Vermont, among whom was Daniel, the father of Fred B. The great-great-grandfather was a staff officer during the Revolutionary War.\n\nThe first marine berth that Mr. Barrows held was in 1866, on the steamer St. Anthony Falls, a side-wheeler plying on the upper Minnesota River, between Mankato and St. Paul. On leaving this boat he became engineer in a sawmill, at Hinckley, Minn., on the St. Paul & Duluth railroad, the first mill in that locality, and remained there until the spring of 1880, when he was appointed engineer of the tug Siskiwitt, which berth he retained three years. The Siskiwitt carried the United States mails and supplies to the north shore ports of Lake Superior, and was out in the great storm of September 16, 1881, which registered great loss of life and property. She tried to find refuge at Sucker Bay but could not make that port, and was also compelled to run by Two Harbors, hence headed for Duluth. When she got opposite the entrance of the harbor the huge combers took her and carried her up onto the south pier where she rolled over on her beams end and dropped back into the canal, but the next sea picked her up; she righted and steamed safely inside without loss of life, the credit attaching to engineer Barrows who stood by the throttle although threatened with instant death, an evidence of presence of mind in a time of peril. He was chief of this boat three seasons, and was then transferred to the tug Eliza Williams, where he remained until July, 1883, when he took charge of the dock machinery of the Ohio Coal Company, in Duluth.\n\nDuring the seasons of 1884-85 Mr. Barrows was chief engineer of the passenger steamer Isle Royal, plying between Duluth and Port Arthur. This steamer sprung a leak off Isle Royal in July, 1885, and sunk, and the engineer finished the season in the tug Mollie Spencer. The next season he fitted out the steamer R. G. Stewart, but did not go in her, as he took charge of the Ohio Coal Company's machinery on the dock in Duluth, where he remained three years. In 1889 he became chief engineer of the Imperial mills, and two years later was engaged as traveling salesman of the Vaccum Oil Company until November, when he was appointed chief engineer of the tug Keystone, of Ashland, Wis., staying with her two seasons, and after one season in the yacht Nautilus, he accepted engineer's berth in the \"Spalding Hotel.\" In 1896 he entered the employ of the Crane-Ordway Company, dealers in mill supplies, as salesman, and when that concern discontinued business he went to work in the machine shop of the National Iron Works until the next spring, when he ran the tug Tomlinson for Barry Bros., after a short time transferring to the employ of Williams & Co., as engineer of the tug Ella G. Stone, and working in the National Iron Works again that winter. In the spring of 1898 Mr. Barrows was appointed chief engineer of the passenger steamer Bon Voyage, plying between Duluth and Portage Lake, a position he now holds. He has fifteen issues of marine engineer's license, but did not keep his numbers up while working ashore. Socially, he is a Master Mason of good report.\n\nMr. Barrows was united by marriage to Miss Margaret, daughter of Matthew Siefner, of Houghton, Mich. The children born to this union are: Fred E., now second engineer with his father on the steamer Bon Voyage, and who commenced his lakefaring life as fireman on the yacht Nautilus, advanced to the position of second engineer in the steamer Shenandoah, served a season in the tug Zenith, and, in 1897, was engineer of the tug Industry; Frank S., Ella A., Florence M. and Grace M. The family homestead is situated at No. 1128 East Third Street, Duluth, Minnesota.\n\nCAPTAIN JOHN L. BARTLETT\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nCaptain John L. Bartlett, whose lake-faring life dates back to 1851, takes rank among the oldest masters in active service on shipboard. He is a descendant of good old New England stock, and is therefore still full of vitality and energy, and his long experience makes him a valuable man in his present employ, especially as a Georgian Bay pilot. He was born at Clayton, N.Y., April 21, 1830, a son of Joseph and Charlotte (Farr) Bartlett. The father was born in Bennington, Vt., in 1782, and died near Forestville, Mich., in 1856, while the mother was a native of Chesterfield, Chester Co., N.H., and died in the town of Fine, St. Lawrence Co., N.Y., in 1847. The paternal grandfather was John Bartlett, a son of Josiah Bartlett, who was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. The grandmother was Mrs. Olive (Collard) Bartlett, a daughter of Joseph Collard, who was a petty officer in the British navy, and took an honorable part in the colonial English and French Wars.\n\nCaptain Bartlett acquired his education in the public schools of Clayton, N.Y., which he attended until he reached the age of fifteen years. He then went to Fine, St. Lawrence Co., N.Y., where he worked on a farm with his father until the death of his mother, at which time he was seventeen years old. It was in 1851 that he went to Clayton and shipped on the schooner Utica with Capt. James Borland, and after three months he joined the schooner G.S. Wickes as seaman. The next season he went before the mast on the schooner Patrick Henry with Capt. John Estes, and in 1853 on the schooner Montezuma. In the spring of 1854 he shipped on the schooner Marshfield, and closed the season on the bark Danube; began the season of 1885 on the Milwaukee Belle, and finished as master on the schooner Cambria. In 1856 he became mate of the brig S.C. Walbridge, going thence to Julia Smith as master in 1857, and remained on her till August of that year, when she was sold, then joined the schooner J.F. Tracy as mate, and during the season of 1858 accepted the same position on the schooner, Wm. H. Craig.\n\nThe season of 1859 found him serving as mate on the bark Sonora, and in 1860 began the season as mate on the schooner Rebecca, closing on the schooner Comely as master, and in 1861 filled a like position on the schooner Petrel; 1862 came out as second mate on the schooner Nightingale, but after making one trip was appointed master; master of bark Fame in 1863; 1864-65 also in command of the schooner Walrus; 1866 became mate of the schooner John Hibbard, laying her up in the fall as master.\n\nIn the spring of 1867 Captain Bartlett took out master's papers, which were unlimited, and came out in command of the new steamer Henry Howard. In the spring of 1868 he was appointed master of the schooner Home, and sailed her three seasons; 1871 went as mate on the schooner Kate Richmond; 1872 was mate on the bark Wells Burt, and the following seasons filled a like position on the vessels named: 1873, Grace Murray; 1874, Narraganssett; 1875, L.W. Perry; 1876, E.C. Roberts; 1877, steambarge H.C. Schnoor, and in September of that season became master of the schooner Sasco; 1878 acted as mate on the schooner Frank Perew, and in 1879 was in the same capacity on the schooner Carlingford. During 1880 went on the Melvina in the same position, and remained as such till July, 1881, when he became her master for the balance of the season. During the season of 1882 officiated as mate on the Ira Lafrinier and the tug Peter Smith, remaining on the latter boat and in the same position till July, 1883, when he went as mate of the tug Kate Winslow; and in 1884-85 served in like capacity on the William Goodnow; 1886 joined the schooner M.F. Merrick as her mate, and finished the season on the tug Ella M. Smith. The season of 1887 found him mate of the Niagara, and that of 1888 master on the same vessel, going, in 1889, again as mate of the Peter Smith, after which he filled the same position on the Ella M. Smith for the remainder of the season of 1889, and again joined her in 1890. The next two seasons he was mate on the Peter Smith, and in 1893 was transferred to the fine tug Sweepstakes as master. This was followed by two seasons on the Lake tug Niagara as mate. In the spring of 1896 he was appointed master of the Peter Smith, and continued to sail her up to 1898, thus rounding out a period of forty-seven years without losing a season ashore. Captain Bartlett possesses the happy faculty of never getting into trouble with his boats, thereby winning the confidence and esteem of the owners.\n\nSocially, he is a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and the Royal Arcanum. On December 14, 1856, Captain Bartlett wedded Miss Amelia E., daughter of Harvey J. Brown, who was a son of Major Brown of Revolutionary fame, noted for his patriotic quarrel with Benedict Arnold, having accused the latter of attempting to sell the stronghold of West Point to Sir Guy Castleton, then in command of the British fleet. The children born to this union are: Delos; Harvey C.; Rosella, now the wife of Frank Colborn, of Cripple Creek, Colo.; Estella M.; Schuyler; Omar D.; and Cora Bird, now wife of William Armor, also of Cripple Creek. Mrs. Bartlett died on March 20, 1889, and on December 4, 1897, the Captain chose for his second wife Zuba Kendall, daughter of Solomon Gotham, of Clayton, N.Y. The family residence is in Clayton, New York.\n\nPETER D. BAULD\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nPeter D. Bauld, chief engineer of the Morrison estate, Chicago, sailed for several years upon the lakes, and is a worthy representative of a family which has been prominently connected with marine affairs. He was born in Chicago, in 1860, a son of David and Jennette (Houston) Bauld, both natives of Scotland and early settlers of Marine City, Mich., where the father was for some time chief engineer of the Ward line of boats. After coming to Chicago in 1854, he was made superintendent of the Hanna, Lay & Co. line of boats, and superintended the construction of all their boats, including the Traverse City and Grand Rapids. He remained with them for the long period of twenty-eight years. He was an expert machinist, and well known all over the Great Lakes. He died in Chicago, in 1889, and his widow still resides in that city.\n\nThere our subject was reared and educated. During his boyhood he commenced his business career as oiler, and at the age of twelve years began serving an apprenticeship to the boiler making trade in the Rock Island railroad shops. In 1872 he commenced sailing out of Chicago as oiler on the City of Traverse, and remained on her some years, being made second engineer in 1875. She belonged to Hanna, Lay & Co., was engaged in lumber and passenger trade, and made Buffalo and nearly all important lake ports. On leaving her in 1878, Mr. Bauld was made second engineer on the City of Grand Rapids, which was engaged in the passenger trade, and in 1881 became chief engineer of the T.S. Faxon, a fast passenger boat, which is still in commission and is now running on the Great Lakes. Later he was chief engineer on the John A. Otis, engaged in the iron trade between Chicago and Escanaba, Mich. As second engineer he was then in the employ of the Union Steamboat Company, and was first assistant on the Avon and later on the Starrucca, engaged in the freight trade between Chicago, Buffalo and Detroit. She is a very large boat, and is still in commission. For the following season Mr. Bauld was chief engineer of the City of Traverse, but in 1887 he quit the lakes and accepted a position of engineer for the Western Electric Company for one year. He was then assistant engineer for the city hall for the same length of time, and remaining in the employ of the city he had charge of the Jackson street bridge for a time, and was engineer of the Holden school building one year. The following year he was chief engineer of the Union League club, for a time was assistant engineer of the Royal Insurance building; and for six years was chief of the Commercial National Bank building. His next position was as superintendent of the Van Buren street bridge, but for the past year and a half has been chief engineer of the Morrison estate. Socially he was at one time a member of the Marine Engineers Association, and is still widely and favorably known in marine circles.\n\nIn 1889, in Chicago, Mr. Bauld was united in marriage with Miss Anna Riewald, and they have one daughter, Dorothea.\n\nWILLIAM BAUMERT\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nWilliam Baumert is a native of Prussia, and was born in 1853 at Frankfort-on-the-Oder, son of Carl and Anna Rosina (Summer) Baumert. He attended school in the city of his birth, and at the age of fourteen began learning his trade with his father, who was a locksmith, working with him one year, and spending the succeeding three years at the same work, but in other employ. For the years following until 1872 he was engaged in the capacity of oiler on salt-water steamers of the old Red Star line, out of Antwerp to Philadelphia, after which he made up his mind to sail on the Great Lakes for a livelihood. He made a couple of trips as fireman on the steamer James Lord, but because of dull times returned to salt water and accepted the berth of fireman on an ocean steamer to Hamburg. Upon a visit to his native town he was drafted into the German army, in which he was compelled to serve three years, and from the close of his service to the spring of 1878 he migrated from place to place in the old countries, working at his trade. In 1878 he proceeded from Antwerp to Philadelphia, and thence to Pittsburg, where he worked at the locksmith and blacksmith trades until he was taken ill, being compelled to abandon labor for about five months. In 1879 he went to Cleveland and shipped as fireman on the steamer Roanoke, of the Commercial line, from which he transferred to the James Lord, under Capt. M.M. Drake, closing the season on her. For the ensuing ten years he was variously employed, both on the lakes and in machine shops, and in 1890 he began to sail the lakes steadily, during that season serving as oiler on the steamer Brazil. He was oiler on the Susquehanna the early part of the season of 1891, and closed it as second engineer of the Owego. In 1892 he was second engineer of the old Belle Cross until June, when he became chief engineer of the private steamyacht Alcyone, owned by Henry Bulge, of Minneapolis, which he laid up at Chicago. In 1893 Mr. Baumert fitted out the Alcyone and operated her until June, when he went to Buffalo and entered the employ of the Western Transportation Company as second engineer of the Montana, laying her up at Buffalo at the close of the season. He retained his berth in the Montana until June, 1895, when he was taken ill and compelled to leave, for the rest of that season finding employment on shore as a steam-fitter. At the opening of the season of 1896 he was engaged as second engineer of the steamer J. H. Shrigley, remaining on her until June, from which time until the close of navigation he was on the W. B. Morley, which was laid up at Milwaukee. He is a member of the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association. In 1892 Mr. Baumert was married at Chicago to Mrs. Bertha Trenner, who had one child by her first husband, named Nicholas. They reside at No. 23 Cypress street, Buffalo, New York.\n\nJAMES W. BEACH\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nJames W. Beach when a lad possessed great bravery and manliness, and at the age of ten years drove a team of horses from Geneseo, N. Y., to Hall's Corners, Mich. He was born at the former place April 5, 1821, and is the son of Samuel Beach, a farmer, who left the family some time afterward and went to Michigan.\n\nHere he purchased land and built a log-cabin upon it, after this going back to the family in New York State for a short time. He soon left, however, and blazed the trees as a guide for the sharp eyes of his son, who was to conduct the family to the place which he had prepared for them. This was accomplished, and they duly arrived with all the necessary household effects. Soon after their advent, another family, that of John Marvin, from the same town in New York, arrived and made their home with them in the cabin which had been prepared by Mr. Beach, and in this place Azubah B. Marvin and James Beach passed their childhood and youth, and on March 9, 1843, were united in marriage, forming a closer tie between companions from infancy. They remained here till 1850, when Mr. Beach came to Cleveland, and found employment in the Cuyahoga Works, now the firm of Bassett, Presley & Train, he having learned the machinist's trade in Coldwater, Mich. He remained in Cleveland a year, and was then joined by his wife. Later on he connected himself with the Union Steamboat Company, of Buffalo, being in their employ for over twenty years, some of which time was spent as chief engineer on the lakes; but in 1868 remained on shore as chief engineer of the line. During his career as marine engineer he was on the Wabash, Genesee, Jersey City, New York and other vessels.\n\nMr. Beach was the father of five children: (1) Harriet I., born September 24, 1845, died in August, 1847; (2) Ellen M., born August 28, 1848, died in the fall of 1859; (3) George N., born September 3, 1851, died in July, 1852; (4) Florence A., born October 19, 1854, married Albert C. Berger, April 25, 1878, and is the mother of four children - William B., deceased; Grace, Raymond and Abigail; and (5) Oscar M., born December 19, 1862, a marine engineer, filling the position of chief on the Vulcan and Wallace, having served an apprenticeship under his father. During the American-Spanish war he was employed as machinist on the torpedo boat Dupont, which carried to the battleship Maine the message ordering her to Havana, and later on was active in the Havana blockade. At the close of the war he was engaged on the torpedo boat Rogers, belonging to the United States navy. He is married and lives at the old home in Cleveland.\n\nMrs. Beach died January 25, 1895, and was preceded twelve years by the death of her husband, which occurred may 18, 1883. Up to the last he had charge of the business at Buffalo, having visited the office on the day of his death. He was practically what is termed a self-made man; was a fine scholar, and an accurate mathematician, though he never attended school after he was ten years of age.\n\nOSCAR M. BEACH\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nOscar M. Beach, who for a number of years was connected with marine service in various capacities, is one of Cleveland's native sons, his birth having occurred in that city in the year 1862. In his youth he served an apprenticeship at the machinist's trade in the King Iron Works, in Buffalo, N. Y., and thoroughly mastered the business in all its details. His first service on the lakes was in 1883, when he accepted a position as assistant engineer. His first appointment as chief engineer was on the propeller John C. Gault, of the Wabash line, plying between Toledo, Ohio and Buffalo, N. Y. He remained on that vessel for five years, and on the expiration of that period was appointed to the position of chief engineer on the Robert Wallace, where he remained until the Vulcan was built, she being owned by the same company.\n\nIn the winter of 1891 Mr. Beach entered upon a different field of labor, establishing a machine shop in Fairport, Ohio, and engaging in marine repair work and in dealing in engine supplies. For two years he carried on that enterprise and then returned to the lakes, accepting a position as chief engineer on the steamer Alexander Nimick, which position he filled for two years. From that time until April, 1896, he conducted a meat market in Cleveland, and was connected with other business interests of the city. Since September, 1897, he has been in the United States navy. He enlisted (for three years) as first-class machinist, and was assigned to the torpedo boat Dupont. On July 1, 1898, he was promoted to chief machinist on the torpedo boat Rodgers, where he is at present.\n\nCHARLES BEATTY\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nCharles Beatty, one of the prominent marine engineers who have sailed out the port of Buffalo in past years, but now lives retired from active duties in that line, was born of Scotch-Irish descent in Londonderry, Ireland, March 15, 1837, a son of Richard Beatty, a mason and contractor, and his wife, Margaret (Doty) Beatty. His education was acquired at the public schools in Ireland and also in the United States at Milwaukee, Buffalo, etc., in the winter seasons.\n\nMr. Beatty came to the United States early in the fifties, and made his home in Philadelphia, where he had kinsmen. Being a lad of adventurous nature he shipped out of Philadelphia on one of the steamers of the Sanford Independent Steamboat line, plying between that port and New York, also between Portland, Bangor, Boston and Norfolk, and remained in that employ four years, working his way up to the position of second engineer; he sailed on the Kennebec, Delaware, Mineman, Sanford and Cape May. In the spring of 1857 he went to Cleveland, and was appointed engineer of the tug George H. Notter, which he took to Milwaukee in the employ of Elias and Thomas Simms, on contract work.\n\nWhile in the employ of the Simms Brothers he did considerable wrecking with their large wrecking tug, and also did towing with her in the summer of 1860. During the winter he found employment on the railroad ferry boats between Milwaukee, Wis., and Grand Haven, Mich., as engineer. He then went to Buffalo and entered the employ of the Pease Passenger line, between Buffalo and Chicago, as second engineer during the seasons of 1862-63-64 on the Winona, Idaho and Galena. In the spring of 1865 he went as second engineer on the steamer Pacific and remained with her one season, the fall of that year purchasing a half-interest in the tug Mixer, which he engineered in Buffalo harbor two seasons and then sold. He then took the steambarge Oakland four months, finishing the season as chief engineer of the passenger steamer Atlantic. In 1868 he bought a half-interest in the tug C.W. Jones, which he ran himself in Buffalo harbor, and after selling her he built and was half owner of a new one, to which he gave the same name, C.W. Jones; he also bought an interest in the tug Compound. About this time he owned and operated the Mary E. Pearce. After running the new tug Jones one year he sold his interest and there engineered the Compound for five seasons, after which he built the tug Thomas Wilson, named for Capt. Thomas Wilson, of Cleveland, who had been Mr. Beatty's playmate in boyhood and lifelong friend. In 1892 he sold his other tug property and built the tug Townsend Davis. In 1892 while this tug was operating out of Buffalo harbor he made a visit to his old home, and spent three month very pleasantly in England, Ireland and Scotland.\n\nMr. Beatty has been quite prosperous in his marine ventures, and by the exercise of good judgment and industry during his younger years has acquired considerable property. He has held money in interest in the Hand & Johnson Tug line in Buffalo for over thirty years, and in the Wilson Transit line in Cleveland for ten or twelve years. He also holds a good block of stock in a brickyard, operating in Lancaster, N.Y., with an office in Buffalo. Mr. Beatty is treasurer of this company. During his active marine life he never had trouble with his machinery, owing, no doubt, to his thorough knowledge of the marine engine, and it is gratifying to him to know that he has never had a man injured on his boat. He is a member of the F. & A.M., DeMolay Lodge, of Buffalo.\n\nRICHARD BEAUBIEN\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nRichard Beaubien (deceased), who in his lifetime was one of the leading ice and coal dealers of Detroit, was born in that city in 1821, and for years was a marine surveyor. He owned a large dockage along the river, and for many years was in the tug business with Anthime Moisan, under the firm name of the Beaubien Tug Company. The firm name remains unchanged, as, since the death of Mr. Beaubien, his widow has continued to hold his interest and to take an active part in its management. The firm known as the Beaubien Ice Company now has for its president Mrs. Beaubien; S.P. O'Brien, vice-president, and John R. Long, secretary, and under the wise control of these parties does a large and lucrative business.\n\nIn 1866 Mr. Beaubien was united in marriage with Miss Frances S. Coquillard, of South Bend, Ind., and of this union were born three children, one of whom is now deceased. Those living are: (1) Josephine, wife of S.P. O'Brien, vice-president of ice company, by whom she has three children - Maurice B., Richard B. and Henriette J. (2) Edna Blanche, wife of John R. Long, secretary of the ice company, by whom she has three children - Carlisle R., Beatricia Ellenor and John Cornelius.\n\nRichard Beaubien was a Democrat in his political faith, and in religious belief accepted the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. He passed to his last rest June 21, 1896, honored and respected by all.\n\nHENRY BECK\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nHenry Beck, the only surviving son of John O. and Eliza (Langman) Beck, was born October 20, 1859 at Elmore, Ohio, from which place he moved to Buffalo in 1864, and in the latter city obtained a common-school education while he was between seven and eleven years of age. He learned his trade at the respective machine shops of David Bell and the C. & B. Holmes Iron Works on Chicago Street.\n\nIn 1883 Mr. Beck began sailing the lakes as greaser in the steamer Philadelphia, remaining in that capacity one season, and for the two successive seasons - 1884-85 -was engineer of the same steamer. In 1886 he purchased the tug Lone Star at Ithaca, N. Y., and after bringing her to Buffalo harbor sold a half-interest in her to Capt. John Owens; she has been used as a harbor tug steadily for ten successive seasons, during which period Mr. Beck has been her engineer. He and Captain Owen also own a half-interest in the tugs Trenton and E. E. Frost. For the seasons of 1897-98 he has been engineer of the tug Trenton, one of these boats. He is a member of the Canal-boat Owners Association of New York City.\n\nOur subject was married, in 1895, at Buffalo, to Miss Nellie O'Neil. They reside at No. 26 W. Ferry Street, Buffalo, New York. Mr. Beck has been one of the successful men of Buffalo harbor.\n\nWILLIAM G. BECKBISSINGER\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nWilliam G. Beckbissinger is a native of Germany, having been born at Wurtemburg, October 16, 1867. His parents are George A. and Annie M. (Scholl) Beckbissinger, also of that place, where the father is in the milling business. Our subject has four brothers and two sisters, of whom John A. is a florist of Lansing, Mich.; another brother is in the postal service at Stuttgart, Germany; one is in the milling business; and the other is employed in a paper mill in the old country.\n\nWilliam G. Beckbissinger attended school and assisted his father in his native city until fourteen years of age, when he secured employment as oiler in a paper mill. He remained there two years, at the end of which time, believing that advancement in any profession was more rapid in America, he emigrated to these shores. This was in 1884. For the first six years he worked in machine shops, and in 1890 took to steamboating, starting on the Iron King as oiler, in which capacity he served three seasons. In 1893 he received his first issue of license, as second engineer, and shipped on the Wyandotte for that season. In 1894-95 he was second on the W. R. Stafford, and in 1896 went onto the John Oades as second, remaining on her until August 14, when he went as second to George Lawrence on the Appomattox, which they brought out new. He has continued on her ever since.\n\nMr. Beckbissinger was married at Detroit, Mich., in 1895, to Miss Fredericka Leucht, of Wurtemberg, Germany, and one child has blessed their union. The family residence is at No. 94 Lafferty street, Detroit, Mich. Mr. Beckbissinger is a member of the M. E. B. A. No. 3, of Detroit, and also of Detroit Lodge No. 6, A. O. U. W.\n\nCAPTAIN DANIEL M. BECKER\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nCaptain Daniel M. Becker (deceased) was a representative of a family which came from Holland and located in New York State soon after Hendrick Hudson made his discoveries. The Dutch name was Van Becker, but it was gradually changed to Becker by American use and brevity. With a party of their relatives the family located on a farm on the coast in New York, which place is now owned and occupied by Frederick Becker, a brother of our subject. Captain Becker was born April 22, 1834, in Charleston, N. Y., but shortly after his birth the family removed to Three Mile Bay, where he attended the common schools. At an early age he and three of his brothers - Calvin, William and Hiram - went upon the lakes, being the first of the family to embrace a maritime life, and all became owners of vessels or captains, sailing for many years. Hiram died in Chicago in 1892. Daniel Becker left home at the age of sixteen and first sailed as mate on the Minnehaha. He was later on several different schooners, and had command of the Florida, Bahama, Thomas Mott, Brightie, Negaunee and Ahira Cobb. From the last named he went to the Everett, of which he was captain up to the week before his death, which occurred at Milwaukee, in December, 1890. He had made his home in Cleveland since 1875, and from 1874 until 1884, was a ship broker and a member of the Board of Trade in that city. During all these years he commanded vessels not a man on board was ever lost. He was a highly respected citizen of Cleveland, and a prominent member of the Ship Masters Association and of the Masonic Order.\n\nOn December 25, 1857, Captain Becker was united in marriage to Miss Mary Kelley, a young lady of Irish ancestry, whose father, Michael Kelley, was a pilot on salt water and spent the latter part of his life in Chicago. The Captain and his wife became the parents of six children, namely: Minnie, now the widow of Webster Roberts, who died in 1887; William H. of Cleveland, who married Mamie Gibson and is a member of the firm of J.H. Outhwaite & Co.; Zuleika, who died in 1884; Calvin, who died in infancy; Calvin, who married Nora Creegan, and resides in Cleveland, and Daniel, Jr., deceased.\n\nG. W. BEERS\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nG.W. Beers, the well known master mechanic of the Packing & Provision Co., at the stock yards, Chicago, was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1859, a son of David A. and Kate (Conley) Beers, the former a native of Painesville, Ohio, the latter of New York. The father was reared in Ohio and for some years engaged in sailing out of Cleveland as chief engineer for the Northern Transportation Company. During the Civil War, he enlisted in the navy, and after the war he was chief engineer of the Commodore Perry. His entire life was spent in sailing or in working in machine shops. Both he and his wife died in Cleveland, honored and respected by all who knew them. The schools of Cleveland afforded our subject his educational privileges, and after laying aside his text books, he served his apprenticeship to the machinist's trade at the Cuyahoga works. In 1878 he sailed from Cleveland as second engineer on the old G. N. Brady, remaining on her for one season, and from that time until 1897, he was either on the lakes or connected with shipbuilding. For one season he was oiler on the City of Detroit, a passenger boat, after which he worked in the machine shops for three years, and next went as second engineer on the steamer Atlantic, finishing the season, however, with the Union Dry Dock Company, Buffalo where he fitted out the revenue cutter, William P. Fessenden. He remained with them until the H. J. Jewett was completed, after which he was employed as her second engineer for one season. The following season he came out as engineer as on the tug Protection, of Chicago, and later was on the revenue cutter, William P. Fessenden. The following winter he worked for Hodge & Co., engine builders of Detroit, and then became second engineer of the steamer Pearl, for J. P. Clark, of Detroit, after which he was second engineer in the Anchor line. The next season he was with the Union Dry Dock Company, until the steamer Tioga came out, and on her shipped as second engineer for part of two seasons, spending his winters with the Union Dry Dock Company from 1885 to 1888. The steamer Chemung then came out, and on her he sailed as engineer for one season. He continued with his connection with the Union Dry Dock Company of Buffalo until 1890, when he was made master mechanic and chief engineer under Mr. Babcock of the South Chicago Shipbuilding Company. He was on the steamer Philadelphia, of the Anchor Line, in 1891, as engineer of the Arthur Orr, sailing out of Chicago in 1893, but returned to the Chicago Shipbuilding yards, where he was employed until in 1897 he accepted his present position as master mechanic of the Chicago Packing & Provision Co., at the stock yards. He has fitted out altogether over forty new boats and is a most thorough and competent marine engineer.\n\nIn 1886, in Buffalo, N. Y., Mr. Beers married Miss Katie Bradigan, a native of that city, and to them have been born five children: Frances, George A., Mary, Nellie and Katie.\n\nTHURMAN E. BEERS\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nThurman E. Beers was for several years connected with the lake marine, but for some time past he has been occupied on shore, being the present engineer at the Columbus street bridge, Cleveland. He was born in Peninsula, Summit Co., Ohio, September 29, 1867, a son of George W. Beers, a native of Painesville, Ohio, in which State he spent the greater part of his life, at present living on a farm near Independence. For some time the father owned and operated boats on the Ohio canal.\n\nLeaving his birthplace at the age of six years, Thurman E. Beers removed with his parents to Newburg, Ohio, and later to Independence township, Cuyahoga county, attending school at both places. He early felt a desire for marine life, which was gratified in 1884 when he went on the Charles Castle as fireman, but remained only a short time. He then became connected with the White Stack line of tugs, owned by Robert Greenhalgh. After a time as fireman in that employ, he remained on shore one season and then went again on the Charles Castle for one year. He was next fireman on the tug Paddy Murphy, and afterward spent two seasons on the Tom Maytham, finally becoming engineer.\n\nMr. Beers spent part of the next season on the tug Florence, of which he was part owner, and the remainder of the year with the V.O.T. Co., on the Tom Maytham. For about eighteen months he was employed on the H.L. Chamberlain, and on the Alva B., for about five months, both belonging to the V.O.T. Co. In August of the same year he went on the propeller H.B. Tuttle as second engineer, and was later promoted to chief, serving as such for one year, since which time he has remained on shore.\n\nOn December 16, 1890, Mr. Beers married Miss Kate Drew, of Cleveland. He is a member of the Knights of the Maccabees, and is the center of a large circle of friends and acquaintances.\n\nHARVEY C. BEESON\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nHarvey C. Beeson, son of Jacob and Elizabeth H. Beeson, was born in Niles, Mich., January 1, 1856. Mr. Beeson's father was one of the pioneers and prominent citizens of Niles, and was one of the men who drafted the first constitution for the State of Michigan; the family removed to Detroit in 1858, where he established a banking business.\n\nAt an early age young Harvey, after completing his studies in the public schools, entered the employ of Messrs. Robinson, Burtenshaw & Co., wholesale shoe dealers, for the purpose of learning the shoe business. Shortly after, or in 1876, he associated himself with his father and brother in the grain business, under the firm name of Jacob Beeson & Co. In 1881 he established the firm of H.C. Beeson & Co., produce and commission merchants, which he continued until 1885, when he was appointed deputy collector and marine clerk in the United States custom service. While in this position, early in 1887, he had called to his attention the desirability of a marine manual that would answer the many inquiries necessarily made by vessel men, generally in relation to marine documents, etc., and he at once set about the production of such a medium of information. His first publication was what is known as Beeson's Marine Directory, which was issued in the spring of 1888, in pocket form, and with no idea that there were any of the possibilities in it that have since developed. This publication, at the end of the third year, had obtained a prestige and circulation sufficient to warrant him in throwing up a position from which he realized $2,000 per year that he might devote his entire time and attention to the requirements of his manual. The work was published in Detroit in 1894, when he removed his office to Chicago in order that he might be in the center of a trade in which vessels and vessel men were more in evidence. As he had surmised, his location in Chicago called forth more strenuous and increased efforts on his part, and a very material enlargement of his work was the result. The last issue of the work is from Mr. Beeson's own plant, and judging from the typographical standpoint, it strikes one as being a work of art.\n\nIn 1878 Mr. Harvey C. Beeson was married to Miss Henrietta L. Bourke, of Detroit, to whom were born three children, Walter B., Harvey C. and Henrietta Louise. In May 1893, he was again married, his second union being with Miss Esther R., a twin daughter of the Hon. George S. Clapp, of Niles, Michigan.\n\nDAVID BELL\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nDavid Bell, one of the most prominent manufacturers and ship builders on the chain of lakes, was born December 7, 1817, at Amesfield, Dumfriesshire, a border county of Scotland, on the Solway Firth. In 1834 he was apprenticed to the millwright trade, of which he quickly acquired a practical knowledge. Afterward he visited England and there acquired additional experience and skill. Having a brother in St. John, N.B., he determined to come to America, and accordingly sailed for New York in the spring of 1841. During a portion of this time he was in the employ of the Boston Steam Engine Works, receiving $1.50 per day. In the fall of 1841 he visited his brother at St. John, and worked there in a machine shop about a year. In 1842, he removed to Buffalo, N.Y., and was at once engaged by the Buffalo Steam Engine Works, and shortly afterward went to Cleveland, Ohio, where he worked for the Cuyahoga Steam Engine Works for a while. Returning to Buffalo, he was soon employed in building the propeller Hercules, the first screw steamer to successfully sail the Great Lakes. In 1845, Mr. Bell formed the partnership with William McNish, under the firm name of Bell & McNish. From this time onward Mr. Bell, being at work for himself, instead of others, demonstrated his great ability as a skillful engine builder. What his firm lacked in capital they made up in knowledge and enterprise. They erected a small shop on the site of what is now Mr. Bell's foundry and machine shop, and there prosecuted their business to the best of their ability. One of the first engines built by this firm was the one put in the elevator built by Joseph Dart, which was the first in the world devoted to such a purpose. This engine gave such satisfaction that the same firm successfully built engines for the elevators Seymour and Wells, Evans, Stirling, Bugbee and others. The firm also constructed marine engines for a number of passenger steamers that were then rapidly taking their places on the lakes, and the same firm also built the \"handy tug engine,\" which enables tugs to pull a tonnage so largely disproportionate to their displacement.\n\nIn 1850 the copartnership between Mr. Bell and Mr. McNish dissolved, and Mr. Bell continued the business alone until 1854, when he rented his shop, sold his machinery and tools to the Buffalo Steam Engine Company, and became superintendent of that company at a salary of $2,500 per year. Soon after he resigned that position, and paid a visit to Scotland. Returning to Buffalo in 1855, he took possession of his old shop, and began again to build up a business in that city. Not long afterward, his shop having burned down, he erected a large building on the triangle bounded by Norton, Evans and Water streets. In 1858, Mr. Bell, having some time previously assisted in putting a steam engine in the Black Hawk, the first steamboat tried on the Erie canal, and which had a stern wheel like steamboats on the Mississippi river (and which proved a failure), built the steamtug and fleet of canal boats that made a triumphal voyage on the canal, which is celebrated in history as being an occasion of the finest illumination in Buffalo up to that time and for many years thereafter.\n\nIn 1861 Mr. Bell began to build the first iron propeller ever launched on the Great Lakes. This vessel was named the Merchant, was of 720 tons burden, and was built for J.C. & E.T. Evans. The new propeller was a success, notwithstanding numerous baleful predictions of failure that were made when she was on the stocks. Mr. Bell had the fullest confidence in her success from the first, and more vessels of the same kind followed the Merchant rapidly into the water.\n\nDuring the progress of the war of the Rebellion, Mr. Bell rendered powerful aid to the Government of the United States. His swift, handsome and powerful tugs were purchased by that government, and were of great use on the Atlantic waters. One of the tugs built by Mr. Bell was towing the Constitution when she was scuttled off Newport News, and it was also one of his tugs that carried the information to President Lincoln that led to the eventful destruction of the Merrimac.\n\nFollowing this is a complete list of the iron vessels built by Mr. Bell: The iron propeller Merchant, which was, as has been stated elsewhere, the first iron boat built on the lakes, in 1862. Then came the Glen Iris in 1863, the Dexter, in 1866; the Metropolitan, a police boat for New York, in 1867; the Philadelphia, the tug Eliza Williams, the Cayuga and the yacht Ariadne, all in 1868. In 1869, the side-wheel steamer Ivanhoe and the tug Nellie Cotton; in 1870, the tug Douglass and the yacht Mary Bell; in 1871, the revenue cutters Hamilton and the Gallatin; in 1873, the G.A. Boutwell; in 1875, the tug M.C. Carrington and the yacht Titania; in 1876, the yachts Rosaline and the G.W. Gardner, and the yacht Esperanza, for the Royal Canadian Yacht Club, of Toronto; in 1878, the steamer Arundel; in 1879, the yacht Flora and the yacht Vanderbilt; in 1880, the yacht Angelique; in 1881, the yacht built for E.L. Dow and for Mr. Wesson of Detroit, Uarda and the tug A.W. Cotton; in 1882, the tug Robert H. Cooke; in 1883, the yacht Waller; in 1884, the yacht Theseus; in 1886, the Sand Beach, a government dispatch boat; in 1887, the yacht Seneca Chief; in 1887, the fireboat City of Buffalo, now the George R. Potter; in 1888, the tug Phil Sheridan; in 1889, the Florence Rice; in 1890, the tug Spalpeen; in 1891, the tugs Keystone and Paddy Miles; in 1892, the yacht Neversink and the fireboat J.M. Hutchinson; in 1893, the revenue cutter Calumet; in 1894, the yacht William McKinley; in 1895, the tug Katherine T. Wilbur and the yacht Primrose; in 1896, the seamless steamyacht Sandusky and the yacht Alert. In addition to the above, Mr. Bell has built a large number of wooden boats, and also the first yacht for Lake Tahoe in the Rocky Mountains, to carry mail across the lakes in connection with the Union Pacific railroad. He also proposed a canal-boat for use of the Erie canal, when enlarged and deepened, which was to be 200 feet long, and 26 feet beam, and to draw, when loaded, 9 feet of water.\n\nMr. Bell was one of the organizers of the Mechanics Institute, which was formed in 1865, and incorporated in 1869. He was also one of the incorporators, and was unanimously elected its first president. It was largely owing to Mr. Bell's efforts that this institution held its first International Exhibition in Buffalo, in 1869, the result of the exhibition bearing abundant evidence of the soundness of his judgment and of his great executive ability. The receipts were more than $18,000, and, after all expenses were paid, there was more than $4,500 left on hand. Mr. Bell was re-elected to the presidency the next year, 1870.\n\nMr. Bell is a life member of the Young Men's Library Association, serving as its president one year, and has done much to aid it in its work. He is a member of the St. Andrew's Scottish Society and of the Scottish athletic organizations. He is a promoter of all healthy outdoor sports, and has been president of the Grand National Curling Club, and was pre-sented with a grand testimonial by the society as a token of their high appreciation of his services. He is also a life member of the Society of Natural Sciences. He was also made, in 1895, an honorary life member of the Buffalo Historical Society, to whom he presented a cannon captured by the Americans during the war of 1812, and which now stands in front of the Soldiers' Monument in Lafayette Park.\n\nIn May, 1897, Mr. Bell entered into a contract to build a steel tug for the Cleveland Tug Company. This tug is 90 feet long and 23 feet beam, and it is the largest tug on the lakes. Her boiler is a return tube marine, is 12 feet diameter and 16 feet long, and her engine is a fore-and-aft compound, slipper guide style, 20 inches and 40 inches by 30 inches. In 1865 Mr. Bell began to build locomotives, the first one he built being named the David Bell, after the builder. This was the first locomotive built in Buffalo, and its trial trip up to Dunkirk was the occasion of a great celebration. The entire number of engines built by Mr. Bell was eight. It will be seen, therefore, that he was a very successful inventor and builder. He built the first engine for an elevator in the world; the first iron propeller on the lakes; the first revenue cutter ever built at Buffalo, and also the first locomotive built at Buffalo. He is the inventor and patentee of a new style of steam hammer, which has proved to be very effective, and which in its different sizes is adopted to the ordinary blacksmith shop and to the largest forge shops.\n\nAn article written by David Bell in May, 1876, with reference to the comparative values of wood and iron in the construction of vessels is of great interest to vessel men, as it conclusively demonstrates the superiority of iron, and the great advantages derived by the use of iron in their construction. This article gives a brief history of the iron steamer Merchant. When completed in 1862 she was valued at $90,000. She was lengthened in 1872, her value thereby being increased to $120,000. At that time, after ten years of service, her iron work was in as good condition as when she was built. In 1875 she struck on Racine reef, and sunk, becoming a total loss, because the season was so far advanced that it was useless to attempt to raise her. From 1862 to 1875, inclusive, she made 2,041-1\/2 trips, and during that period she paid to the underwriters for insurance on hull and eastbound freight, $154,535.80, and the total amount received for insurance during the period was $143,913.35, leaving a profit to the underwriters of $10,622.55. During the career of the Merchant she sunk twice in Detroit river, and once in a fog in Lake Michigan, striking on rocks and shoals. There was, however, but little difficulty in raising her, the entire cost being but $17,170.37.\n\nThe same principle is more fully established by taking into consideration the history of ten other propellers built of iron, as follows: the Philadelphia, built in 1868, cost $165,000; the Alaska, in 1871, cost $170,000; the India, built in 1871, cost $170,000; the China, built in 1871, cost $170,000; the Japan, built in 1872, cost $170,000; the Cuba, built in 1872, cost $160,000; the Java, built in 1872, cost $160,000; the Scotia, built in 1873, cost $160,000; and the Arabia, built in 1873, cost $165,000; a total cost of the propellers of $1,600,000. Up to 1876 the eleven vessels, including the Merchant, had paid to the underwriters for insurance on hulls and east-bound freight, $940,231.96, and the entire amount paid by insurers for losses was $395,124.53, leaving a profit to the insurers of $545,107.43. This was in addition to the premiums on west-bound freight, which were estimated at $155,000, bringing the total up to $700,107.43. This profit had been made notwithstanding that some of the vessels had been injured, more or less, by striking on rocks and shoals, which the underwriters had paid for. And it was found, too, that the vessels were in good condition as far as their iron work was concerned, as they were when they were launched. The superiority of iron over wood being then generally recognized, as was evident that many boats even on the Mississippi river made of that material.\n\nAn incident in Mr. Bell's life is very creditable to him, and shows the estimation if which he was held by his fellow citizens. In 1869 he was the first choice of the Republican party for mayor of Buffalo, but as he was at that time president of the Mechanics Institute, which was then holding its first International Exhibition in Buffalo, he felt compelled to decline the honor, giving as his reason for so declining, that the duties in connection with the Exhibition engaged every moment of his time, and was likely to do so for some weeks thereafter.\n\nIn 1844 Mr. Bell was married to Miss Elizabeth Adams, a native of Perthshire, Scotland. By this marriage, Mr. Bell has one daughter now living, who married a son of the late Sir Casimir Gzowski, of Toronto, Canada, the builder of the International Bridge across the Niagara river. Mr. Bell was married to Mrs. Jane Reid, his first wife having died in 1866. By this marriage he has two sons; David and George Burwell, born in 1875.\n\n\"Whilst the fierce and ever memorable struggle was being waged in the United States between the North and the South, it may appear strange that perhaps the most honorable and civilizing enterprise of modern times was being launched in the troubled world of commerce, not many hundreds of miles away from the actual scenes of battle.\n\n\"It was in the year 1862 that Mr. J.C. Evans, of Buffalo, N.Y., commissioned the veteran shipbuilder, David Bell, of the same city, to build for the company now known as the Anchor line the first iron merchant vessel that ever floated on the Great American Lakes. This vessel, the Merchant, was a screw steamer of about 200 feet length, and her deadweight ability equalled about 700 tons.\n\n\"Though her capacity was small, her gross earnings could not have been insignificant, for when carrying flour and bacon from Chicago to Collingwood in those days, not less than $7 to$10 was received; twenty-five cents was not an uncommon price to be paid for the transportation of wheat from Chicago to Buffalo. As the Merchant could carry about 35,000 bushels, her freight would often amount to over $8,000.\n\n\"Though the modern successors of the Merchant can carry seven times the amount of cargo, it is doubtful if an $8,000 freight has yet been credited to one of the large modern steamers for a voyage of equal distance. I have not been able to learn what the Merchant's hull and machinery cost, but she was the first iron vessel, and also the first cargo boat, I believe, on the Great Lakes to burn coal under her boilers.\" [Joseph R. Oldham, in Cassier's Magazine.]\n\nGEORGE M. BELLOIR\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nGeorge M. Belloir, one of the most prominent and best qualified marine engineers sailing out of Duluth, has inherited many of the admirable characteristics of his French ancestors. The same qualities previously transmitted to his father rendered him one of the most notably courageous soldiers of the American Civil war, and it was he of whom General Custer wrote: \"I record the death of one of the bravest of the brave, Sergeant Mitchell Belloir, who has been my color bearer since I have been in command of this brigade, and who received his death wound while gallantly cheering the men on at the head of a desperate cavalry charge at the battle of Trevillian Station, West Virginia.\" Mitchell Belloir was born in Lyons, France, and came to the United States about the year 1845, locating in Ogdensburg, N. Y. Soon after the birth of his son George M., which occurred in Ogdensburg, April 15, 1851, he removed to Marquette, Mich., where he followed his business as iron worker in the first forge erected in that city. On June 14, 1861, he enlisted in Company B. First Michigan Cavalry, Captain Town being in command of the company, and the regiment eventually became a part of General Custer's brigade and saw much service on the battlefield. Mr. Belloir was promoted to the rank of sergeant and color bearer for the regiment, and was noted for his gallantry. He was invested with the brigade colors in 1863, and had the honor of participating in the momentous battles of Antietam, Fredericksburg and Gettysburg. He was taken prisoner at Cedar Mountain, and on June 14, 1864, was shot in the head and died at the head of his brigade, with the flagstaff in his hand, as noted above and recorded in detail in a volume entitled \"Michigan in the War.\" George M. Belloir, being but thirteen years old at the time of his father's death, was taken charge of as a ward by Cornelius Donkersley, superintendent of the Marquette, Houghton & Ontonagon railroad, and sent to school in Marquette. In 1865 Sidney Adams was appointed as his guardian until 1870, and in the meantime he learned the machinist's trade in the shops of the Marquette, Houghton & Ontonagon Railway Company, serving a four-years' apprenticeship. In the spring of 1871 Mr. Belloir went to Sault Ste. Marie and entered the employ of Mr. Burke, remaining with him four years. It was in the spring of 1875 that he opened his career as an engineer in the employ of Mr. Trompf, as assistant in the tug W. D. Cushing. The next year he was appointed chief engineer of the steamer Mary, following with two seasons on the Mystic and part of a season in the William H. Seymour. In the spring of 1880 he took the lake tug E. M. Peck, which he ran for two seasons, In November, 1882, he went to Duluth, and the next year was appointed chief of the T. H. Camp, running her three seasons. In 1886 he was chief engineer of the steamer R. G. Stewart, owned by the A. Booth Packing Company, transferring the following spring to the steamer A. Booth, as chief, and retaining that office until July, when she was lost, and he again joined the Stewart. In the spring of 1888 Mr. Belloir went to Baltimore after the steamer Hiram R. Dixon, which Mr. Booth had purchased to taken the place of the A. Booth, and as chief engineer ran her to Portland. In August he went to Tacoma, Wash., where he had acquired a homestead, and during the two years he was in the West he sailed on Puget Sound as chief engineer of the passenger steamer Seaside. On returning to Duluth in 1890 he was engaged to the close of the season on the ferry boat Estelle - plying between that city and Superior -and the little steamer Point Angelus, and in 1891 he became chief engineer of the steamer Doctor, holding that berth three consecutive seasons. In 1894 Mr. Belloir again entered the employ of the A. Booth Packing Company as chief engineer of the steamer S. B. Barker, which he ran two seasons, when he was transferred to the pass-enger steamer Hunter, as chief, retaining that berth up to the present time and giving uniform satisfaction.\n\nOn October 31, 1880, Mr. Belloir was united in marriage with Miss Ella L. Wray, of Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., formerly of Williamsport, Penn., and to them have been born two children - Earl Eugene and Collia Wray. Although Mr. Belloir lives in Duluth, Minn., the family homestead is in Tacoma, Wash. Fraternally he unites with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association No. 38, of Seattle, Washington.\n\nCAPTAIN W. H. BELTZ\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nThis well-known shipmaster was born in London, Ont., November 15, 1848, and before he was a year old removed with his parents to Grand Island, N. Y. He attended the public schools of that place and at the age of nine years became assistant cook on the tug Relief. In 1863 he was fireman on the tug Ellen M. O'Brien, and the following year he enlisted as a private in the Sixteenth United States Infantry, with which he sesrved faithfully for three years. In 1869 Mr. Beltz received his papers as marine engineer, and shipped in that capacity on the tug Fanny White, of Cheboygan, Mich.; during the season of 1870 he was engineer on the tug Mildred, of that port, and in 1871 came to Buffalo and sailed the steamyacht Maggie L. Wilson, as master. The following year he shipped as second engineer on the tug Music, and in 1873 served as chief engineer of the barge Saginaw. He worked ashore during the years 1875 and 1876, and in 1877-78 was engineer of the steamer Allentown, the year following shipping on the tug Mayflower in the same capacity. In 1880 he sailed the private yacht Lorelei as master, and in 1890 became the master of the excursion steamer Huntress, belonging to the Oakfield and Island Clubs, and still holds that berth.\n\nCaptain Beltz was married November 27, 1879, to Miss Josie Rockleman, of Buffalo, and has three children living. They reside at No. 163 Potomac avenue, Buffalo, New York.\n\nCAPTAIN CHARLES E. BENHAM\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nCaptain Charles E. Benham is one of the busiest and most enterprising men along the entire chain of lakes. He began his career as a sailor at the age of nine years, and has filled many positions of trust and responsibility from the age of fifteen up to the present date.\n\nCaptain Benham was born in Ashtabula county, Ohio, September 29, 1847, a son of Samuel Benham, who has charge of his son's vessel supply store on River street, in Cleveland. Captain Benham graduated from the Ashtabula high school, and removed to Cleveland when he was fourteen. He occupied himself during the winter seasons in school, and the summers, since his ninth year, on various lake craft. He also spent one year in a commercial college in Cleveland. From 1862 to 1883 he sailed continuously, as master of all classes of craft, from one hundred and fifty tons to two thousand tons burden. Following are a few of the vessels on which he has served in various capacities: scows - Union, Spanker, and Jim Hill; and schooners - American and Medbury. In August, 1862, he was appointed master of the scow Industry, after which he sailed the tugs L.H. Nichols, T.W. Notter, W.D. Cushing, J.H. Martin, Solon Rumage, and the river tug Samson; also the topsail scow Seabird, bark Indiana, the steambarge Fayette, and the steamers J.K. White, Hickox and Metropolis, and the V.H. Ketcham, of which he was part owner, besides numerous other vessels, of which he was in temporary charge in his capacity of wrecking master. During his career as wrecking master Captain Benham used the tugs Champion, Gillett and Adams, releasing the steamer Wallace and consort from the beach below Marquette, and was master of the powerful tug Samson, five years, which he owned. He accomplished some notable work in that branch of the business, as representative of the old Mercantile Marine Insurance Company (by whom he was employed seven years), now operating under the firm name of Foote & Maxson. He is still in charge of the marine department of the firm; also representing the Fire and Marine Insurance Company of Toronto, the St. Paul Insurance Company, and the Greenwich Insurance Company. Among the wrecks recovered by him may be mentioned the schooners Zach Chandler, Cormorant, George Sherman, James F. Joy, the David and Robert Wallace, etc. During the years 1894 and 1895 he has recovered several wrecks, among which is named the W.B. Hall, and he also stripped the B.F Bruce. The job of wrecking the two Wallaces was attended with unusual danger and difficulty, both vessels being frozen up in the ice. Captain Benham shipped his pumps and other wrecking appliances by rail from Cleveland to Marquette, and on the passage up with the water expedition he stopped at Detroit and took along some of Captain Grummond's wrecking appliances. The water expedition reached the scene of the wreck before the pumps, etc., shipped by rail, were taken off the cars at Marquette. The expedition was entirely successful; both vessels were pumped out and floated without loss of life notwithstanding the precarious conditions. Capt. C. E. Benham is also largely interested in the wrecking tug C.E. Benham, lighter Mentor, the steamers H. B. Tuttle, Nahant, Rube Richards, May Richards, Germanic, Edward S. Pease and consort Planet, the schooners H. C. Richards and Queen City.\n\nHe is now engaged in the brokerage business and the marine insurance business, making a specialty of marine surveying. He was connected with the municipal department of West Cleveland, being chairman of the waterworks board for three years, and was chairman of the joint committee on annexation. He was for several years chairman of the West Cleveland Republican club, a member of the infirmary board of Cuyahoga county for some time, and is at the present writing a member of the city council, and the chamber of commerce of Cleveland. He was chairman of the navigation committee of the Chamber of Commerce for one term, and represented Cleveland in the session of the Deep Waterways Convention at Toronto. He has been a member of the river and harbor commission in Cleveland for three years, representing both the city and the Chamber of Commerce at different times. He has filled all the offices in the Ship Masters Association, and now holds the rank of past grand president in the Grand Lodge of that Association, and carries Pennant No. 234. He is also purser of Harbor No. 42 of the American Masters and Pilots Association. He is interested in several banks and a director in one; a member of the Lake Carriers Association and the Vessel Owners Association, and has always been very active in working for the improvement of channels, lighthouses, etc., maintained by the government, having often appeared before committees in Congress for this purpose. He is now serving on two commissions for the improvement of rivers and harbors, and was one of the compilers of the Rules of the Road at sea, termed the White Bill - Captains George P. McKay and William S. Mack (deceased) being the other two members of that commission.\n\nCapt. C. E. Benham was wedded to Miss M. J. Prescott, of Boston, Mass., and seven children have been born to them.\n\nThe eldest son, Capt. Chas. A., was master of the steamer Sitka during the season of 1896; the second, Capt. William P., was master of the steamer Nahant during the season of 1896; the third, Capt. George E., master of the Queen City, in 1895; Robert is a marine engineer; Harry and two daughters, Eva M., the wife of J. A. Karr, one of Cleveland's young business men, and Jennie, complete the family.\n\nCAPTAIN W. P. BENHAM\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nCaptain W.P. Benham, of the steamer Nahant, is one of the younger men who have met with success in the management of vessels on the Great Lakes, and has been sailing since 1885. He is a son of Capt. C. E. Benham, who occupies such a prominent position in maritime and civic circles in Cleveland, and was born in Cleveland in 1870, receiving his education in the public schools of that city, for the most part in the Orchard school. He commenced his sailing career when fifteen years of age, shipping as watchman on the tug Samson for a few trips in the fall of 1885. The following season he sailed before the mast in the schooner Queen City, spending the season of 1887 in the schooner Our Son, from which he transferred to the steamer Henry C. Richards, in which he remained six years; the first season he was second mate, and for the remaining four years master of the vessel. During the season of 1894 Captain Benham sailed the steamer H. B. Tuttle, and he was master of the steamer Britannic from the opening of navigation in 1895 until she was lost in the Detroit river. This accident was due to the failure of her steam-steering apparatus to work properly, so that she was struck amidships by the steamer Russia and sunk. After the accident Captain Benham sailed the steamer Waverly one trip, and the steamer Bulgaria two trips, closing the season on the steamer Australia. He commanded the steamer Nahant during the season of 1896, laying her up in Cleveland, and then sailing the wrecking tug C. E. Benham for a short time in the late fall. Captain Benham has made occasional trips on other craft than those named, while his own vessels were laid up; he was before the mast in the schooner Brunette one fall, and was wheelsman of the steamer Cambria for a time during the year she came out. The accident which resulted in the sinking of the steamer Britannic in the Detroit river was the only serious one which has occurred to any vessel with which he has been connected.\n\nD. C. BENNETT\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nD.C. Bennett is one of the old-timers on the lakes, his career dating from 1844. He was born in Genesee county, N. Y., February 22, 1828, and his father was an old-time stage driver, in the days when railroads were scarce. In 1844, Mr. Bennett began steamboating as fireman on the old Anthony Wayne, running from Buffalo to Chicago, and continued on her during that and the next season. The two succeeding seasons he fired on the St. Louis for Captain Floyd, and the next season he fired on the Dewitt Clinton, in 1849 filling the same berth on the steamer Superior, after which he put in a couple of years working in the shops as machinist. In 1853 he served as assistant engineer on the propeller Forest City, and the next season shipped on the new propeller Sun. In the spring of 1855 he went to Grand Haven to run the engine of the Mary Belle, and held that position for two years, the next season returning to Buffalo and firing on the Orontes for two months, when he shipped as second engineer on the Edith. He remained with her and the Neptune until 1861, when he went back to the Orontes as assistant engineer, leaving her in the fall to take charge of the engine of the city elevator in Buffalo. This position he held until the elevator burned in March, 1864, when he went out as chief of the tug Harrison, serving on her when the government took her to patrol the Niagara River to prevent the crossing of the Fenians into Canada. The next season Mr. Bennett ran the tugs Danford and Bryant, both belonging to one line, and that winter he went to Titusville, Penn., to superintend the sinking of an oil well and the putting in of pumping machinery, remaining in the oil fields one winter. In 1867 he was second engineer on the Badger State, the next two seasons he ran the tugs Tiger and Harrison, and in 1870 he worked in a machine shop; in the spring of 1871 he shipped as chief engineer of the Araxes, and held that position for five years, at the end of which time he went to Sandusky to take the position of chief on the Orontes, which berth he held for two years. During the nine years following he sailed out of Sandusky as chief of the tugs Mystic and R. B. Hayes. In 1887 and part of 1888 he was chief of the American Eagle, and left her to become chief of the barge Norma, removing to Detroit. He then shipped as chief on Grummond's tugs, and was with that line on different boats, the Oswego, Gladiator, etc., until 1894, when he went out as chief of the steambarge Business. During 1895 he ran the Huron City, but in 1896 he did not sail much for the reason that he had his shoulder put out of joint on the Ohio early in the season, and was disabled. Later, when his shoulder got better, he ran the Little Daisy, for Beller, on the Detroit river.\n\nMr. Bennett was married in 1855, at Buffalo, to Miss Harriett Walker, and they have had twelve children, only five of whom are now living: Alva L., J. C., Daniel C., Jr., Edwin and Lillian.\n\nJ. C. BENNETT\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nJ.C. Bennett is a marine engineer of great promise, for he pays close attention to his business, and has always managed to employ his winters at work in the machine shops until recently, when he became a solicitor for the New York Life Insurance Company as employment for his spare hours. He was born in Buffalo October 28, 1860, his parents being D.C. and Harriet (Walker) Bennett, the former a marine engineer. He has three brothers, Alva L. (who is an engineer), Daniel C., Jr., and Edwin, and one sister, Lillian M. Mr. Bennett's lake career was begun in 1874, as fireman on the tug Mystic, in which position he gave good satisfaction, and continued through 1875 and 1876. In 1877 he was given charge of the engine of the steamyacht Ina, plying between Middle Bass and Put-in-Bay; in 1878 he ran the barge Norma, running from Sandusky to Put-in-Bay island and vicinity, and in 1879 he was second engineer of the barge Colona. In 1880 he took charge of the engine of the side-wheeler R.B. Hayes, and ran her so well that he was retained for 1881. That winter he took charge of a stationary engine ashore, and like the work so well that he kept it through 1882 and 1883. The next season he ran the engine for the little Red Jacket, a local steamer running out of Sandusky, and for the season of 1885 he had charge of the engine of the tug Mystic. In the winter following he assumed management of the heating plant of a Sandusky hotel, and in the spring of 1887 he came to Detroit and took the position of second engineer of the tug Gladiator. He began the season of 1888 as second on the Don M. Dickinson, after a short time being promoted to chief of that boat, and the next season he served as chief of the William A. Moore; during 1890 he ran the engine of the Winslow, all of these boats being in Grummond's line. The seasons of 1891 and 1892 Mr. Bennett put in as chief of the Maggie Duncan, and that of 1893 as chief of the steamer Ionia, since when he has served as chief of the steamer Chauncey Hurlburt to the satisfaction of both owners and masters.\n\nMr. Bennett was married in 1886, at Sandusky, Ohio, to Miss Celia Bernhardt, and they have one son, named Gordon C. Fraternally Mr. Bennett is a member of the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association and the Red Cross.\n\nJAMES BENNETT\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nJames Bennett, chief engineer of the steamer Pabst, was born near Belleville, Ont., in 1862, son of Bernard Bennett, a shoemaker. After leaving school he worked at farming and as a grocery clerk until 1884, when he began sailing as fireman on the steamer W. L. Wetmore. The following season he hired on the steamer Raleigh, and during the next two seasons served on the Manistique and Robert Holland, in turn. For one season following he was oiler on the William H. Woolf, at Milwaukee, engaging for the same length of time as second engineer of that boat. He was second of the Thomas Davidson and the Fred Pabst one season each, in 1892 becoming chief of the Pabst, where he has since been retained. One of the most terrible experiences which Mr. Bennett has had during his sailing career took place in the fall of 1894. The Pabst, while making the passage from the Sault to Milwaukee, lost her rudder in St. Mary's river, but being very anxioius to complete the trip, the captain engaged two tugs to steer the boat and continued on the way. A gale sprang up and both tugs broke loose, and one of them, losing her bitts and tow-posts, was powerless to render further assistance. The other tug remained with the steamer through the night and succeeded in making fast several times, only to be torn away again. The steamer was finally saved, but she had suffered terribly, and needed to be almost rebuilt. Mr. Bennett was married, in 1890, to Miss Annie Mulrooney, of Cleveland. They have one child living, Bernice; one is deceased.\n\nCAPTAIN FRED G. BENSON\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nCaptain Fred G. Benson, may with truth be designated as the typical tug master, genial and large hearted, courageous and gentle, of fine physique and great endurance, broad mined and generous to a fault. He is the son of Royal and Emily (Bates) Benson, and was born June 20, 1854. The only other child of the family is Isabella, now the widow of John M. Came. The father was a carpenter and millwright, and carried on business in and about Saginaw, Mich. having removed to that city from Iowa in the year 1864.\n\nIt was in Saginaw that Fred G. acquired his education, attending school winters until he reached the age of eighteen years. He was apprenticed to learn the carpenter's trade with Benson & Campbell, his father being the senior member of the firm and remained with that firm four or five years, sailing as occasion offered when his trade was dull, on the Saginaw river and bay, and it was by reason of this experience that he was made wheelsman in 1873 on the steamer John Sherman, formerly a United States revenue cutter and considered the speediest boat on the lakes. Her machinery is now in the steamer Alaska. Capt. John Steward was in command of her at one time, and she was operated by Messrs. Cole & Halt. The next season he shipped as lookout and acting second mate in the same steamer.\n\nIn the spring of 1885 Captain Benson joined the steamer Mendota, with Captain Palmer, closing the season in the steamer China, Capt. Charles Christy, as wheelsman. The following season he was appointed second mate in the steamer G.P. Heath, owned and sailed by Capt. R.C. Brittin in the fruit and lumber trade between Chicago and Saugatuck. Captain Benson had his first experience on Lake Superior in the steamer Annie L. Craig, as wheelsman. Capt. William Cunnings sailed the Craig, Michael Chalk was chief engineer, and Thomas Lang mate. In the spring of 1878 he was appointed master of the tug Uncle Sam, operating on the Saginaw and owned by L.D. Russell. The next two seasons he sailed the tug Charles Lee, for W.A. Avery, which had the machinery of the tug Gray. During the season of 1881 he sailed the tug George Hand for Thomas Hubbell, of Saginaw, who had a contract for government work at Sand Beach, engineer Gilbert being in charge. It was in the spring of 1882 that Captain Benson entered the employ of the Tittibewasse Boom Company with whom he remained six years. During that period he sailed the tugs J.P. Logie, Charles Lee, James Hay and Robert Weideman, being master of the latter tug four seasons. He purchased an improved farm of eighty acres near Clio in the winter of 1883-84, upon which he built a spacious modern home, and which his wife manages in a practical business way during his absence on the lakes. In September, after sailing the tug Music, he entered the employ of Capt. B.B. Inman as master of the tug O.W. Cheney, transferring to the Cora B. the next season, and in September taking command of the M.D. Carrington, which he sailed until the fall of 1894. In the spring of 1895 Captain Benson was appointed master of the fine new tug B.B. Inman, of which he is still in command. He designates her as the flower of the fleet. She is one of the most powerful tugs on the lakes, and has the name of being the handiest and most sensitive to her rudder on fresh water. She is handled entirely by steam as regards windlass, stearer and reverse gear. She has a Dean independent air, feed bilge, water and fire pumps, using seventeen steam cylinders and the Howden hot air draft.\n\nIn 1893 Captain Benson joined the Ship Masters Association, and carried Pennant No. 860, but has since surrendered it.\n\nIn 1877 Capt. Fred G. Benson was wedded to Miss Julia, daughter of Eleazer and Amanda Woolsey, of Saginaw. The children born of this union are: Frances E., now the wife of William McCumsey, of Clio; Roy E., Nellie B. and Fred Albert. When the snow of winter approaches Captain Benson retires to his pleasant home at Clio, the fittings of which are in keeping with the education and refinement of its occupants.\n\nCAPTAIN JOHN G. BETKE\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nCaptain John G. Betke, an ocean navigator in the fullest sense of the term, with a skipper's certificate at the age of twenty-two, was born at Cappeln, Schleswig-Holstein, in 1858. He attended the common schools of his native place until fifteen years of age, and then shipped at Flensborg, on the schooner Louisa, as boy, for ten months, after which he sailed on the schooner Lydia as ordinary seaman, remaining one year.\n\nReturning to Flensborg he shipped on the German steamer Quatur as ordinary seaman. The Quatur loaded coal at Cardiff for Port Said, and after discharging, she took on 1,000 pilgrims bound to the shrine of Mecca, on the Red Sea, to worship. The voyage then extended to Hong Kong, China, where part of the cargo was taken aboard, being filled out at Singapore and Bankok with sugar; the steamer then sailed for London. The time passed on this steamer was about one year. He left her on arrival at London, and shipped as able seaman on the bark Hausa out of Hamburg with a general cargo for Hong Kong, where she discharged cargo and loaded rice, going to Bankok for sugar to finish cargo, after which she cleared for London. He then went over to Bremen and shipped on the bark Atlanta, bound for New York with a cargo of merchandise, carrying coal oil back to Bremen, the voyage occupying three months. In 1878 Mr. Betke enlisted in the German navy, and was assigned to the battleship Hansa, then under orders to sail for Valparaiso, to release the merchant steamer Loxus, which had been seized by the Peruvians, they being at war with Chili at the time, and holding that the Loxus was trying to run their blockade with contraband goods. He served in the navy two years, being discharged in 1880. He then returned to the German port of Flensborg, where he attended navigation school, and by close and diligent application to his studies he learned navigation thoroughly in one year and received a skipper's certificate of competency. He then found berth as able seaman on the British ship Glad Tidings, out of Hamburg for Baltimore, the passage occupying two months. Arriving at Baltimore he was appointed mate of the schooner George Washington, in the coasting trade, occupying one year. His next berth was in the schooner George Adams, as mate, out of Bath, Maine, for Galveston, Texas, three months passing while in the schooner, after which he shipped as mate at Galveston on the schooner Whitehead, bound for Boston, remaining on her one year. He then purchased the schooner Lydia, which he sailed one year in the coasting trade between Galveston, Sabine Pass, Corpus Christi, Indianola and ports on Lake Charles, the Brazos river and the Gulf of Mexico. He was then taken down with fever and transferred his command to a skipper named Smith, who lost her at Morgan City bay in the fall of 1885.\n\nOn his recovery Captain Betke entered the United States life saving service at Aransas Pass, in the Eighteenth district, as surfman, and took part in all the rescues during the two years he remained. He made a good record as a life saver. In the spring of 1887 he came upon the lakes and shipped out of Toledo, Ohio, before the mast in the schooner Rival, remaining one year, which was followed by one year on the schooner Fayette Brown. He was then appointed mate on the schooner David Wagstaff one season; mate of the George W. Warner one season; mate of the Thomas P. Sheldon one season; mate of the whaleback 105 one season; then master of the barges Walton and Little Jake, ice boats, in the employ of the Forest City Ice Company, plying between Cleveland and Put-in-Bay with ice and general cargoes. He has been with the company six years. Captain Betke is a member of the I. O. O. F.\n\nCAPTAIN JOHN M. BEVERLY\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nCaptain John M. Beverly, or, as he is familiarly known, \"Local Attraction Jack,\" was born in 1843, at Frederick, New Brunswick, a son of Francis and Margaret (Lombard) Beverly. His father was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, in 1800, a grandson of Admiral Peter Beverly, of the English navy, and a great-grandson of Post Captain Beverly, to whom the British Government granted a tract of land near Boston, known as the Beverly reservation, before the Revolutionary war. Francis Beverly was the Queen's printer and bookbinder for the British provinces; he died at the age of ninety years, and his wife, who was born in Portland, Maine, in 1811, died in 1892, at the age of eighty-one years.\n\nCaptain Beverly attended the penny schools of New Brunswick, and finished his education at the Baptist seminary. He then commenced, at the age of sixteen years, his sailing career, in 1860 shipping on the schooner Gilbert Bentt, plying between the Bay of Fundy and New York City in the plaster trade. In 1861 he sailed in the schooner Abbie Wells, out of Portland, Maine, to the West Indies, remaining on her one year before the mast. In 1862 he was appointed master of the schooner Mary D. Wilson, holding that berth for two years.\n\nOn leaving the Wilson, the Captain quit sailing, and went as coast pilot between Boston and all eastern ports on the Atlantic, continuing in that business until 1878, when he opened a store and office as compass adjuster at the Union wharf, Boston. The following year he sold out his business there to Henry Mayo and went to Cleveland, in which city he had an office in the ship-chandlery store of J. W. Grover & Son, and there remained fifteen years and gained much renown. In 1893 he opened a shop at Brooklyn, Ohio, returning to Cleveland, however, in the spring of 1897, and estab-lishing a new shop and office at No. 150 River street. He manufactures all kinds of nautical instruments, and is always ready to go on board vessels and adjust compasses, Captain Beverly is the oldest compass adjuster in the United States, and when he commenced business in that line was the only one. He has been eminently successful in his chosen field, and has done the major part of the work on the new vessels launched on the lakes since his advent in 1879, the result of his science proving satisfactory to both owners and masters. He has worked for the Anchor Steamship Company of Buffalo for the last fifteen years; for the Western and Union Steamboat Companies; has adjusted all the compasses of Bradley fleet for the last twelve years, as well as those of Capt. John Mitchell, since he has been in the vessel business, and has been engaged by other lines as occasion required.\n\nCaptain Beverly has a master's license of the first class, which covers the Great Lakes and the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and is therefore a navigator in the fullest sense of the term, a qualification not possessed by any other compass adjuster in the United States. It is therefore to be presumed that he is well prepared to do satisfactory work. He is a member of the Ship Masters Association and holds Pennant No. 889.\n\nCaptain Beverly was wedded to Miss Mary J. Harvey, of Portland, Maine, in 1866, and two daughters, Daisy and Pansy, have been born to this union. The family residence is on a farm near Painesville, Ohio, to which the Captain retires during the winter months.\n\nC. F. BIELMAN\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nThe management of the freight and passenger business of the Star-Cole-Red & White Star Lines steamers, is in the hands of C. F. Bielman, under the title of general traffic manager; his duties covering the business of all five steamers operated on the Detroit-Port Huron and Detroit-Toledo routes. As these boats are owned and operated by four corporations under a pooling arrangement, it is evident that the position demands the services of a clever accountant, as well as one versed in the methods of keeping freight and ticket accounts.\n\nMr. Bielman was born in Detroit in 1859, and was educated in public schools of that city. He began steamboating when twenty years of age, as clerk of the R. J. Gordon, running from Algomac to Port Huron. After one season on this boat, he became clerk of the Evening Star, then owned by the Detroit & Cleveland Steam Navigation Co. When the first steamer, City of Mackinac, came out in 1880, he was transferred to that boat, and was clerk of her for five seasons. Mr. Bielman considers this the most pleasant part of his career on the lakes, as the boat was a fine one, handsomely appointed, and the passenger traffic largely made up of pleasure seekers.\n\nIn 1886 he took charge of the freight and passenger business of the pool operating the Detroit and Port Huron boats; but owing to the dissolving of the pool the following season, he went back to the Cleveland line, as purser of the City of Alpena. In July, 1887, with Capt. Darius Cole, he purchased a controlling interest in the Star line, and took his present position of general traffic manager.\n\nMr. Bielman is also secretary and treasurer of the Stewart Transportation Company, owning and operating the fine freight steamer C.F. Bielman.\n\nFRANK BINGHAM\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nFrank Bingham was born February 24, 1862, at Niagara Falls, and received part of his education in that place and the remainder at Buffalo. His parents, George and Edna (Bell) Bingham, are Americans by birth. Mr. Bingham's first employment was in the boiler works of Dempsey Brothers, at Buffalo, where he remained seven years. In 1886 he became engineer of the steamyacht Eddy, upon which he remained two years, following this with about ten years' service in the same capacity on the following Buffalo tugs: George Fullerton, Lewis Mills, Silver King and John Edwards.\n\nOn July 3, 1879, Mr. Bingham was married at Buffalo, to Emma Oldman, and they have the following-named children: Edna Belle, Pearl May, George F. and Gracie G.

Y., in 1863, and received his education at Unadilla, Otsego county, that State. He learned the machinist's trade in the R. K. Teller machine shop at Unadilla, and subsequently worked for the Cleveland Ship Building Company, the Case Agricultural Works at Racine, and with Shepley & Walls, at Binghamton, N. Y. In 1882 Mr. Birdsall began life on the lakes as watchman on the steamer Frank Moffat, of Port Huron, finishing the season as wheelsman. The season of 1883 he was wheelsman of the Milton D. Ward, out of Detroit. He began the season of 1884 as mate of the side-wheel steamer Idlewild, plying between Toledo and Detroit, finishing as mate of the Sigma, a steamyacht owned by Colonel Reynolds, then president of the Wabash railroad. In 1885 Mr. Birdsall shipped as greaser of the Cambria, where he remained throughout the season. He was greaser on the Northern Light for the season of 1886, and was second engineer for the seasons of 1887-88 on the John M. Nichol and Northern King, holding a similar position on the Saginaw Valley until June, 1889, when he went to Detroit to become foreman over the shops and machinery of the Michigan Adamant Plaster Company. Here he remained until April, 1890, at which time he put in a new plant and new works for the above named company at Marquette, and became foreman there, continuing in this employ three and a half years. The winter following he was engaged in the Electric Light Works of that city. His next employment was at Marine City, where he fitted out the steamer New Baltimore, on which he remained as chief engineer for one season. During the early part of 1894 he was second engineer of the steamer Alaska, and chief of the Delaware for the remainder of the season. In 1895 he was chief engineer of the Connecting and Terminal Elevator at Buffalo, and for the season of 1896 he was chief engineer of the steamer Delaware.\n\nMr. Birdsall was married, at Cleveland, on April 13, 1889, to Miss Nora Van Kuren, of Youngstown, N. Y., and they have two children\u2013Edna Madge and Ada Grace.\n\nW. E. BISHOP\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nW.E. Bishop, manager of the Hamilton Steamboat Company, has risen to his present responsible position by his natural merits as an indefatigable and clever business man of unusually good judgment, and he is an excellent director of men under him. His company owns three fine vessels, the Modjeska, Macassa and Mazeppa, the first two on the run between Hamilton and Toronto, and the Mazeppa plying from Hamilton to the Beach and Burlington. Mr. Bishop was born in 1868 in the city of Brantford, Ont., and was educated in the common and high schools of that place, learning rapidly. He started in life for himself at the age of fourteen years, his first employment being with Messrs. A. Harris & Co., the prominent manufacturers of agricultural implements, with whom he remained for some time intending to learn the business. Not having a strong liking for it, however, he gave it up and went into the freight office of the Grand Trunk railway at Toronto in 1881, occupying a position there for three years, after which he went to Topeka, Kans., and secured lucrative employment in the auditor's department of the Topeka & Santa Fe railway. Returning to Canada, he entered the employ of the Hamilton Steamboat Company, as a clerk under Mr. Fergus Armstrong, who was at that time, in 1889, Toronto manager, and he remained in the Toronto office for three years, at the end of that time accepting a position with W.A. Geddes, wharfinger and vessel owner, of Toronto, as purser on the propeller Ocean, sailing between Montreal and the Upper Lakes in the passenger and freight business. That position Mr. Bishop continued to hold for four years, when he relinquished it to take charge of the Toronto end of the Hamilton Steamboat Company's business, Mr. Armstrong having been promoted to the position of general manager for the company at Hamilton. In the year 1896 Mr. Armstrong resigned, and Mr. Bishop was given the general managership with headquarters at Hamilton, in which incumbency he is still retained, as it has always been the policy of the Hamilton Steamboat Company to keep a good man. Mr. Bishop was married in 1889 to Miss Margaret Sin, and three children have been born to them, two sons and one daughter, all bright children who promise to be a credit to their parents. Mr. Bishop's party politics savor of Conservatism, but he is not a bitter Tory, always voting for the good of his country, and in his life he has as often voted Liberal as Conservative. Religiously he is a Presbyterian.\n\nWILLIAM H. BISHOP\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nWilliam H. Bishop is a son of Orris and Sarah (Philps) Bishop, and a brother of Edward Bishop, who was in the Thunder Bay life-saving station for a time and is now lighthouse-keeper at that port. Mr. Bishop was born in Marshalltown, Iowa, March 14, 1863, and attended the public schools in his native place until he reached the age of fifteen years. He then opened his lakefaring life as lineman on the tug E.H. Miller, out of Alpena harbor, on which he remained six years. In the spring of 1883 he entered the employ of the Thunder Bay Boom Company as engineer of the tug Segison, retaining that berth three years, and in 1886 he joined the tug Ralph, as engineer, with Capt. C.W. Richardson, now hull inspector in Chicago. The next spring he went to Detroit and shipped in the river tug Kate Williams, as engineer, for a short time, after which he went to Cleveland and entered the employ of L.P. & J.A. Smith as engineer of the tug Maggie Sanborn. He continued with this firm four years, transferring from one tug to another as occasion required. In the spring of 1891 Mr. Bishop shipped as second engineer on the steamer John W. Moore. The next season he was on the steamer Empire for a time, and after leaving her served as second engineer on the C.J. Kershaw and E.S. Pease until fall, when he shipped on the fish tug, King, at Erie, Penn. In the spring of 1893 he came out as second engineer on the steamer A. Everett, transferred to the Nellie Torrent, and in the fall joined the fishtug Siskiwitt. The next season he was second engineer of the steamer Nahant. In 1895 he served as engineer of the tug S.S. Stone, till August, closing the season on the steamer Horace B. Tuttle. In 1896 he came out as first assistant on the Griffin, transferred from her to the steamer Argonaut, and at the close of lake navigation shipped on the steam canalboat John Lang, and went to the Atlantic coast by way of the Hudson river and the Sound. Returning to the lakes the following season, he fitted out the steamer Pascal P. Pratt, and ran her till June, when he took engineer's berth on the large tug Chauncey Morgan, of the Cleveland Towing Company. Mr. Bishop was married to Miss Emma Horn, of Cleveland, on June 30, 1897. He is a member of the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association.\n\nDAVID A. BLACK\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nThe marine life of this gentleman has been marked with no shipwreck or experience of a serious nature. Gradually he has worked his way up the ladder of marine engineering till he has reached the berth of chief engineer of the Maricopa, a position which speaks for itself. All of his active life has been spent in preparation for his trade and its fulfillment, and he is a devoted follower of his chosen calling.\n\nMr. Black was born in Hamilton, Ontario, the son of David and Isabella (Arnott) Black. In his infancy his parents removed to Flamboro, Ontario, and there he lived until sixteen years old, at which age he went to Dundas, same Province, and entered the machine department of Gartshore's foundry. There he served four years, after which he was employed about two years at the same place and then removed to Goderich, Ontario, and purchased an interest in a foundry there; which venture proved unsuccessful, and he began sailing. He first went on the pleasure yacht Tommy Wright as engineer, and then served in the same capacity on the tug Maytham. He next became second engineer on the Tecumseh, of Chatham, acting as such for two seasons and then for one season as chief. He now moved to Detroit, Mich., becoming a citizen of the United States, and shipping as chief engineer of the steamer Kershaw one season, from which he came to the passenger steamer Saginaw Valley, and remained two seasons. After three years spent in the W. L. Frost he went to the F. W. Wheeler, which was new, for one season, and then in the seasons closely following brought out the steamers Mecosta, Tampa, Pioneer and Selwyn Eddy, all new. For one season following he was with the Detroit, Belle Isle & Windsor Ferry line, on the steamer Promise, from which he transferred to the Minnesota Steamship line on the steamer Marina. Upon this boat he spent the season of 1895, and continued on her until October 20, 1896, when he went on the Maricopa, of the same line, for the balance of the season.\n\nMr. Black was married to Georgina Pirie, of Guelph, Ontario, and to this union were born: Annie Maud, Alice Mabel, Ada Jacquelin, Hattie Florence, Alex Aitken and George Arnott, all of whom are living at home but Annie Maud, who died at the age of five years. Socially Mr. Black is a member of Detroit Lodge No. 2, F. & A. M., the M. E. B. A., No. 3, and Peninsular Lodge No. 12, A. O. U. W., of Detroit.\n\nWILLIAM A. BLACK\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nWilliam A. Black is one of the family of five children - four boys and one daughter -of John and Mary J. (Carlisle) Black, both of whom were born in the North of Ireland, the former in County Antrim.\n\nJohn Black, the father, who was a farmer by occupation, died in April, 1897. He immigrated to Canada in 1837, and eventually located near St. Catharines, Ontario, where he still resides. The mother passed from earth about the year 1877. One of their sons, Robert J. Black, has been an engineer on the lakes for about twenty-four years, and is now a partner in a machine shop at St. Catharines. Another son, Edgar E., is a carpenter by trade, and is located at St. Clair, Mich. The other son died in 1894, and the daughter died in 1887.\n\nWilliam A. Black, the subject of this sketch, was born at St. Catharines, Ontario, November 24, 1856. After attending school at his native place, he was apprenticed in the machine shop of C. M. Able, in St. Catharines, where he remained about four years. He was next employed at the Pond Machine Shop, at Lockport, N. Y., and then went to Buffalo and worked, respectively, in the Eagle Iron Works, Bell's Machine Shop, the Buffalo Grape Sugar Works, Howard Iron Works (two years and a half), and the George L. Squire Manufacturing Co. (three years). In 1884, in the month of September, Mr. Black shipped as oiler on the steamer Clarion, on which he remained until the end of the season. The next three seasons he was second engineer of the same steamer with the exception of the last two trips, in the fall of 1887 becoming second engineer of the Winslow. In the spring of 1888 he was made chief engineer of the steamer Conemaugh, of the Anchor line, and has remained in her in that position steadily ever since. During his experiences on the lakes Mr. Black has been in but one accident of consequence. In the month of October, 1891, while the Conemaugh was coming down the Detroit River laden with flour and package on the way to Buffalo, and when abreast of Smith's Coal Dock, she was run into by the steamer New York and sunk near the Canadian shore, but remained sufficiently out of the water to permit the crew to remain on her until she was raised, none of them even getting wet. As usual a lawsuit resulted. Mr. Black has been a member of the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association eleven years, and a Mason since 1882, being a member of Buffalo Chapter No. 71, Council No. 17, Lake Erie Commandery No. 26, and of the Mystic Shrine, Ismailia temple.\n\nMr. Black was married at Buffalo in February, 1887, to Miss Catherine F. Johnson, by whom he has had three children: Ethel May, Raymond Alfred and Hazel, now (1898) aged respectively seven years, five years, and one year. The family resides at No. 261 Whitney Place, Buffalo, New York.\n\nJAMES B. BLAIR\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nJames B. Blair was born August 4, 1861, at Buffalo, N.Y., and in that city he has always made his home. He is a member of a family of eight children born to James C. and Margaret (Foster) Blair, both natives of Scotland. Hugh, the eldest child, was born in Scotland, and died in infancy; John is connected with the Standard Oil Company at Marquette, Mich., at the present time; Lizzie is married to Frank Miller, chief engineer of the steamer Boston; William E. and Frank follow the machinist's trade and reside in Buffalo; Alexander is a physician, residing in Buffalo; and Charles Arthur died in October, 1896, after one season spent on the steamer Clarion, as oiler. James B. Blair attended the public schools until he was fifteen years of age. At that time he entered the printing office of Baker, Jones & Co., working in the press department, and remaining about two and a half years. He then entered a planing-mill owned by Haigh & Blair (the later member of the firm being his brother John) and acted as fireman. After a time he was made engineer, and in that capacity remained until 1883, when he entered the employ of L. S. & M. S. railroad as fireman. In the fall of 1884 he left the railroad and went on the steamer Vanderbilt, as oiler. Upon this boat, however, he remained only one trip, going on the Chicago, of the W. T. line, in the same position, where he finished that season and spent the following one. During 1886 and 1887 he acted as first assistant engineer on the Chicago, and the following year accepted the same position on the Albany, of the W. T. line, where he remained until 1891. At that time he left the lakes, and accepted a position of chief engineer of the City Elevator B, at Buffalo, where he has since remained.\n\nOn August 4, 1885, Mr. Blair was married to Miss Lizzie Genner, daughter of John Genner, of Buffalo. To them three children have been born: Jessie C., May 22, 1886; James B., October 27, 1888; and Edward William, April 20, 1891.\n\nMr. Blair is a member of the Masonic fraternity, of the E. E. B. A. and the L. O. F. at Buffalo, New York.\n\nEDWARD R. BLANCHARD\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nEdward R. Blanchard is well known in Detroit in his connection with the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association, which has no more enthusiastic member or one who has done more for the general interest of the association and the special interest of No. 3, of which he is now treasurer. He became a member twelve years ago and has filled the offices of doorkeeper, chaplain, secretary, vice-president, etc., and for the last four years has been a representative in the national meeting at Washington.\n\nMr. Blanchard was born in Southampton, England, October 12, 1851, son of Alfred and Frances (Wright) Blanchard, the former of whom was a well-known yacht builder there. His oldest brother, Alfred, Jr., was a yachtsman and was drowned off a yacht near Southampton some years ago. His brother George is the master of a large yacht which has been in the Mediterranean since early in 1896. The other brother, William, is in business in London, England, and is the only one of the family not connected with marine interests. Edward was in the yachting business out of Southampton as a young man, and left his native country for America in 1873, coming direct to Detroit, where he obtained employment as assistant engineer of the tug L.L. Lyon. The season of 1874 he spent as second engineer of the William A. Moore, and in 1875 he held the same position on the William Goodnow. In 1876 he returned to England in hope of benefiting the health of his wife, and he was again connected with English yachts until 1882, when he returned to Detroit; on account of his wife's health, however, he did not go on the lakes until the season of 1883, when he became engineer of the George A. Marsh, the tender for the Detroit river lighthouse during the building of the latter. He held the same position in 1884, and in 1885 he accepted from Hiram Walker & Sons the position of chief engineer of their fine yacht Pastime, giving such excellent satisfaction that he has been retained on her continuously since.\n\nOn December 12, 1874, in Detroit, Mr. Blanchard wedded Miss Emma Wright, an English girl, and they have had ten children, of whom three only are now living: Alfred E. (who is on the lakes). Ernest W. and Gertrude. Mr. Blanchard also holds membership with the A.O.U.W. in fraternal connection.\n\nJOSEPH R. BLANCHETTE\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nJoseph R. Blanchette, who has been chief engineer of the Nyanza since the season of 1892, is the second of five sons of William and Catharine (Quilliams) Blanchette. The father was an old-time steamboat engineer, and was lost on the lakes, in 1856, while on the J. W. Brooks, of the old National Transit line. The sons, like their father, all became engineers; and Thomas, the eldest, met with the same fate, being chief engineer of the B. W. Jones, when she was blown up at Port Huron, on the St. Clair River, in May, 1871. John is a locomotive engineer on the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy railroad, and resides at Aurora, Ill. Nelson is a locomotive engineer on the Flint & Pere Marquette railroad, residing at Saginaw, Mich. Frank, the youngest, is engineer on the Northern Pacific railroad.\n\nJoseph R. Blanchette, the subject of this sketch, was born in Avon, Ohio, in 1845, and obtained his schooling at that place. His first employment was running a drill for the Dean & Eaton Car Co., at Detroit, Mich., and after three years of that work he entered the machine shops of the Kellogg Nut and Bolt Works, remaining there two years. He then started railroading, firing on the Grand Haven & Milwaukee railroad for the three years of 1864-65-66, and in 1867 began his marine life as assistant engineer of the tug Grant, out of Detroit, owned by John Deman. Leaving her after two seasons, he went on the tug Thomas Quayle, of which he was second engineer for the season of 1869, and the succeeding seasons of 1870-71 was chief engineer of the Jay Cook, a passenger boat, of Detroit. In 1872 he returned to railroading, as locomotive engineer of the Flint & Pere Marquette railroad until May, 1874, when he left to accept the position of chief engineer of the John Sherman for that season. During the winter of 1874-75 he engaged in railroading again until March 22, 1875, when he again went on the John Sherman as chief. In 1876-77 he was chief of the George R. Dunlap, and for the four successive seasons, from 1878-81 inclusive, of the Dove, being then transferred to the Arundel, of which he was chief the next nine seasons. It will thus be seen that Mr. Blanchette spent seventeen years in the employ of the Detroit, Bay City and Alpena Mail line of steamers. He entered the service of the McBrier line, of Erie, Penn., in 1891, as chief of the Fedora, and in 1892 went on the Nyanza, belonging to the same line, and was on her five seasons. During his career as engineer Mr. Blanchette has proven himself a careful, reliable and steady navigator, never having been in any steamboat collision or wreck, and since he has had chief's papers has been in the employ of only two lines, one seventeen, the other seven, years.\n\nHe is the holder of a number of issues of chief's license, is a member of Local Harbor No. 1, Marine Engineers Beneficial Association, of Buffalo, and is a thirty-second-degree Mason, being a member of Michigan Sovereign Consistory, A. A. S. R., Valley of Detroit, and Blue Lodge No. 129, F. & A. M., of Bay City, Michigan.\n\nMr. Blanchette was married, December 12, 1876, to Miss Louisa Clark, a daughter of T. L. Clark, an old pioneer of Maumee, Ohio. The family residence is at No. 209 Potomac avenue, Buffalo, New York.\n\nH. J. BLANEYM\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nH.J. Blaney, a well-known and highly respected citizen of Chicago, who spent several years of his early life upon the lakes, and has since had charge of stationary engines, is the present chief engineer of the Stock Exchange building, having held that position since 1894.\n\nMr. Blaney was born in Canada, in 1843, a son of Daniel and Nelly (Nichol) Blaney, both natives of Glasgow, Scotland, who at an early day emigrated to Canada, where they made their home throughout the remainder of their lives. By trade their father was a weaver. Our subject was reared and educated in Canada, and on leaving home went to Detroit, Mich., but since 1863 has resided in Chicago. In 1861, at Detroit, Mr. Blaney secured the position of engineer on tug boats on the Detroit and St. Clair rivers, and during that year and the year following was in the employ of the Winslow line. In the latter part of the season of 1862 he came to Chicago, and the following year accepted the position of second engineer of the steam propeller Water Witch, which was engaged in passenger trade, and which was lost in the fall of that year in Saginaw Bay, while sailing from Chicago to Sarnia in the interests of the Grand Trunk Line. From 1864 until 1868 he remained ashore as stationary engineer, but in the latter year was made second engineer of the propeller line of the Grand Trunk line, and was on her two seasons. In 1869 he located permanently in Chicago, and during that year and 1870 he was engineer of a dry-goods house; from 1872 until 1882 was chief engineer of a building at the corner of State and Madison streets; was chief engineer of the Ayer building in 1882; from 1884 until 1888 was chief engineer of the Royal Insurance building; for the following four years held a similar position at the Auditorium; and since January, 1894 has been chief engineer of the Stock Exchange.\n\nIn 1867, Mr. Blaney was married in Canada, to Miss Margaret McMillan, and to them have been born the following children; Charles J.; Mary Elizabeth; William H.; Frances; George W.; Walter A.; Maud; Mildred; and Lillian. Socially Mr. Blaney was a member of the old M. E. P. A., No. 4; the Home Lodge No. 508. F. & A. M., and also belongs to the Royal League and the Independent Order of Foresters.\n\nC. BLAUVELT\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nC. Blauvelt, who was a prominent marine engineer during the earlier period of steamboating, is still active in the line of his calling: he is a man of fine stature and possesses a good reserve force of vitality. Mr. Blauvelt was born in Tompkins county, N. Y., son of Isaac and Betsey (Swartout) Blauvelt, who removed to Algonac, Mich., in the year 1848, and were considered pioneers of St. Clair county. They were of Holland descent, the grandfather having come to the United States while young and located in New York.\n\nCornelius Blauvelt attended the public schools until about eighteen years of age. In 1952 he began the life of a lake sailor, shipping as boy with Capt. William Wilds in the steamer Romeo, then plying on the St. Clair Flats, and the following year he went as fireman in the steamer Odd Fellow, commanded by Capt. William Dana. The next position accorded Mr. Blauvelt was that as chief engineer of the lake tug Pilot, which berth he held five consecutive seasons. He was chief engineer of the large tug William B. Castle, with Capt. R. J. Hackett, for nine seasons, and of the lake tug George E. Brockway, with Captain Moffat, five seasons. His next steamer was the Annie Smith, Capt. M. H. Murch, in which he remained two seasons, and for two seasons following he ran the propeller Allegheny as chief engineer. In the fall of 1885, after laying his boat up, he built a gristmill in Algonac to occupy his time during the winter months, and he still operates the mill when he is not sailing. After holding the berth of engineer on various steamers, the names of which are not remembered in order. Mr. Blauvelt shipped as second engineer in the steam passenger monitor Christopher Columbus, with Captain McArthur, and assisted in operating her during the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago, his son, Robert Blauvelt, being the chief engineer; theirs were responsible positions, as over 1,800,000 passengers were carried without the loss of life, with the exception of one member of the crew who fell overboard and was drowned, although every effort was made to rescue him by Captain McArthur. In the spring of 1895 Mr. Blauvelt fitted out the George W. Farwell, which he engineered two seasons, laying her up at the close of navigation in Marine City. He formerly owned interests in some of the vessel property he had sailed, but has disposed of all.\n\nIn 1860 Mr. Blauvelt wedded Miss Lena, daughter of Jacob Sternlar. The children born to this union are George E., who was engineer of the John B. Trevor in 1897; Delos; Henry E., who died in 1895, while first assistant engineer of the Christopher Columbus; Robert S., who was chief engineer for the American Steel Barge Company for a number of years and brought out new many of their large steam monitors, rounding Cape Horn in one of them, he was chief engineer of the passenger steamer Northland in 1895; John W., first assistant engineer of the Northland, and Ralph H., also a marine engineer of good report. The family live in Algonac, Mich. Fraternally Mr. Blauvelt is a Master Mason.\n\nROBERT S. BLAUVELT\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nRobert S. Blauvelt, one of the most scientific marine engineers navigating on fresh or salt water, has been a resident of Buffalo only a short time. He is the son of Cornelius and Lena (Stomler) Blauvelt, and was born in Algonac, Mich., in 1865. His father, a marine engineer of forty years' experience, is still active in the engineering business at Algonac.\n\nThe subject of this sketch attended the public schools of his native town until he was twelve years of age, after which he took a business course at the college of Bryant & Stratton. On completing his school education he occupied his boyhood days, usually passed by lads of his age in play, around the engines and machinery of his fathers' tugs in Algonac, and became so imbued with the desire of following up that branch of industry that he went down to Detroit and entered the employ of Samuel F. Hodge in order that he might learn the machinist's trade under the eyes of a master. After thoroughly learning the trade he went to Oscoda, Mich., and shipped as master of the tug Dave and Mose. In the spring of 1883 he purchased an interest in the tug Allie May, and sailed her, towing between Oscoda and Au Sable. He remained ashore during the early months of 1884, but toward the close of the season shipped as assistant engineer on the tug William B. Castle, and in 1885-86 occupied the same position on the steamer James P. Donaldson. During the winters of these years he worked in the shop of the Frontier Iron Works, and while in this employ they built the machinery of the propeller Oconto, afterward sunk in Niagara river; Mr. Blauvelt ran her for about two months after her machinery was placed in position. In the spring of 1887 he was appointed chief engineer on the steamer Sitka, of the Wilson Transit line, and that winter entered the employ of Christy & DeGraf, a well known firm of Detroit. In 1888, upon the invitation of Capt. Alexander McDougall, he went to Duluth, Minn., as superintending engineer, put the machinery into the first steam monitor Colgate Hoyt, and ran her that season. During the winter months he took charge of the engine department of the American Steel Barge Company's plant in Duluth.\n\nIn 1889 Mr. Blauvelt also put the machinery into the monitor J. L. Colby, and took her down to Boston by way of the St. Lawrence river, shooting the rapids, and arriving at that seaport with his boat in good condition. She plied for some time between Boston, Baltimore and New York. In August he was recalled to take charge of the machinery of the monitor C. W. Wetmore, which he took down to Philadelphia and around Cape Horn to Everett, on Puget Sound. The success or failure of this passage was commented on very widely, the knowing ones asserting that she was not seaworthy, and that she would never be heard from again. She left Philadelphia September 19, 1889, making good weather on the passage around the Horn, and good speed until she encountered a terrific storm off the Columbia river, in Oregon, the velocity of the wind being reported by the officers of the weather bureau to be 103 miles per hour. Here the monitor lost her rudder plates, but rode out the storm while in a helpless condition. The steamer Zambesa, passing, gave them a line and towed the boat to Astoria, at the mouth of the Columbia river, where the rudder was repaired. She then proceeded on her way to Everett, arriving there December 6, 1889.\n\nOn March 7, 1890, he left the Wetmore and returned to West Superior, to which city the American Steel Barge Company's plant had been removed, and again took charge of the engine department as superintending engineer. During the time he held this office he put the machinery into the monitors Pathfinder, Pillsbury, Washburn, Thomas Wilson, James B. Colgate, Samuel Mather, E. B. Bartlett, A. D. Thompson and Christopher Columbus, and brought them out on trial trips.\n\nIn 1893-94 our subject remained on the Christopher Columbus, taking her to Chicago, and engineering her in the passenger and excursion business during the World's fair, for which purpose she had been admirably constructed. She also plied between Chicago and Milwaukee. In the fall of 1894 he tendered his resignation to the Steel Barge Comany, and returned to the Pacific coast to place the electric plant and machinery in the steamer City of Everett, which he ran in the passenger and freight business in connection with the Panama Railroad Company. He remained on her through the season of 1895, plying between San Francisco and Panama. In the spring of 1896 Mr. Blauvelt removed to Buffalo, and was appointed chief engineer of the steel steamer Centurion, of 3,402 tons burden, owned by the Hopkins Steamship Company. He laid her up in Buffalo harbor at the close of navigation, and during the winter of 1896-97, he was appointed chief engineer of the steamship North Land, of the Northern Steamship Company, and finished the running season. In 1898 he retired from sea life, and accepted a position with the American Sugar Refining Company, of New York. He was fifteen issues of engineer's license, which include license for ocean-going steamers, and three issues of pilot license.\n\nIn June, 1895, Mr. Blauvelt was wedded to Miss Minona Lewis, of Springfield, Maine, the ceremony being performed in Seattle, Wash. Two children, Althea Minona and Roberta Victoria, have been born to this union.\n\nHENRY BLOECKER\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nHenry Bloecker, an accomplished machinist and engine builder, and an esteemed citizen and business man of Grand Haven, Mich., has perhaps had the honor of bringing out more marine engines than any engineer on the lakes. This arises from the fact that he has been a popular and enterprising builder of engines for steamboats during the last twenty years, and that he assumed charge of each when the steamer made her maiden trip, and it is but truth to say that all of the engines produced at the shop over which he had jurisdiction gave eminent satisfaction in every respect. His extensive practical know-ledge, added to rare mechanical ingenuity, common sense and remarkable powers of discrimination, all tended to the best results. He is a man of good presence, and has a strong, earnest face, expressing at once shrewdness, intelligence, good humor, kindness and liberality. He was born on September 6, 1845, in Holstein, Germany, and is the son of Marx and Margaret Bloecker, both of whom died in Germany, his father in 1847, and his mother in 1895. He was educated in the public schools of Holstein, where he also learned the machinist's trade, serving an apprenticeship of about four years.\n\nWhen he reached the age of twenty-two, Henry Bloecker left his home in Germany and came to the United States, going directly to Grand Haven, where he entered the employ of the Ottawa Iron Company as machinists, and worked at his trade in that place and Ferryburg for ten years. By economy and industry he was, in 1877, enabled to start in business on his own account, associating in the business Mr. Bryce, and this was known as the firm of Bryce & Bloecker, they carrying on a general machinist's and engine-building trade until 1881, when the establishment was destroyed by fire. This did not dampen Mr. Bloecker's industrial ardor, however, and he immediately resumed business, after building a new shop, under the firm name of Bryce, Bloecker & Co., this title remaining in force for two years, when Mr. Bryce sold his stock, and the title was changed to Henry Bloecker & Co., the new members of the company being H. B. and Christian Gallmeyer. Business was thus conducted until 1889, when Mr. Bloecker bought out both of his partners and carried on the business alone until March 20, 1895, when he was appointed United States local inspector of boilers for the Grand Haven district, an office which he was eminently qualified to fill, and which he held for some time.\n\nSocially, Mr. Bloecker is a Royal Arch Mason, and a member of the Beneficial Order of the Maccabees.\n\nOn April 17, 1868, Henry Bloecker was wedded to Miss Mary Glazat, daughter of Herman and Caroline Glazat, of Grand Haven, Mich. The children born to this union are Hugo, Fred, Robert, Paul, Emma, Ernest and Henry. The family homestead is in Grand Haven, Michigan.\n\nCAPTAIN DAVID BLOM\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nCaptain David Blom,, a business man of Holland, Mich., was born in that city, on May 2, 1869, son of Capt. Cornelius B. and Jane (Maries) Blom. His father was an owner and master of lake craft for many years, his last command being the schooner Tempest, and David has been conversant with marine matters from boyhood. After acquiring a liberal public-school education he engaged in gill-net fishing on Maratawa Bay and Lake Michigan, eventually selling his boats and nets to carry on business ashore, which he has conducted with good financial success. He has sailed as boy on the steamer City of Holland, as pilot on the Fanny Schreiber and Henry S. Brown, on Black Lake, and on the east shore of Lake Michigan, as master of the steamyacht Minnie S., which he purchased in the spring of 1898. After some practical experience and much study, Captain Blom went to Grand Haven, Mich., and applied to the United States local inspectors for a license to sail his own steamyacht, the Mamie S. He also had aspirations of becoming a master, in order that he might be competent to take practical charge of either or both ends of his charming yacht, and after solving the problems placed before him relative to the mysteries of marine engineering, he at once set to work to delineate the duties and emergencies of the full-fledged captain, all of which he accomplished to the satisfaction of the powers which preside over papers maritime. Thus at one sitting, or, more accurately speaking, without sleeping, Mr. Blom became possessed of both master's and engineer's papers, a notable achievement in the annals of the inspection service.\n\nCaptain Blom was married on November 22, 1890, to Miss Eva Kniffen, daughter of Fred and Fannie Kniffen, of Holland, Mich., and one daughter, Jeanette, has been born to this union. Their home is on West Seventh street, Holland. Socially the Captain is a member of the Order of Elks.\n\nCAPTAIN FRANK BLOOM\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nCaptain Frank Bloom, master of the Conemaugh, of the Anchor line, is one of the younger men on the lakes, who have of late become more prominent in its navigation. He is the youngest of the seven children of John C. and Nancy (Roberts) Bloom, of Wesleyville, Erie Co., Penn., at which place he was born, January 30, 1859.\n\nCaptain Bloom attended the village district school, and farmed until about seventeen years of age, when he set out for the oil fields, expecting, like many others in those days, to make a fortune. After two years' work there, however, he decided that steamboating was more lucrative, and in 1879 entered the service of the Anchor line as lookout on the Annie Young. From this comparatively humble position he has worked himself up to the highest point in marine circles on the lakes, at present serving as master of the Conemaugh, one of the finest steamers at present on the lakes. His record in order of progress is as follows: two years in the Annie Young as lookout and wheelsman; two years as wheelsman in the Alaska, and two more as second mate; second mate of the Lycoming one season; first mate of the Juniata four seasons, and of the Philadelphia one, just prior to the year she sank; he was then master of the Conestoga one season, and of the Conemaugh four, including 1897, thus rounding out a service of eighteen consecutive seasons with this line, with fourteen issues of license, quite an enviable record for a young man. Captain Bloom is a member of Keystone Lodge Royal Arcanum, No. 108, Erie.\n\nIn May, 1886, he was married to Miss Mary L. Brandon, of Erie, Penn., and they have three children: Harvey, Frank and Esther Mahala. The family residence is at Wesleyville, Erie Co., Pennsylvania.\n\nCHARLES A. BLOOMER\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nCharles A. Bloomer, formerly president of the Western Elevating Association, is a native of the Empire State, having been born May 15, 1818 at Scipio, Cayuga county, of Quaker heritage. He is a son of John and Tamma (Chamberlain) Bloomer, the former of whom was born in Westchester County, N. Y., and the latter near New Haven, Conn. The Bloomer family on both sides trace their ancestry back to early English colonists of Plymouth Rock. The education of Charles A. Bloomer was received in the common schools, and during his boyhood he lived successively in the counties of Cortland, Seneca and Ontario, to which his parents moved. While yet young he learned the trade of carpenter, millwright and contractor, and in 1852 removed to Rochester in order to establish himself there in the business of millwright. For several years he was thus engaged in the \"Flour City,\" where his skill at his trade led to his recognition as one of the ablest men in that line in the country.\n\nIn 1854, through some financial complications, Stephen Whitney, of New York, became virtually the owner of a chain of flouring-mills located at Oswego, Macedon, Rochester and Black Rock, and Mr. Bloomer was placed in charge of the property, with authority to lease, sell or operate, according to his own judgment, and it was while he held this trust that he rebuilt the Frontier Mills at Black Rock. In 1856 he became one of the lessees of the Exchange Mill at Rochester, operating it until 1862, in which year he removed to Buffalo to take charge of the construction of the elevator built that year by William Rankin, Alfred Ely and Ashley Hall. This elevator, after passing through the hands of several different owners, became the property of Greene & Bloomer in 1881, burned down in 1889, and was rebuilt in 1890. Mr. Bloomer became part owner of this elevator, and in 1890 was president of the company that owned the property. In 1885 Mr. Bloomer was chosen president of the Western Elevating Company, retaining the position until 1890, when he was succeeded by George Sowesby. The same year he became a stockholder and president of the Exchange Elevator Company, relations which he still sustains, the office of the company being at No. 66 Board of Trade Building. Mr. Bloomer's elder brother, Dexter C. Bloomer, has been for many years a prominent lawyer of Council Bluffs, Iowa, and another brother owns a fine farm and vineyard on the eastern slope of Seneca lake. Mr. Bloomer is a member of the Merchants Exchange, of the Young Men's Christian Association, of the Buffalo Library Association, of the Republican League and of the Delaware Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church, of which latter he has been a trustee and treasurer many years.\n\nOn October 15, 1839, Mr. Bloomer was married, in Newark, Wayne Co., N.Y., to Miss Cornelia Frear, and on October 15, 1889, they celebrated their fiftieth anniversary. Mrs. Bloomer died September 2, 1894. Mr. Bloomer has his home at No. 28 Orton Place, Buffalo, New York.\n\nTHOMAS J. BLUETT\n\nSource: History of the Great Lakes, Vol. 1 by J.B. Mansfield\n\nThomas J. Bluett was born in 1854 at Buffalo, N. Y., the only child of Thomas and Elizabeth Bluett, the former of whom was a cartman about the business portion of Buffalo for many years. He attended school in his native city, and began active life in the machine shop of Robert Dempster, where he remained several years, during four of which he was engaged learning his trade. He has also worked in the Erie railway shops, several small shops on Broadway, Buffalo, in the Ruger Cracker Machine Works, and with C. W. Whitman & Co. (formerly Donaldson & Polley), 178 Ohio street, where he was employed seventeen consecutive winters. Mr. Bluett's first experience in the lake service was as fireman on the steamer Starrucca, and he has since served as second engineer, respectively, of the following named steamers: Newburgh, Montana, Lehigh, Northerner, Tower, Fayette Brown, Commodore, John Rugel, Yokima, Albany, Thomas Adams, Robert E. Packer, Nebraska and Fred Mercur. He has also been chief engineer on the William H. Gilcher, Alfred P. Wright, Fred Mercur, Robert A. Packer and H. E. Packer, being on the latter for the season 1896, and transferring from that boat to the China, also as chief. Mr. Bluett has had two narrow escapes from death, and was in one collision, in 1886, when the steamer Lehigh, of the Anchor line, collided with the schooner Van Valkenburg off Thunder Bay light, sunk, and was afterward blown up; she was loaded with coal. He was second engineer of the steamer Albany the second trip before she was lost, and chief of the William H. Gilcher the same season she went down in Lake Michigan. Mr. Bluett is unmarried, and resides at No. 587 West avenue, Buffalo."}
{"text":"Sunday, February 24, 2013\n\nThe Samoan Paopao\n\nBorn in 1877 or thereabouts, Te Rangi H\u012broa, aka Sir Peter Henry Buck, was a\nhalf-English, half-Maori anthropologist who studied Maori and other\nPacific cultures. In his 1930 publication Samoan Material Culture(complete text here free), he described seven boat types of Samoa:\nthree based on dugout technology, and four of sewn-plank construction. Quoting\ndirectly from the source, these were:\n\nDugout Canoes 1. Paopao. The smallest dugout, with two outrigger booms, propelled by\npaddling.\n2. Soatau. A medium dugout, with three outrigger booms, propelled by\npaddling.\n3. 'Iatolima. The largest of the dugouts, with five outrigger booms,\ntopsides, bow and stern covers, and sail. Plank Canoes 4. Va'a alo. The bonito boat made of lashed planks, with two outrigger\nbooms connected with float, propelled by paddling.\n5. Amatasi. A plank canoe larger than the bonito boat, with two\noutrigger booms connected with the float, a platform over the booms, balancing\nspars on the right, and a mast for sailing.\n6. Taumualua. A wide plank canoe without outrigger, modelled originally\non whaleboat lines, idea foreign but technique native.\n7. 'Alia. The double voyaging canoe made of planks and consisting of\ntwo canoes lashed together.\n\nDue to the incursion of Western technologies and political\nadministration, only one of each category was still in use during his research:\nthe paopao and the va'a alo, although a few stray examples\nof some of the other types were still in existence, if no longer usable. Here\nwe'll look at the paopao; we may\naddress some of the other types in future posts.\n\nThe paopao, or\nsmall canoe, was a single-outrigger paddle-propelled dugout designed for one\nman, although it was capable of carrying two in a pinch. It was used exclusively\ninside the islands' surrounding reefs primarily for transportation and for fishing,\noften by trolling a hook. According to Te Rangi H\u012broa, the paopao was \"in\nactive general use throughout the (Samoan islands)\u2026and is an indispensible part\nof every male adult's equipment in life.\" To quote further:\n\nThe paopao canoes\nare made by the householders who are not expert carpenters. A master builder\nwhile enumerating the canoes made by the carpenters' guild omitted the paopao.\nOn my mentioning it, he smiled and said, \"The paopao is\nnot a canoe.\" Neither is it from the expert point of view. In the eyes of\nthe guild they rank with the cooking houses and are beneath their dignity to\nbuild.\n\nIn H\u012broa's\ntime, most or all of this home-grown boatbuilding was done with steel adzes.\n\nPaopao in plan and cross-section.\n\nThe main hull of the paopao\nhas a fascinating cross-section. The stem was heavy and vertical on the\noutside, and the hold was deepest at its forward end, gradually becoming\nshallower until it reached the rear outrigger boom, at which point the bottom\nsloped up sharply to meet the sheerline. The paddler sat aft of amidships, so\nhis weight raised the forward end and this resulted in approximately even draft\nalong the boat's length, but it also meant little freeboard aft. The knob at\nthe very end of the stern was used as a fastening point for a rope when\ntransporting the log from the forest to the boat's building site. It served no\nfurther function, but was retained as a decorative element.\n\nIn plan view, the hull was narrow, double-ended, and roughly\nsymmetrical fore and aft. Amidships, the hull was round in cross-section \u2013 i.e.,\nit was not expanded \u2013 so the greatest beam was some inches below the sheerline.\n(A 16'8\" LOA paopao hull measured\n14.5\" maximum beam.) Inwales were carved to provide a wider bearing surface\nfor the outrigger booms: as they weren't intended to contribute to stiffness, these\ninboard hull flanges did not continue into the ends.\n\nAs the boats were not sailed, outrigger booms were fairly\nshort: a measured 15-footer had booms 4'6\" and 4'7\" long. Each boom\nwas lashed to the hull through a single hole bored just below the inwale. The\nbooms were straight, and connected to the float by struts. The floats were long\nand pointed at the forward end, but cut off square just behind the aft support.\nFloats were aligned parallel with the main hull.\n\nBecause of the sloping run of the hull's bottom, the forward\nconnecting struts were longer than the aft struts. Two styles of struts were\nobserved:\n\n1. Paired rods: Each boom had two pairs or ironwood rods, with the top ends lashed directly to the boom. The upper\nends of the paired rods that were inboard of the float slanted inboard (i.e.,\ntoward the hull), while the rods outboard of the float sloped outboard. The\nbottom ends of the rods were sharpened and forced into holes bored on either\nside of the centerline on the top surface of the float. To make all fast, lashings\nwere passed over the boom and through holes bored transversely through a\nlongitudinal ridge standing proud on the upper surface of the float.\n\n2. Forked branches: Each boom had a Y-shaped connector: the\ntwo upper arms of the Y were lashed to the boom, and the sharpened bottom end\nwas inserted into a hole bored on the float's upper surface. The lashing method\nwas not recorded, but it may have been similar to that used for the other\nmethod.\n\nPaopao end decorations\n\nSome paopao had\ndecorative protrusions left standing proud on the upper surfaces of the solid\nends. Short sections of V-shaped serrations were also carved into the gunwales\nof some of the canoes just inboard of the solid ends. The seat was a simple\nplank that locked over the gunwale just forward of the aft outrigger boom, and\nit was removed when the boat was not in use. Where paopao were used for rod\nfishing, a forked rod rest would be lashed to the forward boom, while the\npole's butt end rested on the after boom.\n\n4 comments:\n\nRaises again why there is an apparent absence of outrigger use in Europe. Some double dugouts but no outriggers. There are some top planks with holes that could have mounted outriggers but as far as I know that is all.\n\nThe silly thing is that anyone paddling a canoe is aware of the support available from an extended paddle so the principle of the outrigger would be obvious from that, likewise the benefits from two canoes \"rafting\" up.\n\nOf course it possible that skin boats were used so extensively, sewn planks boats of stable breadth came in and only self-sustaining logboats were ever made so an actual need for outriggers never developed.\n\nIn many ways the development of the planked boat was the way forward for the creation of ocean-going ships. Skin and outrigger were wonderful dead ends.\n\nEdwin: My guess concerning the absence of the outrigger from Europe is that the leap of imagination simply didn't occur. As logical and self-evident as it appears to us, it required a new intellectual construct concerning the way a boat is \"supposed to work,\" and for whatever reason, no one came up with or properly developed that idea -- for the same non-evident \"reasons\" that North Americans never used the oh-so-obvious sail, and Pacific Islanders never used oars for propulsion"}
{"text":"Plattsburgh's Link to a Maritime Tragedy\n\nIn the past 200 years, a few ships have borne the name Plattsburg. In the War of 1812, there was the unfinished vessel at Sackets Harbor, a project abandoned when the war ended. There was the rechristened troop transport that hauled thousands of troops home from the battlefields of World War I. There was the oil tanker that saw service in the Pacific theater during World War II. And there was the cruise boat that plied the waters of Lake Champlain in 2003\u20134. One of them played a role in perhaps the most famous maritime disaster of all time. The unfinished ship at Sacket's Harbor had been designated the USS Plattsburg. The oil tanker was the Plattsburg Socony, which survived a horrific fire in 1944. Thirty-three years later, after two more re-namings, it split in two beneath 30-foot waves and sank off Gloucester. The cruise ship was the short-lived Spirit of Plattsburgh. But it is the USS Plattsburg from the First World War that holds a remarkable place among the best \"what if\" stories ever.\n\nIn early April 1917, just three days after the United States entered World War I, a merchant marine ship, the New York, struck a German mine near Liverpool, England. The damage required extensive repairs. A year later, the ship was chartered by the US Navy, converted into a troop transport, and newly christened the USS Plattsburg.\n\nBy the time the armistice was signed, ending the war in November of that same year, the Plattsburg had made four trips to Europe within six months, carrying nearly 9,000 troops of the AEF (American Expeditionary Forces) to battle.\n\nThe transport assignment continued, and in the next nine months, the Plattsburg made seven additional trips, bringing more than 24,000 American troops home. A few months later, the ship was returned to her owners, reassuming the name SS New York. After performing commercial work for a few years, the ship was scrapped in 1923.\n\nWhen the end came, the New York had been in service for 35 years. At its launch in 1888 in Glasgow, Scotland, it was named S.S. City of New York. The S.S. indicated it was a \"screw steamer,\" a steamship propelled by rotating screw propellers (City of New York was one of the first to feature twin screws). After service under the British merchant flag, the ship was placed under the US registry as the New York, where it served in like manner for five more years.\n\nIn 1898, the US Navy chartered the New York, renaming it Harvard for service during the Spanish-American War. It served as a transport in the Caribbean, and once plucked more than 600 Spanish sailors from ships that were destroyed off Santiago, Cuba. When the war ended, the Harvard transported US troops back to the mainland, after which it was decommissioned and returned to her owners as the New York.\n\nA few years later, the ship was rebuilt, and from 1903\u20131917, it was used for routine commercial activities around the world. In April 1912, the New York was at the crowded inland port of Southampton, England. It wasn't the largest ship docked there, but at 585 feet long and 63 feet wide, it was substantial.\n\nTowering above it at noon on the 10th of April was the Titanic. At 883 feet long, it was the largest man-made vessel ever built. This was launch day for the great ship, and thousands were on hand to observe history. The show nearly ended before it started.\n\nNo one could predict what would happen. After all, nobody on earth was familiar with operating a vessel of that size. Just ahead lay the Oceanic and the New York, and as the Titanic slowly passed them, an unexpected reaction occurred.\n\nThe Titanic's more than 50,000-ton displacement of water caused a suction effect, and the New York, solidly moored, resisted. It rose on the Titanic's wave, and as it dropped suddenly, the heavy mooring ropes began to snap, one by one, with a sound likened to gunshots. The New York was adrift, inexorably drawn towards the Titanic. A collision seemed inevitable.\n\nHuge ships passing within 50 to 100 feet of each other might be considered a close call. In this case, desperate maneuvers by bridge personnel and tug operators saved the day (unfortunately). The gap between the two ships closed to only a few feet (some said it was two feet, and others said four). Had they collided, the Titanic's maiden voyage would have been postponed.\n\nNo one can say for sure what else might have happened, but a launch delay would have prevented the calamity that occurred a few days later, when the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank within hours, claiming more than 1,500 lives.\n\nThere you have it. A ship that bore four names\u2014City of New York, Harvard, New York, and Plattsburg\u2014is forever tied to the fascinating, tragic story of the Titanic.\n\nPhoto Top: USS Plattsburg at Brest France 1918.\n\nPhoto Middle Right: L to R: The Oceanic, New York, and Titanic in Southampton harbor.\n\nPhoto Middle Left: The tug Vulcan struggles with the New York to avoid a collision.\n\nPhoto Bottom: The New York (right) is drawn ever closer to the Titanic.\n\nLawrence Gooley has authored eight books and several articles on the North Country's past.

Thought for Today: \"Goodwill is the only asset that competition cannot undersell or destroy.\" \u2014 Marshall Field, department store founder (1834-1906).\n\nFriday, January 15, 2010\n\nLook, our brain is a bit more damaged than usual, & we can't conceive of anything to type that's the least bit clever, thought-provoking or nuthin', no how. Fortunately, we can aggregate, if not aggravate.\n\nOver Christmas, my brother and I paid a visit to the other side of our family. They live as far as they can from an urban center, and are distrustful of \"citified\" people, though they make an exception for my side of the family, even if we are looked upon as somewhat freakish. They are Red Staters trapped in a Blue State (Washington), and resent it. They are nominally Christian.\n\nNone (save one 2nd cousin, who has run away to attend the university I tutor at in the city) have graduated from high school, having left early to take up some form of manual labor. One of my cousins, a meth addict, disappeared years ago in Idaho. Another, a year younger than I (47) is a grandmother dying of cirrhosis of the liver. Another cousin has three daughters, all of whom are on welfare, have multiple kids from different men, spend their days playing video games when not getting new tattoos and tramp stamps at the nearest mall. All are obese and chain-smoke.*All routinely refer to President Obama as \"the nigger.\"\u2020 All watch Fox News in between bouts of video games.\n\nSome of them have seen jail. Two of my cousins had been, up until a few years ago, given to reading romance novels and lurid true-crime books. They now have taken to buying the books of Hannity, Coulter, et al.\n\nOn this visit, we found that Sarah Palin's book had become the Christmas gift of choice for most of them. Whether they've read it or not, she was the primary topic of their conversation. They adore her. \"She speaks like us,\" one aunt said, almost tearfully. \"She's one of us.\" Their anger, impotent at the moment, seems to be growing. My brother and I made a hasty retreat out, as we were neither of us in the mood to engage these family members in debate. Why? To what end? But nor could we just stay and listen to these deluded, rambling speeches. Worse, we felt chilled by the experience.\n\nThe next American revolution really will be led by an ignorant rabble with pitchforks.\n\nWe doubt if most of these lumps will leave the couch & their video games for the revolution, but what a wonderful portrait of the real \"Real\" America.\n\n*Nothing wrong w\/ those two. What up w\/ this snooty citified elitest?\n\n\u2020Juxtaposed against the \"life-style\" mentioned, we are laughing extra-hard.\n\n\"We are a movement of the plain people, very weak in the matter of culture, intellectual support, and trained leadership. We are demanding, and we expect to win, a return of power into the hands of the everyday, not highly cultured, not overly intellectualized, but entirely unspoiled and not de-Americanized, average citizen of the old stock ... \" - Dr. Hiram Wesley Evans, (1881 - 1966) in a statement issued by him in 1926 in his role as the Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nI found the quote in a 1973 issue of Commentary, in a brutal excavation of the cultural roots of the Watergate scandal. The same magazine, now run by a dauphin of the neocon nepotism-tree, now celebrates the very things it once had the decency to oppose.\n\nAnd now, the rest of the story: Working on our second cup of coffee, we somehow managed to get a serious gulp down the air-pipe, resulting in a sudden loss of ability to breathe. Staggering to our feet, we headed to the bathroom, hoping to spew out the offending liquid. Next thing we know, we're on the floor, coming to, & hearing some idjit on the tee vee. So we gather our thoughts, & wonder for a moment why we're listening to the telebision while lying on the floor. Then we remember, & wonder why our face is wet.\n\nNo idea of what we beaned ourself on (no blood anywhere but our face) but judging from the straight, even cut, we'll guess the raised lid of the toilet. What if we'd fallen face-down into the toilet, & drowned? That would've been really funny.\n\nHey I love the blog. I've been looking for more information on Downtown San Diego Real Estate and I was wondering if you have any good tips or pointers? I'm getting ready to move and I need all the information I can get. Thanks!\n\nWe've already given them a verbalized death threat on their 800 #. A world-wide campaign of threats & anger can only teach these scum a lesson. Mailing of rotten fish, dead rodents & used sanitary products would probably give them a good idea of the people's reaction to their heinous activity, as will threatening 'phone calls. (We're contemplating a bus ride south, to investigate how easily certain windows break.)\n\nDowntown San Diego Real Estate! An obvious scam. Criminals, is what they are!\n\nEven more frightening than the low-information voter is the low-information state representative. From Skull Valley:\n\nRep. Judy Burges, R-Skull Valley, is crafting a measure to require anyone running for president or vice president to provide proof to the Arizona Secretary of State's Office that they are legally eligible to seek the office. The U.S. Constitution requires the president - and, by extension, the vice president - to be \"a natural born citizen.\"\n\nMore to the point, Burges would require the secretary of state to verify, independently, that the information is accurate.\n\n\"And if it's not certifiable, then that person's name would not go on the ballot,\" she said.\n\nBurges told Capitol Media Services the measure is not necessarily about Obama, though she admitted she has her doubts that he was born in Hawaii as he claims and, even if so, that he can show he is a U.S. citizen.\n\n\"With what's happening throughout the world, we need to make sure that our candidates are certifiable,\" she said.\n\nWe'll name you one right now.\n\nBurges did not support Obama and is not a fan. And she said if, in fact, he is not a \"natural born\" citizen, that makes him suspect.\n\n\"When someone bows to the king of Saudi Arabia and they apologize for our country around the world, I have a problem with that,\" she said.\n\n[...]\n\nThe two-term lawmaker said her concerns remain about having a president whose citizenship - and, by her reckoning, loyalty - is not clear.\n\n\"We want to make sure that we have candidates that are going to stand up for the United States of America,\" Burges said.\n\n\"This is my home. I want to leave my children a better country than I inherited. And the only way I can do that is what I can do as a state legislator.\"\n\nBurges said her suspicions about Obama go beyond that well-publicized bow in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"Obama has a book and it said, when it came down to it, he would be on the Muslim side,\" Burges continued. \"Doesn't that bother you just a little bit?\"\n\nThe quote comes from Obama's book, \"The Audacity of Hope,\" in which he writes about conversations with immigrant communities following the 2001 terrorist attacks, especially Arab and Pakistani Americans. Obama said they were fearful over detentions and FBI questioning and were concerned about the historical precedent.\n\n\"They need specific assurances that their citizenship really means something, that America has learned the right lessons from the Japanese internments during World War II, and that I will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction,\" Obama wrote.\n\nToday is Friday, Jan. 15, the 15th day of 2010.

Bonus ThoughtThursday, January 14, 2010\n\nThere are other necessary expenses, like the large sums you're forced to spend on your loved ones. Who needs it? I've recently discovered that simply denying to further support my mother has caused her to be transferred from that crappy nursing home to an even crappier state-run facility. Now my monthly \"Mom\" costs have dropped down to $0. Why doesn't everyone do this?\n\nWere your ass sweet (We're sure it isn't, so don't.) you could safely fucking bet it that your editor is catching up on his R.E.M. (Not the as-shitty American version of U2, mind you.) sleep when such inane crap as C-SPAN's \"Washington Journal\" is polluting Yankee cable systems & satellite services.\n\nWe are not kidding about the polluting, either, as one Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlanticnotes:\n\nC-Span's \"Washington Journal\" is inundated with anti-Semitic and racist callers, and most hosts are similarly robotic in their responses to these bigots. So there is obviously a deep problem here, one that should be addressed publicly.\n\nThe item's real point is that C-SPAN won't reply to Goldberg's queries about this interesting phenomenon, rendering them less than transparent.\n\nI just want the chance to explore your network's policies with you. This is obviously a problem for C-Span -- I've heard from a number of colleagues (mainly Jewish) who will no longer agree to go on \"Washington Journal\" because of the frequency of insulting, anti-Semitic callers (I myself stopped going on the show after one caller said, \"I can tell by looking at you that you're Jewish,\" and then proceeded downhill from there. The host in that instance also did not end the call.)\n\nBear this in mind when you next encounter a religious reactionary whining about how persecuted Christians are when the government refuses to execute homos for being gay.\n\nWe also wonder if this is related to C-SPAN's insistence that callers segregate themselves by \"Democratic,\" \"Republican,\" & \"Independent\" lines.\n\nGoldberg's opening sentence is worth a quibble, though:\n\nEver since a host for C-Span's \"Washington Journal\" allowed an obviously bigoted caller to discuss how America was \"jewed\" into Iraq, I've been trying to get an interview with C-Span's vice-president for programming, Terry Murphy.\n\n\"Jewed\" is not the verb we would have used, but somebody sure as fuck pushed us into the illegal invasion of Iraq, & it wasn't Hindoos & animists. No, we aren't suggesting use of \"neo-con\" as a euphemism for \"Jew.\" As a rootless cosmopolitan ourself, we have plenty of admiration for the more rootless & cosmic of our Hebrew cousins. And plenty of room to condemn those who have roots & are excessively parochial. Meaning you all, Kristols & Podhoretzs.\n\nC-SPAN HOST ROBB HARLSTON: Lets take a 2nd call from Atlanta. This one on our line for Democrats. You're on the Washington Journal.\n\nCALLER: How you doing this morning?\n\nHARLSTON: Just fine Sir, go ahead.\n\nCALLER: Okay. Listen, I feel we need to come to the problem- to the root of the problem - and I think the Jews that's actually there in Palestine - they are pretended Jews. It's just like white folks from South Africa (indistinct) but they went over and took the people's land, language and their culture and then called themselves South Africans. There was Jews already over there in that land. They were darkey Jews. These European Jews - they are pretended Jews. They are the scum of the planet Earth and they are just like their father, the Devil.\n\nPlus which:\n\nCALLER: \"Good morning. What I want to say is that Iran has the full right to test anything they want in their land. The only problem with Iran and the only reason that the media here puts a lot of attention on Iran is that they are anti-Zionist, which Zionism is a theology or methodology of ethnically cleansing the Christians and Muslim Palestinians from Palestine to make it a Jewish majority state called Israel. You call it \"Israel,\" I call it the \"fourth reich\" and the \"fourth reich\" controls the media here and so they set the agenda on what is important and they keep fear mongering people about Iran.\"\n\nC-SPAN HOST PAUL ORGEL: \"Should Israel be concerned over its security with Iran apparently having the ability to strike it?\"\n\nCALLER: \"Well, if you notice how insecure Hitler was, the Third Reich was, because they had bad intentions - Hitler had bad intentions - for he was always insecure about Russia and everybody against him. Because he was out against everybody - Hitler was. The same thing with the Jews. They are against everybody.\".\n\nMuch idle & cliched chit-chat concerning the \"dignity\" of the dead, specifically in Haiti, but one hears this crap often enough.

In fact, the slugs incorporate the genetic material so well, they pass it on to further generations of slugs.\n\nThe babies of thieving slugs retain the ability to produce their own chlorophyll, though they can't carry out photosynthesis until they've eaten enough algae to steal the necessary chloroplasts, which they can't yet produce on their own.\n\nThank you so fucking much, Bill Gates.

As a precondition to doing business in China, several years ago Microsoft was required to provide the government the source codes for the company's Office software. The Chinese State Planning Commission contended that Microsoft's Windows operating system was a secret tool of the U.S. government and demanded Microsoft instruct Chinese software engineers on inserting their own software into Window's applications.\n\nThat gave the Chinese Army's cyberwarfare department what computer hackers dub a \"skeleton key,\" allowing them access to almost every networked private business, military, and government computer in the U.S. Among the Chinese Army-backed Microsoft attacks, the FBI report includes successful forays against computer systems at the State Department, Commerce Department, the FBI, and the Naval War College, among others.\n\nCome on, when are we going to haul the Redmond Reds before a treason tribunal?\n\nGoogle threatened to end its operations in China after it discovered that the e-mail accounts of human rights activists had been breached.\n\nThe company said it had detected a \"highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure originating from China.\" Google says further investigation revealed that \"a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists.\" GooglePatch sketches a range of threats, from explosives-laden small boats to cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. He particularly emphasizes the danger posed by crafty, bloody-minded extremists. For one, \"carrier crew size and diversity would likely allow unfettered access to clandestine infiltrators of almost any ethnicity,\" Patch writes.\n\nIn other words, because there are so many people on carriers \u2014 up to 5,000 \u2014 some of them are bound to be brown-skinned. And the presence of brown-skinned sailors could make it easier for Islamic terrorists to sneak on board and sabotage the ship.\n\nSo how would one defend against such infiltration? Patch doesn't say, but the implication, however indirect, is clear: fewer non-white sailors would help. In implying, even vaguely, that racial integration has weakened the carrier force, Patch plays into a sea swell of race anxiety in the Navy that outsiders rarely observe. Many in the Navy are unhappy with what they see as affirmative action gone out of control, to the detriment of our national security. \"What core competency of the Navy is a diverse Navy supposed to represent?\" blogger CDR Salamander asked.\n\nToday is Tuesday, Jan. 12, the 12th day of 2010.

{"text":"On January 2nd, my nephew and his family were back in town visiting, and we went with them and my sister and bro-in-law down to Branson to the Titanic Museum. No photos were allowed inside, but here's a shot of the outside of the museum. Now, I know in these parts that Branson can be a bit of a joke, perpetuating the hillbilly stereotypes of living in the Ozarks, but I have to say, this museum was outstanding.\nAs you're standing in line to get your tickets, you're given a \"passport\" of an actual passenger that tells the back story of their personal lives. One of the Titanic historical societies did all the research to provide this information for the museum. As you walk through, you look for the name of your passenger on relics and mementos that were salvaged from the wreckage, and at the very end, you find your passenger's name on a wall to learn his or her fate.\nThere's definitely something for everyone, from the science explaining how the \"unsinkable\" ship met its doom, to costumes and other items from the movie set, to a tub of water where you can immerse your arm at the actual temperature of the Atlantic waters that night. (I kept my hand in the tub for 45 seconds, outlasting everyone else in our group. It's no wonder so many died of hypothermia.)\nOne of the exhibits that really touched me was a trunk recovered from the bottom of the ocean, with a blouse, a hair comb, and a small purse. They identified the items as belonging to a second-class passenger, and determined that she'd probably sold everything to obtain her ticket on the \"ship of dreams\" to bring her to America. The commentary said that she'd be surprised to learn that her meager belongings were now valued at over $35,000.\nAnother exhibit showed letters exchanged back and forth between a widow and the White Star Line, with the widow finally giving up on having her husband's body recovered and sent back home for burial. She couldn't afford it, and with all the other claims, White Star couldn't either.\nThe last thing that was particularly striking to me was a letter or telegram (I can't remember now), possibly from Bruce Ismay to White Star trying to silence the news about the sinking, stating something to the effect that no one would want to remember what happened.\nIf you're wanting to go, shop around for discount tickets; although it was a great experience, it was much better knowing we'd only paid half price."}
{"text":"Caput,\nGood distinction on Caen and with regard to the partisan issue. I hadn't fully understood the concept as a giant raid, rather than a D-Day type invasion designed to hold territory.\nIn a related note, I dug up an essay on San Francisco's [link= defenses[\/link]. Couldn't find anything on Portland, though--I assume there weren't any twin-16\" gun mounts like San Francisco seems to have had. In any event, having visited the museum of coastal defence in Hong Kong, the Japanese had some prior experience in avoiding direct confrontations with heavy coastal artillery.\n\nComrade, in this regard of the abilities of merchant vessels, it is worth remembering that worldwide, the speed of merchants was an average of 7.8 knots. (Estimate prepared for Tenth Fleet, which was responsible for the Atlantic seaboard, February, 1942).\n\nIt's not the speed I was thinking about, but rather about how well they could handle long voyages, how much they could carry and whether they had a chance of surviving an attack by a submarine.\nI'd say it wouldn't really effect the Japanese situation in China if the armies in that area would be supplied by older vessels, keeping in mind that in this scenario there would not be any allied interdiction of that area.\n\nORIGINAL: Caput\nThe obvious first question is why in the world would Japan want to invade the Pacific Northwest. Aside from natural beauty of course, a number of posters have already pointed out that the area had little to offer the Japanese from a resource or industrial standpoint. The cost of occupation is going to easily outweight any production you might see, especially when you factor in the poor local infrastructure, the unwilling populous, and the long shipping time back to the home country. I'd also say that outside of speculative fiction, its none to likely that Japan would then have the strength to march further east and conquer the rest of the US. Too large a disparity in industrial base, with the majority of US industry concentrated in the east, which is a heck of a long trip from Japan. So I think it would be safer to assume that Japanese conquest of the Pacific Northwest would be aimed either at achieving a peace settlement with favorable consessions (and sapping the US's will to fight), or perhaps as a coastal base of operations in a continuing naval war in the eastern pacific. Or finally, perhaps as a grander version of the invasion of the Aleutians. I think foreign soldiers occupying US cities would have had a galvanizing effect... in the context of WW2, this could provide the european axis powers a little breathing room, as the invasion of Europe is put on hold until after the liberation of Seattle.\nI think in the pre WW2 time frame, Japan would also need the help of another naval power, or at least US entanglement elsewhere. Even if you assume the Japanese achieve destruction of the entire US Pacific Fleet, they still need keep the remainer of the US Navy busy somehow. I agree with other posters, the logistics are daunting, and the sealanes between Japan and Seattle need to be completely secure, and that will be hard to accomplish if the Atlantic Fleet is still available (or the British Asiatic Fleet.. they can't be too keen on having the area adjacent to British Columbia invaded). So I think we're basically at the point of needing to invent an 2nd 1920's war to create enough turmoil that our invasion is possible.\nSo rather than speculate an entirely new war, lets stick to the one we have, WW2. Assume the Japanese victory at Pearl Harbor is total. The battleship fleet AND the carriers are all out of action. This is quickly followed up by an invasion of Midway and Hawaii, which happens to also capture a large portion of the US submarine fleet. I think the obvious next move have been to consolidate things throughout Asia, perhaps invading Australia as well. Get that 'Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere' thing really going. But lets say the Japanese don't see it that way. They know the US is down, but not out, and they want the US totally knocked out of the pacific war. If humiliation in Hawaii wouldn't do it, perhaps bombers over Hollywood would? (G4M Betty could reach LA or Denver from Seattle\/Portland).\nA little research on Wiki shows that Japan had a prewar merchant fleet of about 6,800,000 tons. Assume most of the fleet is needed in the Pacific moving raw materials, but 10% could be pulled to supply an invasion garrison, giving us 680,000 tons. Tokyo to Seattle is about 8000 nautical miles round trip, or about 1000 hrs @ 8kts, or about 42 days. Lets call it two months round trip, due loading\/unloading and forming up convoys (while we're at it, lets assume that Japanese ASW is competent). So we can move about 340,000 tons\/month. Some quick googling shows that a combat division in ww2 required anywhere from 100-600 tons\/day. I think we can safely pick 200 tons\/day, since after the initial invasion I think our Japanese army will be hunkered down in the favorable mountain terrain. In addition, some of the foodstuffs can be gotten locally, possibly from Japanese fishing fleets now based out of Seattle. So 6000 tons\/month for a division. With that kind of consumption, the Japanese could comfortably maintain over 40 divisions, though 25 might be a more realistic number, since some supply will go towards airpower and naval replenishment. 25 still isn't too bad, given that the Japanese army strength in 1941 was about 41 division (27 of which were committed to China\/Manchuria). So, I'm surprised, but I think if Japan could establish secure lines of communication, manpower limitations would be more important than logistics. But even 10 divisions would be pretty formidable against a reeling 1942 US army (26 divisions).\nAnyway, it's fun speculation. My calculations are all back of the envelope type stuff, if anyone sees any errors or grossly incorrect assumptions, feel free to call me on it.\n\nThere is a lot of oil in California.\n\n\"Question with boldness even the existence of God; because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason than that of blindfolded fear\" --Thomas Jefferson\n\nCertainly less discovered then than now... and much of it offshore, for which there was almost no technology for in 1940.. much less than 1930.\nThe DEI will always present a more lucrative opportunity for resources than California.\n\nWell, I just lost a mile-long post on the topic, but I'm a longwinded blowhard anyway, so let me try to summarize.\n1) When discussing historical hypotheticals, it's important to ask \"What would need to happen for this to be feasible?\" Otherwise, we just argue all the reasons why and why not all day long.\n2) If we assume the Japanese conduct of WW II did not change dramatically, there's no way they could have mounted anything in 1942. There are a lot of reasons for this:* We're all sorely understimating the Japanese commitment in China. The largest share of their army, as well as their logistical abilities, were aimed there. The Japanese--like everybody else in Asia--had spent the last 1,000 years worrying about Chinese imperialism. They had a lot more reason to pick a fight with China than with the US, which is what they did.\n* It's worth remembering that the Allies agreed from the start that Hitler was their top priority. If their had been a real threat of a Japanese invasion of the mainland, it's much more feasible that Torch would have been postponed or cancelled, than that the Japanese would have occupied America East of the Sierra-Nevadas.* Folks suggesting that American civilians would have taken arms against the Japanese Army and made a dent are fooling themselves. They would have been a nuisance, possibly tying up Japanese reserves to keep supply lines open, but no more. Japanese reprisals against armed resistance by American civilians would have been bone-chilling. Cities like Nanking and Manila both bear vivid testimony to the Japanese military's flagrant disregard for civilian life, and neither of those attrocities were committed under orders (not exactly). The retribution that an eventually-fully armed and industrialized America would have extracted from the Japanese simply chills my blood (our firebombings of Japanese cities weren't exactly gentle, but they would have been only the tip of the iceberg if the Japanese had perpetrated a Nanking on Seattle or Sacramento).\n* As has been pointed out elsewhere in this thread, the inter-service cooperation between the Japanese Army and Navy was horrendous throughout WW II. Too much inflexible [i]bushido [\/i]bullshit to cut through on both sides. The samurai ethic was awesome for building a warrior culture, but very poor at handling the kind of interdisciplinary and logistical challenges needed for an undertaking like the invasion of the US.\n* There are no forward bases between Hawaii and the West Coast. It's 2,300 miles to California from Hawaii and over 5,000 miles from the West Coast. The US had a whole range of bases well within striking distance of the Japanese mainland; the Japanese had none. (I'm not counting the Farralone Islands--the Japanese don't invade bird sanctuaries and I don't think the 30 miles shorter supply line would have made much difference!\n\n)\n* OneFor all these reasons, I just don't see how the Japanese could have mounted any kind of successful assault on the US at any point in the 40s. They had bigger fish to fry closer to home, and they weren't even able to take care of those.\nThey might have tried something, but it would have been much smaller in scope, or would have had to come at an earlier point in time (had history taken an alternate path).\n\nOne\nNow that is interesting.\nWas there a sizable communist\/socialist movement in Cali during the 30's & 40's? How many card-carriers would there have been? Enough to form a resistance?\n\n\"I love Anne Hathaway and her penchant for nudity.\" -The Dawg of Metal\nAn invasion of European colonies wouldn't be as taxing on the Japanese fleet as operations around Midway with an active enemy fleet.\nThe main issue for the Japanese would be focus: they should not be attacking towards Madagascar, attempt to conquer China, try to invade Australia and possibly invade US territory all at the same time. In this case, the discussion has assumed that the Japanese focus on China and the western US.\n\nHow many air force bases, planes and factories were in the western US at this time?\nIt is likely that the Japanese would also move land based aircraft to the area as soon as possible, and about 3\/4 of the Japanese carrier fleet would be able to support a fairly impressive \"umbrella\" until the arrival of those land based planes.\n\nThat argument would be true if they tried, but they didn't. The Japanese were still busy with their own island hopping campaign to secure access to Australia. That campaign ran out of steam on New Guinea when the Japanese tried to kick the Allies out of Port Moresby.\nIt's not entirely reasonable to assume that the logistical challenge would be less: considering that the larger cities were scattered, and that there was not enough modern infrastructure to support a large scale offensive, an invasion of Australia (don't forget that it's a country [i]and[\/i] a continent for a reason: it's huge) would pose more of a logistical challenge than an invasion of a few of the larger cities on the US west coast.\n\nComrade, we're all getting so hypothetical here, it's hard to argue too many specifics and prove anybody right or wrong, but let me throw out a few thoughts:\n* In terms of my \"ship fatigue\" argument, it was really targeted at Japanese troop transports and cargo ships, moreso than the warships (although the warships had been operating at a torrid pace as well). For argument's sake, I'll grant that, if the US carriers had all been sunk at Pearl, the Japanese carrier force could be in a high state of readiness and ready to hold their stations for extended periods. Their transports, however, would not have been in the same state of readiness. What none of us here have any hard data on is \"just how busy Japanese transports and cargo ships were maintaining the status quo\". But I still stand by my argument that Japanese transports and cargo ships would have faced some serious challenges making the 10,000-mile round trip from Tokyo to the US West Coast.\n* I think your assertion that the Japanese carrier fleet could have provided an effective \"umbrella\" and produced aerial superiority for any period of time is simplistic and ill-founded. To invoke shades of another poster in a similar argument about SeaLion a few weeks ago, you've tried to dismiss that with a simple \"wave of a magic wand\". Naval doctrine at the time and the sheer number of planes that the US had available by mid-1942 to defend the West Coast give the lie to that. The Japanese grasped the importance of land-based airpower in securing naval operations better than the Allies in the early months of the war, but the evidence was pretty overwhelming to both sides. It's simply too much easier to repair, resupply, and repopulate airfields, compared to carriers.\n* For argument's sake, I'll grant that most of the Japanese carrier force could have made it to the West Coast in a high state of readiness by mid-1942. However, even if we assume no Japanese carrier casualties, the research I can find yields 6 CVs (Kaga, Akagi, Hiryu, Soryu, Zukaku and Shokaku) and 2 CVLs (Ryujo and Zuiho) carrying a total of 561 planes as of July 1st, 1942. It seems a bit pessimistic to assume that the Japanese would sink all 6 American CVs that were in operation at the start of the war (Hornet, Yorktown, Enterprise, Saratoga, Lexington, and Wasp--the last on station in the Atlantic in 1941), but if we assume that they sank 4 of the 5 on duty in the Pacific at the outbreak of hostilities (I don't think there were more than 3 stationed at Pearl Harbor, but I'm being conservative in my argument) and the Wasp was transferred back to Pacific waters, that still leaves the US 2 CVs with 164 planes as of mid-1942. A detailed treatment of this topic can be found at [link=\n* According to the USAF records, by mid-1942, it looks as though the US Army Air Force (this ignores the USN and planes shipped to allies) had ~1,000 4-Engine Bombers, ~1,200 2-Engine Bombers, 600 Light Bombers, and 2,300 Fighters. You can get more specifics at everybody's most authoritative historical source, Wikipedia!\n\n[link= We can conservatively assume that only 3\/4 of those heavy bombers would be stationed in defense of the West Coast and we can further assume that only 2\/3 could reach a Japanese landing site (it's 1,100 miles \"as the crow flies\" from the southernmost to the northernmost tip of the US West Coast, and those planes had a full range of 2,100 miles or more). That yields about 500 heavy bombers a day, facing a Japanese carrier-based air force composed of 561 total aircraft. Even if we ignore the twin-engined bombers, and the fighter escorts, and the single engine dive-bombers, exactly how would the Japanese go about establishing an \"aerial umbrella\" to protect their ships as they unloaded? Without radar?\n* It seems probable to me to suggest that those 2 US carriers not sunk at Pearl Harbor would not have been committed in a frontal assault to stop the Japanese at sea, but rather used to harass Japanese supply lines (~2,300 miles from Hawaii to the West Coast) once a landing happened. It seems ludicrous to suggest that 561 Japanese aircraft--with the nearest replacements 2,000 miles away in Hawaii--could have sustained aerial supremacy against several thousand ground-based US planes on the West Coast, but even if I grant that they could, who would guard the Japanese supply lines against marauding US carrier fleets? And, if the Japanese CVs and CVLs are filling American skies w\/warplanes while simultaneously guarding Japanese supply lines, how will they ferry fighter planes to the newly captured airfields in the US? Transporting them via freighter takes much longer, and it seems far-fetched to suggest that the Japanese could have had fighter planes operating out of US airbases in less than a month--airbases that would have been bombed flat before the Japanese had any planes based their.\n* In terms of airbases, I don't have numbers at my fingertips, but there was no shortage of them. Much of California east and west of the Sierras is flat, isolated desert and had a good number of \"underused\" airports that could have been easily expanded. If there's one thing Americans could do well that early in the war, it was pouring concrete. Washington and Oregon are a bit less flat than California, but still afford plenty of places to build an airstrip. I'm sure the Japanese could have bombed some of those bases, but they can only fly so many sorties a day, and it's unclear to me that they would have had much success. Just after the two, highly successful raids against Pearl Harbor, the Japanese had 10% of planes either shot down or unable to take off. They couldn't have sustained this attrition long enough to make a dent in US airbases on the West Coast. I did mention that the US would likely have had >1,000 fighters in operation by then, along with a sophisticated radar network, didn't I?\n* In terms of production facilities, they were spread all over the country. B-17 production facilities were mostly on the West Coast (Long Beach, CA and and Seattle), but B-24 production facilities were coming fully online by 1941 and were headquartered across the US (mostly in Michigan and Ohio, I believe). Smaller planes were produced in more diverse locations across the country--smaller planes required smaller production facilities for final assembly and smaller runways for take-off. A lot of it was concentrated in the automative manufacturing centers in the middle of the US (again, Michigan, Ohio, etc.), but by war-end, there had been a huge explosion of airplane production in CA and many other places.\nI just don't see how the Japanese could have protected their cargo ships and troop transports, much less sustained long-term aerial supremacy. The US military was a shadow of its final self in the early years of the war, but even that small shadow utterly dwarfed the Japanese capabilities to project power across the entire Pacific Ocean.\n\nTheir transports, however, would not have been in the same state of readiness. What none of us here have any hard data on is \"just how busy Japanese transports and cargo ships were maintaining the status quo\".\n\nEvery bit of data I have, mostly on casualties to submarine attacks and how effective the Japanese supply link to the troops in the Dutch East Indies was without naval or aerial supremacy points to the conclusion that the Japanese would have a difficult time without any of these conditions.\nHowever, the amount of Allied submarines in the area would be quite low (where would they be sailing from and how would they cover the Pacific from Japan to the US?) and the Japanese would only have to worry about planes.\nAs to the argument of the \"waving of a magic wand\": the roles are more or less reversed now, as you're throwing thousands of planes at \"my\" naval force (in the argument), whilst in the discussion about Sealion I was throwing thousands of planes at the Royal Navy. One of the conclusions from that debate was simply that we can't guess\/estimate accurately what all those planes would be able to do, simply because there is no historical example.\nIn this specific scenario, inexperienced American pilots would face the veteran pilots of the Japanese carrier fleet and land based planes shipped to the US on transports. I'd say it's safe and fair to assume the US would send most of its best troops to stop the Japanese either in the Pacific or on the West Coast itself, so the Japanese would not be facing mostly veterans after the landing (the US Army didn't have many veterans in general, whilst the Japanese had been effectively at war for over 5 years at this point, with the majority of the Army veterans being in China). If the effectiveness of veteran pilots against a naval force is difficult to guess\/estimate, doing the same for an attack by an inexperienced force on naval force with veteran air cover is even more difficult.\nFor the sake of the discussion, let's say every escort carrier and similar smaller carriers are busy with the British and the Dutch and Australians in or around the Pacific. That leaves the Japanese with around 500 carrier-based planes in the area.\nI agree that we should limit the amount of US carrier losses to three or possibly four, as the carrier force was not located entirely on the West Coast. However: the carriers on the East Coast would have a very hard time with getting to the West Coast, as the Panama Canal is a death trap in this scenario, so they would have to sail around the South American continent (with many neutral countries in the area, which would make refueling more difficult as they can't stay in the same port for long due to international law on warships of a combatant in neutral ports).\nThe US would be theoretically able to counter the 500 or so planes of the carrier fleet with around 4000 planes of its own, as your statistics indicate. However: the Japanese planes would all be in the same spot and could defend an area at the same time, it would be logistically impossible for the US to do the same. The effect of heavy bombers on even a moderately prepared, mostly infantry, force is negligible in any case as the Allied experiences in Italy and Normandy have shown. Heavy bombers would also be less effective against a mobile naval\/carrier force (note that it's not just carriers, it's a fleet, including ships with radar, the first of which would be available in mid to late 1942). I'd have to check on how good the Japanese were at moving land based squadrons to other locations by sea in order to be able to state how effective their land-based aircraft would be.\nAs to harassing supply lines: with the US Pacific fleet mostly sunk, and the rest of the fleet mostly on the East Coast unable to use the Panam Canal, which ships would harass the Japanese supply lines and how would they be supplied? As soon as the Japanese \"close\" the ports on the West Coast, the vast majority of the Pacific turns into a Japanese \"lake\". Note that if you're going to argument that those carriers could sail to and be based in Australia, I'll raise you my point that I left all the smaller carriers there for a reason. Together with land based aircraft, they would make US carrier operations ineffective in the area.\n-\nAs a final note: After some more research, I'd still say the Japanese could conquer and occupy the Dutch East Indies with SNLF units, some units from the recently occupied parts of China and naval support (the historical setup, but with more Japanese ships in the area), although the capture of Java would possibly be seriously delayed. That is only a minor problem, as the resources and refineries the Japanese wanted were also located on other islands.\n\nLook... the objective for heavy bombers (or any ground attack aircraft for that matter) is not to sink Japanese carriers lurking off the coast. The key is to strike supply concentrations for the landing zones, ad hoc or floating workshops to service aircraft and sea vessels, motor parks, and marshalling points for ground formations. At the outset, the Japanese would have no more than 500+ aircraft of ALL types available for an invasion to cover a landing at least one beachhead. None of the ground attack element of this formation would have the range or numbers to effectively locate and suppress and perform BDA against American airpower operating from inland airfields and countless unprepared airstrips. Japanese ground forces would be faced with the 'vastness' of West Coast that could not accrue even the Wehrmacht's advantages of operating highly mobile forces across the Don Steppe. The West Coast has sparse populations centers seperated by numerous geographical barriers.\nHawaii, yes. Anchorage, why not? But the West Coast? It is beyond the realm of sanity and reality to even argue that it could have been successfully.\n\nComrade, in these types of Internet discussions, and doubly so on threads where we're debating historical hypotheticals, I try very hard to give folks the benefit of the doubt. Lord knows I've been wrong in plenty of such debates, and I will be again.\nBut I feel as though you're more interested in arguing with me than you are in listening to what I have to say. Let me try to spell it out.\n[ol][*]I don't think the Japanese would have ever stood a chance of obtaining aerial supremacy for longer than a day or two, if even for a single day. In the first 2 weeks of any landing, the Japanese would have been completely reliant on carrier-based planes (~560 of them at the start) for aerial supremacy. They had significantly better pilots and (in the single engine category) better planes. But they would have been outnumbered by at least 2-to-1 (assuming half the 4-engine bombers, and ONE-EIGHTH the one- and two-engined planes, would have been within range of a given beachead). They would have had limited (i.e., carrier-based) repair facilities and the nearest replacement planes would have been 2000 miles away (based at Honolulu). It's worth noting that, after the two attacks on Pearl Harbor in a single day--as successful an air attack as could be dreampt of--10% of the Japanese planes were either shot down or inoperable. Meanwhile, the Americans would have been feeding air units into the theater as quickly as they possibly could (which would have been slowly).\n[*]The Americans would have had a profound intelligence advantage, given by three main sources:\n* Shore-based radar installations\n* 4-enginge search aircraft to spot the incoming fleets (PBY Catalinas had a search range in excess of 2,000 miles round trip)\n* US intelligence had seriously compromised Japanese cryptography\nGiven these advantages, and the fact that the bulk of American aircraft could have been based inland, it seems very unlikely that the Japanese would have been able to launch any \"surprise attacks\" to catch a huge number of American planes on the ground.\n[*]In the Sea Lion example we were discussing, the Germans could have been postulated to have aerial supremacy over the beachead due to the fact that [i]they had more planes and ground airbases within 100 kilometers of the beachead[\/i]. The Japanese would have had neither of these advantages. Nor would they have been able to add enough ground-based airplanes to the fighting in the first few weeks of the war to ever gain aerial supremacy. You can't forward-deploy large numbers of aircraft to a hotly contested battlefield without temporary aerial supremacy, and it's very unclear how the Japanese might have secured that for longer than a day or two (see #1 and #2 above).\n[*]I'll grant the Japanese could have established a beachhead. They had better soldiers and, with the advantage of the initiative, could have focused their inital landing somewhere where an initial landing was likely to succeed. However, once a beachhead is established, you then have to be able to marshall enough troops and supplies to break out of that beachhead before the enemy is able to concentrate sufficient forces to drive you back into the ocean. The logistical challenges here are formidable--the only reason the Allies won this \"resource race\" at Normandy in 1944 was because the USAF and the RAF had conducted a massive, two-month long bombing campaign on French rail roads and rail stocks. The Japanese would have had none of that advantage.\n[*]As I said in the original post and as Marvin Gardens emphasized, B-17s\/B-24s and B-25\/B-26s would have mounted continuing attacks on the logistical areas at the Japanese beachead. This would have included bombing freighters as they were unloading supplies, bombing supply depots on shore, bombing captured port facilities (cranes, piers, etc.), bombing assembly points for the various units, etc. Bombing mobile naval targets would have been a wate of time, but heavy- and medium-bombers would have had a field day with stationary targets, just as the Luftwaffe did w\/English naval targets docked in Channel ports in the opening weeks of the Battle of Britain.\nIn this case, the Japanese would have been stuck in a defensive, reactive role--without the advantage of forward observers or radar, the CAP demands on Japanese fighter pilots would have taken an extraordinary toll on their combat readiness, to say nothing of their ability to escort bombers on any kind of ground support missions. It's also worth noting that the Americans could have sent large numbers of fighter escorts in with the bombers.\nWhile American casulaties would have been significant, they would have been sustainable. The Japanese supply train never would have made it out of the beachead.[*]The notion that the Japanese could have turned the entire Pacific Ocean into a \"Japanese lake\" is a gross oversimplification. While the Japanese could bring a decisive concentration of force into play at any one place, they lacked the forward airbases (no islands) or the advanced search aircraft to determine the whereabouts of intruding forces. The US Navy would have had challenges operating from established ports on the West Coast, but the neutralization of those ports (even if successful) would have required additional carrier operations on the part of the Japanese, which would have consumed time and aircraft pilots that the Japanese did not have.[*]The same thing goes for assaults on the Panama Canal. While tactically feasible, they would have required a dispersion of forces and an allocation of scarce resources that would likely have delayed any offensive on the US West Coast.[*]The two weakest areas in the whole Japanese conduct of the war seemed to be logistical planning, and inter-agency cooperation between the Army and Navy. Any invasion of the US West Coast would have required both of these.\n[\/ol]I haven't even discussed the implications of limited Japanese petroleum stocks on diverting millions of tons of shipping to the 5,000 mile one-way route from Tokyo to the West Coast, or the question of how long it would have taken the Japanese to rebuild and replenish fuel depots at Pearl Harbor after the Americans would have demolished the ones that were there.\nBut I've been posting a couple hours here, and honestly, at this point, I'm dubious that you're reading my arguments for anything but loopholes and things to disagree with. I apologize if I'm reading your intentions wrong here, but that's the way it has come across to me.\n\nSometimes, I feel very sorry that I seem to appear to be a prick, or someone who just wants to bash the person I'm debating with. I can assure you that is not the case.\nI agree that I \"stretch\" hypotheticals a bit usually, to create what I'd call a more interesting discussion, but I do try to stick to the facts, or at least: something that could have happened.\nA Japanese invasion of the entire West Coast could not have happened, unless the Japanese had half a century to prepare, so to speak. However: an invasion of a certain specific spot to show the Americans that the Japanese are only going to accept victory would be possible. In that case the Japanese fleet can also sail to the cities in the area to provide support. The goal in this case would be to occupy Seattle and its surroundings. Taking Seattle would strike a blow to the aircraft and shipping industry and as noted earlier, is fairly easy to reach for ships. Of course, the majority of the Japanese fleet would not be in the direct vicinity of Seattle all the time, but in the Pacific hugging the West Coast.\nAs far the air superiority argument: a lot depends on whether the US is able to move planes into the area efficiently and what they lost in the opening days of the campaign (and how\/with what that has been replaced).\nAs soon as the Japanese enter an urban area the effect of US air superiority on the Japanese ground troops would lessen, not to mention the question of whether the US government is willing to bomb a city full of American citizens.\nThe main problem for the Japanese will be: how to protect their shipping from air attack, and there's no real answer to that question.\nAs to turning the Pacific into a Japanese lake being a simplification: correct, but my point was that the ships in the ports on the West Coast could be effectively put out of action by the Japanese fleet whilst the transports move up from Japan. As soon as those ships are gone, and as soon as the Panama Canal is blocked, the US Navy would have to sail all the way around the South America continent, which would mean the only real danger to the Japanese invasion fleet would be coming from the deep south. That was already the case, as Australia is still in place as the world's most desolate and arid aircraft carrier, which also provides bases for what remains of the Dutch fleet (probably mostly submarines) and the Australian fleet.\nI also agree that the Japanese logistical planning was flawed, which is also why I proposed sending only the more modern, larger cargo ships in the area with less chances of sinking. During the invasion of the Dutch East Indies, the Japanese employed all kinds of ships...and spread the troop transports out amongst the battle fleet. That was a bad idea. I wouldn't be entirely off the mark if I would say that more Japanese troops drowned than were KIA'ed by the Allies in the area at that time. The Japanese had also underestimated the small, but capable and equipped with relatively modern aircraft, KNIL air force and supporting elements from British and Australian squadrons.\nIn any case, this might be the kind of discussion that will keep going in circles, it seems the average discussion about hypotheticals ends up that way.\n\n\nInteresting invasion site. The northern West Coast is notorious for long breakers, steep shorelines, submerged hazards and relative remoteness. Aberdeen offers relatively good anchorage, but like many estuary environments, it has extreme tidal flow and rough waves just outside the basin. Any Japanese advance is limited to a single avenue of approach to Seattle.\nIt could be better, though, than penetrating Puget Sound.\nAll hypotheticals...\n\nThe terrain is indeed quite bad, but the site does offer advantages such as being located in a corner of the US, without the extensive coastal defences and reserves that California had. It also helps that the Japanese could support the invasion with more or less direct fire, but still the tides and coastline are a problem.\nI'm often amazed how many people forget that the landing at Normandy was made on terrain that was more or less suitable for an amphibious landing, not on coastline made up almost entirely out of cliffs, for example. There was a debate about the coastline in California in a thread about a mod for a Japanese campaign for PG2. The scenario that was eventually included was quite tricky, even with elite and seriously overstrength troops. Invading Australia was a piece of cake compared to that mission.\n\nThe Japanese proved themselves quite capable in '42 of making rapid advances down defended valleys with enemy flanks anchored on the heights (i.e. Cagayan Valley, Malayan Peninsular Campaign). They did this well, however, against marginally equipped and trained infantry (Indian and Filippino Regulars) and with uncontested air and naval dominance. Still, their ability to maneuver rapidly in dense terrain to outflank these entrenchments seemed unequaled... at least until they met the 1st USMC Division. U.S. regulars and national guard on the mainland are likely to demonstrate the same weaknesses as U.S. regulars and U.S.-trained proxies in the Philippines. It could be that the Japanese might do well in your proposed landing sight... for a time.\nNevertheless, while such tactical acumen might ensure localized operational successes, there is simply no place else for the Japanese Army to go once they reach Seattle. It is a strategic dead end. And once the Japanese land at Aberdeen, you can be sure that even a marginally intelligent U.S. commander would immediately fortify the approaches through Puget Sound... sowing mines, installing artillery emplacements among the many islands, etc. Capturing Seattle would be of no more use to a Japanese foothold on the West Coast than Antwerp was to the Allies without control of the Scheldt.\n\nSeattle would be a dead end, but that's not a problem. In this case, it's all about a show of force. Defeating the US forces in the area would be enough for the political goal of showing the US that they're on the losing side and it would be better for them to quit fighting the Japanese.\nAny Japanese presence along the West Coast would make it difficult if not impossible to do anything about Japan without sailing across the globe to Australia and New Zealand. It would be interesting to see what an island hopping campaign from those locations would've looked like.\nThe verdict on \"Free Tibet\" and Kosovo:\n[img]\n\nORIGINAL: SeawolfI love it, \"Mass Treason\". Another word that means the same as \"the will of the people\".\n\nSeawolf's digression aside, I do think it's a lot more realistic to discuss whether the Japanese could have mounted any kind of effective punitive expedition against a smoewhat isolated part of West Coast, and if so, how effective it might have been.\nBy mid-1942, the Japanese certainly had a few more million combat veterans than the US did. By that point in the war, the only US soldiers who had seen ground combat were POWs.\nI also think it would have made a lot more sense to land somewhere in either Washington state or Oregon. The \"best\" target in the US would have been San Diego--easy beaches, great harbor facilities, etc. I'm sure that the Americans would have realized this from the get-go.\nSan Francisco, while also a very appealing target, would have also been fairly well defended. Speaking as a guy who walks his dog once a week in the conrete ruins of Fort Funston's 16-inchers, it would have taken an extended campaign to get meaningful access to the Bay Area. Not so much because of a few huge naval rifles in one fort, but because the geography of the Bay does not easily lend itself to neutralization and pacification. Specifically, the Bay itself is fringed by two thin peninsulae (San Francisco is at the tip of the Southern peninsula, which runs 40-miles North-South and is girded by the Santa Cruz mountains--which are more like hills than mountains, but serviceable terrain for defenders). Each of those would have had to have been neutralized in turn, as well as the eastern coast of the Bay in Oakland.\nFor all those reasons, we're back to the Pacific Northwest.\nI'm still doubtful that the Japanese navy could neutralize a shore-based air force of 4,000 planes, even taking them on piecemeal over the first 8 weeks of fighting, but for the sake of argument, we could assume it would happen for at least a while. The Japanese were much more seasoned fighters, and would have been able to defeat most of the established pockets of resistance within immediate striking distance of their beach-head.\nThey then would have been faced with the dubious proposition, \"What now?\" They could have put the torch to US properties in an effort to show the Americans who was boss, but I think that would have backfired. I don't know that modern America would respond the same way, but speaking to lots of folks in my parent's generation, I think they would have been PISSED at having American soil violated.\nGiven the code of conduct exhibited by the Japanese military dealing with civilian populations in Manila, Nanking, and other places, it seems logical to suspect that similar events would have transpired on American soil. That would have only added fuel to the fire of American conviction, I think.\nWe're often a short-sighted and self-absorbed people, I think, but we're also very idealistic and once our energies are truly focused on a concrete challenge, we can be relentlessly effective. What was the Bernard Lewis quote about serving with the Americans in WWII (he was a British officer)? \"They were completely unteachable, and despite our warnings, they insisted on making all kinds of mistakes--many of them new and completely original. But they were also extroardinarily fast to learn and adapt. Nothing we had ever seen prepared us for that faculty of theirs.\"\nThe list of \"unlikely preconditions\" necessary to make it feasible for the Japanese to conduct even a limited punitive assault on the Pacific Northwest is long indeed. InInQuestion remains: how would the Allies\/the US get to Japan, with most of the Pacific occupied and the West Coast ports and the Panama Canal being watched by the Japanese? As I said earlier, a scenario where the US simply sends its troops to Australia (either by using the \"safer\" route of East Coast - Cape of Good Hope - Australia, or by sailing around South America) is daring, but possible. If the US sets sail for Australia with even only a single construction year's worth of ships, the Japanese would face a serious problem. The question remains which ships the US would use. The Pacific fleet is either raised by the Japanese or still at the bottom of a bay or the Pacific ocean near Pearl Harbour.\n\nFantasy can be a lot of fun, but you fellers are turning Imperial Japan into a powerhouse it was not.\nThe First Air Fleet, Kido Butai, with all six of the heavy carriers of the IJN, could only carry about 365 aircraft that were combat ready. To do more than raid a location, it would have to find a means of replacing large quantities of aircraft. Short of a trip back to Japan, that would have meant lots of valuable transport space.\nDon't talk about building land bases and airfields. To repair the expected damage on Midway (after the amphibious assault of Colonel Ichiki's detachment), the naval planners were reduced to taking american construction equipment from Wake Island. The airfield on Guadalcanal took long to develop by American standards. The Japanese felt they were being quite successful to get the ground cleared in less than a month.\nIn the strategic conference on the Midway operation leading to an eventual Hawaii invasion, the Naval General Staff and the Army opposed the plan put forth by Combined Fleet. The spokesman for Admiral Nagano (Cdr. Miyo, IIRC) made a telling point by demonstrating that Hawaii, like England, could not feed itself. In a month, american shippers regularly brought eighty thousand tons of foodstuffs to the islands. If Hawaii were seized, even allowing for reduction in the civilian population, somehow sixty loads of food (50-60,000 tons) must be imported to avoid mass starvation. (It wasn't that the NGS was totally against mass starvations, but where were they going to find sixty merchant ships to make the monthly trips?)\nIn terms of fuel for the garrison forces, Japan's industrial weakness was clearly exposed. To allocate even five modern tankers to the Hawaii run meant that there would be shortages created in the Home Islands.\nNot from a lack of oil, the fields of Indonesia took care of that, but from a lack of transport.\nNo matter how you slice and dice it, oil was the life blood of the military, and there was no possible way for the Japanese to get refined oil across the Pacific to support an invasion. A fleet train doing a continuous loop from Japan to the Pacific Northwest would require at least twenty tankers to support the grind of constant combat. Otherwise the troops and aircraft fighting in North America would face periods of no fuel. This could work against an agricultural state like China, but was a sure recipe for failure against a self sufficient industrial state\nThe first Essex became operational in last 42, the next 3 were not until 2nd quarter in 43. However lets assume the three US carriers were in Pearl Harbor, on Dec 7th, why would you assume that they would take as long to repair as the battleships, the battleships were floated repaired then sailed off to there home ports and underwent major refits, the carriers more then likely would not of. Carriers do not have the complex armor and could have been battle ready much faster.\n\n\"Question with boldness even the existence of God; because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason than that of blindfolded fear\" --Thomas Jefferson"}

{"text":"What is gross tonnage?\n\nOasis of the Seas (220,000 gross tons) and Navigator of the Seas (137,000 gross tons).\n\nWhen people talk about the size of cruise ships, they usually compare the gross tonnage of one ship to the gross tonnage of another. Thus, Oasis of the Seas at 220,000 gross tons is considered a bigger cruise ship than Navigator of the Seas at 137,000 gross tons. Because the word \"tons\" is used in connection with this measurement, people often think that the gross tonnage is the weight of the ship. However, as Captain Herman Zini of Royal Caribbean explains: \"The tonnage is not weight. It is a volume measurement. So when we are talking about the tonnage of a ship, we are talking about the volume inside \" This measurement was developed in order to be able to assess a ship's cargo carrying capacity. In fact, \"tons\" as used here is a corruption of \"tuns,\" an archaic term for casks of wine.. Traditionally, one gross ton was equal to 100 cubic feet of space. As Holland America's Captain Christopher Turner notes, today however, \"tonnage is worked out using a formula. Gross tonnage still is a measurement of space. It is the internal capacity of the ship. But there is a specific formula for working it out now rather than 100 cubic feet to the ton.\" The weight of a ship is its displacement. The size of a warship is often stated in terms of its displacement. For example, the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan has a displacement of 102,000 tons. However, it would be a mistake to conclude that the Ruby Princess is a bigger ship because she is 113,000 gross tons. It is simply an apples and oranges comparison."}
{"text":"Scientists studying the Civil War wreckage of the world's first submarine to successfully sink an enemy ship are now saying the sub most likely sank because it was too close to the ship it was targeting. New evidence shows an explosion affected the Hunley, a Mobile, Alabama-built submarine belonging to the Confederacy.\n\nThe Hunley was less than twenty feet away from her torpedo when it exploded, according to new evidence uncovered by experts working to preserve the world's first successful combat submarine. This is one of the most important clues found to date for archaeologists trying to discover why the Hunley vanished.\n\nRemnants of the torpedo that sank the USS Housatonic in 1864 were found securely bolted to the tip of the spar, a large pole that served as the Hunley's weapon delivery system. The metal is jagged and peeled away from the aftermath of the explosion. It would have clearly created a risky situation for the Hunley's crew if the torpedo stayed attached to the spar when it exploded.\n\n\"There is overwhelming evidence to indicate this was not a suicide mission. The crew no doubt knew the dangers facing them, but still, they hoped to make it back home. They must have believed this was a safe enough distance to escape any harm,\" said Hunley Commissioner Lieutenant Governor Glenn McConnell. \"If so, they were at least partially right. Thus far, no damage has been found on the actual submarine caused by the explosion.\"\n\nPlan of Attack: The new find is turning upside down the traditional understanding of how the Hunley's weapon system functioned. Traveling to the target in a 19th century, hand cranked submarine was challenging enough. But how do you actually get the torpedo in the right spot and then trigger it once you are there? The answer has been sitting quietly in the Hunley lab underneath a brittle layer of concretion coating the spar.\n\nUntil now, the conventional wisdom has been the Hunley would ram the spar torpedo into her target and then back away, causing the torpedo to slip off the spar. A rope from the torpedo to the submarine would spool out and detonate once the submarine was at a safe distance. This theory has always had difficulty under scrutiny since it would be very hard to actually lodge the torpedo into the hull of the enemy ship.\n\n\"You have to remember, what these guys were trying to do had never been done before. They were constantly improving their new weapon as they learned during testing,\" said Maria Jacobsen, Senior Hunley Archaeologist at Clemson University's Warren Lasch Conservation Center in North Charleston.\n\nFinding a portion of the original torpedo casing has enabled the team to confirm a long held suspicion that it was built and designed by a group associated with Edgar Singer (cousin of the famous sewing machine entrepreneur Isaac Singer). A period diagram housed at the National Archives indicates that this Singer torpedo held 135 pounds of gunpowder and was detonated by a trigger mechanism.\n\nThis means the Captain had to position the torpedo while still attached to the spar and trigger it when the time was right. The Hunley's crew was very strategic in their placement of the torpedo. It was detonated right under the stern to maximize the impact of the explosion and ensure destruction of the large Union ship. The explosion was not an accident. It was the result of careful planning.\n\nReconstructing the Past: There are dozens of possible theories to explain why the Hunley disappearedafter sinking one of the mightiest ships in the Union's fleet. Scientists have long wanted to digitally test the different scenarios using computer modeling. Until now, they have been missing key pieces of information such as the torpedo strength and the approximate location of the Hunley during the deadly explosion.\n\nWith the torpedo charge and size now known from the diagram, understanding where the Hunley was in relation to the Housatonic and the blast that dragged her down to the bottom of the sea becomes a matter of arithmetic. The spar measures approximately 16 feet in length and the torpedo 2 feet, meaning the Hunley was at least 18 feet away from the bomb when it went off.\n\nNow, scientists have the information they need to move forward with computer simulations of the attack, which could prove vital in solving the lingering mystery of why the Hunley did not come home on the fateful night of February, 17th, 1864.\n\nWhat's Next:The submarine is covered with a layer of rock, sand and silt \u2013 often referred to as concretion \u2013 that built up over time while she rested on the ocean floor. The concretion serves as protective coating, but also inhibits the effectiveness of the conservation treatment needed to ensure the Hunley's survival. Scientists will soon begin peeling away the concretion. \"What has been concealed under this layer is anyone's guess. As we remove it, we'll be seeing the actual skin of the submarine for the first time. Hopefully, we'll find many new clues to help us have a deeper understanding of the Hunley's history,\" said Lieutenant Governor McConnell.\n\nOn the evening of February 17, 1864, the H. L.

{"text":"They saw them on the horizon: the two hard shapes topping the sea level stood out like squat battlements: they could only be U-boats\u2014the hated and longed-for targets that were now part of the rubbish of defeat.\n\u2013 Nicholas Monsarrat,\nThe Cruel Sea\n1951\n\nWhether fostered by fanciful images of adventure, fear, nationalism, or curiosity, the German U-boat, that elusive hunter from a far-off land, has become an established part of American naval folklore. Particularly along the New England coast, in many a seaport town, an old salt can be found with a tale to tell of the night he or someone he knows came face to face with a U-boat, mere miles from our shores. Although it is often difficult to separate fact from fiction, one thing is certain: Americans are fascinated by U-boats, particularly those that lie at the bottom of the sea.\n\nWhile tedious research and advances in technology may some day uncover more, five U-boats representing three classes are known to have gone to the bottom in the deep waters off the coast of Massachusetts. Although none were caught lurking outside our harbors and all suffered less than Hollywood fates being either scuttled or used as training targets by the U.S. Navy, their presence none the less serves as a stark reminder of a dark period in our world's history.\n\nOf the five U-boats off the Massachusetts coast, the XB class U-234 is perhaps the best known. The XB class U-boats\u2014a total of eight existed\u2014were designed during World War II and constructed at the Germaniawerft yard in Kiel, Germany. As mine-laying submarines, XBs were capable of carrying 66 mines in 30 mine shafts, which were at times also used for storing freight. Additionally, XB U-boats were equipped with up to 15 torpedoes, but unlike a number of other U-boat classes, these subs had only two torpedo tubes, both located on the stern. The XBs measured 295 feet in length, 30 feet in breadth, and 15 feet in draft, making them the largest German U-boats ever built. The XBs could travel at a top speed of 17 knots on the surface, seven knots submerged, and had a maximum oil capacity of 368 tons. Designed for a crew of 48-60 submariners, the XBs were able to reach depths of more than 700 feet. As with most vessels, size comes with some significant drawbacks. What the XB class U-boats gained in size, they lost in diving speed; a compromise that ultimately resulted in the loss of six of the eight XB class U-boats constructed.\n\nU-234, construction of which commenced on October 1, 1941 at Germaniawerft, sustained damage from bombing raids before even coming off the stocks. Originally intended for mine laying operations, it was rebuilt as a transport submarine to ferry war materials from Germany to Japan in order to fill the void left by the July 1944 loss of its predecessor, U-233. From March 1944 to February 1945, U-234 was a part of the Fifth Flotilla based at Kiel and for the last two months of its career served the Thirty-Third Flotilla at Flensburg, Germany. U-234 took part in only one active patrol from Kiel to Kristiansand, Norway, with the intention of sailing to Japan under the command of Kptlt. Johann-Heinrich Fehler. Despite the vessel's size and firepower, it was unsuccessful in the destruction of Allied shipping.\n\nUpon reception of cease-fire instructions from headquarters on May 4, 1945, U-234 was en route to Japan carrying technical drawings, two crated Me-262 fighter jets, 550 kilograms of uranium, and several senior-ranking German officers. Due to the cease-fire, Commander Fehler aborted his mission and set a course for the United States to surrender the vessel, but not before two Japanese officers, passengers on U-234, took their own lives. Historian Samuel Eliot Morison contends that much to the skipper's repulsion, the officers \"dosed themselves with liminal instead of performing the traditional seppuku, and died slowly and ignobly,\" while other sources attribute the deaths to an overdose of sleeping pills.\n\nFollowing the broadcasting of its position, U-234 was boarded by a U.S. Navy crew to prevent the anticipated destruction of the craft by the Germans and brought under escort to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Two years following its surrender, U-234 was motored northeast of Cape Cod where it was sunk on November 20, 1947 as a torpedo test target by the submarine\nU.S.S. Greenfish\n. Today, the remains of U-234 lie in more than 600 feet of water some 40 miles off shore. While the condition of this site and that of the other four U-boats is unknown, rapid advances in deep water technology suggest that a new generation will catch a glimpse of these elusive vessels from a far off land.\n\nMore information on U-234 and other U-boats is available online at"}

{"text":"Why Titanic's Story Still Resonates 100 Years Later\n\nSUMMARY\n\nOne hundred years after the Titanic sank, the story of the technological triumph-turned-tragedy still captivates many people. Margaret Warner and writer Daniel Mendelsohn, author of the recent New Yorker piece \"Unsinkable: Why We Can't Let Go of the Titanic,\" discuss the story's staying power.\n\nMARGARET WARNER: Finally tonight, remembering the Titanic, and exploring why its story resonates in our modern age.\n\nThe story of the technological triumph that ended in tragedy still captivates the public mind 100 years after the Titanic sank. This weekend will see scores of events marking the centennial anniversary, from the re-release of the late '90s blockbuster film, now in 3-D. . .\n\nWhen it sets sail from Southampton, England, for New York, on April 10, 1912, the Titanic was hailed as the largest vessel in the world and touted as unsinkable. But just four days into its maiden voyage, the luxury cruise ship hit an iceberg and sank, killing more than 1,500 passengers and crew.\n\nWith the shipwreck lying on the ocean floor, its tale has spawned countless books and films. And the wreckage itself attracts underwater tourists and scavengers, prompting calls for its preservation.\n\n\"It's a real-life event that unfolds as if it were basically a work of literature. You know, it's sort of too good to be true.\"\n\n- Daniel Mendelsohn\n\nSTEVE BLASCO, marine geologist, Survey of Canada: Recovering artifacts, the belongings of people who have died is -- is not to be done.\n\nMARGARET WARNER: Whether or not the wreckage survives another 100 years, fascination with its story and fate seem sure to endure.\n\nAnd for more on why the fascination endures, we turn to writer and critic Daniel Mendelsohn. His latest piece in The New Yorker is \"Unsinkable: Why We Can't Let Go of the Titanic.\"\n\nAnd, Daniel Mendelsohn, welcome.\n\nSo, what is it about the Titanic tale and its themes that so grips ours imagination and has for 100 years?\n\nDANIEL MENDELSOHN, writer\/critic: Well, I think, mostly, it's that it's a real-life event that unfolds as if it were basically a work of literature. You know, it's sort of too good to be true.\n\nIt has all the themes. It has the structure. You know, there's something irresistible about it because it's too perfect.\n\nMARGARET WARNER: Well, give us an example. What do you mean? What themes?\n\nDANIEL MENDELSOHN: Well, you know, it's about the oldest -- it's about the oldest theme of all, which is man vs. nature. That's one, right?\n\nHubris, the subject of so many Greek tragedies. They say they build -- they're going to build the ship that can't sink. Of course it sinks. It's about class. It's a perfect parable about class at the end of the 19th century.\n\nIf you were a man in first class, you had a better chance of surviving than if you were a small child in third class. It seems to be about technology and overconfidence in technology, which is something we're very interested in still, obviously, and the limits of technology.\n\nSo all of these things seem to be sort of overdetermined. You know, in one story, you get class, you get overweening arrogance, you get technological overconfidence. And it all comes together and you put it in the most beautiful, biggest ship ever built, and it sinks on a piece of ice in the middle of the ocean.\n\nMARGARET WARNER: On its maiden voyage.\n\nDANIEL MENDELSOHN: On its maiden voyage.\n\nMARGARET WARNER: You write in this piece. You begin with the fact that your uncle when you were age 12 enrolled you in a club called Titanic Enthusiasts of America.\n\nDANIEL MENDELSOHN: Right.\n\nMARGARET WARNER: And I won't try to speculate on what your age may be, but what. . .\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nMARGARET WARNER: Have the themes that resonate changed over time, at least here in the U.S.?\n\nDANIEL MENDELSOHN: I don't think so.\n\nWell, I mean, it could be. I think, at the very beginning, there was a tremendous amount of anguish about the class issue. You know, it was very shocking when this first came out that the scales were tipped so greatly and so obviously in favor of people who were first-class passengers. And I think, today, the sort of technological theme predominates. And, also, there's this irresistible idea. . .\n\nMARGARET WARNER: You mean the limits of our technology?\n\nDANIEL MENDELSOHN: The limits of technology.\n\nIt's like the Challenger disaster. You know, many of the kinds of things that were said after the Challenger disaster were said after the Titanic sank, how here we thought we had it all figured out and we were getting so accustomed to these fantastic technological accomplishments, and it turns out we didn't get it all right.\n\nSo that's -- as long as we have technology, that's going to be a theme that interests us.\n\nMARGARET WARNER: And then, of course, as you pointed out, it really taps into classical myth. It is a myth and it taps into them.\n\nDANIEL MENDELSOHN: Yes.\n\nYeah, I think there's an idea that the Titanic itself is a kind -- in a funny way, you know, a hero of this mythic story. You know, we go to Greek plays to watch great heroes like Oedipus, you know, who everyone thinks has all the answers, powerful, strong, accomplished, fall apart.\n\nThat's why we go to see these dramas. It is still we why we go to see \"Death of a Salesman\" or whatever. And the Titanic itself looks like one of these heroes. It's a wonderful, impregnable, unsinkable. It seems to have it all. And then we get a certain kind of funny pleasure from watching a drama in which something beautiful disintegrates"}

In May 1941 Yorktown returned to the Atlantic, patrolling actively during the troubled months preceding the outbreak of war between the United States and the Axis powers.\n\nTwo weeks after the 7 December 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Yorktown transited the Panama Canal to reinforce the badly damaged Pacific Fleet. The carrier's first combat operation was the Marshalls-Gilberts raid in early February 1942. Yorktown then steamed to the South Pacific, where she participated in a series of raids and other operations that climaxed in the Battle of Coral Sea in early May. In this action, in which she was damaged by enemy bombs, her planes attacked two Japanese aircraft carriers, helping to sink Shoho and damaging Shokaku.\n\nQuick repairs at Pearl Harbor put Yorktown into good enough condition to participate in the Battle of Midway on 4-6 June 1942. During this great turning point of the Pacific War, her air group fatally damaged the Japanese aircraft carrier Soryu and shared in the destruction of the carrier Hiryu and cruiser Mikuma. However, successive strikes by dive bombers and torpedo planes from Hiryu seriously damaged Yorktown, causing her abandonment during the afternoon of 4 June. Two days later, while salvage efforts were underway, the Japanese submarine I-168 torpedoed both the damaged carrier and the destroyer Hammann, sinking the latter immediately and Yorktown shortly after daybreak on 7 June 1942.

{"text":"Monday, October 4, 2010\n\nSea stories\n\nIt's difficult to believe that my dad isn't going to be there when I get home later this week. It's been almost two weeks since he died. As a family, we had been preparing ourselves for 25 years, when he was first told that his heart was working on borrowed time. He'd been dodging bullets in the form of cancer, heart disease and diabetes for that whole time. A childhood spent in orphanages and foster homes left him exposed to polio and rheumatic fever as a kid, though it took 50 years for that to catch up with him. He was 76, and had been married to my mom for just shy of 49 years. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nMy father sailed in the heyday of the 'tin can' navy, when tiny WWII-era destroyers were the workhorses of the US Navy fleet. He remains the most widely-travelled man I know of, having visited almost every coastal nation in the world. The father I knew was an introspective, gregarious, extremely kind and religious man. Arthritis, coupled with scoliosis, had progressively weakened his back as an adult. He retired when I was only 3. This was about 10 years before his heart went south. I never knew the wild sailor that he was, but the stories were too insane to be anything but unvarnished truth.\n\nLike all US Navy sailors, the only form of recreation after several months at sea was to go drinking with shipmates at the first opportunity. This particular story centers around Malta, something of a Mecca for the fun and alcohol-seeking sailor, I guess. My father was coming off of the longest sea cruise he'd ever been on.\n\nwhen arriving in Malta, he and his off-watch buddies from the engine room made a beeline for the nearest gin mill. Sailors being sailors, they proceeded to get kicked out of bars that night for being rowdy, one after another, each time working their way further from the ship, out of necessity. At the end of the night, dead, dead drunk, and a long walk from the ship, the men started to stagger back. Being a young bunch of guys, they were still energetic and animated, if bombed.\n\nDown the quay from their ship, the men spotted a massive, gleaming yacht- bright white amidst the dark water's backdrop, like a magnet for the eyes. This ship was obviously brand new, and the largest private vessel than any of them had ever seen. They needed to see more of it, to see how the ultra-wealthy got around from A to B. While standing at the gangway of this beautiful ship, someone suggested that they, a bunch of professionally-trained and supremely qualified master mariners, take the ship out for a joyride. She wasn't much smaller than their destroyer, the men reasoned, so she should handle the same. The boat in question, shown here, was, unfortunately, owned by Aristotle Onassis.\n\nSo, aboard they went, onto this luxury yacht. My dad and his friends went to the engine room and warmed up the engines.Others went to the bridge and looked things over. As the men started casting off the mooring lines, the cavalry showed up. Apparently, you can't steal a megayacht all that discreetly, and the cavalry, the pulizija, showed up with automatic weapons. The men were marched, at gunpoint, onto the quay. Shore Patrol found them, too, while the 5-0 were waiting for the paddy wagons. The watch officer on shore patrol requested that the men be marched to their ship prior to processing, so that the captain could pull their paperwork and send it with the men, who were to be arrested and held in prison until they faced trial. While the pulizija were nonplussed, the watch officer noted that the men were US citizens and actively serving in the US military, and having proper documentation would prevent the Maltese and American consulates from having any conflict. Well, this resonated with the locals, and my father and his friends, hands shackled, were marched at gunpoint, staggering and stinking drunk, down to their ship. At the gangway, the shore patrol stopped the group, explaining that he had to wake up the captain. A few minutes later, the captain, in a foul, foul mood, walked down the gangway. He proceeded to let the men know that, in no uncertain terms, they were going under the bus, and that they would be tried as civilians, and left to rot in Malta, as soon as their papers were processed. The captain ordered the men to line up outside his office aboard, for immediate processing and discharge to the custody of the Maltese authorities. The pulizija, being a foreign police force, were asked to wait at the gangway, and the captain arranged for a steward to serve them drinks while they waited. The men then were marched up the gangway under the screams of the furious captain. Once the men were aboard, and assembled outside the captain's office, sailors with boltcutters opened the shackles. The ship's Executive Officer told the men to go immediately to bed to sleep it off. My father went to bed. After an interminable wait, the Maltese cops got antsy. They started up the gangway, only to be stopped by the gangway watch. A US warship is the soverign territory of the United States. It is, in fact, considered to be 'US soil,' and an unauthorized foreign police presence would be viewed, the men were told, as an attack on the US. When asked about the disposition of the sailors who tried to steal Aristotle Onassis' yacht (he being the wealthiest man in the world at the time), the gangway watch claimed that they had no idea what the police were talking about.\n\nObviously the story doesn't end there. The US consulate got involved. The captain got a nastygram from the navy AND from the Maltese government. The captain then mentioned that the police in question smelled heavily of scotch, and he had no idea what was going on. The police force was shooed off the dock not long after. _________________________\n\nThe men in question were punished, of course, at the captain's mast. A court martial could have easily been convened for each of them. The captain, however, would lose his engine room crew, and his ship would truly be in deep shit with no sailors to actually run the plant. Some guys lost rank. Some were docked pay. My dad was restricted to the ship for the duration of his assignment to her. He was 'in hack,' however- his punishment wasn't recorded on the ships' books. As a potential 'lifer,' the captain didn't want to see my dad's career ended. He dodged a bullet.\n\nLong hitches have been the architect of so many memorable nights ashore. That's why the best part of this story is that if I, or you had been in Malta that night we would have hopped onboard that yacht thinking it was the greatest idea since canned food for that is the insufferable inebriated logic seafaring fosters.\n\nGod bless the Captains who've looked the other way when they knew it's only for want of a night away from the regimen of a ship at sea for which we commit such heinous acts. Acts that make landlubbers (And the police) blush and wonder what in the hell is wrong with us"}

{"text":"shotdown\n\nUSS Nimitz (CVN-68)\n\nUSS Nimitz (CVN-68) is a supercarrier in the United States Navy, the lead ship of its class. She is one of the largest warships in the world. She was laid down, launched and commissioned as CVAN-68, but was redesignated CVN-68 (nuclear-powered multimission aircraft carrier) on 30 June 1975 as part of the fleet realignment of that year.\n\nThe documentary series Carrier focuses on the life of Nimitz and the crew members that served on it during a six month deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2005.\n\nShip's history\n\nThe USS Nimitz was first deployed to the Mediterranean in 1976 in company with the nuclear powered cruisersUSS South Carolina and USS California. It was the first time in ten years that the United States had deployed nuclear-powered ships to the Mediterranean. The cruise was uneventful, and the Carrier returned to Norfolk, Virginia in February 1977.\n\nA second Mediterranean cruise was conducted during 1977\u20131978 was also uneventful. The third cruise conducted in September 1979, had the carrier involved in Operation Evening Light; the attempt to rescue the US Embassy staff being held hostage in Tehran, Iran. The mission was aborted when helicopters crashed at a rendezvous point in the Iranian desert. The ship finally returned home 26 May 1980, having spent 144 days at sea.\n\n1980-1990\n\nOn 26 May 1981, one of carrier's EA-6B Prowlers crash landed on her flight deck, killing 14 crewmen and injuring 45 others. Forensic testing conducted found that several members of the deceased flightdeck crew tested positive for marijuana. As a result of this incident, President Ronald Reagan instituted a \"Zero Tolerance\" policy across all of the armed services - which started the mandatory drug testing of all US service personnel.\n\nIn 1985, two Lebanese gunmen hijacked TWA Flight 847, which carried 153 passengers and crew and included Americans. In response, the carrier was deployed to the Eastern Mediterranean, off the coast of Lebanon, where she remained until August.\n\nThe Nimitz departed Norfolk, Virginia for the Mediterranean in December 1986. After four months and numerous port visits the carrier left the Mediterranean and crossed the equator en route to Rio de Janeiro. From Rio she proceeded south around Cape Horn and into the Pacific. After a brief stop in San Diego, California to offload her air wing, she arrived at her new home port of Bremerton, Washington on 30 June 1987.\n\nDuring the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, the Nimitz provided security off the coast of South Korea. In October she participated in Operation Earnest Will, operating in the North Arabian Sea. On 30 November, while the ship conducted operations in the Arabian Sea, a 20 mm cannon accidentally fired on a A-7 Corsair II during maintenance. Six other aircraft were set on fire and there were two casualties; one sailor was killed and another died in the hospital from injuries on 2 December.\n\nOn September 1997, the Nimitz began an around the world cruise that ended in Newport News where she would underwent a mid-life Refueling Complex Overhaul (RCOH) that ended 25 June 2001.\n\nWar on terror (2001-)\n\nIn 2001, the Nimitz changed its home port to San Diego, California, arriving there on 13 November. In January 2002, she began a four month post-shakedown availability at NAS North Island. The pier-side availability ended in May.\n\nIn mid-April 2003, Nimitz relieved the USS Abraham Lincoln in the Persian Gulf, launching aircraft for sorties over Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. She returned to San Diego on 5 November 2003 where maintenance and repair work was carried out. After these were completed, the ship and crew conducted sea trials.\n\nThe Nimitz again deployed to the Persian Gulf in May 2005, returning in November 2005. This deployment is depicted in the 2008 PBS documentary series Carrier.\n\nThe carrier departed North Island, San Diego in April 2007 on a six-month deployment in the Arabian Sea, relieving the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. She reached Chennai, India on 2 July as part of efforts to expand bilateral defense cooperation between India and the United States. Sailors of the nuclear powered aircraft carrier participated in community work in Chennai during its station there. She left Indian shores on 5 July along with the destroyer USS Pinckney towards the Persian Gulf. She returned to North Island on 30 September 2007.\n\nOn January 2008, the Nimitz deployed to the Pacific for a surge-deployment. On 9 February 2008, two Russian Tu-95 'Bear bombers overflew the carrier in the Western Pacific. Four F\/A-18C Hornets were launched when the bombers were away from the U.S. ships, and intercepted the bombers south of the Nimitz. Two F\/A-18s trailed one of the bombers, which buzzed the deck of the carrier twice, while the other two F\/A-18s trailed another TU-95 circling about away from the carrier. The fighters then proceeded to guide the Russians away from the area. Reportedly, there was no radio communication between the American and Russian aircraft. According to the Department of Defense, one of the two aircraft was said to have flown above the Nimitz at an altitude of . This caused much controversy. On the same day, Russian aircraft entered Japanese airspace, which caused the Japanese to raise protest at the Russian ambassador in Tokyo. CVN-68\/CVW-11 made a port visit to Busan, South Korea on 28 February in conjunction with military exercises Key Resolve\/Foal Eagle. Again, on 5 March 2008, a Russian bomber came within three to five nautical miles (9 km) and flew above the Nimitz and its battle group. Two F\/A-18 fighters intercepted the Russian aircraft and escorted it out of the area.\n\nThe Nimitz was awarded the Navy Battle \"E\" for battle efficiency for 2007 along with the Ney award for food service excellence and the Department of Defense Thomas Jefferson Award for best newsletter format publication \"Nimitz News\". In keeping with the ships motto of Teamwork, a Tradition!. She returned to her homeport of San Diego, California on 3 June 2008 after spending 10 of the last 14 months at sea. The ship is currently undergoing a Planned Incremental Availability (PIA) and will begin workups in 2009.\n\nPopular culture\n\nUSS Nimitz features in the 1980 film The Final Countdown starring Kirk Douglas, James Farentino and Martin Sheen. In the movie, the ship and crew are thrown back in time via a wormhole storm to 6 December 1941 near Hawaii; just hours before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nThe Nimitz is featured in the 1986 novel Red Storm Rising by famous techno-thriller-autor Tom Clancy. In the story, the Nimitz is part of a NATO carrier battle group operating in the North Atlantic and is heavily damaged during an attack of Soviet bombers."}

Joseph Thomas, commanding officer of USS De Wert. The crew of De Wert has succeeded at fulfilling a demanding schedule of completing ship preparations, providing tours, conducting community relations projects, and engaging with the public of the host city. More than 5,000 people visited De Wert in Quebec City and Montreal. \"I really enjoy the opportunity to meet and mingle with the people and for them to see the finished product of all our hard work,\" said Boatswains Mate 2nd Class Nathaniel Pennywell. Currently, De Wert is transiting the St. Lawrence Seaway, which provides a system of locks, channels, and canals for ships to transit from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes. De Wert's arrival into the Great Lakes is a highly anticipated event, as it is the first Navy frigate to visit the Great Lakes since the Navy's last Great Lakes Cruise in 1999. The USS Hurricane (PC 3) and the Royal Canadian Navy's HMCS Ville de Quebec are also traveling with De Wert throughout the Great Lakes for the commemoration events. Other scheduled port visits include Chicago, Toledo, Detroit, Cleveland, and Buffalo. The War of 1812, also known as America's second war for independence, is regarded by many as the conflict that started our country's rise to global influence. From 1812 to 1815, we fought to expand to the north and west, and to assert our rights to trade freely with other countries, without interference from Britain's Royal Navy ships on the high seas. Our modern Navy and our role as a global maritime power are rooted in the events of 1812 to 1815. More information on the Bicentennial Commemoration of the War of 1812 can be found at"}
{"text":"Innovation hits earth! The new PACTOR 4 modem\n\nCrew of the \"Bounty\" rescued by PACTOR\n\nThe original intention was to prevent major damage by hurricane \"Sandy\" from the three-masted sailing vessel, which was built in 1960 for the movie \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" in an enlarged scale using original ship drawings from the British Admiralty archives. At her location in the port of New London, Connecticut, she would definitely have been destroyed by the storm. Therefore, the crew decided to set course to St. Petersburg, Florida, on October 25, trying to move the vessel around the hurricane. Further, during a storm, a ship is basically considered to be more save at sea than in a port. Damage should thus be minimized that way. Tragically, the \"Bounty\" sank in the hurricane on October 29 after loss of power and failure of the pumps about 100 miles off the coast of North Carolina. A report of the American amateur radio society (American Radio Relay League, ARRL) says, that according to the ship's electrician, Doug Faunt, N6TQS, all efforts to call for help using satellite phone or short wave voice communication failed. Finally, captain Robin Walbridge, KD4OHZ, sent a distress message to the US Coast Guard via e-mail using the PACTOR-based Winlink system. Within an hour, a Hercules C-130 plane arrived to sight the place of the disaster. Fourteen of the 16 crew members were able to make their way aboard one of the two life rafts and were afterwards evacuated by two rescue helicopters. The captain and a female crew members did not arrive at either of the rafts. The woman was later found unconsciously and also transported to the hospital where she died. Captain Walbridge is still missing at sea and considered to be dead. The remaining 14 crew members returned home healthy in the meantime. They survived thanks to the reliable PACTOR link. As Doug Faunt, who's hobby it is to sail on rebuilds of historical vessels, told the ARRL, he is already looking for a new boat to continue his adventures at sea.\n\nThe austrian Red Cross supports a Short Wave Network using PACTOR Modems as well.

Parker was ordered to detach Denmark from the League by 'amicable arrangement or by actual hostilities'. On 30 March they passed through the narrows.\n\nThe Danish fleet was moored along the shore with old ships (hulks), no longer fit for service at sea, but still powerfully armed, as a line of floating batteries off the eastern coast of the island of Amager, in front of the city in the King's Channel. The northern end of the line terminated at the Tre Kroner forts armed with 68 guns. Batteries covered the water between the Danish line and the shore, and further out to sea a large shoal, the Middle Ground, constricted the channel. The British spent most of the night of 31 March taking soundings in the channel up to the Danish line.\n\nParker gave Nelson the shallower draft ships whilst he remained to the north-east screening Nelson from external interference. The British ships anchored by the stern about a cable (240 yards) from the Danes and they exchanged broadsides until a ship ceased firing. Thinking that Nelson might be being fought to a stand-still but unable to retreat without orders Parker signalled to discontinue the action but upon receiving it Nelson made his famous comment \"You know, Foley, I only have one eye - I have the right to be blind sometimes,\" and holding his telescope to his blind eye \"I really do not see the signal!\".\n\nEventually the superior gunnery of the British started to silence the Danish ships. The cessation of firing left the way open for the British bomb vessels to approach Copenhagen. Several Danish ships fired on British boats sent out to them after their officers had signalled their surrender and Nelson said that he 'must either send on shore and stop this irregular proceeding, or send in our fire ships and burn them'. He sent a note under a flag of truce to the Dano-Norwegian regent, Crown Prince Frederik. After a further exchange of notes a twenty-four hour ceasefire was agreed.\n\nThe Danish-Norwegian loses were estimated between 1,135 to 2,215 captured, killed or wounded.

{"text":"The Titanic may have struck an iceberg and sank helplessly because of a strange atmosphere-caused optical illusion, a new book argues. British historian Tim Maltin says super refraction, an extraordinary bending of light that causes mirages, prevented the Titanic's crew from seeing the fateful iceberg.\n\nIt also may have prevented nearby ships from seeing the doomed Titanic, Maltin argues. His theory is the subject of a new book and a documentary airing next month in time for the 100th anniversary of the accident.\n\nApparently a British investigation in the 1990s brought up super refraction, but no one ever studied it in depth, according to Smithsonian magazine, which just published an excerpt from Maltin's new book. Maltin studied old weather records, shipping logs and survivor testimonies to determine the atmospheric conditions on April 15, 1912. He argues conditions were ripe for super refraction, caused by a thermal inversion in the area south of Newfoundland were the ship was sailing. This abnormal bending of light waves would have created a false horizon, and the iceberg lay beneath it, out of view of the ship's lookouts.\n\nThey sounded the alarm when the iceberg was a mile away, but it was too late. The same bizarre atmospheric conditions could have prevented a nearby ship, the Californian, from seeing or hailing the doomed Titanic, Maltin says. It's a frustrating, sad explanation. Click through to the Smithsonian for more detail.\n\n... And the Iceberg That Doomed It:Photo of the iceberg which was probably rammed by the RMS Titanic, taken five days after the disaster by Stephan Rehorek. Wikimedia Commons\n\nA recent report states that the sun and moon were aligned in a way that created a rare, very deep tide near the Greenland coast. This caused icebergs, which usually drag the ocean floor there, and remain until they have melted enough to float on, instead to continue on their way unobhstructed.\n\nThe iceberg being in that place at that time was rare, and was not expected, possibly causing the captain not to believe radio reports.\n\nYou know, taking full responsibility for the passengers gives rise to going down with the ship. But watching the dramatic movie of Titanic, the Captain staying at the wheel, until the ice cold water crashed through the window and killed him is more like overwhelming regret and suicide.\n\nHad the Captain gotten on top of the deck and commanded and supervised the launch of the emergency boats, I think more people would have survived! But this opinion was based upon a movie and I was not there.\n\nStaying with the ship to supervise is to be respected; to supervise and try to save as many people as you can.\nStaying at the wheel was just hiding via the Titanic movie.\n\nSo what do you feel the Captain actually did?\n\n.............................\nScience sees no further than what it can sense.\nReligion sees beyond the senses"}

The villagers tried to determine the sailors' nationality, asking, \"Are you Napolean?,\" \"Are you Bismarck?,\" \"Are you Washington?\"\n\nThe Cheseborough Wreck as reported in the New York Times - November 1889\n\nThe sea was yellow with spilled sulfur and strange wreckage washed up on the beach; such as novel foods, belongings, and animals. A seed from a pear washed ashore and was planted in Shariki village; today there is a large and beautiful pear tree.\nThe crewmen were housed and cared for and people from miles around brought chickens and eggs to help feed them. Those who survived lived for days with the villagers and when they returned to their homes in the United States, their families wrote letters of friendship for many years.\n\nThe villagers of Shariki held Buddhist and Shinto services for the sailors who perished. These services have continued every year since the tragedy, including during World War II when Japanese-American relationships were strained.\n\nEighty years after the shipwreck, a granite monument was built over the beach where the shipwreck occurred. This monument has a view of the sea and displays the story of the Chesebrough. Children in the village to this day are taught the story of the shipwreck and rescue as a piece of their community's history.\n\nApproximately one hundred years after the wreck. A delegation of Shariki village officials traveled to Bath, Maine, USA to propose the creation of a formal relationship. Papers were signed and Bath and Shariki became sister-cities. From this partnership came the sister-state relationship between the State of Maine and the Aomori Prefecture of Japan as well as multiple other sister-city relationships between towns in Maine and Aomori.\n\nWithin a year, Shariki established the first annual Chesebrough Festival, the Chesebrough Cup. Held in early August, the highlight of the festival is the international swimming competition, in a cove of the Sea of Japan near Shariki. The goal of the race is to eventually swim the 10,200 km distance between Shariki and Bath.\n\nShortly after the initiation of the sister city relationship, Shariki and Bath developed a student exchange program. The purpose of the exchange is to develop a better understanding of each community's life and culture by learning from the other city. This is accomplished by placing visitors in local homes and introducing them to the local community; its history, schools, museums, attractions, and most importantly, its people.\n\nThe Sister-City Proclamation\n\nIn 1990, the first group from Bath to visit Japan included a delegation of city officials. In the following years, Bath swim teams traveled to participate in the Chesebrough Cup. Now the program participants are primarily Bath area middle school and high school students who travel with chaperones for a two week home-stay and extensive touring. The richness of the experience has had a permanent influence on all who have traveled. For many Maine students the trip has been life-changing and has a significant impact on their perspective on the world.\n\nAlso each year, a group from Japan comes to Bath for a visit. This trip is available to 8th grade students who have studied English, accompanied by City and program officials. In 2006, the village of Shariki, population 10,000, merged with four other small villages to form Tsugaru City. Tsugaru chose to continue the relationship with Bath and soon after sent an official delegation to resign the binding documents. The exchange program has continued and thrived with the new city's support.\n\nFrom the beginning, the Bath program has been run by casually organized volunteers and focused on the annual exchange visits. With a few dedicated participants, the traveling students organized the exchange and had orientation sessions with help from earlier travelers. The group realized that a loose volunteer organization has significant weaknesses and in 2007 the decision was made to formally organize, incorporate, and seek charitable status. The primary motivation for the change was to ensure the stable continuation of more cultural exchanges to enrich and support the exchange program within the community. An additional goal was to accomplish more fundraising and to solicit business and community sponsors and broaden travel opportunities for those who cannot afford the cost of travel. Finally, formal organization enables the formation of stronger relationships between the City of Bath, Regional School Unit #1, and sponsoring organizations."}
{"text":"THE STORY OF THE JAMES CAIRD - 2\n\nWithin a few days of their arrival at Elephant Island,\nShackleton decided to fetch help.\n\nAccordingly, having made ready the James Caird, his largest lifeboat,\nfor the voyage, at midday on 24th April, the very last day before the pack\nice closed in again, Shackleton and five others - Worsley, Crean, McNeish,\nMcCarthy and Vincent - set off through the Drake Passage - a name to bring\ndread even to seasoned mariners - in the almost impossible hope of making\nlandfall on South Georgia, eight hundred miles away, and summoning help\nfrom the whaling stations there.\n\nThis journey involved a crossing of the world's most inhospitable ocean in the\ndepths of Antarctic winter. The boat was buffeted by mountainous and tempestuous seas.\nIce built up on the decking, fifteen inches (750mm) deep, threatening to overturn the\nJames Caird. Hour by hour, frostbitten and numbed with cold, they had to chip away\nfrom the vessel. At other times they were forced to bale for dear life. Their only solace\nwas four hourly hot meals and the glimmer of a tiny primus stove. Their discomfort, hunched\nbelow in the James Caird's cramped hold, must have been absolute.\n\nBut given Shackleton's leadership, all six men's sturdy seamenship and the amazing skills\nof New Zealander Frank Worsley, skipper of the Endurance, in charting a route for the\nJames Caird by direct reckoning with only four sightings of the sun for Worsley to observe\ntheir position (April 26, May 3, 4 and 7 - the rest was dead reckoning) - they won through.\nAfter sixteen terrible days at sea, the James Caird sighted land at midday on\nMonday 8 May 1916.\n\nAll was by no means to prove easy, however, even now they had completed 800 miles.\nThe boat arrived off South Georgia in hurricane conditions, and only at 5 p.m. on Wednesday\n10th did they eventually manage to land, after tacking violently to make their way into a\nsmall, inaccessible inlet. Had they failed to make it, or had they overshot the island,\nShackleton, his crew and the James Caird would have been either smashed to pieces\nand or swept beyond South Georgia, to be lost in mid-Atlantic.\n\nThey had travelled fifteen hundred miles since the Endurance had\nbeen crushed. With the James Caird beached in King Haakon Bay to\nthe west, help now lay only some twenty miles away, at the whaling stations\non the east of the island. The mountainous interior had never been penetrated\nbefore. Previous attempts had been defeated by the severity of the elements\nand the only available map, charted largely by Captain Cook, showed merely\nthe outline of the coast.\n\nAs Shackleton's three man group, consisting of himself, Frank Worsley\nand Tom Crean, set off, they were ill-prepared for climbing and had little means\nto prepare for the glaciers, crevasses and snow storms that lay ahead.\n\nBut in the end, Shackleton's proverbial luck held. In no more than thirty-six\nhours and against incredible odds the three of them crossed the island on\nthe only moonlit night before bad weather closed in again, and arrived at\nthe whaling station of Stromness.\n\nIt took four more months and four attempts with help from the Norwegians, and\nfrom Uruguay and Chile, before Shackleton finally managed to negotiate a way through\nthe pack ice aboard the steam tug Yelcho, lent to him by the Chilean\ngovernment, to rescue his remaining twenty-two men.\n\nThat boat journey aboard the James Caird was a supreme act of\nhuman courage. Not a single man of Shackleton 's original twenty-eight men\nwas lost. And though Endurance was lost, the James Caird survives\nto this day as a living reminder of an act of remarkable courage in the\nheroic age of exploration."}

Commissioned in September 1865, she served briefly with the North Atlantic Squadron along the U.S. east coast, then was inactive at the Washington Navy Yard, D.C., until April 1866. After a short stay at New York, in early May Miantonomoh departed on a historic\ntrans-Atlantic voyage, accompanied by USS Augusta and USS Ashuelot . Carrying Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus V. Fox for most of the trip, she arrived in Ireland in mid-June to begin nearly a year of visits to ports from the Baltic to the Mediterranean.\n\nMiantonomoh was decommissioned at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in July 1867, soon after returning to the U.S. from Europe. She recommissioned in November 1869. In January 1870, she steamed north to meet the British ironclad Monarch and USS Plymouth , which were bringing the body of the great philanthropist George Peabody back to Massachusetts for burial. The monitor\nthen operated along the U.S. Atlantic coast until July 1870, when she was laid up at the boston Navy Yard. During that period of active service, she was involved in two collisions, sinking the schooner Sarah at New York in December 1869 and the Navy tug Maria off Martha's Vinyard, Massachusetts, in January 1870. In 1874-75, as part of a program to \"rebuild\" Civil War era\nmonitors into modern ones, her wooden hull was broken up and construction of a new iron-hulled ship, also named Miantonomoh , was begun at Chester, Pennsylvania, essentially retaining only the name of the original.\n\nWatercolor by Oscar Parkes\n\nMoored off the Washington Navy Yard, D.C., in 1865-66.

{"text":"Why it is important for NZ to participate in Rimpac exercises\n\nHawaii is perhaps best known for its many surfers, the blonde-haired, non-threatening and docile creatures comfortably living on the waves.\n\nBut this July and August larger and more deadly craft are skimming the waves around the holiday islands. The 23rd military exercise of the Rim of the Pacific (Rimpac) series is under way and the Royal New Zealand Navy is participating.\n\nThese multinational maritime manoeuvres are the world's largest, with 21 countries invited to participate this year sailing everything from conventionally powered warships to the controversial-only-in-New-Zealand nuclear-powered variants.\n\nIntriguingly, the United States plans for many of its ships to be powered by a 50\/50 mixture of biofuel. The alternate energy was bought at the hefty price of $US12 million for 1.6 million litres, making it the largest single biofuel purchase in history.\n\nThe exercises are particularly important for the US as Washington cements its strategic shift toward the Pacific region. Interoperability and power projection are at the top of the agenda, with Russia making its debut entrance to the series.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand have been invited to previous Rimpac gatherings and it is just as important today as it has been in the past for both South Pacific nations to participate.\n\nThis is because both rely on maritime trade to maintain their standards of living. Neither country could function if those supply lines to the world markets were broken.\n\nMore than 75% of Australian exports and imports (by value) travel by sea. And New Zealand's export market, especially its livestock and dairy industry, depends on the safe travel of shipping to deliver their goods to faraway cities.\n\nThe Australasian nations cannot guarantee the safety of these logistics with their own navies. The Royal New Zealand navy is small and equipped primarily to protect its territorial waters and cannot maintain long-term expeditionary missions.\n\nWhile the Royal Australian navy is stronger in size and capability, and looking to increase its purchases of modern warships, it is nevertheless unable to project any real maritime power.\n\nThroughout their history both nations have relied on a stronger naval power to guarantee their critical supply routes. In the 19th and early 20th centuries that patron country was Britain. British ships controlled the world's strategic waterways and protected international shipping.\n\nHowever, since World War II, when Britain essentially ceded control of the North Atlantic to the US in return for American assistance in fighting Axis powers, the pre-eminent global maritime power has been the United States Navy.\n\nThe US Navy patrols the world's oceans every day of every year. Hundreds of millions of dollars are funnelled into the operation of extremely modern warships that can sail to any part of the globe within days.\n\nIt operates more aircraft carriers than all other countries combined and plans to build even more in the next few decades. In fact, a US carrier group is a centrepiece to the Rimpac exercises.\n\nThere are few things more intimidating than the sight of a US aircraft carrier sailing just offshore for a belligerent government. The presence of American naval patrols around the world, in flashpoints such as the South China Sea or the Korean peninsula, and in the world's most critical shipping lanes, is not to be understated.\n\nWithout the guarantee of international passage that US warships provide the global market could probably not exist.\n\nPerhaps the most enduring international relations success of the past 50 years is also the most difficult to spot. US warships that maintain the balance of power between nations and hold open transit lanes are an integral part of our world.\n\nWithout the United States Navy Japan, for one, would bolster its territorial navy, which is already one of the strongest in the world, to offset the growing strength of China's increasingly capable navy.\n\nIf US ships did not patrol the Arabian Peninsula many of those nations would take their security into their own hands to counter the threat posed by a rising Iran.\n\nThe territorial disputes in the South China Sea is already heating up \u2013 removing the presence of American navy patrols would only accelerate fractures in the region.\n\nIts global maritime pre-eminence prevents conflicts between states just as surely as it can conclude them. US warships now in Hawaii are part of a system that is just as humanitarian as the largest aid package.\n\nThe 21 nations attending Rimpac display the global dependence on American naval power and how incredibly important each country considers training with the US military.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand are participating in the exercises to ensure they can operate alongside the US Navy. It is extremely important for isolated nations such as these to maintain good relations with the current global maritime power.\n\nIn a world that tends toward disorder, the future is always uncertain. Rimpac exercises are an important staple of New Zealand\/Australia\/US military relations and likely will be long into the future.\n\nThe world does not tend toward disorder, it tends toward order. The relatively tiny police forces nations need measured in proportion to their populations illustrates this. The world is more cohesive than ever before because of trade. You could remove 80 percent of the US navy's placements and nothing would change. Trade is trade's own best assurance. US warships intimidate no one of any real concern. Wars are fought and won on land. From Vietnam to Iraq - where warships were used to enforce blockades of medicine that murdered one million Iraqis - warships in modern times prove almost useless. Ironically, Chinese influence is the subtext here, while it is China the insolvent US will borrow the money from - yet again - to fund this \"exercise\"...This is a joke. Nothing but show and distraction for a fleeting ex-power...China, like it or not, is the new dog in town. And they are not in any mood for war.\n\nChina is about 20 years away from floating a capable blue water fleet. It's refurbishment of the Russian Varyag aircraft carrier may look impressive but they are behind by about two generations of competent naval commanders with operational experience. The ship has not even conducted landing trials yet. China is by no means anywhere near being the new dog in town. The US outclasses the Chinese military on every front except perhaps cyber warfare.\n\n\"The 21 nations attending Rimpac display the global dependence on American naval power and how incredibly important each country considers training with the US military.\"\n\nRussia is participating. Are you actually saying Russia is dependent on the American navy for anything? Are you saying Canada is concerned with China? They are very close and friendly trading partners. The hysterical Amerophila of this article borders of culthish. Naive and cultish.\n\n\"The US Navy will demonstrate its green fleet of biofuel-driven vessels\"\n\nNow this line gets to what this is really about - potential military industrial complex sales...It's the worlds largest sales pitch, nothing more.\n\nWhat I'm pointing out is that the world trades with each other because the US Navy patrols the oceans. Without the US Navy performing this task, the world's oceans would likely be closed off for international trade in favour of special partnerships. The US Navy does real humanitarian good each day that it prevents this from happening. Protecting the world's oceans from localised strongmen is in both the US and international community's interests."}

The after deck of the US Coast Guard Cutter MOJAVE with the deck crew preparing to pass a 12-inch hawser to the ship in an attempt to tow her off the beach at the next high tide. CBM Earl J. Morris to the right of the 5-inch gun working next to the ship's rail.\n\nThe S.S. MANHATTAN on a Christmas\/New Years Cruise 1934\/35.\n\nIn the late evening of January 11, 1941 the United States Lines S.S. MANHATTAN, outbound from New York for San Francisco via Havana and the Panama Canal, ran hard aground about 300 yards off the beach ten miles north of Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nThe S.S. MANHATTAN, 705 feet long, displacing 24,290 tons, was cruising inshore of the north moving gulf stream when she plowed into the sandy beach near Lake Worth Inlet and came to an abrupt halt. She tried unsuccessfully to back herself off. The night was cold, the weather clear, light wind and moderately calm sees.\n\nThe S.S. Manhattan's distress call was received at the US Coast Guard Radio Station, Jacksonville, Florida. The 8th Coast Guard District Office notified the nearest rescue units to proceed to the scene and provide assistance.\n\nThe life boat station at Lake Worth Inlet immediately launched their 36-foot self righting, self bailing motor surf boat. This was the First Coast Guard unit to reach the S.S. MANHATTAN. The 192 passengers and 482 crew members were in no immediate danger and the ship's captain believed he could re-float his ship during the next high tide, so the Coast Guard surf boat hove to and remained at the scene.\n\nThe 125 foot Coast Guard patrol boat VIGILANT, based at Fort Pierce 40 miles to the north, recalled its crew members and was soon underway to also stand by with the surf boat should the passengers or crew need to be removed or otherwise assisted.\n\nSeventy miles to the south in Miami the large 240 foot Coast Guard Cutter MOJAVE began recalling its crew and was underway about one hour later.\n\nThe MOJAVE was back in her homeport of Miami in between tours of duty on Neutrality and Weather Patrols in the North Atlantic Ocean and towing mothballed W.W.I ships from storage in the Mississippi River near New Orleans to East Coast ports for refurbishing for delivery to Great Britain.\n\nDuring December 1940 on one of these long distance tows in a severe Atlantic storm, the 12-inch towing hawser snapped in two and had to be recovered before it became fouled in the MOJAVE's propeller. After recovering the hawser from the tow and splicing it together, it was again passed to the towed ship which was in danger of being washed onto the beach. A short time later the hawser again snapped. It was decided to replace the 12-inch manila hemp hawser with an inch and one-half wire rope hawser.\n\nOnce again the MOJAVE's whale boat towed the hawser to the towed ship and placed extra crew members on board to assist in hauling it aboard and securing it. After arduous hours of recovering the manila hawser and replacing it with the wire hawser, it now became necessary to splice in a wire bridal to ease the strain. While the deck crew was accomplishing this task, strands of the wire hawser would snap and unwrap with violent slashing of the deck and anything it came in contact with.\n\nThe deck crew finally completed this hazardous task as the storm continued to worsen. The tow was once again underway. The MOJAVE and her seasoned crew had plenty of experience in towing vessels.\n\nWhen the MOJAVE was underway, the 26-foot monamoy whale boat was rigged for sea outboard of its storage space so to be ready for any emergency. In the dark night hours the deck crew, under direction of Chief Boatswain Mate (CBM) Earl J. Morris, were just completing this task when a large ocean swell caused the MOJAVE to roll heavily and Seaman First Class (S1\/C) Harold was knocked overboard into the ocean. The cry \"Man Overboard\" was sounded. Quartermaster (QM) Charles Day on the bridge noted the time and immediately released a slide-mounted Fromkin Life Buoy, a large copper clad U-shaped life buoy equipped with carbide lights that ignited when immersed in water. This gave the \"man overboard\" a floatation aid and the ship a reference point to begin its search and rescue operations as it reversed course back to the emergency scene.\n\nChief Morris, as boat coxswain, with S1\/C J. C. Entrakin, as stroke oarsman, mustered the six-man crew and immediately launched the whale boat even as the MOJAVE slowed its speed and began its turn to reverse course and return to the scene. The oarsmen began their strong strokes with Chief Morris standing in the stern at the sweep oar steering towards the Fromkin life buoy lights., Seaman Harold was also swimming towards the float and reached it at almost the same time as the whale boat.\n\nThe whale boat crew pulled S1\/C Harold and the Fromkin life buoy on board and rowed to the returning MOJAVE pulling along side, hooking on and hoisted aboard, all the while underway in a rolling sea. The total elapsed time according to QM Charles Day was under six minutes. The MOJAVE was on its way back to the grounded S.S. MANHATTAN.\n\nThe MOJAVE deck crew, under Chief Morris, began preparing the 12-inch manila towing hawser and associated towing gear. The hawser was removed from its below-deck storage and rigged an the after deck. the MOJAVE would arrive on scene at about 4 AM, 12 JAN 41. The initial plan was to attempt to tow the S.S. MANHATTAN off the beach at the next high tide, scheduled at 9 AM.\n\nOn arrival the MOJAVE passed the 12-inch hawser to the S.S. MANHATTAN with assistance From the Lake Worth Inlet surf boat. At the 9 AM high tide all was ready and the MOJAVE began pulling while the S.S. MANHATTAN pushed with her engines in the first attempt to pull her off the beach.\n\nThe incoming high tide was also pushing more sand against the grounded ship setting her more firmly in place. The ship was taking a list to port as she grounded more firmly. The towing operation was placing a tremendous strain on the MOJAVE. The Merritt Chapman and Scott tugboat WILLET now arrived from Key West and added her capabilities in the attempt to pull the S.S. MANHATTAN from the beach. But she was firmly fixed and it would take extensive salvage operations before the ship would be re-floated.\n\nThe Coast Guard was relieved of responsibility for re-floating the S.S. MANHATTAN. The passengers and most of the crew were removed by the surf boat and VIGILANT without incident. The Merritt Chapman and Scott tugboat company was awarded a contract to re-float the ship. Three company tugs, the WILLET, RELIEF and WARBLER, spent the next three weeks and succeeded on 4 Feb 41. It was necessary to off-load many tons of cargo including many automobiles and fuel oil, and to dredge out a channel before the y were successful.\n\nThe S.S. MANHATTAN suffered considerable damage to its two propellers and starboard engine shaft. She was towed to Robins Dry Dock in Brooklyn, New York, for repairs.\n\nOn completion of repairs, the S.S. MANHATTAN was taken over by the Navy as the troop transport USS WAKEFIELD (AP21) with a US Coast Guard crew in June 1941.\n\nIn January 1942, as she evacuated British citizens from the port of Singapore, the WAKEFIELD was hit by a Japanese bomb killing five and wounding nine Coast Guard crew members, among the first Coast Guard casualties of W.W.II.\n\nOn 3 September 1942 while returning to the U.S. from England, a fire broke out an board causing the Coast Guard crew to evacuate the embarked passengers and finally the crew itself. A salvage crew returned and extinguished the fire but the WAKEFIELD had to be towed to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and eventually to the U.S. She was rebuilt and recommissioned with a new Coast Guard crew in February 1944 and served in both the Atlantic and Pacific as a troop transport until June 1946.\n\nThe MOJAVE returned to North Atlantic Ocean Neutrality and Weather Patrols until 7 DEC 41. With the entry of the United States into W.W.II she continued service on convoy duty throughout the war. The MOJAVE was decommissioned on July 3, 1947, worn out after 26 years of arduous serviceCruising the past: The SS Europa was the pride of Norddeutscher Lloyd Line in the 1930s. She was the sister ship of the SS Bremen.\n\nSadly the Second World War caused an end to her years in German hands and she was handed to the French as war reparations.\n\nAs SS Liberte, the ship became the stop gap flagship for CGT French Line as a replacement for the legendary SS Normandie that had been lost during the Second World War.\n\nShe was transformed into the pride of France and finally was retired in 1961 after serving two great nations.\n\nTHE FRENCH LINE \u2013 SS LIBERTE \u2013 1950s \u2013 Here are some wonderful vintage home movies shot aboard a crossing on the Liberte.

{"text":"Saturday, April 14, 2012\n\nTombstone design; that's what my maritime school instructor use to characterize the maritime regulation making mechanism. Probably no bigger set of regulations has ever been imposed on the seafaring world, than the ones resulting from the sinking of the RMS Titanic.\n\nUnless you are a cavemen, having recently awoken from your long icy slumber, then I am sure you are well aware that the Royal Mail Ship Titanic, sank 100 years ago today. The 46,328 GRT vessel, the largest at the time, hit an iceberg at 23:40hrs, slicing open its recently constructed hull, while on its maiden voyage. It sank into icy depths of the Atlantic over two hours later, taking with it about 1500 lives, including all the engineering officers.\n\nThere is much coverage of this event in the public, so there is plenty for you to digest from more knowledgeable sources than this blog. But I just wanted to pay a humble homage to the engineers aboard, who by all accounts were instrumental in keeping the lights on, until the final moments, when she slipped below the surface.\n\nKeeping the lights on, meant that the engineers had to maintain fire in the boilers, and steam pressure up. The electricians then had to nurse the electrical generators going, by keeping the turbines humming along. Lighting was critical of course, but ultimately the need for electricity to launch the lifeboats meant this task done, deep in the bowels of the liner, that was sinking, was nothing short of a brave feat, deserving of truly heroic designation.\n\nAccording to the Guild of Benevolence's Titanic Centenary Appeal, all 35 engineers, from Chief to Engineer's Clerk went down with the ship. Also perished, were the Titanic's Designer and seven \"warrantee engineers\" from the builder, Harland and Wolff. In 1912, the IMAREST in cooperation with British paper, Daily Chronicle, established The Titanic Engineering Staff Memorial Benevolent Fund, which was created to aid the families of those brave men who lost their lives.\n\nThose family have moved on, but the fund remains, and continues to aid the families of all lost certificated marine engineering professionals who have perished, regardless of IMAREST membership. They are currently appealing to the community and general public for donation to maintain their work. To find out more about their work and how you can help, visit their website here.\n\nI stayed up way too late the other day watching a riveting special on the Titanic's engineers; it was called \"Saving the Titanic\". The documentary dramatically recreated the happenings as reported in the inquiries, by the few survivors. I particularly enjoyed this take, which I've never seen before, an homage to the men below. If you are interested in further films on the Titanic, I understand the 1958 film, \"A night to remember\", is the most technically accurate recreation on film. The National Post also has these really neat old pictures of the ill fated ship posted on their website.\n\nWe've been reminded quite starkly of the results from the Titanic's foundering, especially with the recent spat of maritime accidents involving passenger ships, such as the Costa Concordia. These accidents have in some way been mitigated by the many regulations resulting from the Titanic, namely the Safety of life at sea (SOLAS) convention, which came in 1914.\n\nI heard quite an apt comment yesterday on the radio, responding to the longevity of the public's fascination with this doomed liner; \"The story has proven unsinkable with the general public, long after the ship sank\".\n\n2 comments:\n\nIm back on board my ship, and just finished watching the 1958 film. Quite moving to think of the scale of that disaster, and to think, its almost exactly the same type of accident that caused the Costa Concordia to sink, a length wise gash, there must be someone at higher levels asking themselves how can we solve this."}
{"text":"Steamboats and Hunt Brothers\n\nShipping and Shipbuilding in the Puget Sound\n\nThe Hunt Brothers: Emmett, Arthur, Arda, Lloyd, and Floyd\n\nCollectively and individually, the Hunt brothers are synonymous with shipping and shipbuilding the length and breadth of Puget Sound. Their steamboats and the quality of transportation they provided for both passengers and freight for more than half a century contributed immensely to the growth of the entire region. As one competing skipper is said to have remarked wistfully, \"The Hunt family was so successful in business because there were always brothers to help when other operators had to depend on a hired crew.\"\n\nEmmett Hunt, second eldest son, was the first of the six Hunt brothers to decide he preferred earning his living on the water rather than farming a homestead in Artondale. His first venture involved rowing across the Narrows to Steilacoom and then back to Wollochet Bay to pick up and deliver the mail. The weekly trip was extremely arduous, with winds and tides buffeting his small boat, and waves and winter rain drenching Emmett.\n\nTimeline for Hunt Brothers Steamboating\n\n1882 Assisted by his brother Arthur, Emmett designed and built his first steamboat, the 26-ft. Baby Mine, with a four-by-four oscillating engine. Emmett was now able to transport both freight and passengers.\n\n1892 Emmett designed the 59-ft. Victor which was built in 1893. She had a ladies' cabin, smoking room, pilot house, and closets. Route: Gig Harbor, Quartermaster Harbor on Vashon Island, and Tacoma.\n\n1898 Emmett, Arthur, Arda, and Lloyd began building the 102-ft. Sentinel to replace the Victor. She could carry 100 passengers. Route:, the highly prized Tacoma to Seattle. Races between steamboats on this route were common and the Sentinel acquitted herself well.\n\n1900Crest built, measured 91.2 ft. in length, 20 ft. at the beam, 5.9 ft. deep, and 99 gross tons and 67 tons net. Hull was built in a tear drop design, originated by Hunts. The blunt bow increased cargo space, permitting Crest to haul more passengers and freight at the same speed.\n\n1902 Interurban began railway transportation between Tacoma and Seattle. Use of steamers dropped dramatically. Emmett and Arthur divided ownership of the boats. Emmett took Crest and Arthur took Sentinel and Clara Brown.\n\n1905 Arthur Hunt and Frank Bibbins formed the Tacoma and Burton Navigation Company. Arthur designed Burton and Magnolia.\n\n1907 Emmett's wife Henrietta dies, Emmett retires from steamboating.\n\nc. 1912 Arda and Lloyd purchased Bibbins' interest in Tacoma and Burton Navigation Co. and, together with Arthur, established a shipyard on the Puyallup River. Steamboats Ariel and Atalanta were built there.\n\n1919 Tacoma and Burton Navigation Company dissolved. Arthur and Lloyd took cash, Arda took Florence K for Gig Harbor run in place of Atalanta. Arthur starts marine repair shop in Tacoma, builds ferry boats.\n\n1912 Emmett sells Crest to farmers' cooperative Hales Passage and Wollochet Bay Navigation Co. Floyd was hired as skipper, Lloyd was engineer. Crest renamed Bay Island, carried produce from farms along Hales Passage and Wollochet Bay to Tacoma. Making as many as ten stops along the way, the steamer ran in the evening so her cargo of fruits and vegetables would be fresh when it reached market.\n\n1922Floyd builds Burro. It operates on the Allyn-Rocky Bay-Longbranch run. Operation of Burro was a family affair: Floyd was skipper, wife Ella cooked, and sons Maury and Ward ran the engine.\n\nc. 1923 Arda converts steamer Florence K into a ferry and runs in competition with ferry City of Tacoma between Tacoma and Gig Harbor.\n\n1926 Floyd's son Ward drowns. Floyd sells Burro to Lloyd and retires from steamboating. Later, he came out of retirement to skipper the ferry FoxIsland. Arda officially retires, although he later occasionally served as relief skipper of the ferry Fox Island."}

{"text":"CASE STUDY - Antarctic Mission For Royal Navy\nEarlier this year, international satellite communications solution provider, NSSL, sponsored a crack team of Royal Navy personnel from HMS Endurance, the Royal Navy's Antarctic ice patrol ship, as they attempted to set a world record by kayaking around James Ross Island, off the coast of Antarctica. The island is 65km in length and is named after James Clark Ross, the explorer, who first sighted the island in 1843.\n\nSix serving members of the Royal Navy and one civilian were the expedition members. Their aim was to kayak around the island for a total of 120 nautical miles, resting at night on the island itself and paddling by day.\n\nThe estimated time to complete the mission was about 8 days, all highly dependent upon the weather conditions. Icebergs and subfreezing temperatures as low as \u201330C were among the additional hazards that had to be faced. If the team were able to complete this mission, a world record would be theirs no one previously had ever kayaked this far south, or around, James Ross Island. Plus, these stalwart Royal Navy adventurers were able to illustrate the amazing capabilities of BGAN mobile broadband terminals and Iridium handheld phones; their only means of communication once the mission was underway.\n\nThe team set off in February 2007, following many months of training, with individual GPS units and a BGAN kit to assist them in asserting their locations and communicating with the world. Scientific tests were also to be carried out, specifically on the south side of the island. Geological observations would offer data from fossils and rocks as to what life existed when Antarctica was a green paradise.\n\nCircumnavigating James Ross Island in sea kayaks was an extremely ambitious plan. The team paddled as many as ten hours a day and also had to contend with icebergs capable of sinking or crushing their canoes, blinding hurricanes that made paddling impossible, and killer leopard seals.\n\nThanks to the BGAN and Iridium kit, however, these dangers were significantly reduced. The kit allowed the team to:\n\nCheck weather reports independently of HMS Endurance\n\nComfortably operate at a considerable distance from HMS Endurance and other inhabited areas\n\nCall in for emergency help or assistance if anything went wrong\n\nUpdate daily blogs with ease\n\nRemain in contact with friends, family, sponsors and the media in the United Kingdom\n\nThe expedition members were:\nMatthew Twiselton, Mike Devlin, Stephen Paris Hunter, Mark Townsend, Mark Jameson and Richard Abbot\nAccording to Stephen Paris-Hunter, Fellow, Royal Geographical Society (FRGS), and the expedition leader with more than 22 expeditions under his belt, \"The equipment supplied by NSSL was robust, reliable and performed brilliantly under extreme conditions and the pre-deployment training and support given by NSSL was absolutely essential. It allowed us to contact the outside world at times when it seemed we were the most isolated individuals on earth. Importantly, the kit was small and portable enough to fit into the confined space of a kayak.\"\n\nNSSL supplied the BGAN set, two Iridium phones and solar panels to recharge the batteries. According to Danielle Edwards, Product Marketing Manager, \"This expedition really proves how satcoms have evolved to become a must-have necessity for adventurers who want to push the limits of human endeavor.\"\n\nNSSL was established in 1969 and is an independent service provider for satellite communications solutions as well as one of the top Inmarsat service providers worldwide.

{"text":"The four Kongo-class ships were the first modern warships in the Japanese Navy. They were designed by Britain's Sir George Thurston, and strongly influenced the design of the forthcoming Tiger-class battlecruisers. They were originally rated as battlecruisers, but 1933-1934 reconstruction and rearmament at Kure reclassified them as battleships.\n\nAs WW2 broke out, Kirishima first served as naval support off the Chinese coast beginning in 1938, then escorted the Japanese aircraft carriers during the raid on Pearl harbor. She was active during the Japanese southward offensive in early 1942. In Mar and Apr, she was part of the powerful force that raided the British in the Indian Ocean. During the Solomons Campaign later in 1942, Kirishima was present during the carrier battles of the Eastern Solomons in August and the Santa Cruz Islands in October. She received minor damage in the night surface action off Guadalcanal on 13 Nov. Two nights later, serving as flagship of another Japanese surface force, she was engaged by the American battleships Washington and South Dakota. She exchanged gunfire with the latter, but because American destroyers' spotlights blinded Kirishima's lookouts, she could not locate Washington which was located 8,000 yards away. Because her guns were trained accurately on South Dakota already, Kirishima did not attempt to shift her guns at Washington's direction. At the end of the engagement, she was hit by nine 16-in shells and forty 5-in shells, all from Washington, and became disabled. With her superstructure aflame and rudders stuck, Kirishima was scuttled by opening her Kingston valves a few miles west of Savo Island about two and half hours after the start of the engagement. About 250 men were lost during the battle.\n\nKirishima's wreck was discovered and examined in August 1992, resting upside down with its forward end blown off some 4000 feet below the surface"}

{"text":"Emergencies\n\nShips are a dangerous place to be, even in peace time or in port. When at sea there is no external fire or police department to call, the ships crew must do everything. During emergencies, to save the ship, every sailor about ship has a specific job to do.\n\nAbandon Ship: Used when the ship is in such a condition that it may sink or it is an extreme danger to the crew, and the crew must leave the ship. It may only be ordered by the Commanding Officer. Word passed is \"Prepare to abandon ship, nearest land is ___ degrees (magnetic), friendly\/unfriendly(whether the local people are friend or foe), distance to land, temperature of the water, and deep or shallow water destruction instruction (in water less than 100 fathoms, important documents must be burned. In water greater than 100 fathoms, they may go down with the ship. \" All headings are given in magnetic bearings so a compass can be used to navigate life rafts. When ordered, the crew will grab their life jackets and report to their abandon ship stations.\n\nMan Overboard: Used when it is believed that a crew member may have fallen overboard. When called, all personnel will physically report to their divisions. Divisions will muster their assigned personnel and report the results to their departments. Departments will report the names of any unaccounted for personnel to the bridge. Bridge will call over the 1MC the names of the unaccounted for personnel and order them to report to the bridge. This process is used to identify who is unaccounted for and may be overboard.\n\nUpon the call of \"Man Overboard!\" the OOD will immediately perform the prescribed ship maneuver to bring the ship back to its location when the man overboard was reported.\n\nA DRT NC-2 (dead reckoning tracer) plotter is indispensable in a man overboard situation. When a man overboard is reported, a plotter must quickly mark the spot indicating the ship's present position, and change the DRT scale to 200 yards to the inch to keep a more precise track of the person overboard.. The ship's position must be determined where the person actually went over the side. A plotter then determines the bearing and range to the person every 15 to 30 seconds. The NC-2 plotting table utilizes five optical projectors for displaying own ship's and target symbols on the plotting surface. Own ship's position is located at the center of the polar diagram. During normal operations in the geographic plot mode, own ship's position (and, therefore, the polar diagram) move geographically across the plotting surface according to the DRT information supplied by the DRAI (dead reckoning analyzer-indicator).\n\nLife jackets have a strobe light attached that blinks when in salt water. Spotters are posted to look for the person overboard. When the person overboard is spotted, a life ring\/buoy is thrown as close to the person as possible and a smoke float is activated and thrown in the vicinity of the person.\n\nLookouts, under direct supervision of the OOD, are posted at stations on the fantail and sponsons to look specifically for the man overboard. At night, search lights may be used.\n\nThe person overboard may be recovered by small boat, the ship, or by air.\n\nWhen the ship has slowed sufficiently to launch boat, the motor whaleboat will trek toward the target guided by signals, searchlight or radio. This is the most common method of recovery.\n\nUnder conditions of low visibility, when weather is too heavy for boat recovery, or when it is believed that a person fell overboard some time previously but was not seen or heard, it is desirable for the ship to turn so as to pass back down her track. This is achieved by the Williamson turn. The turn is started using full rudder (30 degrees). When the ships heading is about 60 degrees beyond the original course, the rudder is shifted and the ship is brought around to the reciprocal of her original course.\n\nWhen the ship is turned about lines, swimmers and\/or cargo nets are lowered when alongside the target.\n\nA helicopter may be used to search wide area, or to provide immediate recovery ability. It is also useful in weather too heavy for motor whaleboats. A rescue swimmer will be deployed to assist in the air recovery.\n\nCollision: A violent crash between two objects having a steady bearing and decreasing range. When a collision is expected, a call to \"Rig For Collision (along with expected location of collision)\" is called over the 1MC to alert the crew to prepare for a collision. When a collision is imminent, a call to \"Brace For Collision (along with expected location of collision)\" is called over the 1MC to alert the crew to take personal action to protect themselves for collision.\n\nFire: Occurs when a fire is reported to the bridge. \"Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire in compartment (location)\" is called over the 1MC, along with the repair locker responsible for that compartment.\n\nFlooding: Occurs when flooding is reported to the bridge. \"Flooding! Flooding! Flooding! Flooding in compartment (location)\" is called over the 1MC, along with the repair locker responsible for that compartment.\n\nEmergency Break Away: An accelerated standard breakaway during a conventional underway replenishment using an orderly and prearranged procedure. The objective is for the receiving ship to disengage quickly without damaging the rigs or endangering personnel. The commanding officer of either ship can order an emergency breakaway. The danger signal (5 short blasts) is sounded on the ship's whistle to warn other ships of the emergency action.\n\nHard Aground: A vessel lodged with its bottom aground that is unable to free itself without assistance.\n\nSoft Aground: A vessel that is aground but that can free itself without outside assistance by shifting ballast and reversing the screws."}

In that\nchallenge, there was no British yacht taking part. Yet the right to\nchallenge was once regarded as the sole prerogative of sailors from\nthese islands. The English and the Irish competed over the years but\nin 1887, there was a uniquely Scottish attempt to win the cup.\nAppropriately, the challenging yacht bore the name Thistle. This is\nthe story of how Scotland became involved in the challenge before the\nturn of the 19th century, when not only Thistle but also Sir Tommy\nLipton's yachts, all named Shamrock, vied for the prize. It also\nreveals the little known story of the Barr brothers from Gourock, John\nand Charlie. John was helmsman of Thistle as a challenger in 1897 and\nCharlie won the Cup in 1899 for America and successfully defended it\non behalf of the New York Yacht Club in 1901, becoming the first\nhelmsman to win the Cup three times."}

{"text":"lake freighter\n\nInformation about lake freighter\n\nThe ill-fated SS Edmund Fitzgerald, built in the classic dual superstructure style with her wheelhouse up near the bow.\n\nLake freighters, or Lakers, are cargo vessels that work the Great Lakes. The most well-known is the SS Edmund Fitzgerald, the latest major vessel to be wrecked on the Lakes. These vessels are traditionally called boats, not ships. Visiting ocean-going vessels are referred to as \"salties.\" Due to their additional beam, very large salties are never seen inland of the St Lawrence Seaway. Because the largest Lakers are confined to the Upper Lakes (Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie) because they are too large to use the Seaway locks, beginning at the Welland Canal that bypasses the Niagara River.\n\nCargo\n\nLakers are generally bulk carriers, that is they carry loads of rocks, salt or grain in large holds - not in containers. The earlier ships required unloading machinery at the docks but modern Lakers are self unloaders which allows them to unload faster and in more ports.\n\nThe most common cargoes on the Great Lakes are taconite, which is a type of iron ore; limestone, grain, salt, coal, cement, gypsum, sand, slag and potash. Much of the cargo goes to support the steel mills for the auto industry which was centered around the Great Lakes because of the ease of Lake transport. Other destinations include coal-fired power plants and stone docks where limestone is unloaded for the construction industry.\n\nDepending on their application, lakers may also be referred to by their type, such as oreboats (used primarily for iron ore), flatbacks (no self-unloading gear), bulkers (carry bulk cargo), sternenders (all cabins aft), self unloaders (has self unloading gear), longboats (reference to their slender look), or lakeboats, among others.\n\nSize\n\nThe largest vessels on the lake are the 1000 footers (300 m). These vessels are between 1000 and 1013.5 feet (305 and 309 m) long, 105 feet (32 m) wide and of 56 feet (17 m) hull depth. They can carry as much 78,850 long tons of bulk cargo although their loading is dependent on lake water levels especially in the channels and ports. A dozen of these giant ships were built, all constructed between 1976 and 1981, and all are still afloat today. The most powerful of these, the Edwin H. Gott[1], carries two Enterprise DMRV-16-4 diesel engines driving twin propellers and is rated at 19,500 brake horsepower, making the Gott the most powerful lake boat on the seaway. (14.5 MW). This generates a top speed of 16.7 mph (27 km\/h). The Paul R. Tregurtha is the largest boat on the lakes, at 1013'6\" and 68,000 gross ton capacity. The Stewart J. Cort, which is not only the first 1000-footer to be put into service on the Lakes, but also the only one built in the traditional wheelhouse-forward Great Lakes style (although all accommodations are foreward, and the stern deckhouse is occupied by self unloading equipment and the engines), is another notable vessel. The Cort started life in Mississippi, and was sailed as a much smaller vessel consisting of only the bow and stern sections (appropriately nicknamed \"Stubby\"), to Erie, Pennsylvania , where she was cut in half and an additional 800+ feet of hull were added. Another interesting 1000-footer is the Presque Isle, an articulated tug and barge combination. The Presque Isle is the largest tug \/ barge composite in the world. All lakers longer than 730 feet are United States vessels, for the Canadian fleet needs to travel to and from its major cities along the St. Lawrence Seaway. The reason for this standard length, is the Welland Canal which bypasses Niagara Falls. The locks here are only about 800 feet long, and for safety reasons, the vessels must be 730' or less.\n\nMore common are lake boats in the 600 and 700 foot (183 and 213 m) classes, due to the limitations of the Welland Canal. These vessels vary greatly in configuration and cargo capacity, being capable of hauling between 10,000 and 40,000 tons per trip depending on the individual boat. The last major vessel built for bulk cargoes on the lakes is the Great Lakes Trader (2000 - 740 feet\/225.56 m), a self-unloading barge permanently partnered to the tugJoyce L. Van Enkevort (1998 - 135 feet\/41.22 m). The combined tug and barge measure 844 feet 10 inches (257.6 m).\n\nList of 1000-footers on the Lakes\n\nBulk freighters\n\nAmerican Integrity\n\nAmerican Spirit\n\nAmerican Century\n\nEdgar B.

Aird, a newer Laker (1983) with a single aft superstructure\n\nSince these vessels all have to proceed through the locks of the Great Lakes Waterway they have features in common, and their appearance differs from similar sized ocean-going freighters. They are narrower and generally longer. An early variation of the type (designed by Alexander McDougall and built from 1887 through 1898) was the \"whaleback\" design, which featured significant tumblehome in the sides of the hull and a rounded bow, looking rather like the back of a whale (hence the name). The largest deep lock at the Soo is the Poe Lock which is 1,200 feet (370 m) long and 110 feet (34 m) wide. Thirty vessels on the lakes can pass only between Lake Superior and Lake Huron via this lock although none approaches the lock's size. Many Lakers are restricted to the Lakes, being unable to navigate the St Lawrence Seaway whose locks allow a maximum vessel size of 740 feet (226 m) in length or 78 feet (24 m) in breadth. Where the superstructure of an ordinary freighter used to have the bridge in the center of the vessel, lake freighters typically have the bridge and associated superstructure right up in the bow. Traditionally they had a second island, over the engine room, right aft in the stern. These dual cabined boats were constructed between 1869 and 1974. The R.J. Hackett premiered the style and the second Algosoo was the final vessel designed this way. More recently built lakers, like the Seawaymax CSL Niagara, have a single large superstructure island right astern.\n\nLake freighter Edward Ryerson just leaving the Soo Locks (bottom right). Michigan on right foreground, Ontario left and background.\n\nLakers differ from most salties in having bluff bows instead of raked or clipper bows and rarely have bulbous bow extensions (Note: A few Canadian Lakers are fitted with ice-breaking bulbous bows). The narrow, raked bow of a saltie allows it more speed, while a bluff bow allows for more cargo capacity at a given draft (but pushes more water). Vessel speeds are not as essential on the Lakes as compared to the ocean. The distances between ports is not as great as those in the ocean trades, therefore cargo capacity is more important than speed. The Lake vessels are designed with the greatest box coefficient in order to maximize the vessels size in the many locks within the Great Lakes\/St Lawrence Seaway system. Therefore, ship designers have favored bluff bows over streamlined bows for that reason. Following World War II, several ocean freighters and tankers were transported to the Great Lakes and converted to Bulk carriers as a way to acquire ships cheaply. Several of them served well in the role and continue to sail today (American Victory (fmr. Middletown), Lee A, Tregurtha, and a few others).\n\nAnother distinguishing feature of Lake vessels versus Ocean vessels is the cargo hatch configuration. On the Lake vessels, the hatches are traditionally spaced 24 feet (7.8m) apart. This configuration was created by the need to match the vessel hatches to the loading facilities. At the turn of the 19th century, most ore loading facilities had loading chutes spaced every 12 feet (3.8m). The ship designers used this pattern as a basis for their hatch configuration. This pattern is continued today, even with the most modern Lake vessels. In comparison, a Lake vessel will have many more hatches than an Ocean vessel of equal length.\n\nThe shallow draft imposed by the rivers (typically dredged to about 28 feet (8.5m) by the United States Army Corps of Engineers) restricts the cargo capacity of Lakers, but that is partially recovered by their extra length and box design. Since Great Lakes waves never achieve the great length or period of ocean waves, particularly compared to the waves' height, ships are in less danger of being suspended between two waves and breaking, so the ratio between the ship's length, beam and its depth can be a bit larger than that of an ocean-going ship. The Lake vessels generally have a 10:1 length to beam ratio, whereas the Ocean Vessels are typically 7:1. The dimension of the locks is the deciding factor in Lake vessel construction.\n\nLifespan\n\nIn 2006, the J.B. Ford, left, in use for cement storage at age 102 with J.A.W. Iglehart, right, in her last month of a 70-year sailing career which included surviving a U-boat attack in the Atlantic during WWII.\n\nSince the freshwater lakes are less corrosive to ships than the salt water of the oceans, many of the Lakers remain in service for long periods and the fleet has a much higher average age than the ocean-going fleet. Boats older than 50 years are not unusual, and, in fact, account for more than half of the fleet. The St. Mary's Challenger, built in 1906 as the William P Snyder (550 feet), is currently the oldest boat in active duty on the Lakes. She is managed by HMC Ship Management, LTD. and owned by St. Mary's Cement, a subsidiary of Votorantim Cimentos. The E.M. Ford had the one of the longest careers, having been built in 1898 (as the Presque Isle - 428 feet) and still sailing on the lakes 98 years later in 1996. In 2007 she was still afloat as a stationary transfer vessel at a riverside cement silo in Saginaw. The J.B. Ford, built in 1904, last sailed in 1985 and in 2007 served in the same capacity as the E.M. at a different cement silo in Superior, Wisconsin. Several decorated World War II veteran ships are still in active, although civilian, use such as the tankers Chiwawa and Neshanic, now the bulk freighters Lee A. Tregurtha and American Victory, respectively, and the Landing Craft Tank 203, now the working vessel Outer Island.\n\nFamous boats\n\nThe most famous laker was the SS Edmund Fitzgerald, which sank on Lake Superior on November 10, 1975. The Fitz was the first ship with a length of 730 feet and the flagship of the Columbia Steamship Division of Oglebay Norton Co. The MV Stewart J Cort was the first of the 1000-foot oreboats.\n\nThe first laker with self-unloading equipment was the Hennepin (formerly the George H Dyer) a small wooden laker that was refitted with the equipment in 1902 The first laker built as a self-unloader was the Wyandotte launched in 1908; before these all boats were unloaded via shoreside equipment. Self-unloading equipment worked well for cargos that could \"flow\" out of the holds onto the belts, like coal and limestone. It did not work well for grain, which flowed too readily and would spill off the conveyors, or iron ore, which wouldn't flow enough and would hang up in the hold. Because the predominant cargo for lakers was iron ore, self-unloaders did not become common until higher grade ores were depleted and taconite pellets were developed in the 1970s. Steam power first appeared in the 1860s and became the standard source of power for over a century. The Canadian grainboat Feux Follets of 1966 was the last laker to be built with a steam turbine and thus was the last steamer built on the lakes. Ford Motor Company's Henry Ford 2nd and Benson Ford of 1925 were the first lakeboats with diesel engines; that powerplant did not become standard until the 1970s. The last active ships of 1920s vintage, and the oldest ships still operating in non-specialized bulk trades are the motorvessels Maumee and Calumet of Lower Lakes Towing which were built as the William G Clyde and Myron C Taylor for US Steel. The ST Crapo, inactive since 1996, was built to haul finished powdered cement for Huron Cement Co. back in 1927 and was the second ship of that design, the first being the John G Boardman of the same company. The Crapo was also the last coal burning freighter on the Great Lakes.\n\nThe classic design of cabins fore-and-aft with open decks over the hold started with the 208 foot long R.J. Hackett, designed and built by Elihu Peck in 1869. The first iron-hulled laker was the Brunswick, launched at Detroit in 1881. The Brunswick sank after a collision later that year and was apparently little known. So it is that many follow the lead of the contemporary Cleveland press and credit the Onoko as the first iron-hulled laker, launched in 1882. The Onoko's higher center section did become a standard for later lakers. At 302 feet, the Onoko was the first bulk carrier to hold the unofficial title of \"Queen of the Lakes\" (longest vessel on the lakes). The SS Carl D. Bradley (1927 \u2013 640 feet) held the title for 22 years, longer than any other laker of the classic design. Currently that title is held by the modern stern-ender Paul R Tregurtha. Launched in 1981 as the William J Delancy, and measuring 1,013.5 feet, the Paul R Tregurtha has held the title for 25 years. The Bradley is also known for breaking her back and foundering in a Lake Michigan storm in 1958. There were only two survivors. The Wilfred Sykes (1949 \u2013 678 feet) is considered to be the first of the modern lakers, and when converted to a self-unloader in 1975 was the first to have the equipment mounted aft. Since then all self-unloading equipment has been mounted aft. The Algoisle (formerly the Silver Isle) (1962 \u2013 715.9 feet) was the first modern laker built with all cabins aft (a \"stern-ender\"), following the lead of ocean-going bulk carriers and reprising a century old form used by little river steam barges and the whalebacks. The Stewart Cort (1971) was the first 1,000 footer and the only \"footer\" built in the classic cabins-fore-and-aft style. The Algosoo (1974 \u2013 730 feet) was the last laker built in the classic style.\n\nAlso of note is the steamer Edward L. Ryerson, widely known for her artistic design and being the only remaining straight-decked (without self unloading machinery) freighter still in active service on the U.S. side of the Great Lakes (the only other U.S. straight decker still listed in semi-active service, the John Sherwin, had not sailed in years and was recently declared unseaworthy due to hull damage - currently relegated to use as a storage hull in Chicago, IL.). In the summer of 2006, the Ryerson was fitted out and put back into service following a long-term lay-up that began in 1998. Unlike the Sherwin, which will likely never sail again, the Ryerson had been meticulously maintained, and was often used as a museum boat for tours. She was put back into service due to a lack of reliable hulls on the Lakes, and a need for more tonnage. (The Canadian fleet retains a number of active straight-deckers for use in transporting grain, which is not well suited for self-unloading equipment. Most U.S. grain is currently transported by rail.)\n\nIn film, the W.W. Holloway (now since scrapped) is famous for being the lake freighter that the Blues Brothers jump their 1974 Dodge over when Elwood decides to jump the open 96th Street Bridge.\n\nManistee\n\nThe City of Milwaukee, a railroad ferry of the Grand Trunk Milwaukee Car Ferry Company. Built in 1931 to replace a previous ferry, the SS Milwaukee, lost in 1929 with all hands. She sailed for this company for 40 years and another 5 for the Ann Arbor Railroad before laying up in Frankfort in 1982. She sat there until being sold for a museum. Later moved to her present berth in Manistee, she is open for tours as the last unmodified classic railroad ferry. (The older paddlewheel steam railroad ferries Lansdowne, built in 1884, was modified to support a restaurant in antique railcars in Erie, Pa; and the Huron, built in 1875, was stripped of her cabins and sank at a pier in Detroit. The hull of the Landowne was raised but little other information as to the future of the vessel has been forthcoming.)\n\nManitoulin Island\n\nThe SS Norisle is a museum ship berthed permanently at the Manitowaning Hertiage Complex. She is one of three surviving running mates, the others being the Norgoma and the Normac. She was built in 1946, the first ship built in post-WW II Canada, using engines intended for a Royal Canadian destroyer. Norisle ran until 1974 when she was replaced by the MS Chi-Cheemaun. Plans call for sinking the Norisle as a tourist dive site. A group, Friends of The Norisle, has formed to lobby against this loss of history.\n\nMuskegon\n\nThe Milwaukee Clipper, another passenger steamer. Built in 1904, she served as a passenger\/package freighter for the Pennsylvania Railroad marine division called the Anchor Line as the Stmr. Juniata. In 1940, after several years in layup, she was sold and converted to an excursion steamer between Muskegon & Milwaukee. Laid up in the 1970s, she lingered for 30 years before returning to Muskegon as a museum. Also in Muskegon is the USCGC McLane, a 1920s vintage Coast Guard cutter used to combat the rum-runners in Detroit during Prohibition.\n\nPort Huron, MI\n\nUSLHS Huron, a lightship built in 1920. A new addition is the USCGC Bramble built in 1944.\n\nSaugatuck\n\nThe SS Keewatin, a former Canadian Pacific passenger liner. Built in Scotland in 1907, the boat steamed between Fort William, Ontario and Port McNicoll for over 50 years until being sold for scrap in 1967. Saved from the wrecker's torch, the Keewatin was towed to Saugatuck, Michigan use as a museum in 1968. She is the last unmodified Great Lakes passenger liner in existence and a wonderful example of Edwardian luxury. Keewatin is one of the world's last coal-fired steamships. A Toronto Star article (June 24-07) documents a Canadian effort to see the venerable steamer returned to Dominion waters as a museum ship at Port McNicoll.\n\nSault Ste. Marie, ON\n\nThe MS Norgoma, berthed in the Canadian Soo, was built as a steamer carrying freight and passengers in 1950. She ran from Owen Sound to Sault Ste. Marie from 1950 to 1963 on the so-called Turkey Trail. In 1963, the Norgoma was converted to a car ferry, her former role taken over by trucks, buses and automobiles. She ran between Tobermory to Manitoulin Island. At this time, the Norgoma was converted to diesel power. She became a museum ship in 1980. See: [2]\n\nFailed museum attempts\n\nSeveral other lakers almost became museums, but due to funding, political opposition or other causes, were sent to the scrapyard.\n\nLewis G Harriman - a 1923 purpose-built cement carrier, the first of her kind, that sailed from her launch until 1980. Used as a storage barge until 2003, a group tried to save her but bad communications within the company saw the ship sold for scrap in 2004 and destroyed in Sault Ste. Marie. The majority of the hull was fed to the Algoma Steel Mill but the fo'c'sle was saved as a summer cottage at Detour, Mi.\n\nSS Niagara - 1897 built freighter, later converted to a sand-sucker. Scrapped in 1997 after a failed attempt to convert her into a museum in Erie, Pennsylvania.\n\nG.A. Boeckling - 1909 built ferryboat used between Sandusky, Ohio and Cedar Point until 1955 when she was replaced by a modern ferry. Used as a machine shop in Sturgeon Bay until 1983 when she was taken to Toledo and restoration efforts began. Burned mysteriously in 1986 and was broken up for scrap soon after.\n\nCanadiana - 1910 built excursion boat that ran between Buffalo, New York and Crystal Beach, Ontario. Sailed this route from launch until 1960. From there, she was passed among several owners and several ports until reaching Port Colborne, Ontario. There she sat for many years, waiting restoration efforts. Eventually, the superstructure was stripped off and the badly deteriorated hull was broken up in 2004. An effort to make the Canadiana into a museum in Buffalo failed when it ran into opposition from that city's daily newspaper. Parts of the Canadiana were salvaged for later display. The Canadiana, along with the Bob-Lo Steamers Columbia and Ste Claire, were designed by maritime engineer Frank Kirby.\n\nGreat Lakes Salvage tug Favorite - She was donated to the group preserving the SS Valley Camp. When leaks developed, she was sold to a scrapper who cut her up at a pier north of DeTour, Michigan; downriver from the Soo.\n\nJohn Ericsson - The second-to-last whaleback freighter. The Ericsson was scrapped in 1969 in the city of Hamilton, Ontario. Politics, as was the case with the Canadiana, played a central role in the loss of the ship.\n\nThree-masted schoonerJ.T. Wing - Last commercial sailing ship on the Great Lakes. She served as a training vessel before being grounded on Belle Isle in 1949. She was used as a museum ship, before being burned before a crowd of 6000 in 1956.\n\nThree masted schooner Alvin Clark - Built in 1846, she sank in Green Bay in 1864. She was raised in 1965 and taken to Menominee as a museum. After being severely neglected for a number of years, she was dismantled in 1998.\n\nUSS Tambor - WW II submarine credited with sinking 26 enemy ships. She also resided at Belle Isle where she was a popular attraction. The sub was sent to the scrappers in 1958.\n\nSeaway Queen - A standard Lake bulker, an attempt to make it a floating museum, and dock space was secured. Due to an accounting error at ULS, the ship was sent to an untimely end at Alang, India.\n\nPossible future museum potential\n\nNormac - 1902 built fire tug converted into passenger steamer for The Owen Sound Transportation Company Ltd. Larger running mates Norisle and Norgoma have been converted into museum ships. After a stint as a floating restaurant in Toronto that was terminated when accidentally rammed by a ferry, the Normac was towed to Port Dalhousie, Ontario, where she serves as the cocktail lounge \"Big Kahuna.\" The Normac's small size makes her a good candidate as a maritime museum in a small Canadian port city.\n\nImperial Sarnia - 1948 built steam tanker. Once considered by shipspotters as among the most beautiful Great Lakes vessels, with her light blue hull and red stack, the Imperial Sarnia is ending her days as the dead bunkering vessel Provmar Terminal II in Hamilton, Ontario. While some freighters, such as Great Lakes bulk carriers, Liberty and Victory ships, have survived as museum ships, no conventional tankers have. The tanker museum ships that do exist, the Falls of Clyde and the Meteor, are known for being examples of unique vessel designs: an iron sailing ship and a whaleback, respectively.\n\nCement Steamers - The cement fleet of steamers is rapidly running out of time as modern tug\/barge combinations like the Integrity and Innovation take over. Among these are the S T Crapo (1927); Alpena (1942);the E M Ford (1898); the J.A.W. Iglehart (1936); and the Paul H Townsend (1945.) If the fate of the Lewis G Harriman is any indication, more of these vintage steamers will follow her into the mists of memory.\n\nArthur M Anderson launched in 1952, is still running as of this writing. She is famous for having had the last contact with the Edmund Fitzgerald before the latter sank with all hands. She was also the first would-be rescue vessel to search for the Fitzgerald. One appropriate berth would be Detroit, which is undergoing a long-awaited revival. The Motor City might one day consider docking the Anderson a stone's throw away from the famed Maritime Sailor's Cathedral.\n\nLandsdowne \u2013 The paddlewheel steam railroad ferry Lansdowne, built in 1884, was modified to support a restaurant in antique railcars and the Huron, built in 1875, sank at a pier in Erie, Pa. The hull was raised but little other information as to the future of the vessel has been forthcoming.\n\nMuseum or historic ships at risk\n\nA number of historic Museum ships face uncertain futures.\n\nThe Boblo Boats Columbia and Ste. Claire formerly of Detroit and the Boblo Amusement Park run. Both excursion steamers were designed by Frank E Kirby. The GLT tug Superior recently towed the Ste. Claire (Summer of 2007) for a visit to Detroit where there seems to be a growing awareness of the ship's contribution to the Motor City's history. Another group is interested in placing the Columbia on the Hudson River. A third excursion steamer, the Canadiana, was recently scrapped, making the Boblo boats the last of their kind.\n\nThere is a campaign to draw the public's attention to the need to renovate the long suffering whaleback tanker ship Meteor in Superior, WI.\n\nPerhaps best-known among ships at risk is Toledo's Willis B Boyer. The future of the Boyer has taken a turn for the better with the port authority taking ownership, providing payment for the ship's caretaker in the Spring of 2007. The Toledo Blade and other local media outlets has provided editorial support.\n\nS S Norisle at Manitoulin Island. Plans call for the ship to be towed and scuttled as a dive site.

{"text":"Privateer\n\ncommissionprizepower\n\nPRIVATEER is an armed vessel belonging to a, private owner, the subject. of a belligerent power, commissioned by the sovereign of that power. The commission is either a commission of war or of marque and reprisals in time of peace. It was marque in this sense which was granted to aggrieved subjects of the realm of England as\nearly as the statute 4 Hen. V. e. 7. The term \"letters of marque,\" however, is now generally' applied less strictly to the commission under which a privateer sails in time of war. The acceptance of a commission from a belligerent power by a neutral, though not piracy by the law of nations, has frequently been made so by treaty.] Accept-ance of such a commission by a British subject is for-bidden\nby the Foreign Enlistment Act, 1870. A vessel with a commission from each of two powers at war with one another is a pirate by the law of nations. Privateers stand in a position between that of a public ship of war and a merchant vessel. They are not entitled to the full rights which the comity of nations extends to public ships of war ; e.g., by the municipal regulations of most nations they may\nnot carry- the flag of a public ship of war. A capture made by a privateer may either become the pro-perty of the captor or, following the general rule of inter-national law, the property of the state (see PinzE). In Great Britain, in order to encourage privateering, the prize taken by a privateer was formerly divided between the owners and the captors, and the rights of the crown were specially\nexcluded in numerous Prize Acts. But now, by the Naval Prize Act, 1864, a prize made by a privateer belongs to the crown in its office of admiralty. By the United States Prize Act of 1864, the whole pro-ceeds of a prize made by a privateer go, unless it is other-wise provided in her commission, to the captors. The sum awarded is divided, in the absence of agreement, equally between the owners and\nthe ship's company.\n\nPrivateering is now a matter of much less importance than it formerly was, owing to the terms of Art. 1 of the Declaration of Paris, April 16, 1656, \" Privateering is and remains abolished.\" The Declaration binds only the powers who are signatories or who afterwards assented, and those only when engaged in war With one\nanother. The United States, :Mexico, Uruguay, and Spain have not acceded to it, and thus it would not hold in ease of a war be-tween the United States and any- other power, whether the latter were bound by the Declaration or not. 1.1y the constitution of the United States, Congress has power to grant letters of marqne and reprisal. Congress, by an Act of March 3, 1863, authorized the issue of\nletters of marque by the president, but they were never in fact issued either by the United States or Confederate Government.\n\nIn the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Prussia, in spite of the Declaration of Paris, took a course very little removed from priva-teering in the creation of a volunteer fleet.\n\nPH,TVET (Li;ejustrum), the vernacular name 2 of a genus , of Oleacece.

The best-known species is the common European privet, which makes good hedges in cases where no great powers of resistance to the inroads of cattle, &c., are required. L. oval?: folizon thrives by the seaside and even in towns, and is thus a valuable all but evergreen shrub. L. llreithon is taller and handsomer.

{"text":"Webmaster\nJohn Rennie and \"the Beast\" aboard the Wave Sentinel in the port of Dorset, England Jonathan WorthOn one recent expedition, Rennie and his crew spent 12 days bobbing in about 250 feet of water 15 miles off the coast of Cornwall in southern England looking for a broken cable linking the U.K. and Ireland. Munching fresh doughnuts (a specialty of the ship's cook), Rennie and his team worked 12-hour shifts exploring the rocky seafloor with a six-ton, $10-million remotely operated vehicle (ROV) affectionately known as \"the Beast.\"\n\nLong Arm of the Beast\n\nThe Beast is like a lunar lander on steroids. Working at depths of more than a mile, it can trundle along the seabed on caterpillar treads or, when its thrusters kick in, skim above canyons like a hovercraft, at a top speed of three knots. Rennie and his team of six control the Beast via a joystick, using its sonar, video cameras and metal detector to locate damaged cables. Plucking a cable from the ocean floor is akin to picking up a piece of thread in a blizzard while wearing a catcher's mitt. Currents can be fierce, which makes it difficult to hold the Beast steady above the cable. Visibility can be close to nil, which means that even finding the cable in the first place can be a long and frustrating process of trial and error. But according to Rennie, \"gripping and cutting is the trickiest.\" This delicate piece of submarine surgery has to be performed quickly and cleanly, using only a murky video image as a guide.\n\nWhen Rennie found the U.K.-Ireland cable--fishermen had cut it after it became entangled in a dragnet--the Beast's manipulator arm grabbed it, sliced it clean, and brought each end to the surface. On board the ship, the cable was repaired and x-rayed (Rennie needed to make sure the splice was set right, as with a broken bone), then tested and lowered to the seafloor. \"There is no time for celebration when we fix a cable,\" Rennie says. \"There is lots of pressure from cable owners to move quickly. They are losing revenue.\"\n\nMost cable breaks go unnoticed by users. Maybe a YouTube clip will take someone a nanosecond longer to download, but that's about all anyone might notice when a single cable snaps. There are so many different lines connecting so many different places\u2014a map of the network looks like the inside of a baby grand: strand after strand of cable stretching across the ocean floor like so many piano wires that service providers can usually reroute around any break. But if several cables snap in chorus, as they did several times in the past two years, big problems result.\n\nTags\n\nLast December 19, when three cables under the Mediterranean Sea were damaged, Internet service began to wink out across the Middle East and parts of Southeast Asia. Egypt suffered terribly, losing as much as 80 percent of its network. E-mail and Web access were disrupted in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, while services fluttered in countries as far away as Malaysia and Taiwan. India's enormous outsourcing industry\u2014the customer-service backbone of the Western world\u2014was also hampered, with the humble fax machine making a brief but crucial comeback until traffic was rerouted around the breaks. The same thing had also happened in January and February, disrupting Internet access to homes and businesses throughout the region for days.\n\nThe incidents reveal a surprising fact about the Internet: that it requires constant physical maintenance. Without people like Rennie patching cables, the entire network would gradually stop. First, traffic would slow to a crawl as more bits crammed into fewer and fewer cables. Then, after a while, isolated service failures like the ones in the Middle East would pop up. Eventually, as line after line went dark, U.S. businesses would be cut off from their outsourced functions abroad, international e-mail traffic would halt, and global financial transactions would cease. Pockets of connectivity would persist, but ultimately the Internet we rely on to stay in touch with the rest of the world would be reduced to the local-area network in your office.\n\nOn the next page, see our animated graphic of how the web works.\n\nWhere is the Web?\n\nAs Wi-Fi hotspots proliferate, making wireless connections commonplace, many people have come to regard the Internet as something that's simply in the air. Ask the average person how it's carried, and they are likely to mumble something about satellites.\n\nBut satellites carry less than 10 percent of all Internet traffic. The Internet is, in fact, inside the more than 500,000 miles of undersea cables like the ones Rennie fixes. It is in the hundreds of Internet hubs around the world, concrete landing points where these cables come ashore and branch back out again through terrestrial networks. It is in the hundreds of thousands of miles of land-based cables that crisscross the continents, bringing the Web to individual businesses and homes. The Internet is actually a vast physical infrastructure, awesome in its complexity--and its vulnerability.\n\n\"Most people don't realize how information moves around the globe,\" says Paul Kurtz, a former member of the National Security and Homeland Security councils who now advises corporations and governments on critical infrastructure protection with Good Harbor Consulting. \"The telecommunications network has morphed into the Internet, and there are vulnerabilities all along the line.\"\n\nCyber-attacks like those launched against the republic of Georgia during last summer's war with Russia will continue to grab headlines, but attacks on the Internet's physical infrastructure could be even more devastating. \"Physical attacks are less likely, but they are more damaging and harder to recover from,\" says Don Jackson, director of threat intelligence for information-security firm SecureWorks in Atlanta. \"We are so much better prepared for virtual attacks that [for terrorists] a physical attack is a very attractive alternative.\" Given how much of our financial, commercial and social lives have moved online, the repercussions from such an assault\u2014and a resulting widespread failure\u2014would be immense.\n\nA Series of Tubes:At Terremark's Miami headquarters, undersea Internet cables emerge from the Atlantic and connect to the rest of the country John B. Carnett\n\nChoke Points\n\nWhen the Middle East cables went down the first time back in January and February of last year--three cables were cut within a period of about 48 hours--observers assumed it was sabotage. Why? Because that kind of scenario had been rehearsed before.\n\n\"During the Cold War, lots of attention was paid to undersea cables,\" says James Lewis, director and senior fellow of the Technology and Public Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C. Communications lines were prime military targets for both sides, and the strategic severing of cables was considered a prelude to full invasion. In the early 1970s, the U.S. even managed to successfully tap a cable on the ocean floor and eavesdrop on Soviet chatter.\n\nNone of the Middle East cuts were deliberate, however. The December outage appears to have been caused by undersea seismic activity and, in the January and February incidents, stray anchors were to blame. But according to Lewis, \"the [January-February] cuts affected the ability of CentCom [U.S. military Central Command] to send communications from Afghanistan and Iraq. Video and data streams are crucial parts of military operations, and they need that fiber-optic cable infrastructure.\" CentCom quickly rerouted around the gaps, but the incident exposed a vulnerability.\n\nThe Middle East is particularly prone to faults because the ties that bind it to the rest of the Internet are thin when compared with the connection between the U.S. and northern Europe or Asia. The cables that went down last year carry upward of 75 percent of the traffic between Europe and the Middle East. The shortest cable here is 12,400 miles long, and traffic between sites in southern Europe and sites in Australia, China, Japan and other points east moves through only a handful of places. A single break in this region is immediately noticeable; two could be crippling; three could have been catastrophic if providers had not diverted traffic away from the cuts, located off the coast near Alexandria, Egypt, through Asia.\n\nThe Middle East is not the only place where the Internet's undersea cable network hits a bottleneck. In December 2006, an earthquake ripped cables running through the Luzon Strait, in the South China Sea between Taiwan and the Philippines, disabling 90 percent of the region's telecommunications capacity. Basic services were restored in a day or two, but full repairs to the cable system took more than a month.\n\nCable Network:Terremark's Miami facility is one of the world's most wired spots Jonathan Worth\n\nDemand and Supply\n\nThe first undersea cable was laid in 1850, under the English Channel between Dover and Calais. It consisted of copper wire waterproofed by a layer of hard, inelastic rubber made from gutta-percha trees. Lead weights were attached to keep it on the seafloor. The cable carried telegraphs for three days\u2014until French fishermen accidentally cut it.\n\nModern fiber-optic cables are more reliable and numerous. Today, between 250 and 300 cables beneath the ocean floor are active at any given moment. And as demand for bandwidth grows (international traffic increased 53 percent between mid-2007 and mid-2008, according to research firm TeleGeography), more and more are needed.\n\nSome of the cables Rennie spends his days fixing reach land near Miami. Here, the cables are bundled and shunted along under the old Florida East Coast Railway that ran from Miami to Key West until 1935, when Hurricane Islamorada wiped it out. The East Coast line was known as the \"overseas railroad\" because of all the bridges and viaducts it had to cross to reach Key West. Now it is the preferred track for the undersea cables that surface in central Miami, home to Terremark, one of the most important telecom firms you've never heard of.\n\nTerremark's six-story, 750,000- square-foot headquarters has no windows. They're unnecessary, since the main occupants of the building are computers: server racks owned by the likes of Deutsche Telekom, Facebook and the U.S. Department of Defense, not to mention the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, the organization that issues domain names, and VeriSign, which provides the infrastructure for secure online financial transactions.\n\nCoastal Connections\n\nThe Terremark facility is among the most wired sites in the world. It is one of dozens of Internet exchanges in the U.S., located mostly on the coasts, that gather the undersea cables and disperse them over land across the country. They are the unmissable links in America's--and the world's--telecom network. Some 90 percent of the Internet traffic between North America and Latin America goes through Terremark in Miami, for example, and according to TeleGeography, that traffic grew 112 percent from mid-2007 to mid-2008.\n\nThe cables that enter Terremark from the Atlantic rise up through the floor at various spots like bouquets of plumbing. The main cables splay out along metal trellises to the 160 or so clients that have servers onsite.\n\nEventually, the cables all return to a glass-enclosed, spotlessly clean space known as the \"meet-point room.\" The meet-point rooms--there are at least two of them on each floor of the building--are the gateways to the Internet. They are where the cables from individual carriers are patched into the land-based cable network that radiates out from Terremark, connecting service providers with other exchange points, and from there connecting to individual homes and businesses.\n\nConstant Caretakers\n\nTechnicians are in the building at all times. They take care of the routine maintenance--tightening a loose connection here, rewiring a patch panel there--needed to keep the Internet running. Even in a hurricane, the building is staffed. Twenty-four hours before a storm hits, all essential personnel--generally, a team of 30 technicians--are already inside. They don't come out until the hurricane has passed. And everything is monitored from a NASA-like network-operation center elsewhere in the building.\n\nTags\n\nTerremark, like any Internet exchange, is vital to the network. That's why the walls are made of seven-inch, steel-reinforced concrete that can withstand the 155mph winds of a Category 5 hurricane. That's why environmental control is fanatically precise, keeping condensation off the circuits and the thousands of servers cool. That's why on top of paying $630,000 a month for electricity, the building also maintains its own bank of diesel generators as a backup. And that's why, if any disaster were to strike Miami, restoring Terremark's power would have priority along with hospitals and the police. In short, it would be very bad if something happened at Terremark. \"If a service provider goes down, it's terrible,\" says Derrick Cardenas, Terremark's regional vice president of commercial sales. \"If we go down, it's global.\"\n\nScale-Free Networks\n\nTerremark and the other exchanges scattered across the country (Chicago, New York and Los Angeles are just a few of the other locations) are so vital because the Internet is a \"scale-free network.\" In a scale-free network, connections are not randomly or evenly distributed. Some points have relatively few connections to other points (a single server in the basement of a small business, for example), and some points\u2014known as hubs\u2014have a relatively huge number of connections to other points (Terremark). This ratio of very connected hubs to less-connected points remains roughly the same no matter the network's size (hence \"scale-free\"). The hubs are both a strength and a weakness. If one hub fails, the others can take up the slack. If several hubs go out of service, however, whole sections of the network can become isolated.\n\n\"The main feature of a scale-free network is that a few highly connected hubs hold the network together,\" says Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, director of the Center for Complex Network Research at Northeastern University, who did some of the earliest studies of scale-free networks. \"If you remove one hub, the network will not fall apart; the smaller hubs will maintain it. But if you [simultaneously] knock down a sufficient number of hubs, there will be quite a lot of damage.\"\n\nNow Send This:Tubes like these connect you to the rest of the world Jonathan Worth\n\nDoomsday Scenario\n\nIs there a guaranteed way to eliminate the threat? According to Barabasi, no. This is a property of scale-free networks, he says. \"You can't eliminate this vulnerability. There is no patch for it.\"\n\nIn the event of major hub failure, Barabasi believes the only option is damage control. He cites research by Adilson E. Motter, an assistant professor in the department of physics and astronomy at Northwestern University, showing that the selective removal of additional hubs immediately following a disaster can contain the damage around the stricken site. By shutting down the hubs most closely connected to the one under attack, you can prevent the failure from cascading through the entire network, Barabasi says. \"If you shut down the hubs around an infected hub, the damage can be controlled.\"\n\nUltimately, the only real defense is to make Internet exchanges impregnable. Terremark's newest facility is in Culpeper, Virginia, 60 miles southwest of Washington, D.C.\u2014just outside the blast zone should a nuclear strike hit the capital. The facility is surrounded by a 10-foot-high earth berm, guards patrol the perimeter, and the staff includes Department of Defense\u2013trained antiterrorism personnel.\n\n\"People have been worried about attacks on [hubs] since the Cold War,\" says Lewis of the CSIS. For instance, \"since Eisenhower, the telecommunications network has been hardened against nuclear attack.\" What keeps SecureWorks's Jackson awake at night is the prospect of a chemical, biological or dirty-bomb attack on a hub like Terremark. If no one can enter the building to staff the meet-point rooms, and everyone inside is already dead, it won't be long before things start to fall apart. \"There are so many different ways things could go wrong,\" he says. \"Only one or two hardware faults can cause a cascade of failures that need constant manual intervention to resolve. You'd be lucky to limp along for two days until something catastrophic happens.\"\n\nIn Case of Code Red\n\nEven something less than an all-out assault\u2014a hybrid virtual and physical attack, for instance\u2014might be enough to bring down an Internet exchange. If terrorists managed to gain remote access to a facility's command-and-control system, they could, for example, cause the generators to overheat and explode. That would take out the cooling system and, soon enough, the meet-point rooms would be filled with the smell of burning motherboards.\n\nTags\n\nIf such attacks happened simultaneously at a sufficient number of hubs, the principles of scale-free networks dictate that the entire Internet could come down. Statistics on these types of assaults are hard to come by, but there were, for example, an average of 2,332 attempted virtual attacks each day on the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems of SecureWorks's utility clients last September, according to the firm. Only a small fraction of these attacks targeted actual command-and-control systems, but the sheer number of attempts is itself a cause for concern.\n\nIn fact, a successful command-and-control attack has already taken place in the U.S. In March 2007, the Department of Homeland Security staged an assault on a massive diesel generator of the kind used to run power plants and Internet exchanges. Hackers managed to gain control of the machine and cause it to self-destruct. Even a single exchange attacked in this way would take months to repair, according to John Bambenek, an information-security researcher who scans the Web for cyber-attacks as an incident handler with the Internet Storm Center, an early-warning network staffed by volunteers. \"If two or three went out, you would run into manpower problems,\" he says. \"There is not enough staff anywhere to do it. We are not as redundant as we think we are.\"\n\nI found the articles on the Internet and the Inkjet printers fascinating; two things that we use daily; sometimes when I see the cover of the magazine I believe it should be called PopSciFi, I understand that you need to capture peoples attention but there is plenty of wonderful things already in use that people do not know how they work, I will give you an example: my inexpensive watch that is synchronized daily with the atomic clock (Is that wonderful or what?).\n\nMarustkl, I hope I spelled your UN correctly?

The concept of the internet is akin to the universe. It is something tangible, but the size of what the \"internet\" really is in terms of data, is massive in scale. The amount of information that flows across the internet in any given location is mind boggling.\n\nWhile I think it is an interesting concept to have it all monitored in one centralized place, I also think it is advantageous to have locations throughout the world who can monitor it, location specific.\n\nI applaud John Rennie on his tireless work ensuring the internet stays afloat so I can post the following links:\n\n\n\n\njust wanna say great article! I never thought of that problem, that teh internet is such fragile. i even will not think about problem, which would accure if such an undersea cable will break.\n\n\nI'm a pro blogger from holland and live 6 months in Malaysia. About 10 days in one months we have no Internet. I think they do it on purpose to checking the data. They alway say that a cable is broken in the sea, i don't believe them no more.\n\nTsunamis may be detectable with underwater fiber-optic cables, according to a new detailed model of the electrical fields the moving water generates.\n\nThe charged particles in the ocean water interact with Earth's magnetic field to induce voltage of up to 500 millivolts in the cables that ferry internet traffic around. With relatively simple technology, those voltage spikes could serve as a tsunami-warning system for nations that can't afford large arrays of other types of sensors.\n\n...\"What we argue is that this is such a simple system to set up and start measuring,\" said Manoj Nair, a geomagnetist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who led the research. \"We have a system of submarine cables already existing. The only thing we probably need is a voltmeter, in theory.\"\n\nThe salt in ocean water makes it a good electrical conductor. Positively charged sodium and negatively charged chlorine ions in the solution are free to move. In a large movement of ocean water, these ions are carried across the Earth's magnetic field creating an electrical field.\n\nI'm just still at awe that they run the cable in water. I kind thought that the majority of the internet is ran via satellite. I guess you learn something new everyday.\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWhile I think it is an interesting concept to have it all monitored in one centralized place, I also think it is advantageous to have locations throughout the world who can monitor it, location specific.\n\nFabulous information!\nI appreciate the valuable information which you discussed here. It is beneficial read for me. We also have an site  so your provided information will be beneficial for me.\n\nThis makes me think of a current situation at hand. Yes, an under the sea fiasco.\n\nPerhaps similar technology, if not already at use, could be used to help with the current BP problem? Certainly, the problem is rather out-of-hand. It would be beneficial to pool both intellectual and material resources to solve this one.\nIt would not be funny if this gush continues onward for for several more months. But, IMO, I think the current situation is a joke. Not to be to harsh, but there should be more resources thrown at this problem and more 'teams' formed to work on it. As a side note: We should write our congressmen.\n\nHello! You would think there would be some interesting views and info with Russia, Alasaka, and the Bering Strait! if you are giving future terrorists another avenue in which to disrupt the world. Site has been added to my RSS feed for later browsing triathlon bike and triathlon wetsuit this site.\n\nThis is interesting information. Great stuff on this site, keep up the good work. Consider me a new reader!  -  - \n\nI am quite surprised that given the age of internet, no bigger problems or global attacks on the internet have surface so far. But then it is often so, that first some problems occur, that people get aware of vulnerabilities, in this case of the internet infrastructure.\n\nI think it's amazing that man can create a cable that long and then place it at the bottom of the ocean. What an achievement, you don't even think about the time or effort it must take to maintain it! I always presumed it didn't need any maintenance. I suppose nothing is strong enough against the forces of nature!\n\nThat was really an interesting read -- and an important thing to think about. We all depend so heavily on the internet, whether it's for business, communication with friends and family, or relaxing. Keeping the web alive for people across the world is a critically important job!\n\nthanks to the guys who hurry and repair those cables when they get cut.i really cannot imagine going internetless for a few days.that would be terrible and unendurable as well\n\n\nYour right, great post sweed This is a good posting, I was wondering if I could use this write-up on my website, I will link it back to your website though. If this is a problem please let me know and I will take it down right away\n\nWell, in my opinion the internet weakness is primarily the vulnerability to cyber attacks. Till now nothing big has happened yet, but one can see how disrupted things become even when just one website has problems, like facebook recently. \n\nIt is high time now for those under sea cables been replaced by satellite connectivity. These failures are accountable for prolonged outage and slow down of internet in many countries. But you should also comment on the brave and responsible job of guarding those cables. Good job\n\n\nUS army rocks for the innovation of Internet itself.Without internet our life would be really something pretty useless.I can't imagine what it would have been, if internet would not be their. By the way ronnie looks hero here.\n\n\nYou would think here would be approximately appealing views and info with Russia, Alasaka, and the Bering Strait! If you are giving prospect terrorists a further chance in which to disrupt the planet.\nMedical Products\n\nFound your communication dynamics very valuable. I'm currently teaching two introductory college classes. Each one has half the students using blogs, the other half using wiki's. So far, I think the wiki's are more helpful for the students. But I didn't know about the aggregator application. That would certainly help me to monitor what the students are writing, and I think that it would make the experience more lattice-like for students because it would make it easier for them to monitor each other's postings\n\nGreat article on protecting the internet, except I hope no one protects it. The internet shouldn't become regulated, once we do that, the internet won't ever look the same again (and not in a good way). I hope governments never get the power to interfere with what we can view on the internet.\npennyauctionscam.org\n\nProtection in all aspects of the internet is a very important part to consider when creating a site, or when someone else could be using your computer. I carefully watch all links to my website  whether the content is legit or not.\nJust another facette on the topic. - Thanks.\n\nIn addition, the amount of time and money needed to fix these cables is astronomical. By moving to wireless, it would free up all of those resources and there are less areas to break and that require fixing.\n\nI find this whole article interesting. I had no idea how the communication got to all the other parts of the country, For me it just did. I have never really put much thought into it. When reading this article, the thing that I found most interesting is all the cable on the ocean floor. With all that goes on under the sea, I most definatly would not think it would last. For sure a full time problem to fix. There would never be a dual moment in that job. As for what I learned about how things work when searching for a web site, the thing that I did not know and find interesting is that only 10 % connection goes through satalite and there are over 500 thousand miles of cable under the sea. All of this totally amazas me. Thank god for those individuals that are willing to do the job"}
{"text":"Interesting Questions, Facts, and Information\n\nU.S. Coast Guard\n\nDouglas Albert Munro. Douglas Munro was a Signalman, First Class, during WW2. He was killed while attempting the evacuation of a battalion of marines trapped by enemy forces at Point Cruz Guadalcanal, on 27 September 1942. The other gallant men were also awarded the Medal of Honor but were in the U. S. Navy during WW2.\n\nCGC Eagle. CGC Eagle is a former German training ship taken by the US after WW2 as part of payment for war debts. CGC Healy is an icebreaker in Seattle, the newest of the fleet. CGC Harriet Lane and CGC Hamilton are the names of many Coast Guard ships over the years.\n\nThe Coast Guard was initially tasked to conduct The International Ice Patrol in the Atlantic Ocean in what year?\n\n1914. The sinking of the Titanic in 1912 led to the establishment of an International Ice Patrol along the North Atlantic ship lanes. Since 1914, the patrol has been maintained through a sharing of its expenses by the principal shipping nations of the world. The Coast Guard does the actual patrolling with ships and airplanes.\n\n1915. In 1871, the government formed the U.S. Life-Saving Service, which was operated by the Revenue Cutter Service. In 1878, the Life-Saving Service became an independent bureau of the Department of the Treasury. The Revenue Cutter and Life-Saving services were finally combined as the United States Coast Guard in 1915.\n\nOriginally, the US Coast Guard was established in 1790 under what name?\n\nRevenue Cutter Service. The service was created in 1790 at the recommendation of Alexander Hamilton, the first secretary of the Treasury. Congress established a fleet of 10 sailing vessels to stamp out smuggling and piracy along the coasts of the United States. American Patrol is a WW2 Glenn Miller tune, other nations have a Coastal Defence Force, and the Navy is always the Navy.\n\nIn 2002, the US Coast Guard became part of what newly-established Government department?\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security. The Coast Guard was established in 1790 as part of the Treasury Department. In 1967, they were transferred to the Department of Transportation. When the Homeland Security Department was established in 2002, the Coast Guard was an integral part of the original organization.\n\nCape May, New Jersey. Both male and female Coast Guard recruits spend 8 weeks at Cape May. The U.S. Navy trains at Great Lakes. The U.S. Marine Corps trains at San Diego, Camp Pendelton, and Parris Island. At ease!\n\nNew London, Connecticut. The cadet training program started in 1876 in New Bedford Massachusetts on the cutter Dobbin. It later moved to Arundel Cove, Maryland, and, in 1912, moved ashore in New London. Buzzard's Bay is the home of the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, King's Point is the location of the U. S. Merchant Marine Academy, and the Naval Academy is at Annapolis.\n\nWhich device is considered the standard rescue device for Coast Guard helicopter hoists?\n\nThe rescue basket.. The Rotary Wing Development Unit, located at the Elizabeth City Air Station, was to develop helicopter use by the Coast Guard. It was here, in 1948, that helicopter flotation gear and the Coast Guard rescue basket were developed. The basket has proven to be easier and more instinctive for the rescue of untrained civilians.\n\nIn 1972, the Coast Guard installed a state-of-the-art helicopter simulator at the air station located in which city?\n\nMobile, Alabama.. The original HH-52A simulator was installed at the Coast Guard Aviation Training Center in Mobile. In addition, another simulator has been installed for the HH-65 Dolphin which features a full-motion platform with audio and visual cues. CG aviators are able to simulate emergency and instrument procedures that are impractical (and dangerous) in a real helicopter.\n\nThe first Coast Guard helicopter mercy mission was flown in what year?\n\n1944. The first mercy mission was flown on January 3, 1944, when two cases of blood plasma were taken from The Battery, New York City, to a hospital at Sandy Hook, New Jersey. The hospital was treating survivors of an explosion on the USS Turner; the flight was made through a blinding snowstorm.\n\nIn 1962, an USCG crew in a UF-2G Grumman Albatross set the world record for an amphibian non-stop distance flight. How far did they fly non-stop?\n\n3107 nautical miles; 5754 km. On October 25, 1962, the UF-2G 7255 took off from Kodiak, Alaska, and flew to Pensacola, Florida. To set the amphibian record, the airplane took off from the runway in Kodiak and landed on the water at Pensacola.\n\nCGAS San Diego, California. CGAS San Diego opened in 1934 and is still in operation today as part of the commercial airport, Lindberg Field. CGAS Salem opened in 1935 as an all-water operation. It was active until 1970 when it closed and operations moved to Cape Cod. CGAS Biloxi opened in 1935 but closed in 1966.\n\nExtensive rumrunning operations during Prohibition.. The rumrunning became so flagrant that the surface units could not cope with the bootleggers. The Coast Guard had borrowed a Navy UO-1 and flown daily patrols to show its effectiveness. The success of the patrols convinced Congress to give the Coast Guard its own airplanes.\n\nThe first Coast Guard Air Station (CGAS) opened in 1920 at what location?\n\nMorehead City, North Carolina. Six Curtiss HS-2L flying boats were borrowed from the Navy and began operation on March 24, 1920. However, there were no operating funds appropriated, and after fifteen months, the station closed. The airplanes were returned to the Navy.\n\nThe first CG aviator was LT Elmer Stone. He was one of the pilots on the first trans-Atlantic in May 1919 in what type of aircraft?\n\nCurtiss NC-4 seaplane.. LT Stone was the only non-Navy man in the six man crew. Several books have been written about the flight which started with NC-1, NC-3 ,and NC-4 aircraft. Only the NC-4 made it to Lisbon.\n\nWhat cutter was the predecessor of the United States Coast Guard Academy?\n\nDobbin. The Revenue Marine School of Instruction was started on the Dobbin in 1876, which operated off New Bedford, Massachusetts. The Acedemy's present location in New London, Connecticut was established in 1932.\n\nEagle. She was taken as a war prize from the Germans after World War II and comissioned into the Coast Guard on May 15, 1946. She has been training future Coast Guard officers ever since. Horst Wessel was the writer of the Nazi Party notorious marching song named after him.\n\nWhat buoy tender ran aground and sank in the Great Lakes on December 4, 1989?\n\nMesquite. The Mesquite was comissioned in August, 1943. From what I heard from a Coast Guard officer, the Officer of the Deck (OOD) during the accident was a newly minted ensign from the Coast Guard Academy. It was late fall, and the Mesquite had just picked up the buoy that was marking the reef for the winter. The OOD charted a course across the reef and promptly ran aground.\n\nWhat ship was responsible for United States's first capture of an enemy vessel during World War II?\n\nIcebreaking. The two 399' polar icebreakers, Polar Sea and Polar Star, the 420' polar icebreaker Healy, and the 290' Great Lakes icebreaker Mackinaw have red hulls. Law enforcement and maritime defense may be the missions of all cutters, red hulls are built specifically for icebreaking.\n\nWhat was the last ship to be decommisioned that fought at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941?\n\nTaney. The Taney was ready to return fire within four minutes on December 7, 1941. She was decomissioned on December 7, 1986 after fifty years of active service in the Coast Guard. She is now a part of the Baltimore Maritime Museum.\n\nIn 1897, crewman from what cutter drove a herd of reindeer across the Artic ice to feed trapped whalers. What was the name of the ship?\n\nBear. In 1897, President McKinley sent to Bear to the Bering Sea to rescue sailors on eight whaling ships trapped in the ice. Lieutenants Jarvis and Bertholf and Surgeon Call drove a herd of reindeer to the stranded ships. This event competed for national media attention with the Spanish-American War. The Bear and her captain, Mike Healy, were, in parts of Alaska, the only representatives of the U.S. government at the time.\n\nHarriet Lane. Fort Sumter was besieged by the Confederates. The steamer Nashville approached. To prevent her capture, the Harriet Lane fired across the Nashville's bow. Both ships later went on to have distinguished careers. The Nashville became an infamous Confederate blockade runner. The Harriet Lane was captured by the Confederates at Galveston in 1863.\n\nWhat was the result of the Revenue Cutter Eagle's encounter with HMS Dispatch in 1814?\n\nEagle was forced to surrender. Eagle was stationed in Long Island Sound to protect it from the British during the War of 1812. Eagle encountered the British brig Dispatch and moved to protect the merchantman Suzan from capture. Realizing he was outmatched, Captain Frederick Lee beached Eagle and had her guns moved atop a steep bluff. The Americans began to fire on the British, and they were forced to retreat. The next day, Eagle limped back to port and was captured.\n\nWhat schooner was commanded by the United States' first sea-going comissioned officer?\n\nScammel. Captain Hopley Yeaton, commissioned on 21 March 1791, is the first comissioned officer in the United States Revenue Cutter Service, the predecessor of the Coast Guard. Then Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton created the Revenue Cutter Service to help collect tariffs and restrict smuggling.\n\nAll of the these (Fourth Class cadets get \"carry on\" for the day, Second Class cadets square corners and spew indoc, First Class cadets celebrate 100 days until graduation). More a celebration for upperclassman, the Fourth Class get mocked, and the Second Class get to vent off the steam they have incurred during their hard work training the Swabs. In years past, Fourth Class could \"earn\" the shoulder boards of the Second Classman they most admired.\n\nM1 Garand. Drill rifles are filled with lead and have their firing pins removed. Rules require the straps to be loosened when not in use, otherwise an upperclassman will disassemble the rifle. \"Inspection arms' requires the user to stick their thumb inside the rifle to close the bolt. If you don't pull your thumb out quick enough, it gets bruised resulting in a condition affectionately called \"M1 thumb\".\n\nWhat is the PRIMARY function of the Navy base just up stream and across the river from the Coast Guard Academy?\n\nSubmarines. It is the home of the Navy's first submarine base. Although named Naval Submarine Base New London, it is physically located in Groton, Connecticut. It houses most of the Navy's submarine training programs, and many attack submarines are stationed there. It is also home to the now retired USS Nautilus which was the world's first nuclear submarine. Academy personel use the facilities at the sub base, including its hospital.\n\nYou pass a group of people wearing Coast Guard uniforms, but have silver stripes on their shoulder boards. What organization are they with?\n\nCoast Guard Auxillary. Members of the Coast Guard Auxillary are civilians that aid the regular Coast Guard with non-law enforcement duties such as maritime safety and search and rescue. Originally they were called the Coast Guard Reserves, but the name was changed to reflect the organization of the other military branches. Auxillary members are civilians and do not have to be saluted"}

{"text":"Italian Salvage Ships at the Galley Head\n\nPaddy O'Sullivan traces the history of the Italian salvage company, Sorima, and describes its successful Ludgate operation off the Galley Head in 1934-35\n\nOn 19 May 1922, the ageing P&O liner, Egypt, departed from Tilbury, bound for Marseille and Bombay, having on board 294 crew and forty-four passengers. In addition to her general cargo, the liner shipped in its strong-room a consignment of gold and silver to the value of \u00a31,054,000. This staggering fortune consisted mainly of gold ingots, several dozen cases of gold sovereigns and a large quantity of silver ingots.\n\nThe following evening saw the twenty-five-year-old liner travelling at reduced speed in dense fog off Ushant near the French coast. However, as the fog thickened, the captain of the Egypt took diligent precautions by shutting down his engines and drifting while sounding his siren at regular intervals to reveal his presence. He was not the only one to be confounded by fog on that late afternoon; another ship's siren could be heard in the distance and gradually grew louder, though its direction of approach could not be ascertained due to the fog. Sensing grave danger, the captain and officers of the Egypt crowded the bridge as they strained their eyes to make sense of the white nothingness that greeted them. Suddenly, the unthinkable happened \u2013 the white fog turned ink-black to reveal the shadow of an oncoming ship. In seconds, the French steamer Seine emerged from the fog at high speed, making for the Egypt on a collision course. In as many more seconds, the Egypt received a death-dealing blow as the oncoming steamer crashed violently into her port side between her two funnels. While the Seine was a relatively small vessel of 1,380 tons against the Egypt's 7,500 tons, she was built for ice-breaking with a razor-sharp prow which had been heavily reinforced for its task. With such deadly armour, the French ship ploughed deeply into the Egypt's side with cata\u00adstrophic consequences. Great panic ensued throughout the ship, especially among her crew. The badly damaged liner took on a severe list as she rapidly flooded and sank to the seabed in a mere twenty minutes, taking its valuable bullion cargo to the depths. Her unwitting assassin, the Seine, rendered all possible assistance in taking survivors on board and subsequently putting them ashore at Brest. In all, seventy-two crew members and fifteen passengers lost their lives in the incident.\nThe Egypt's five-ton gold cargo dangled a tantalising bait to would-be salvors. L1oyds, having paid the full claim on the treasure within ten days of the liner's loss, were now the owners of the bullion and were prepared to grant salvage concessions to diving entrepreneurs on a 'no cure, no pay', basis, and on attractive terms that would allow the salvor to keep seventy-five per cent of his recoveries while turning the remainder over to L1oyds. There were some difficulties, however; the position of the Egypt was unknown and, secondly, its 65-fathom depth (390 feet) was well beyond the recovery tech\u00adnology of the era. However, the lure of gold was strong, and various companies made unsuccessful attempts to find the wreck between 1923 and 1928. A Swedish company based in Gothenberg expended considerable resources in a failed attempt to locate the wreck; later, a French salvage company would also savour the bitter taste of failure in searching for the wreck. A local friar even departed from his monastery to join a team of adventurers by claiming he could find gold with his divining rod. In 1929, An Italian company succumbed to the Egypt's challenge. This company has been formed in 1926 by a Genoese lawyer named Giovanni Quaglia. Quaglia had powerful connec\u00adtions and had amassed considerable wealth from the World\u00b7 War I shipping shortage by converting sailing ships to motor vessels. However, such success could not sate his lust for adventure. Quaglia named his company Sorima, the name being derived from the first two letters of each of the following words: Societa Ricuperi Marittimi, translated as Society of Maritime Recovery. Despite his wealth, he was best known for his courage and dogged determination. In developing his new salvage company, he identified a need to pioneer new methods of deep cargo-recovery from the ocean floor; in this pursuit, he experienced some success in recovering cargoes from lesser shipwrecks in the Mediterranean during the embryonic years of Sorima's development. Quaglia realised that a salvage vessel fitted out with a four-point mooring system and powerful grabs would be capable of anchor\u00ading over a wreck and tearing her remains apart to recover its cargo. The problem was that such a vessel would be working blind and perhaps even wasting its energy on the wrong location. Quaglia pondered the dilemma long and hard. Finally, he concluded that if an artillery observer could direct a gunner in accurate placement of his shells, then surely a salvage-grab could be directed in a similar fashion if only he could figure out a way to allow an observer to accompany the grab as it set to work in the inky blackness of the ocean's depths. Eventually, the answer struck him and he ordered his salvage engineers to weld a crude one-man steel container, fitted with five windows and a telephone to communicate with the surface. The diver would be sealed in this mummy-like steel case and lowered to the seabed prior to commencing his day's work. His breathing needs would be catered for by including a supply of oxygen in his cramped chamber which was sealed against the crushing pressure of the sea outside; his air supply was designed to last several hours in case of emer\u00adgency. The newly invented system was tried and tested, and seemed to be a runaway success; now at last the Egypt's gold was within Sorima's grasp if only they could find the wreck.\n\nItalian Salvage Ship - Artiglio\n\nWith high hopes of early success, Sorima's salvage vessels, the Artiglio and the Rostra, set out to search for the Egypt in 1929. But the reluctant treasure liner was not about to give up its secrets without a struggle. The next two years saw both ships sweep wires in vain across vast tracts of fea\u00adtureless ocean without the slightest glimmer of success in locating the sunken liner. Quaglia became exhausted both physically and financially from his futile efforts, while his salvage company, Sorima, was driven to the edge of bankruptcy by his failure to find the Egypt. However, the old adage 'fortune favours the brave' was to hold true for Quaglia, and in his second year of searching and sweeping the Bay of Biscay, the elusive Egypt was found sitting upright on the seabed. Diving oper\u00adations commenced immediately, as six heavy-duty moorings were placed about the sunken liner. When mooring operations had been completed, the familiar sound of the ship's grab .clanking over the side heralded the start of a long and often frustrating salvage operation. As the grab plunged to the bottom, the observation diver \u2013 dressed in heavy layers of woollen clothing \u2013 donned his knitted cap and entered the cramped steel diving-bell that was to become his home for the next four to five hours. Having entered the bell, the Artiglio's deck-crew set about fixing the heavy lid in place and tightening a series of bolts and nuts to keep the water out. Then the telephone system was tested once more before the diver in his canister was lowered into the ocean to follow the grab already sitting in position as if to await his instructions. Soon, deck-winches were groaning under the strain as the listing Artiglio set to work demolishing the Egypt's seven decks to access the strong-room in the bowels of the ship. Blasting by dynamite was a necessary prerequisite to opening the ship prior to tearing off steel plates. As the operation progressed, the chatter on the ship's telephone was almost constant as directions were sent up from the murky depths by the diver. Soon, the temperature inside the diving-bell would drop sharply, causing the walls to become shrouded in droplets as moisture condensed from the diver's breath on the cold steel. Eventually, depleted oxygen levels would cause the diver to suffer splitting headaches and shortage of breath, leaving the topside crew with little choice but to recover the bell. Once back on deck, the steel lid of the diving bell would be unbolted to release its shivering occupant to welcome fresh air and warmth; a fresh diver with a replenished oxygen supply would continue the work on the seabed.\n\nOn 22 June 1932, Lady Luck at last smiled on the Artiglio's efforts; two gold sovereigns came up in the grab; the next lift brought up two gold ingots. Euphoria flashed around the ship with hoots and howls at the first sight of gold from the deep. Work ground to a halt in the excitement as the ship's cook broke out the wine to enable the crew members toast the success of several years' efforts. As the euphoria died down, work commenced as before. Soon, gold bars and coins were tumbling out of the grab and onto the Artiglio's deck in daily monotony. Though bad weather regularly inter\u00adrupted operations, the Artiglio's efforts continued throughout the years 1932 and 1933 until practi\u00adcally all five tons of the Egypt's gold had been recovered. Finally, the Italians pulled up stakes and departed the Egypt in 1933, having successfully recovered ninety-three per cent of its cargo.\nSorima of Genoa. the city of Christopher Columbus, had inadvertently become the best-equipped, most-profitable deep-water salvage company in the world. Its hard-served apprenticeship in recov\u00adering the Egypt's gold saw it pioneer new grabs, powerful lifting cranes and unparalleled salvage techniques; its achievements had marked a new era in the science of salvage. An idea of the immen\u00adsity of the operation may be realised from the fact that its work spanned five years. When one takes into account the fruitless efforts of the earlier Swedish and French salvage companies from 1923 onwards, quite ten years had been spent on recovering the Egypt's gold. Quaglia's success enabled him to acquire a total offive ships and engage in simultaneous salvage operations across European waters. As he planned the future strategy of his company, he realised that his chances of encountering another glamorous gold cargo were a million-to-one. However, the ocean floors were littered with valuable cargoes of copper and other non-ferrous metals thanks to the U-boat campaign of World War I, and Quaglia's scribbled calculations told him that 2,000 tons of copper were just as lucrative as three tons of gold. Britain alone lost 2,500 merchant ships to the torpedo and mine during the 1914-18 War. Many of these ships were sent plunging to their doom, laden with ingots of copper, nickel, tin and brass. These valuable commodities represented much-needed war supplies to feed Britain's insatiable armaments industry. U-boat commanders attempted to cripple that industry by cutting off Britain's supplies, deliberately targeting war suppliers. Much of this slaughter was carried on across the south-west coast of Ireland with efforts concentrated off Waterford, Galley Head and west of Fastnet. Now the Galley Head area promised rich pickings as Sorima identified two copper-rich steamers: the Spectator and the Ludgate. Alan Crothall's book, Wealth from the Sea, states that the Ludgate contained 350 tons of copper, and the nearby Spectator 1,298 tons of copper. In 1934, having negotiated satisfactory terms with the British government \u2013 the owners of the copper\u00ad Quaglia dispatched two vessels, the Artiglio and the Arpione, to set up base in Kinsale. This Artiglio was in fact a second salvage ship so-named, in memory of the original Artiglio which had blown itself sky high whilst demolishing a munitions wreck off France in the 1930s.\n\nOn arrival off the Irish coast, the Italians were struck by the emerald-green vista that greeted their eyes, in sharp contrast to the parched landscape of their native Mediterranean. They were also struck by Ireland's ever-present rain and the bad-tempered nature of the Atlantic. A once-calm ocean might suddenly turn boisterous as gale-force winds whipped up mountainous seas. Howling winds would strip the crests of waves, filling the air with spray; driving rains added to the discomfort by eliminating visibility. Such conditions made salvage prohibitive and forced the Italians to run for the shelter of Kinsale Harbour time and time again. Such events happened all too often for the Italians' liking. Sitting at the pier for weeks on end, chipping rust, painting and attend\u00ading to repairs was extremely boring; on the other hand, salvage of copper bars was exciting and could attract substantial pay bonuses after a successful stint of recovery. Locating the Ludgate was given priority as both ships laid out their search-wires in tandem and began the monotonous process of sweeping for the wreck. The next seven weeks brought nothing but frustration and broken sweep-wires caused by entanglement in rocks. In desperation, the Artiglio's captain decided to put a man ashore at Galley Head to question the locals for guidance. Only one man could offer assistance; it so happened that a local man, Denis O'Donovan from Brownstown, near Ballycusheen, was driving cattle to Rosscarbery fair at four in the morning on 26 July 1917. Denis was rarely called by his Christian name; he was more usually referred to as the Coitineach, an Irish word referring to Denis' origins in Ballycotton. As the Coitineach herded the cattle over the hill of Croachna, the blackness of night was suddenly illuminated by a blinding flash and gigantic fireball two miles south of the Galley Head lighthouse. Turning his head to look at the source of the flash, a loud bang and thunder-like sound rolled in from the ocean. The passing Ludgate had struck a German mine and sank in a mere two minutes. No doubt its weighty cargo of copper ingots contributed to its sudden demise. Twenty-four lives were lost, including that of the captain, many being still in their bunks when the mine exploded. Five survivors clung desperately to floating wreckage for several hours; mercifully, British patrol boat no. 46 arrived on the scene at 10.35 the next morning and plucked the shivering mariners from the sea before heading for Castletown Berehaven. The barely alive survivors had endured the chilly Atlantic for all of six hours; some were semi-conscious and near death from their ordeal.\n\nDiver being lowered from the Artiglio\n\nThe vital information obtained from the Coitineach brought success to the Itabans, who easily found the Ludgate in a few days. Moorings were laid down, dynamite charges rig1fed and fired, and all top-decking torn away by the grab from the Ludgate to reveal three open cargo hatches. Both aft and middle hatches were brimful (and still are) of copper pyrites, and are of fourteen per cent average purity. However, the forward hatch was crammed with tombstone-like copper ingots weighing three hundredweight each. Meanwhile, the Arpione busied itself dealing with the copper ship, Spectator, sunk eleven miles south-east of Galley Head. A companion to the Ludgate, the Spectator was more fortunate by being torpedoed and sunk without loss of life on 19 August 1917. The submarine UC-33 was reported to have carried out the foul deed. At the time, the Spectator was on a voyage from Zanzibar to Liverpool. Her remains lay in 300-feet of water, close to the site of the Lusitania. As required by law, all Italian mooring-buoy locations were reported to Irish Lights.\n\nTwo salvage seasons, spanning 1934-35, were necessary to achieve the high level of copper recovery from both these shipwrecks. Copper ingots were deposited on Kinsale pier and moved by hand truck to an old coal store \u2013 now the Trident Hotel bar and restaurant near the pier. The Cork Examiner of 5 June 1935 reported: ' \u2026 the Arpione has been laid up for a few weeks in bad weather. It has landed 40 tons of ingots from the Ludgate.' Another report from the Cork Examiner, dated 6 July 1935, states: 'The Italian salvage vessel, Arpione, arrived in the harbour [Kinsale] with about twenty tons of copper ingots aboard, salvaged from the Ludgate. The work has been hampered by bad weather and now that an improvement has set in it is expected that salvage work will proceed with more success. She expects to leave the harbour this evening and will steam ten miles west of the Old Head and complete the salving of the Spectator's cargo. The latter has still on board 800 tons of copper which, it is expected, will be uncovered by September when further sweeping operations by the Artiglio will take place.' The Spectator's total cargo was eventually salvaged and most of the Ludgate's copper ingots were recovered; her ore cargo of pyrites was abandoned as being a commodity of low value.\nBy October 1935, Sorima had ended its operations off Galley Head and was busy searching off Waterford for the French copper ship Lincolnshire. With the onset of winter, the Waterford searches were greatly hampered by bad weather. And then, as Italy entered the fray of war, its government recalled both salvage vessels. The Sunday Independent of 13 October 1935 reported: 'The Italian salvage ship, Arpione, which has been operating on the wrecks of copper-carrying vessels sunk off the south Cork coast during the war, has taken in provisions and bunkers at Kinsale preparatory to sailing for home. The Arpione continued during the summer months salvage work begun last year on two large British ships torpedoed in 1917 off the Old Head of Kinsale \u2013 the Spectator and the Ludgate - which were conveying cargoes of copper from East Africa to Wales. The total cargo of the Spectator has been salvaged.\n\nWorld War II saw Neptune's coffers topped up with more rich ingot cargoes. German U-boats once again swung into action, wreaking deadly havoc on merchant 1\u2033 shipping as they attempted to starve Britain into submission by use of the torpedo and mine. Hitler's admiral of submarines, Karl Donetz, was hell-bent on ridding the ocean of enemy shipping. He almost suc\u00adceeded. Initially, his U-boats had great success as they torpedoed and sank merchant ships on an unprecedented scal., Countless cargoes of non-ferrous ingots accompanied the sinking ships to the ocean floor. This bonanza did not go unnoticed by Sorima, which welcomed the war's end as it pondered new prizes to be recovered from the seabed. Peace saw the company take up negotiations, as before, with the British authorities. This time, however, Sorima was greeted with a frosty reception by their noble lordships at the Admiralty. Relations had soured, since Italy had been England's enemy during the war and now the British authorities would have no truck with the company. Instead, salvage concessions were granted to the newly emerging English company, Risdon Beasley Marine Salvage. Beasley was to become Sorima's arch rival and successor. Italy's support of Hitler sounded the death knell for Sorima, and it was several years before it clawed its way back into business. However, it never regained the momentum of the glory years on the Egypt and Galley Head shipwrecks. Sorima's last recovery effort took place in 1953 off Land's End when the company recovered $61,000 in bank notes from the foundered American ship, Flying Enterprise. A failed attempt to locate a copper cargo off Chile in 1960 brought operations to a close.\n\nThe Ludgate still excites the imagination of sport divers who visit the wreck from time to time. Peering through the pea-green gloom, one can still see the claw marks of the Artiglio's grab on the ship's rusting steel; a few jade-green copper ingots are scattered about the bow area. A pair of erect lifeboat davitts stand sentinel-like over the forward hatch. The wreck itself is a veritable scrap-heap tenanted by conger eel and pollock. Though the rusting Ludgate will never complete her voyage and rendezvous with her destination in Wales, she remains a monument to a daring band of sailors who gambled with their lives and lost in a futile war that achieved little more than the slaughter of eleven million lives worldwide ."}
{"text":"Local man builds replica schooner for Heritage Society\n\nA one time schooners ruled the waters around Newfoundland and were regularly sights in towns around the Coast of Bays. Max Taylor stands proudly by the schooner he made and presented to the Milltown-Head Bay dEspoir Heritage Society.\n\nThe fabric and culture of the south coast of Newfoundland is woven with the history and folklore of the tall ships commonly known as schooners.\n\nThese vessels were the backbone of the fishing trade and merchant fleets that sailed the world. Bay dEspoir was home to a number of these ship builders, most notably the Roberts Brothers of the former community of Head Bay dEspoir and the Kendell Brothers in Morrisville.\n\nThese schooners were mainly two and three masted ships with sails. These ships at one time were commonplace and could be seen arriving and departing the many small communities that dotted the coastal areas of Newfoundland.\n\nAll goods and supplies came by sea; there were no connecting roads in the early days of Bay dEspoir. Many members of the older generation remember the sailing schooners and the excitement of spotting one as she slipped into port bringing news and much needed staples after a long winter.\n\nThese boats were mainly trading schooners used to carry supplies, export fish and timber, as well as being the only means of transportation from one community to another.\n\nIn the south coast area the Jensens from Harbour Breton and Riggs from McCallum would bring in supplies that couldnt readily be made or grown and pick up timber for sale further down the coast as well as exported to the overseas markets.\n\nLeonard Long from St. Albans carried lumber to Nova Scotia and returned with coal, which began to replace wood as the main source of fuel. Garlands in Gaultois had a strong overseas trade and used schooners built by the Roberts Brothers. These schooners would make port in the communities about two or three times a year and were seen in the Bay dEspoir region as late as the 1940s.\n\nOne man in the community of Milltown-Head Bay d'Espoir decided that he would build a small-scale schooner, indicative of those he remembered as a young man.\n\nMax Taylor, now retired from Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro likes to be busy, and it seems boat building is a passion from way back. He started by building his own boat many years ago. His first small scale schooner was built for his grandson Justin.\n\nHe then built two more, and a hobby was born. In conversation with Heritage Society Chairperson Susan Dunphy, Mr. Taylor described his recent project.\n\nThe schooner is not an exact replica of any one ship, but rather its a replica of the old Newfoundland schooners that used to sail the waters of Bay dEspoir, the south coast and beyond, said Mr. Taylor.\n\nMr. Taylors replica ships are intricate in design and attention has been given to the smallest of details. There are water barrels and hatches for fish and cargo. A miniature Captains wheel and small row dories show the scope of these ships size.\n\nMr. Taylor said, it takes me about a year to complete a schooner.\n\nEarly this spring Mr. Taylor presented the Heritage Society of Milltown-Head Bay d'Espoir with one of these beautifully made replicas for the Town Museum.\n\nThe Heritage Society was pleased to have this wonderful addition to their exhibits. It tells the story of a vital part of the communities way of life that younger generations can no longer imagine.\n\nRepresentatives from the Heritage Society said the schooner will add another layer in the interpretation of the stories that make up the history and folklore of the Bay dEspoir"}

{"text":"Tag Archive | \"john milton\"\n\nPosted on 10 August 2012\n\nProfessional seaman are familiar with NOAA's frequent publication of a Notice to Mariners. It warns of new hazards or changes to navigation aids which don't appear on the latest charts. If NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) had existed in 1858. If it had issued a notice about the new Shinnecock lighthouse. If the captain of the sailing vessel John Milton had received the notice, then the crew and passengers of the 1445-ton ship wouldn't have died in freezing waters off the south shore in one of Long Island's worst maritime disasters. If.\n\nWhen you drive south through Hampton Bays towards the Ponquogue Bridge and the barrier beach, you pass the U.S. Coast Guard Shinnecock Station just before the bridge. On this site in 1857, before the Coast Guard base existed, the government erected a new lighthouse. The tower was 160 feet high, built of red brick. Fueled by lard oil, the light shone through fine glass lenses imported from France and could be seen 20 miles at sea. The first keeper, John Hallock, and his two assistants lived in houses at the base of the tower. Coal for a stove and oil for the light were hoisted up outside the tower by heavy rope. The light began operating on January 1, 1858, a boon to the safety of mariners. Or so everyone thought.\n\nAfter a voyage of nearly three years, touching at San Francisco, Peru and finally Hampton Roads, Virginia, the three-masted, 203-ft. John Milton departed for her homeport of New Bedford, Massachusetts, on February 16, 1858. Strong northeast gales and heavy snowstorms battered the ship as she clawed past Cape May. The mercury dropped to eight degrees above zero. Sometime during the night of the 19th, Captain Ephraim Harding no doubt was relieved to see a steady beam over his port bow, Montauk Point. What the captain couldn't know was that the bright beam came from the new Shinnecock lighthouse, and Montauk's light had been converted to a flashing signal. In the blinding storm, thinking he was well clear of the island's end, he turned to a more northerly course for New Bedford. But the John Milton never reached its homeport. At 10 a.m. on the 20th, the ship piled up on the rocky Montauk coast in the section known as Ditch Plains.\n\nNear evening, bodies floated ashore frozen and covered in ice. The Sag Harbor Corrector (predecessor of the Express)of March 11, 1858, reported, \"The first that was discovered was a boat bottom up, and near it, was a body, on the shore, and a little to the eastward, the wreck was discovered. The bows, bowsprit, head gear, etc. was discovered about one third of a mile from shore, probably held there by her anchors; the rest of the wreck was scattered along the beach; heavy masts and spars came ashore, broken and twisted up in several pieces\u2026\" By marks made in the sand, witnesses deduced that the ship's cook had made it to the beach and attempted to crawl from the water, but froze to death before help arrived. The coroner held an inquest in a barn on Newtown Lane in East Hampton.\n\nLocal authorities brought recovered bodies over snow-bound roads to East Hampton where on February 28th they arranged a funeral service in the old Presbyterian Church across from Clinton Academy. Montauk historian Henry Osmers wrote a book about the disaster, They Were All Strangers: The Wreck of the John Milton at Montauk, New York. The title came from the words of Captain Thomas Mulford who spoke at the service. Twenty-one victims rest in East Hampton's South End Burying Ground where a monument remembers their fate. Captain Harding and his teenage son were buried in Tisbury, Mass., and other victims were taken to graves near their family homes. Different sources put the number of dead at 32 or 33. The ship's bell was retrieved and tolled for years from the Presbyterian Chapel known as Session House. It is now part of the collection of the Montauk Lighthouse Museum.\n\nIn 1934 the government erected an electric beacon on a metal framework on the ocean beach in Shinnecock and the lighthouse no longer was needed. It was offered to Suffolk County for one dollar but the County turned it down. It was demolished in December 1948. An essay in the October 1947 Long Island Forum headed \"Venerable Shinnecock Lighthouse\" made no mention of an earlier article, in the April 1944 issue, which described the tragic role played by the \"venerable\" lighthouse in the wreck of the John Milton."}
{"text":"1920s\n\nDuring the 1920s powerboat racing was dominated by American businessman and racer Gar Wood, whose Miss America boats were capable of speeds approaching 100 miles per hour (160 km\/h). Increased public interest generated by the speeds achieved by Wood and others led to an official speed record being ratified in 1928.\nThe first person to try a record attempt was Gar Wood's brother George. On 4 September 1928 he drove Miss America VII to 92.83 mph (149.40 km\/h) on the Detroit River. The next year Gar Wood took the same boat up a waterway Indian Creek, Miami and reached 93.12 mph (149.86 km\/h).\n\n1930s\n\nLike the Land Speed Record, the water record was destined to become a scrap for national honour between Britain and the USA. American success in setting records spurred Castrol Oil chairman Lord Wakefield to sponsor a project to bring the water record to Britain. Famed land speed record breaker and racing driver Sir Henry Segrave was hired to pilot a new boat called Miss England. Although the boat wasn't capable of beating Gar Wood's Miss America, the British team did gain experience that they put into an improved boat. Miss England II was powered by two Rolls-Royce aeroplane engines and seemed capable of beating Wood's record.\n\nOn July 131930, Segrave drove Miss England II to a new record of 98.76 mph (158.94 km\/h) average speed during two runs on Lake Windermere, in Britain's Lake District. Having set the record, Segrave set off on a third run to try to improve the record further. Unfortunately during the run, the boat struck an object in the water and capsized, with both Segrave and his co-driver receiving fatal injuries.\n\nFollowing Segrave's death, Miss England II was salvaged from the lake and repaired. Another racing driver, Kaye Don , was chosen as the new driver for 1931. However, during this time Gar Wood recaptured the record for the US at 102.16 mph (164.41 km\/h). A month later on Lake Garda, Don fought back with 110.223 mph (177.387 km\/h). In February 1932, Wood responded, nudging the mark up by one mph (1.6 km\/h).\n\nIn response the continued American challenge, the British team build a new boat, Miss England III. The design was an evolution of the predecessor, with a squared-off stern and twin propellers being the main improvements. Don took the new boat to Loch Lomond in Scotland, on July 18 1932, improved the record first to 117.430 mph (188.985 km\/h), and then to 119.810 mph (192.816 km\/h) on a second run.\n\nDetermined to have the last word over his great rival, Gar Wood built another new Miss America. Miss America X was 12 metres long, and was powered by four supercharged Packard aeroplane engines. On September 20 1932, Wood drove his new monster-boat to 124.860 mph (200.943 km\/h). It would prove to be the end of an era. Don declined to attempt any further records, and Miss England III became a museum piece. Wood also opted to scale-down his involvement in racing and returned to running his businesses. Somewhat ironically, both of the daredevil record-breakers would live to their 90s. Wood died in 1971, and Kaye Don in 1985.\n\nBoat design changes\n\nWood's last record would be one of the final records for a conventional, single-keel boat. In June 1937, Malcolm Campbell, the world-famous land speed record breaker, drove Bluebird K3 to a new record of 126.33 mph (203.31 km\/h) at Lake Maggiore. Compared to the massive Miss America X, K3 was a much more compact craft. It was 5 metres shorter and had one engine to X's four. Despite his success, Campbell was unsatisfied by the relatively small increase in speed. He commissioned a new Bluebird to be built. K4 was a 'three pointer' hydroplane. Unlike conventional powerboats, which have a single keel, with an indent, or 'step', cut from the bottom to reduce drag, a hydroplane has a concave base with two floats fitted to the front, and a third point at the rear of the hull. When the boat increases in speed, most of the hull lifts out of the water and runs on the three contact points. The positive effect is a reduction in drag and an increase in power-to-weight ratio - the boat is lighter as it doesn't need many engines to push it along. The downside is that the three-pointer is much less stable than the single keel boat. If the hydroplane's angle of attack is upset at speed, the craft can somersault into the air, or nose-dive into the water.\n\n1940s\n\nCampbell's new boat was a success. In 1939, on the eve of the Second World War, he took it to Coniston Water and increased his record by 11 mph (18 km\/h), to 141.74 mph (228.11 km\/h). The return of peace in 1945 brought with it a new form of power for the record breaker \u2013 the jet engine. Campbell immediately renovated Bluebird K4 with a de Havilland Goblin jet engine. The result was a curious-looking craft, whose shoe-like profile led to it being nicknamed 'The Coniston Slipper'. The experiment with jet-power was not a success and Campbell retired from record-attempts. He died in 1948.\n\n1950s\n\nEarly in the morning of June 26th1950, a small red boat skipped across Lake Washington, near Seattle, and improved on Campbell's record by 18 mph (29 km\/h). The boat was called Sho-Mo-Shun-IV, and it was built by Seattle Chrysler dealer called Stanley Sayres . The piston-engined boat was able to run at 160 mph because it's hull was designed to lift the top of the propellers out of water when running at high speed. This phenomenon, called 'prop riding', further reduced drag.\n\nIn 1952, Sayres drove Sho-Mo-Shun to 178.49 mph (287.25 km\/h) - a further 18 mph (29 km\/h) increase. The renewed American success persuaded Malcolm Campbell's son Donald, who had already driven Bluebird K4 to within sight of his father's record, to make a push for the record. However, the K4 was completely out-classed and Campbell could not run at the speeds of the Seattle-built boat. In 1951 K4 was written-off when it hit an submerged object on Coniston.\n\nAt this time, yet another land speed driver entered the fray. Englishman John Cobb, was hoping to beat 200 mph (320 km\/h) in his jet-powered, all-aluminium built Crusader. A radical design, the Crusader reversed the 'three-pointer' design, placing the floats at the rear of the hull. On September 29, 1952, Cobb tried for a 200 mph (320 km\/h) record on Loch Ness. Travelling at an estimated speed of 240 mph (386 km\/h), Crusader's front plane collapsed and the craft instantly disintegrated. Cobb was rescued from the water but died of shock soon afterward.\n\nTwo years later, on October 81954, another man would die trying for the record. Italian textile magnate Mario Verga , responding to a prize offer of 5 million lire from the Italian Motorboat Federation to any Italian who break the world record, built a sleek piston-engined hydroplane to claim the record. Named Laura, after Verga's daughter, the boat was fast but unstable. Travelling across Lake Iseo at close to 190 mph (306 km\/h), Verga lost control of Laura, and was thrown out into the water when the boat somersaulted. Like Cobb, he died of shock.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Campbell had been working on a new Bluebird - K7, a jet powered hydroplane. Learning the lessons from Cobb's ill-starred Crusader, K7's floats were forward of the cockpit. The craft was almost too stable: when Campbell first tried out K7, the boat's bow wouldn't lift out of the water. After modifications, Campbell set a new record of 202.32 mph (325.60 km\/h) on Ullswater in 1955. Campbell and K7 would hold the record until June 1967, increasing it 276.33 mph (444.71 km\/h) in the process.\n\n1967\n\nWhen Donald Campbell arrived at Coniston Water on the morning of January 41967, he was a man under pressure. Bluebird K7 was over a decade old, and an American called Lee Taylor was threatening to put the record beyond Campbell's reach with a new boat. The patriotic Campbell desperately wanted an Englishman to be the first to break 300 mph (483 km\/h). His first run across the lake was relatively untroubled. K7 reached 297 mph (478 km\/h) and Campbell immediately turned around at the end of the lake to begin the mandatory return leg, and to hopefully break the 300 mph (483 km\/h) average for Britain. Minutes later he was dead. At around 320 mph (515 km\/h) Bluebird somersaulted and plunged nose-first into the lake.\n\nLee Taylor, a Californian boat racer, had first tried for the record in April 1964. His boat Hustler was similar in design to Bluebird K7, being a jet hydroplane. During a test run on Lake Havasu Taylor was unable to shut down the jet and crashed into the lakeside at over 100mph. Hustler was wrecked and Taylor was severely injured. He spent the following years recuperating, and rebuilding his boat. On June 301967 on [[Lake Guntersville, Taylor and Hustler tried for the record, but the wake of some spectator's boats disturbed the water, forcing Taylor to slow down his second run, and he came up 2 mph (3 km\/h) short. He tried again later the same day and succeeded in setting a new record of 285.21 mph (459.00 km\/h).\n\n1970s to the present\n\nUntil November 201977, every official water speed record had been set by an American or Briton. That day Australian Ken Warby broke the Anglo-American domination when he piloted his Spirit of Australia to 288.6 mph (464.5 km\/h) to beat Lee Taylor's record. Warby, who had built the craft in his back yard, used the publicity to find sponsorship to pay for improvements to the Spirit. On October 8 1978 Warby travelled to Blowering Dam, Australia, and broke both the 300 mph (483 km\/h) and 500 km\/h barriers with an average speed of 317.18 mph (510 km\/h).\n\nAs of 2005, Warby's record still stands. There have only been two official attempts to break it. Lee Taylor tried to get the record back in 1980. Inspired by the land speed record cars Blue Flame and Budweiser Rocket, Taylor built a rocket-powered boat, Discovery II. The 40-foot long craft was a reverse three point design, similar to John Cobb's Crusader, albeit of a much longer length. Originally Taylor tested the boat on Walker Lake in Nevada but his backers demanded a more accessible location, so Taylor switched to Lake Tahoe. An attempt was set for November 131980, but when conditions on the lake proved unfavourable, Taylor decided against trying for the record. Not wanting to disappoint the assembled spectators and media, he decided to do a test run instead. At 270 mph (435 km\/h) Discovery II hit a swell and one of the floats collapsed, sending the boat plunging into the water. Taylor's body and his destroyed craft were never recovered. In 1989, Craig Arfons , nephew of famed record breaker Art Arfons, tried for the record in his all-carbon-fibre Rain X Challenger, but died when the hydroplane somersaulted at 300 mph (483 km\/h).\n\nDespite the high fatality rate, the record is still coveted by boat enthusiasts and racers. Currently there are three major projects aiming for the record. The British Quicksilver[1], The American Challenge project [2], and. spurred into action by the new challengers, Ken Warby has also built a new boat [3].\n\nIn 2001, Bluebird K7 was raised from Coniston Waterb by members of the Bluebird"}

{"text":"The passengers \"precipitated into Eternity\" when their steamship sank\n\nPublished on 08\/05\/2006 07:19\n\nTHE NAME of Henry James Bell has its own special place in the annals of nautical history. The engineer, born in Torphichen, West Lothian, designed the world's first practical steamship, the Comet, and had it built in a shipyard in Port Glasgow. It was launched in 1812 and is one of Scotland's much-lauded inventions. Bell was a pioneer in his field in the early days of steamship transportation which were fraught with danger.\n\nWhat few people know is that Bell commissioned the building of two Comets. The original vessel was carrying passengers from Fort William down the west cost to the Firth of Clyde in 1820 when strong winds drove it ashore on to rocks near the Argyll port of Crinan. All the passengers, including Bell, escaped, but the vessel was wrecked, an ignominious end for such a historic ship.\n\nBut the fate of the second vessel, Comet II, was to be far more disastrous. It shocked Bell to the core and forced him to end any further involvement in steamship design - only 13 years after his great invention.\n\nIn the early morning darkness of 21 October, 1825, the Comet was again on the West Highland run, carrying a boat-load of passengers from Inverness and Fort William to the Clyde. As the vessel rounded Kempock Point, between Gourock and the Cloch Lighthouse, she was struck by another steamboat, the Ayr. The collision was so violent that the Comet sank like a stone, killing 62 of the 80 passengers on board.The grim reporting of the time was evident in the following day's Glasgow Courier which wrote that \"in rounding the point the vessels came in contact with each other with such force and violence that the Comet went down almost instantaneously, when above 70 persons were, in a moment, precipitated into the deep, into Eternity\".\n\nIn equally woeful tones the newspaper noted that \"there is too much reason to dread that the greater number of those who perished are persons in the superior ranks of life\".\n\nMost of those who died when the Comet sank were indeed wealthy, but then only the wealthy had the financial means to travel on a steamship in those days. By all accounts the men, women and children on board the vessel had been in high spirits as they approached the final stage of their journey from the Highlands to Glasgow.\n\nAmong those who died was Captain Sutherland of the 33rd Regiment. He and his wife had been married only five days. In her desperate bid to survive, Mrs Sutherland clung on to the only cabin passenger to survive, Colin Anderson. The waves were so high, however, that she lost her grip and drowned. Another woman, Janet Millar, survived when she was driven ashore between two tables. Her two-year old daughter Susan was lost.\n\nThe bodies washed ashore at Greenock included two ladies said to have been \"genteelly dressed\" as well as two black slaves, a sure sign that those on board were wealthy. It was not uncommon for the tobacco barons of Glasgow, who carried out a lot of their business in Virginia and the southern states of the US, to have Negro servants.\n\nThe master of the Comet, Duncan McInnes, and the ship's pilot, Peter McBride, both survived and were tried before the High Court for Admiralty accused of the culpable killing of those who had perished. The court alleged that the two men behaved in a reckless manner, neglected to cause a light to be affixed to the boat and continued to steer the vessel without a light.McInnes, who later helped found the Anchor shipping line, was found guilty and sentenced to three months in Greenock Prison. McBride was found not guilty.\n\nFor Henry Bell, the loss of his second boat, particularly in such tragic circumstances, was enough to make him give up his work in steam navigation. He moved on to other projects but had such a poor grasp of handling his finances that, when he died in 1830 at the Hydropathic Institute in Helensburgh, he was in a state of \"virtual poverty\".\n\nThe disaster caught the attention of a young Alfred, Lord Tennyson who penned a short work entitled, Collision of the Ayr and Comet Steamboats. Part of which reads:\n\n\"The hearts were glowing, the steps were light, the melody was free\n\nThat ushered in that Midnight jollity;\n\nSad was the shock and fearful was the doom\n\nThat quenched those happy hearts so suddenly;\n\nAnd sad to see their kindred come in quest o' the dearest brow, with hushing"}

{"text":"Overview\/Introduction to USS Liberty\n\nOn June 8, 1967, 34 American servicemen were killed and 174 were wounded during an Israeli attack on the USS Liberty.\n\nAccording to former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas Moorer, \"Those men were then betrayed and left to die by our own government.\" The survivors are still awaiting justice.\n\nWhat happened to the USS Liberty? The USS Liberty was a virtually unarmed American navy ship that was attacked by Israeli planes and torpedo boats on June 8, 1967.\n\nWhat were the American casualties? 34 American sailors were killed and 172 injured that day, a casualty rate of 70%. This is among the highest casualty rates ever inflicted upon a U.S. naval vessel.\n\nWhat was Israel's explanation for the attack? Israel claimed the attack was \"a case of mistaken identity\"; that they didn't know it was an American ship.\n\nWhy would we question that explanation more than 30 years later? The ship's survivors were afraid to speak out in the early years because of threats of \"court martial, prison-up the incident. Today, an Independent Commission of Inquiry has].\n\nDid Israel have reason to believe the USS Liberty was an Egyptian ship? Israel says its pilots and torpedo boat commanders confused the USS Liberty with the El Quseir, an Egyptian ship allegedly firing upon its forces in the Sinai. But there was no Egyptian naval bombardment that day; nor did the El Quseir (an unarmed 1920s-era horse carrier out of service in Alexandria) bear any resemblance to the Liberty.\n\nIsn't it difficult to identify a ship if you're in an airplane? In large white identification numbers on its bow. Egyptian hull numbers are painted black.\n\nDoesn't Israel say that the Liberty flew no flag? According to American survivors, a 5-by-8 feet American flag was hoisted early that morning and was flying all day until it was shot away by attacking aircraft. Within several minutes, it was replaced by the giant 7-by-13 feet holiday ensign, which flew for the duration of the attack.\n\nCould Israel have thought the ship was in a war zone, acting suspiciously? According to surviving crewmembers, Israeli reconnaissance aircraft closely studied the Liberty over an eight-hour period prior to the attack, one flying within two hundred feet of the ship. At all times the Liberty was a clearly marked American ship in international waters, proceeding at a speed of only 5 knots.\n\nWhat was the weather like the day of the attack? WeatherDoesn't Israel say they ended the attack the minute they saw someone hoist an American flag? The Israeli attack by combined air and naval forces spanned two hours \u2014 as long as the attack on Pearl Harbor. The air attack alone lasted approximately 25 minutes: consisting of more than 30 sorties by approximately 12 separate planes using napalm, cannon, and rockets which left 821 holes in the ship. Following the air attack, three Israeli motor torpedo boats torpedoed the ship, causing a 40'x 40' wide hole in her hull, and machine-gunning (they departed after hovering over the ship for several minutes, making no attempt to communicate).\n\nDid the Liberty send out a distress signal when it was under attack? Throughout the air attack, the Liberty's radio operators found it difficult to transmit a distress signal because the attacking Israeli aircraft jammed all five of the Liberty's American, not Egyptian, emergency radio channels. However, a call for help did reach the U.S. Navy command in the Mediterranean.\n\nWhat was the American response time? Although the only instance in American naval history where a rescue mission was cancelled when an American ship was under attack.\n\nWhy would Israel have deliberately attacked an American ship? Israel's motive for launching the attack has never been determined with certainty. This is why an impartial investigation is criticalHas the incident been investigated in the past? Some people say that there have been \"thirteen official investigations\" all concluding the attack was a case of mistaken identity. Several were conducted by Israel. Upon examination, however, every one is based upon the conclusions of the original 1967 US Navy Court of Inquiry, which accepted the Israeli version, but which has been exposed and discredited by its chief attorney as a cover-up.\n\nDid the surviving crewmembers testify in the other investigations? In not one of these \"investigations\" were any of the Liberty's surviving crewmembers permitted to publicly testify.\n\nWhy would the White House prevent the rescue of an American ship? This is, perhaps, the most disturbing question arising out of Israel's attack. It is why there needs to be a thorough investigation of the actions taken by the White House and the Secretary of Defense. Why did they order the recall of the planes that had been sent to rescue the Liberty? Why did they order that the survivors be silenced and the true facts be withheld from the American people?\n\nWhat kind of investigation are you calling for? We are calling for a new Court of Inquiry by the Department of the Navy, with congressional oversight, to take public testimony from surviving crewmembers and otherwise thoroughly examine the circumstances of the attack.\n\nWhy are you calling for a naval \u2014 and not a congressional \u2014 investigation? We believe this would remove the inquiry from the political pressures traditionally exerted by special interest groups upon individual congressional offices. Fundraising and election pressures have prevented an honest investigation from being conducted for the past 36 years.\n\nWhy is this significant for the American people 36 years later? We have a duty to the crew of the USS Liberty, while the survivors are still alive to testify, and while the perpetrators can be brought to justice. Furthermore, any policies that paralyze our elected leadership to the extent they become unable or unwilling to protect Americans and American interests, endangers not only the safety of all Americans but also the national security of the United States.\n\nDoesn't America have a special relationship with Israel? No nation or people should be above the law; nor should American interests be subordinated to the interests of any foreign nation. Those Israelis responsible for ordering the attack and the resulting murder of American sailors must be held accountable for their actions"}

This came to a head when the Inman liner City of New York was\nwrecked on the rock in March 1864. The Irish Lights Board placed a\nlightship on station to guide shipping from this hazard and by 1896\nthe lightship Puffin was moored in 16 fathoms east of the Daunt rock.\n\nThe Puffin on Rushbrook foreshore\n\nThis lightship had\nbeen built in 1883 and was just after a lengthy refit, so was considered\nvery seaworthy and able for the job. On October 8 1896 a terrible\ngale swept the south coast of Ireland, the changing wind direction\nover the course of the night caused mountainous confused seas to develop\nand by the morning of the 9th , Coastguards reported that the Puffin\nwas nowhere to be seen. Incoming steamers reported signs of wreckage\nfurther east, but nothing to identify origin. On October 10th the\nSuperintendent of Lights had engaged the Clyde Shipping Company tug\nFlying Sportsman to search the area, even though conditions were still\nvery rough at the harbour entrance.\n\nIn the days that followed,\nsporadic unsuccessful attempts were made to grapple for the remains\nof the missing lightship. In the meantime a new lightship the Guillemot\nwas towed into place by the tender Tearaght and successfully moored.\nIn the meantime rumours had started that the Puffin had not sunk,\nbut could have been blown eastwards, and there was even a report that\nshe had been seen riding at anchor near Tramore Co.Waterford. In the\nmeantime the painstaking grappling around the position of the Puffin\ncontinued, now with the help of the firm of Ensors, the Cobh salvagers.\n\nPress photo of the remains of the Puffin\n\nIt was not until\nthe 25th of October that a length of anchor cable was found, and with\nthe weather deteriorating operations had to be abandoned until November\n5th. It was on this day, nearly a month later that divers, following\nthe cable found the forlorn remains of the Puffin. The wreck was intact,\nbut it was apparent that the savage motion of the sea had torn her\nlight mast from the deck, exposing the innards of the ship to the\nbreaking waves\n\nChart portion,showing position of Daunt Rock.\n\nSoon she must have\nbeen swamped and foundered. The weather again deteriorated and it\nwas not until the middle of December that the wreck was raised. It\nwas beached on a mud bank in Rushbrook in Cork Harbour and eventually\nscrapped on the spot by Ensors.\n\nNo trace was ever\nfound of the eight crewmen on board. The Daunt Rock continued to be\na hazard on the western approaches, with the Cunarder Ivernia grounding\nthere in 1911 and the Greek liner Neptunia hitting the Rock in November\n1957"}

{"text":"Vasa (or Wasa) is a Swedishwarship built 1626-1628. The ship foundered and sank after sailing less than a nautical mile (ca 2 km) into its maiden voyage on 10 August 1628. It fell into obscurity after most of its valuable bronzecannons were salvaged in the 17th century. After it was located again in the late 1950s in a busy shipping lane just outside the Stockholm harbor, it was salvaged with a largely intact hull in 1961. It was housed in a temporary museum called Wasavarvet (\"The Wasa Shipyard\") until 1987 and then moved to the Vasa Museum in Stockholm. The ship is one of Sweden's most popular tourist attractions and has been seen by over 29 million visitors since 1961. Vasa has since its recovery become a widely recognized symbol of the Swedish \"great power period\". It is today also a de facto standard in the media and among Swedes for evaluating the historical importance of shipwrecks.\n\nVasa was built top-heavy and had insufficient ballast. Despite an obvious lack of stability in port, it was allowed to set sail and foundered only a few minutes after it first encountered a wind stronger than a breeze. The impulsive move to set sail was the result of a combination of factors: Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus, who was leading the army on the continent on the date of its maiden voyage, was impatient to see it join the Baltic fleet in the Thirty Years' War; at the same time, the king's subordinates lacked the political courage to discuss the ship's structural problems frankly or to have the maiden voyage postponed. An inquiry was organized by the Swedish privy council to find personal responsibility for the disaster, but in the end no one was punished for the fiasco."}

{"text":"At the outbreak of WW1 nobody could foresee what a pivotal role the submarines would play in this war. The breakthrough of the\nGerman army to the English Channel coast took the Imperial Navy staff by surprise - the war was assumed to be of short\nduration... The Belgian ports in Flanders had been captured undamaged, and the need for a compact submarine to operate\nfrom these bases soon became apparent.\n\nThe initially fast-moving war ended in a virtual stalemate; the opposing sides dug into trenches and the German High command began to seek alternative methods to hasten the route to ultimate victory.\n\nGermany quickly realized the strategic value of Ostend and Zeebrugge in the war of attrition; being only 75 miles away from Dover and 12 hours from the Home- submarine bases at Helgoland.\n\nOn 9 November the German submarine U12 arrived at Zeebrugge and was the fisrt to commence operations. Almost immediately it became apparent that the existing submarines were too large to operate in the shallow shoal waters of the English Channel and Southern areas of the North Sea.\n\nThe requirements were for a small coastal submarine of simple construction, which could be transported by railway in disassembled state.\n\nTwo bow 450-mm torpedo tubes and one 7.92 mm machine gun gave her offensive capability\n\nUB-1 to UB-8 were ordered from Germaniawerft and UB\u00b79 to UB-15 from AG Weser. Subsequently both UB-1 and UB-15 were given to the Kuk Austro-Hungarian navy.\n\nTrials showed these boats were rather slow - surface speed was only 6 knots and 5.5 knots submerged; -- capable however of diving in 22 seconds!!\n\nThe submarines were transported to their bases in five separate sections by rail. Upon arrival at Antwerp assembly was completed within 2 weeks.\n\nDespite their hurried design and build, in service they were successful. The main disadvantage being their diminutive size; the firing of a torpedo made the bow rise- and thereby visible to the enemy. The crew running forward to the torpedo room to compensate for the weight\/balance shift negated this problem!\n\nThe boats operated in the North Sea, Baltic, Black Sea and the Mediterranean.\nUB-6 was the most successful; completing 60 combat cruises and sinking 15 enemy vessels as well as RN destroyer HMS Recruit.\n\nThe type numbered 20 built, and despite their diminutive size they accommodated 14 officers and men on sorties of up to 6 days\n\nMy model was built using the small resin kit by U-boat Laboratorium consisting of the hull, a resin stand and two PE frets.\n\nA truly esoteric subject, the kit is neatly packaged with detailed historical detail notes and with the comprehensive instructions; the model was simple to build.\n\nI merely omitted the PE rigging and rails; preferring to replace these with stretched sprue.\n\nThe later boats carried some pretty outlandish colour and 'disguise' schemes; UB-1 however was deemed to have been painted in 'mid'grey- so I used Humbrol 64 !\n\nThe display pedestals are brass cup bearings used in Model Railways and the submarine is mounted on a small square of black Perspex.\n\nI added a figure to the display to permit the unfamiliar observer to appreciate just how cramped the conditions aboard must have been!!"}

The ship did not sail into the iceberg head on but rather suffered a glancing blow in a manoeuvre trying to avoid it. Further the iceberg did not open her plates like a can opener but rather tore them apart in the riveted joints.\nThe Titanic was designed to survive a head on\n\nThe high casualty rate resulting from the sinking was due in part to the fact that, although complying with the regulations of the time, the ship carried lifeboats for only 1,178 people. A disproportionate number of men died due to the \"women and children first\" protocol that was enforced by the ship's crew. This procedure meant that many boats were only half filled. Since the sea was calm, it would have been safe to fill all boats to capacity and thereby rescue an additional 500 persons. Further, only a few were picked up from the water after the sinking out of fear of the boats being overfilled or capsizing. Another factor that crucially contributed to the high death rate was the failure of the nearby ship the Californian to come to the rescue. The Titanic stayed afloat for more than 2\u00bd hours, which meant that the Californian would have had enough time to reach her before she sank. In the end it was the Carpathia which came to the rescue and picked up the survivor from the lifeboats but not until the Titanic had been sunk for almost 2 hours."}
{"text":"Jumboisation\n\nJumboisation\n\nJumboisation is a technique in shipbuilding consisting of enlarging a ship by adding an entire section to it. By contrast with refitting or installation of equipment, jumboisation is a long and complex endeavour which can require a specialised shipyard.\n\nEnlarging a ship by jumboisation allows an increase in its value without needing to purchase or build an entirely new ship. This technique has been used on cruise ships and tankers, as well as smaller vessels like sailing or fishing ships.\n\nMethods\n\nLarge ships often have a long mid-section with a uniform profile. In such cases, the ship is cut in two pieces and an additional section is inserted in between. This operation must be performed in a drydock.\n\nOn large ships, the additional sections are typically 20 to 30 metres long, consisting of an oil tank, a cargo ship hold, or a group of cabins, depending on the type of ship. The tanker Knock Nevis became the largest ship in the world after her jumboisation.\n\nSmaller ships are usually jumboised by replacing the entire bow or stern section of the ship.

{"text":"Marion, Ark., Mayor Frank Fogleman wants a museum in Marion dedicated to the steamboat Sultana, which blew up after the Civil War, killing 1,800.\n\nHarper's Weekly\/Library of Congress\n\nA artist's illustration from a 19th century edition of Harper's Weekly shows the sinking of the steamboat Sultana on April 27, 1865. About 1,800 people died when the boat exploded on the Mississippi River near Marion, Ark., marking the worst maritime disaster in American history.\n\nPoll\n\nAre you familiar with the details surrounding the Sultana tragedy?\n\nIt is the most deadly nautical episode in American history, yet the fiery demise of the steamboat Sultana in a flooding, near-freezing Mississippi River became little more than a footnote in history.\n\nThough the Titanic is the best-known shipping disaster, 300 more people were killed when the Sultana blew up nearly 50 years earlier just north of Memphis.\n\nThe luxury sidewheeler steamboat was doing double duty as a military transport on April 26, 1865. It was carrying former Union prisoners of war north to be mustered out of the Army when a cracked boiler exploded at 2 a.m. April 27, about seven miles north of Memphis. The blast caused two more boilers to explode.\n\nWith steam hissing and burning coals raining onto the wooden decks, the Sultana was an inferno as it drifted downriver to its final resting place near Mound City, Ark.\n\nOf 2,400 people on board, 1,800 died.\n\nAs the river changed course over the decades, the watery graveyard became farmland, now a soybean field on the outskirts of Marion, Ark.\n\nThe town will host a Sultana exhibit March 6-26 to help reclaim a history virtually lost in a cascade of world events during the final weeks of April 1865.\n\n\"It's like the deaths of Princess Diana and Mother Teresa,\" says Diane McAdoo, director of the Marion Chamber of Commerce. Mother Teresa's death, since it occurred the same week as Diana's, was overlooked by much of the world.\n\nThe Sultana's fate similarly lost its impact amid an avalanche of tragedies. The Civil War had just ended, with Lee surrendering to Grant on April 9, 1865. Roughly 620,000 soldiers had died, more than the combined total of U.S. casualties in every war since.\n\nOn April 14, President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by actor John Wilkes Booth. The nation followed as Lincoln's death train crossed the country to Springfield, Ill.\n\nThen, on April 26, Booth was captured and killed. The Sultana's departure that night was hardly noticed. While local newspapers wrote of the cataclysmic explosion and huge death toll, it rated a brief mention on page four of the New York Tribune later in the week.\n\n\"The thing that amazes me the most is why the nation doesn't know about this,\" says Memphis attorney Jerry Potter, who has spent 30 years researching the disaster. He wrote a book, \"The Sultana Tragedy: America's Greatest Maritime Disaster.\"\n\n\"You could not write fiction that would be any more compelling than this story,\" says Potter. \"There's greed, disaster, a love story. These people went through so much and to just forget about them is one of the greatest tragedies in American history.\"\n\nLike Potter, other historians ponder the world's seeming indifference to a loss of life on the scale of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. At Arkansas State University, adjunct history professor Louis Intres says the nation was exhausted by the Civil War. \"Most people didn't want to hear any more about war.\"\n\nMemphis history buff Jimmy Ogle says the South, on the losing end of the war, helped the wounded and dying from the Sultana, but, \"It was a bunch of Northern soldiers killed in the South, so nobody down here cared.\"\n\nMarion Mayor Frank Fogleman, whose great-great-grandfather helped rescue survivors, says in addition that, \"Boat accidents were common. That's one more reason it didn't get the attention that it deserved.\"\n\nHis first cousin, Lisa Heath, says that before the end of the war, Union soldiers had come downriver, destroying boats to prevent their use in the Confederate war effort. Her great-great-grandfather had to lash logs together to hurriedly build a raft to rescue scalded and badly burned soldiers. Newspaper stories credited him with saving 100 men. Many had been clinging to trees along the flooded shoreline. Others, who died of hypothermia in waters chilled by snow melt from the north, were swept by the current as far south as Vicksburg, Miss.\n\nPotter says the boat, 260 feet long, was roughly a third the length of the Titanic. It was designed for only 376 passengers but was carrying 2,400. A corrupt quartermaster and the ship's captain, among others, colluded to load as many soldiers on the boat as it would take. Capt. J. Cass Mason agreed to carry the men at $3 a head with the quartermaster collecting at least $5 a head from the government. One military officer who helped steer soldiers onto the boat reportedly got a 50-cent kickback for each one. Two other steamboats had left Vicksburg virtually empty on the same day. Mason died on the Sultana.\n\nMost of the soldiers had been imprisoned at the notorious Andersonville prison in Georgia and in Cahaba near Selma, Ala. Emaciated, they were overjoyed to be free and, finally, on their way home. They boarded the Sultana in Vicksburg, made a stop in Memphis and had just taken on a load of coal in Hopeville, Ark. They had barely resumed the journey before the boiler exploded.\n\nSoldier Samuel Jenkins of Maryville, Tenn., was only 16 and had been a prisoner of war for seven months when he was put on board. Despite the crowding, Jenkins had managed to lie down. He awoke in midair, the sounds of explosions ringing in his ears. He felt a sharp pain in his shoulder before landing in the cold, rushing water shortly after 2 a.m.\n\nJenkins survived and his story found its way into Potter's book.\n\nAnother passenger, Ann Annis, was one of the few women on board. She was with her husband and 7-year-old daughter. Potter's first two husbands had been sea captains in England. Both drowned at sea. Her third husband, Harvey, was a Union army officer, a \"landlubber.\" He held his daughter in his arms as he leaped from the burning ship and grabbed a plank for flotation. His wife lowered herself by a rope. As she entered the water, she saw her husband and daughter sink into the cold current. Annis survived, holding onto the boat's rudder until it badly burned both of her arms.\n\nThe Marion exhibit will use most of the artifacts in an exhibit already on display at Arkansas State University. Intres says one of the most curious pieces is a cigar-box-sized wooden case with an alligator carved into the top.\n\nIn the boat's hold, the captain had kept a pet alligator. In the last seconds before fleeing, a passenger had killed the gator with an ax and used its wooden crate as a raft. The grateful man later used parts of the crate to make the box. Beneath the carved animal he wrote: \"Saved by a alligator.\"\n\nMcAdoo says the March exhibit will include video and audio interpretations of the disaster that Marion, Ark., hopes to include in an eventual permanent museum. Intres says other exhibit items include firebricks and \"boiler shakers,\" like grates, from the boat. There are personal possessions from passengers, including wooden combs, hairbrushes and pins retrieved from uniforms.\n\nA few weeks after the Sultana explosion, while the death count was still rising among the hospitalized wounded, the Memphis Argus newspaper foretold the eventual obscurity of the Sultana:\n\n\"We have as a people become so accustomed to suffering of horrors during the past few years that they soon are forgotten. Only a few days ago 1,500 lives were sacrificed. Yet now, the disaster is scarcely mentioned -- some new excitement has taken its place.\"\n\nREMEMBERING THE SULTANA TRAGEDY\n\nWhat: \"Sultana: The Exhibit,\" the story of America's biggest nautical disaster -- the explosion of the steamboat Sultana.\n\nComments \u00bb 20 seem seemI've had the privilege of standing on the bluffs of the Miss. River with Jerry Potter as he recounted details of this tragedy. He told me that many of the victims floated back downriver and were picked up in Memphis, dried off, and sent to the hospital in warm blankets. However, when they fell asleep, they never woke up. Hypothermia and it's effects were not widely understood explained Potter.\n\nAnyway, Mr.Potter and the good folks at Arkansas St. deserve much credit for keeping this forgotten piece of American history alive.\n\nI learned of this a few years back on an episode of Modern Marvels on the history channel (engineering disasters series) and am glad to see that someone is trying to spread this story. It's sad it has been lost in the headlines of the day especially when you think this boat had Union soldiers just looking forward to being home.\n\nwill check this exhibit out. I met Mr Potter for a University of Memphis journalism project in the Summer of 1987. Aside from being a historian, he believes he found the wreckage under a lot of soil in a farm near Mound City, Arkansas.\n\n\"In 1982, a local archaeological expedition uncovered what was believed to be the wreckage of Sultana. Blackened wooden deck planks and timbers were found about 32 feet (9.8 m) under a soybean field on the Arkansas side, about 4 miles (6.4 km) from Memphis. The Mississippi River has changed course several times since the disaster. The main channel now flows about 2 miles (3.2 km) east of its 1865 position.\"\n\nwe need to dig up parts of it for the museum. Not sure if it is possible?\n\nIt it very possible!! To see what can happen in Marion just Google Steamboat Arabia. The website for its museum, which is in KC, will tell the story about the boat. The Arabia sank when it hit a snag on the Missouri River in 1856. The only loss of life was a mule. Much of the cargo was preserved and offers a glimpse of the goods being transported out on the frontier. Its worth the lookMyself and my friends and family know but I don't doubt that others have no idea. But let's be honest here. It's not just Tom Lee some people don't know about, it's that they don't know history at all! So yes, there are many who don't know who Tom Lee is, but those that don't, don't know anything historical anyway nor do they care. My point is that you simply can't compare the Sultana and Tom Lee. It's a false equivalence. More people definitely are unaware of the latter and it's about time someone does something about it."}

Collaborating with her students on the project, Owen Johnston, assisted by Tyler Silkwood did extensive research into the main event of the novelthe torpedo sinking of the troopship S.S. Cape San Juan on 11 November, 1943. They transformed their findings into an artistic interpretation and digital graphics that resulted in an outstanding cover, depicting the chaos and suffering the soldiers and sailors endured after the attack.\n\nThis has been a great chance to test myself and my skills as an artist, said Johnston. The work done in completion of this book cover represents, in being published, the validity of my path in the art field. (For me) its been a giant step forward in a direction that has until recently, been a dream.\n\nInstructor Collier said, These students worked tremendously together, with each others ideas giving balance to the composition. Although I prep my students well for the reality of critique in the real world, it was a true test as to how they would handle last\nminute changes. Ultimately, I was proud as they welcomed and accepted all the technical challenges thrown at them.\n\nCode Name: ORIONS EYE is an historical novel based on the true story of an American troop ship, S.S. Cape San Juan, and many of its crew and passengers. It is a fast moving and entertaining tale with a challenging plot set in little known locations during World War II. German submarines operating in the South Pacific, Nazi spies and the governments fear of Japanese incursions in Mexico, and the dramatic event of the largest troopship sinking in the Pacific war are examples of below the fold news that makes an enlightening backdrop for the story.\n\nDr. Gauthier has authored two other books, Meads Trek, published by Patriot Media, Inc. and the international award winning literary novel, A Voyage Beyond, is self published.

{"text":"After the US Navy laid the keel of the S-42-class submarine USS S-44 (SS-155) on January 14, 1921 at the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation in Quincy, Massachusetts, she eventually went down the quays on October 27, 1923. The Navy commissioned her on February 16, 1925. When she cruised on the surface, she displaced 903 tons. While submerged, the submarine displaced 1,126 tons. Powered by two 1,200 horsepower Diesel engines that drove her through the water at a maximum speed of 14.5 knots while surfaced, she could submerge powered by 120 battery cells supplying electricity to electric motors at a maximum speed of 11 knots. Her maximum diving depth was 200 feet\u2014 far less than the fleet submarines (400 feet) the Americans launched after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The boat had four 21-inch forward-facing torpedo tubes, one 4-inch deck gun, and could carry 12 torpedoes. Her crew included four officers and 34 enlisted men.\n\nAfter operating off the New England coast, she served at Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone from mid-1925 until 1927 when she then moved to a new base at San Diego, California. The submarine then cruised to Hawaii in 1930. Seven years later, she returned to her former base in the Panama Canal Zone.\n\nAfter an overhaul in 1941, the submarine began her wartime service in the Canal Zone early in 1942. Later in March and April, the S-44crossed the Pacific to the American submarine base in Brisbane, Australia. She patrolled the waters four times near the Solomon Islands. During these patrols, she torpedoed and sank the Japanese salvage ship Shoei Maru on May 12 and the converted Japanese gunboat Kiejo Maru on June 21. Her most famous victory was the sinking of the heavy cruiserKako on August 10. Later on October 4, she attacked a Japanese destroyer but ran into trouble this time. The Japanese counterattacked with an intense depth charge attack that severely damaged the submarine. The S-44had to return in early 1943 to the U.S. for needed repairs.\n\nAfter completing repairs and a badly needed overhaul at the Philadelphia in June 1943, the submarine left for the Aleutians and arrived there in mid-September. While on her fifth patrol on October 7, she sighted a Japanese ship and attacked it with her deck gun. Tragically, the ship was a destroyer, which overwhelmingly outgunned the S-44. The submarine absorbed fatal damage, and she quickly sank. There were only survivors from her crew."}
{"text":"News\n\nAmerican Forces Press Service\n\nNews Article\n\nWar of 1812 Flagship Reveals Its Secrets\n\nBy Bradley Cantor Emerging Media, Defense Media Activity\n\nWASHINGTON, Oct. 20, 2011 \u2013The Scorpion, the flagship of Commodore Joshua Barney's Chesapeake Bay Flotilla, is located about 30 minutes outside Washington.\n\nDuring the War of 1812, Barney was charged to protect Washington from invading British forces. Barney's plan called for the construction of a flotilla containing smaller barges and gunboats that would be able to outmaneuver the larger British ships in the shallow Chesapeake waters.\n\nThe flotilla fought in several battles and played a key role in draining British resources and slowing the invasion. However, Barney's Chesapeake Bay Flotilla met its end Aug. 22, 1814.\n\nAfter the Battle of St. Leonard's Creek, Barney was forced to flee up the Patuxent River to what is now Highway 4, near Pig Point, Md. He was outflanked, seriously wounded, and had used up most of his ammunition. Neyland said it was there that Barney scuttled his flotilla, including the USS Scorpion, to prevent the approaching British navy from commandeering his vessels.\n\nAs the flotilla sank, Barney and his remaining crew left Pig Point and made their way to join American troops and citizen-soldiers fighting at the Battle of Bladensburg, Md. As the British forces overcame the Americans, many of the citizen-soldiers retreated, but Barney and his crew stayed to fight. In the end, they were among the last on the battlefield. Barney died in Pittsburgh in 1818 while traveling to Kentucky, where he planned to retire.\n\nUntil now, little was known about the construction of Barney's fleet and, in particular, the Scorpion. Historians knew the Scorpion was a converted gunboat, built in 1806. \"We really don't know a whole lot about the construction of it,\" Neyland said, \"other than it was one of the larger sloop brig vessels.\"\n\nIn the late 1970s, amateur archaeologists found wreckage on the same spot where Barney scuttled his flotilla. Preliminary evidence suggested the wreckage dated to the War of 1812.\n\n\"They verified that it was a War of 1812 vessel from recovered parts of a surgeon's kit, [and from] materials that were appropriate to the War of 1812,\" Neyland said.\n\nThe location suggested the wreckage was part of Barney's flotilla. But additional and deeper exploration yielded evidence that removed all doubt that the flagship USS Scorpion, had indeed been found.\n\nArchaeologists have found some very telling personal items aboard one of the vessels, Neyland said.\n\n\"They found a grog cup \u2026 and the initials C.W. were on that cup,\" Neyland said. \"The only C.W. listed with Barney was an African-American sailor named Caesar Wentworth. He was assigned to \u2026 Barney's flagship, called the Scorpion. So, hence, that's part of the evidence that suggests the wreck we are looking at today is that of the Scorpion.\"\n\nWith the excavation under way, the plan is in place to make the USS Scorpion part of the War of 1812 bicentennial commemoration. The commemoration will start in 2012 and continue through 2014. The Scorpion will join the commemoration in 2013. At that point, Neyland said, he and his team will put a steel structure \u2013 called a cofferdam -- around the 75-foot shipwreck. The water will then be pumped out, thus fully excavating the USS Scorpion.\n\nThis method allows a more detailed recording of artifacts and the hull, Neyland said, and will allow for public viewing both on the site and by webcam."}

{"text":"October 31, 2009\n\nOcean Liners vs. Cruise Ships\n\nThey may look alike to the casual observer, but cruise ships and ocean liners are really two very different types of vessel. The large cruise ships you see sailing out of Miami, Alaska, and other cruising destinations are related to Titanic, United States, and Queen Elizabeth II, but have very different missions, construction, and even crews.\n\nOcean liners came first. In technical jargon, any ship that runs a regular schedule on an ocean-going route is a liner, even if that ship doesn't carry passengers. In everyday usage, though, we think of an ocean liner as a passenger-carrying ship in the mode of the QEII. It is this difference in mission that distinguishes ocean liners from cruise ships: liners go from point to point; cruise ships don't have a final destination.\n\nOcean liners are also built for the open ocean routes their schedules require. They have storage for more food, water, and fuel than their cruise ship counterparts, and are built for the rougher waters of the open ocean. They typically have more freeboard than cruise ships, which simply means their highest open-air deck is higher off the water than that on a cruise ship. This makes an ocean liner a lot more expensive to build than a cruise ship. The Queen Mary II (pictured above), when she was completed in 2003, used 40-percent more steel than an similar-sized cruise ship would, and cost twice as much per passenger berth to build than a cruise ship. The builders also had to settle for fewer premium \"balcony staterooms\" than a cruise ship would to allow for the increased freeboard.\n\nCruise ships have become destinations in and of themselves; it's been said it doesn't matter where they sail as long as the scenery is pretty and the weather is decent. More than a third of all cruise ship sailings are out of and back to Miami via various Caribbean destinations. The cruise industry continues to be a huge part of the travel industry and the major cruise lines are building more ships (nearly ten a year since 2001) all the time. On the other hand, demand for ocean liners decreased as commercial passenger air travel became accessible. The Queen Mary II was the first true ocean liner built in more than 30 years and, with the retirement of the Queen Elizabeth II in 2008, remains the only true liner in passenger service in the world.\n\nThe Queen Mary II is the longest passenger ship in the world at 1,132 feet. It grosses more than 148,000 tons, carries more than 2,600 passengers, and has a crew of more than 1,200. The largest standard cruise ship in the world is Royal Caribbean's Freedom of the Seas. It is 1,119 feet long, but surpasses the QMII in gross tonnage, at more than 154,000. It can carry more than 3,600 passengers and 1,300 crew.\n\nIt has to be considered also that, due to longer routes (and tighter schedules) that liners were forced to run, they had to be A LOT faster than modern cruise ships... An example, the QM2 can travel at over 28 knots whereas a cruise ship crawls along at just over 21-22 knots"}

{"text":"Boat & ship types\n\nA thick log, often oak, hollowed out creating a long narrow canoe. In Europe they\nwere made from c 8000 BC until the early 20th century. Some replicas have\nbeen made in modern time, both of Mesolithic logboats and of Medeival logboats.\n\nThe oldest European logboats (dugouts) were usually carefully built, slender,\nelegant, thin-walled and light. However, logboats from historic times are often crude, rough and\nheavy. Perhaps the logboat had lost status in historic times, when the planked boat dominated.\nLogboats built as outriggers are still used in India and other places.\nMore info.\n\nSkin boat\n\nThe skin boat has a skin tied around a wooden frame. The boat type\nwas never very widespread, but may have been one of mankind's earliest attempts of\nboatbuilding. A modern example is the traditional corracle in Ireland.\n\nReed boat\n\nSmall reed boats (made of thick grass) may have been used in the Mesopotamian River\narea and Egypt (papyrus) around 5000 BC or earlier. The\nKuwait find could be just such a boat. Reed boats are still made and used on the Titicaca Lake in\nSouth America.\n\nEgyptian ship\n\nThe first Egyptian sailing ships existed around 3000 BC or even earlier. They were\nused on the Nile River, which was ideal for primitive sailing vessels. The wind on the Nile is\nusually from the north, so if they wanted to go south they just raised the sail on the double mast.\nAnd if they wanted to go north, they just lowered the sail and drifted with the river. Simple!\n\nThe largest Egyptian ship recorded is\nQueen Hatsheput's obelisque barge from the\n15th century BC, transporting two obelisques, each weighing 350 tons and 100 m tall.\nThe best preserved Egyptian ships are the Cheops ships.\n\nTrireme\n\nThe trireme was the quickest ship in antiquity. It was a narrow war\ngalley, as opposed to the wider cargo ships of the same time. It used sail for\ntransportation, but only oars in battle. As the Greek name implies, the trireme had three rows of\nrowers on each side, dveloped from earlier Greek and Phoenician biremes. It was a hi-tech racer that\ncould exceed 10 knots, chase and sink an enemy with its ram.\nThe hull was a compact special construction of light wood, e g pine tree, assembled by\nmortise and tenon fashion. When it was not in action,\nit was kept on a slipway in a roofed boat house.\n\nDuring the battle of Salamis in 480 BC, the\nGreeks had 380 ships and defeated the Persian navy of 600 ships. About half of the Greek navy may\nhave been triremes. Photo by J.S. Illsley, University of Wales. A Greek\nreplica, the Olympias, was built in 1987. Ram photo by J.S.\nIllsley.\n\nRoman merchant ship (corbita)\n\nThe hull was assembled with the mortise\nand tenon method. The masts carried square sails. The ship was steered by two side rudders\nconnected to each other. The reconstruction drawing of the c 40 m long\nMahdia ship (c 100 BC) is made by Dr Olaf H\u00f7ckmann, Deguwa.\n\nJunk\n\nClassic Chinese sailing vessel of ancient unknown origin, still in wide use.\nHigh-sterned, with projecting bow, the junk carries up to five masts on which are set square sails\nconsisting of panels of linen or matting flattened by bamboo strips. Each sail can be spread or\nclosed at a pull, like a venetian blind.\n\nAccording to Chinese tradition, admiral\nZheng He led several expeditions\nduring 1405-1433 AD, using giant junks, to explore the world. Some of the ships were reported to have\nbeen over 100 m long. Ref: Encyclop\u0160dia Britannica.\n\nViking ship\n\nIt had a clinker-built hull assembled with\niron rivets, using the shell-firstmethod. It\nhad one mast with a square yard sail. At insufficient wind it was rown with oars. The quarter rudder\n(side rudder) was on the right (starboard) side. The ship was always open and undecked.

{"text":"Pirates have been sailing the seas of the world from time immemorial. What some historians call the \"golden age\" of piracy started in the 16th century and continued into the 18th century. Perhaps the most successful and best known of the pirate crews during that period were the Barbary Corsairs, bands of pirates who plied their trade along the Northern Coast of Africa. The Corsairs pioneered many of the tactics used by modern-day pirates. They boarded ships, stole cargo, slaughtered some crew members and held others hostage, and demanded that the Western countries pay them to provide \"protection.\"\n\nMost merchant crews of that era lacked even line-of-sight communications and often did not realize their ships were under attack until it was too late. And, of course, they did not have any of the advanced technology \u2013 specifically including detection systems and devices \u2013 that would give them what today is called situational awareness. Most European countries paid protection money to the pirates so that their ships could safely move through the trading ports of the Mediterranean.\n\nThe then-fledgling U.S. government did not have the money to pay the pirates, so \u2013 after several politically embarrassing incidents \u2014 President Thomas Jefferson sent a U.S. Marine detachment to the North Coast of Africa to protect American merchant ships from pirate attacks. It was not an easy or, at first, totally successful assignment, but the Marines eventually defeated the pirates in many ports along the southern littoral of the Mediterranean, ensuring safe passage for American and European traders.\n\nA Change in Tactics, an Increase in Numbers\nModern-day pirates usually board ships searching for money or marketable cargo. Sometimes they have been easily frightened off by alert crew members. However, their tactics have changed dramatically during the past year. Pirates from lawless areas worldwide have defiantly increased the use of force and violence against merchant ships and private yachts. They hijack ships, holding the ships and crews hostage and demanding millions of dollars in ransom payments.\n\nA number of merchant crew members have been injured or killed during these attacks \u2013 which occur worldwide, but have been concentrated mostly off the eastern coast of Africa. It is estimated that close to $150 million in ransom money was paid in 2008 to pirates who were operating primarily in the Gulf of Aden. The International Maritime Bureau (IMB) reported that there were 293 pirate attacks against ships worldwide in 2008, compared with 263 attacks in 2007. There were 49 ship hijackings in 2008, a 200 percent increase over 2007 \u2013 again, according to the IMB \u2014 with 898 crew members taken hostage.\n\nMost of the hijackings reported worldwide in the past several years were concentrated in the Gulf of Aden. However, many maritime-security experts, including at least some senior IMB officials, believe that the number of attacks and incidents reported represents only about one-fifth to one-third of the actual attacks that took place worldwide. Yacht crews and the owners of small cruising vessels also have reported an increase in attacks and violence against their vessels off the coasts of Central and South America; many of those attacks were not reported to the IMB.\n\nThere are very few groups of mariners who are immune to pirate attacks. Pirates can strike virtually anywhere, at any time, and against almost any target (except for armed naval vessels). In recent months various bands of pirates have been targeting large commercial vessels \u2013 e.g., container ships, bulk cargo carriers, oil and chemical tankers, and cruise ships \u2013 as well as the mega-yachts. Most pirate attacks against ships underway take place during daylight hours, but attacks against ships anchored or moored usually take place during the night. Significantly, most of the attacks that were reported had at least one thing in common: The crews of the ships being attacked did not realize they were under attack until the attack was in progress.\n\nUnlike the crews of merchant ships in the times of the Barbary Corsairs, those who man today's merchant ships have a variety of technologies and systems available to help improve their situational awareness. With early-warning equipment and vigilant crews, most attacks could be prevented. There are numerous types of electronic systems \u2014 long-range cameras, for example, as well as surface-search radars and access-control systems \u2014 available to diminish the pirate threat.\n\nVigilance, Training, and Modern Equipment\nCrew vigilance and training also are essential to halting or at least diminishing the number of additional pirate attacks in the future. Unfortunately, most merchant crews are not properly trained on threat recognition, and also do not know how to cope with pirate attacks and boardings. Moreover, many vessels do not have emergency plans in place to deal with attempted attacks and boardings. However, first-hand accounts of recent pirate attacks (and attempted attacks) show that trained and prepared crews that are equipped with early-warning systems have usually been able to prevent attacks and hijackings. (The IMB does not keep statistics on how, precisely, various attacks were prevented; that information is available only by reading individual attack reports and by interviewing crew members).\n\nNot incidentally, many if not all maritime-security experts believe the piracy attacks are not a problem that should be assigned to naval forces but, rather, a law-enforcement problem that requires action by law-enforcement agencies. In fact, most of the world's navies have no \"rules of engagement\" covering piracy incidents and typically release pirates after they have been captured. Only recently, in fact, has the United States itself signed an agreement (with an unnamed country in the Gulf area) to prosecute pirates. After that agreement is ready to be fully implemented, it is expected that the U.S. Navy will change its rules of engagement and permit its ships to pursue and arrest pirates in the Gulf of Aden.\n\nSome shipping industry experts nonetheless believe that the continued attacks on merchant vessels will soon have an adverse worldwide economic impact because of increased insurance costs, the increased operational costs incurring by avoiding certain areas, and higher security costs in general. Meanwhile, because of the major increase in pirate attacks that has occurred in recent year, more than 20 countries already have stationed armed naval vessels in the Gulf of Aden, and have achieved some minor successes in reducing piracy in that area.\n\nHowever, the naval vessels on the scene report to no central command and\/or coordination center. The crews of the Navy ships speak different languages, of course, so a coordinated response is difficult to achieve, which means that most merchant ships and their crews may still have to defend themselves from future attacks. Statistics developed from accounts of previous attacks show, fortunately, that the combination of situational awareness, improved technology, and well trained crew members will help merchant vessels worldwide cope much more successfully in the future with the threat posed by international piracy.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has been working on a common port-access credential since 2003. That credential \u2014 the Transportation Workers Identification Card (TWIC) \u2014 is a biometric ID card that allows authorized personnel access to the secure and restricted areas of a port, regulated facility, or regulated vessel.\n\nDevelopment of a common-access ID for port workers was required by the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) of 2002. The MTSA regulations establish responsibility for the overall program as well as enforcement and application requirements. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was given the authority, and responsibility, both for establishing the program and for the overall enrollment process \u2014 including the background checks required and distribution of the TWIC.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard has the responsibility for enforcement. The over-arching objective of the TWIC program is to improve security in U.S. ports through use of a common ID card and background checks valid for entry into any U.S. port. The TWIC does not automatically grant the user access to any specific port, facility, or vessel. The card holder must have access permission granted from the facility itself or from a vessel security officer.\n\nUnforeseen Delays in Compliance, Implementation\nThe program was scheduled to be implemented in ports across the United States last summer. However, unforeseen delays pushed the compliance dates into 2009. The first ports actually came online, though \u2013 as did enforcement of the program \u2014 in late 2008. The majority of ports along the east coast of the United States are now actively participating in the TWIC program \u2014 this means that anyone seeking unescorted access to secure areas of those ports must possess the TWIC credentials. If a person seeks access and he or she does not possess a TWIC, that person can be escorted by a TWIC holder.\n\nThe Coast Guard has reported that TWIC implementation has continued with very few problems encountered in ports and terminals around the country. Two terminals on the Miami River in Miami, Florida, were closed for a brief period of time, but the problems leading to the closure were quickly resolved.\n\nThe TWIC program has met resistance, though, from at least some trucking companies and from the longshoremen's unions. The Co-Chair of the Longshore Workers Coalition, Leonard Riley, said he is concerned about transportation workers being denied access to the piers they are working. \"We are concerned about the implementation of the TWIC program,\" he said. \"The Longshore workers and truck drivers don't feel like they have been included as \u2026 stake holders in this process. Several people have lost their opportunity to work in the ports because of the TWIC. The Longshore workers feel like they are being treated as terrorists rather than partners.\"\n\nTSA officials reported that 34,240 disqualification letters had been issued as of 15 March, but also pointed out that, when the agency's adjudication process had been completed, there was a total of only 125 final disqualifications. TSA has issued close to one million cards to date and expects that number to double in the next couple of years.\n\nA Broad Range of Mandatory Participants\nThere are a number of people who will be required to possess a TWIC. Anyone who requires unescorted access to the secure areas of ports and port facilities is required to possess a TWIC. The TWIC program also is expected to have a substantial impact on the recreational boating, yachting, commercial fishing, and diving communities. All credentialed U.S. merchant mariners will be required to obtain a TWIC, whether or not they access a port. The TWIC implementation rules apply to anyone holding a Coast Guard-issued merchant mariners license, merchant mariner document, or certificate of registry. All ship security officers (SSOs) on MTSA-regulated vessels also will be required to obtain TWIC credentials.\n\nThere are a number of federal, state, and local agency personnel who are exempt from the TWIC program while they are acting in an official capacity. The largest exemption covers law-enforcement and public-safety agencies, including police departments and fire departments. However, a public-safety employee is not exempt if he or she holds a captain's license as part of his\/her official duties. The full list of exempted personnel and agencies is posted on the TSA website.\n\nMore Than a Few Simple Bits of Complexity\nEnforcement of the TWIC program is carried out primarily by biometric readers specifically designed to permit law-enforcement and security personnel to positively identify and match the card with the holder. The National Maritime Security Advisory Council (NMSAC), working with TSA, invited key security-technology industry personnel to meet and work with government officials on the TWIC program and help them define the technological requirements for the biometric readers.\n\nThe requirements for the TWIC are in fact significantly different from those used for most other proximity-type cards, primarily because the government is dealing with personnel data. The TWIC \"isn't a simple flash-pass,\" said Consuelo Bangs, Senior Program Manager at Sagem Morpho Inc. (one of several companies involved in development of the biometric-reader technology). \"It has the ability to pass over 27,000 bits of data securely between the card and the reader, while normal proximity cards pass [only] 26 bits of data. Most of the [TWIC] data \u2026 [consists of] the security encryption key and digital security that make it almost impossible to counterfeit and pirate information from the card.\"\n\nThe biometric-reader technology companies are operating in accordance with the federal information processing standard (FIPS) 201. The FIPS 201 standard defines not only how the card and readers are designed but also how the information can be passed between them. There are several pilot study programs ongoing at various ports around the country focusing on, among other things, the effect the TWIC program has on throughput and commerce. There is still a lot of other work continuing with the biometric-reader program. The Coast Guard has not yet set a firm date when the biometric readers will be fully ready, but is continuing to work with the companies already involved in development of the biometric-reader technology.\n\nThe port is one of the more challenging \u2013 i.e., dangerous \u2014 work environments in countries throughout the world. The goal of each port is to move cargo and passengers in and out as efficiently and safely as possible. By their very nature, ports present unique challenges for law-enforcement and fire-rescue agencies from concurrent jurisdictions. Most of the larger ports within the United States have their own internal fire and police departments, but require outside assistance during mass-casualty events or other major disasters. Those critical resources will almost always come from the police and fire departments in cities, towns, and other jurisdictions relatively close to the ports.\n\nCaptain James Maes, USCG (Ret.), is the director of Port Services for ABS Consulting. Before working for ABS he was the Coast Guard's Captain of the Port for Sector Miami and also the director of safety and security for the Port of Miami. He points out that there are three key prerequisites to successfully responding to port incidents: (1) Developing an effective plan; (2) Testing the plan through drills and exercises; and (3) Incorporating into the plan the essential \"lessons learned\" from the drills and exercises. \"Any plan worth having is a plan worth exercising,\" Maes comments. \"The public-safety agencies, port tenants, and federal agencies all have different plans so it is important to exercise those plans to understand how the separate plans work together.\"\n\nAn effective emergency-response plan will not necessarily address each and every possible aspect of a particular situation, but it is nonetheless important to have a fairly comprehensive response plan in place to understand how the various agencies from neighboring jurisdictions are going to work together in the event of a true large-scale emergency. \"It is also a good idea for the agencies that surround the port to become familiar with the port and maritime environment before an incident,\" Maes says. \"Training and exercises expose responders to potential situations they may encounter during an incident. The training helps responders understand how to get out of a potentially dangerous situation.\"\n\nPeople and Cargo \u2013 a Lethal Mix\nMany ports house not only all types of cargo \u2014 including hazardous chemicals and fuel \u2013 but also handle large numbers of cruise passengers. Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, for example \u2014 which does handle both hazardous cargo and fuel \u2014 is the largest cruise port in the world. \"There are a lot of things to consider and understand before responding to an incident in the port,\" says Chief Dan Cummings of the Broward County Sheriff's Office, which is responsible for law enforcement in Port Everglades. Cummings says he must always consider how the law-enforcement actions are going to affect the local community. \"We shut the port down for over 12 hours\" after the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, he recalls. However, gas stations along the Florida Turnpike \"were running out of fuel, so we had a find a way to safely get fuel moving again.\"\n\nPort Everglades is bordered by three different cities in Broward County \u2014 Hollywood, Fort Lauderdale, and Dania Beach. \"It is important that we understand the response capabilities of our surrounding agencies,\" Cummings points out. For that reason, he continues, \"We hold monthly meetings at the port with the surrounding agencies, port tenants, federal agencies, and the port director to discuss what is going on in the port.\" The meetings not only help in the planning process, but also serve as \"a way for people from the different agencies to get to know each other.\"\n\nWhen there is a port incident that requires help from neighboring response agencies, Cummings must immediately consider not only how to maintain the flow of people and vehicles into and outside of the port but also where to set up a large-scale staging area with a reliable official on the scene to keep track of: (a) what agencies are at the staging area; and (b) the capabilities of those agencies. \"We have had incidents in the past,\" he points out, \"with multiple agencies responding where everyone tries to get as close to the situation as possible and then leaves their vehicles in the way \u2014 blocking additional response units and [other] traffic.\"\n\nCummings and Maes agree that multi-agency planning, training, and effective communications are the key to successfully responding to port incidents. \"Training helps responders understand how the plans and people are going to work together during an actual situation,\" Maes says. \"During any incident,\" Cummings adds, \"it is important to establish good communication with the different responding agencies and also the news media\" \u2013 which, he points out, serve as \"an important link to quickly get information out to the local community.\"\n\nToday, fortunately, most U.S. ports have in place, and have exercised, fairly comprehensive response plans that define the roles and capabilities of all of the agencies likely to work with one another in a large-scale incident in and\/or affecting the port, but it is still important for the surrounding communities to continue to be involved in planning and training for any future incidents that might occur.\n\nThe Coast Guard faces numerous challenges in protecting the U.S. maritime domain, a task which has always been more difficult than it should be \u2014 mostly because the multi-mission service historically has been both under-manned and under-funded. In recent years, though, the funding stream has been both larger and more predictable, giving the service the opportunity to develop closer relationships, and working partnerships, with local and state law-enforcement and fire-rescue response agencies. The principal Coast Guard goal in forging those partnerships is to improve its own maritime domain awareness and response capabilities, with local stakeholders making greater contributions than ever before.\n\nFor operational purposes, the Coast Guard's local Captains of the Port (COTPs) are designated as the primary security coordinators, and on-scene coordinators for security-related incidents, within their respective zones. However, the Coast Guard also relies on the local agencies, more often than ever before, to handle the bulk of the primary response duties.\n\n\"The Coast Guard works with local and state agencies on a daily basis to reduce all hazards and threats to the homeland through the maritime sector,\" said Commander Brian Gove, the service's chief of prevention for Sector Miami. \"We rely on the local and state agencies to be the eyes and ears on the water because there are numerous local agencies working within a single COTP Port Zone. In some cases the local agencies can respond to incidents much more quickly than the Coast Guard [is able to].\"\n\nA Three-Pronged Modernization & Upgrade Program\nThe Coast Guard is currently going through a long-term service-wide modernization program to improve its command, control, communications, and response capabilities. More specifically, it is continuing to: (a) modernize its cutter and aircraft fleets through what is called the Deepwater program; (b) improve its communications and response capabilities through the Rescue 21 program; and (c) coordinate and expand its overall response capabilities through working relationships with such groups as the Area Maritime Security Committees (AMSCs).\n\n\"The Coast Guard, through the AMSCs, continues to work with local, state, federal, and industry stakeholders to develop risk-management plans \u2026 [as well as] business- resumption and continuity plans that \u2026 [reduce] maritime risk,\" Gove continues. The COTP chairs the local AMSC, but most members of the committee come from local, state, and federal response agencies, port authorities, and local stakeholders, including businessmen.\n\nLocal and state agencies, and qualified maritime businesses, are eligible for port-security grant funds to help establish and operate the security programs needed to mitigate risk and improve response capabilities within local port areas. The Coast Guard awarded $388 million in port-security grant funds in fiscal year 2009, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, signed into law earlier this year, provided an additional $150 million in supplemental funding for port security.\n\nThe Port Security Grant funds are primarily intended to assist ports in enhancing maritime-domain awareness, according to Gove, but they also are used to develop and improve the risk-management capabilities needed \"to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from [terrorist] attacks.\" The grant program is expected to be funded at or near the same level next year so that the recent-year improvements in port security, response, and recovery will continue at much the same pace.\n\nRescue 21 Plus TWICs & Data Fusion = A Full Plate\nThe previously mentioned Rescue 21 program modernization also will continue to improve the Coast Guard's ability not only to respond to emergencies but also to enhance the service's ability to carry out its equally important law-enforcement, marine-safety, environmental-protection, and homeland-security missions. \"Rescue 21 has enabled the Coast Guard to determine the location of any VHF transmission that lasts longer than one second,\" Gove commented. That capability \"significantly reduces the time it takes for our search-and-rescue assets to locate those in distress, greatly increasing the rate of successful rescues,\" he continued. \"Rescue 21 meets the communication standards that enable the Coast Guard's interoperability with other federal, state, and local public-safety organizations and improves our command-and-control capabilities.\"\n\nThe Coast Guard also will continue to work next year, as fast as possible under difficult circumstances, on implementation of the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) program. According to the Department of Homeland Security's Transportation Security Administration, 1.4 million people are already enrolled in the TWIC program, and over 1.2 million TWIC's have been issued. The Coast Guard is working assiduously both on the somewhat complicated TWIC implementation regulations and on an acceptable standard for the biometric readers used in the program to help improve overall port security in general and, more particularly, to control access to sensitive areas of the port such as those where toxic chemicals are loaded or unloaded.\n\nAdding to the USCG's already full plate of duties and responsibilities is the fact that new \"data fusion centers\" are rapidly expanding throughout the United States to help improve data and intelligence sharing between and among federal, state, and local law-enforcement and emergency-response agencies. The primary objective of the 70 fusion centers already operational is to share data and analyze intelligence. Because the real goal is to improve the protection of the U.S. homeland, the centers do not focus exclusively on maritime issues but also on many other aspects of homeland security. Like many other agencies, organizations, and operational units formed since the 9\/11 terrorist attacks, the fusion centers were established primarily to provide the intelligence and analyses needed to improve U.S. law-enforcement capabilities in general and thereby protect not only U.S. port and coastal areas but the American homeland as a whole.\n\nThe Coast Guard requested $9.95 billion in fiscal year 2010 for its operations and modernization budget. Assuming that all or most of that request is approved, the service's modernization efforts will undoubtedly continue to improve for the foreseeable future, as will its response and readiness capabilities \u2013 but so will the already long list of Coast Guard duties and responsibilities."}

Intelligence indicated that the Italian fleet would attempt to attack at some point. The heavy escort of Royal Navy ships was therefore somewhat prepared when on the afternoon of 22nd March 1942 'a thin wisp of smoke' appeared on the horizon. Frank Gregory-Smith records that he felt curiously relaxed at this point, even though the next more detailed report suggested they faced three battleships. As a matter of routine they could also expect to come under air attack from both bombers and torpedo bombers.\n\nVice Admiral Vian had prepared a plan that involved shielding the convoy with some of his force of destroyers, whilst constantly threatening the Italian fleet with a torpedo attack from other destroyers \u2013 a plan that very largely succeeded.\n\nCaptain Frank Gregory-Smith was on HMS Eridge:\n\nA series of flashes in the smoke followed by a dull, rumbling boom announced the opening of the surface engagement. As if this was a signal, a formation of torpedo bombers flew into sight, skimming just above the sea. Simultaneously an even larger group of high level bombers were briefly glimpsed through the smoke and clouds on the opposite side of the convoy. Escorts to port and astem of the convoy immediately engaged the high formation, leaving the torpedo bombers to HMS Southwold, HMS Dulverton and HMS Eridge.\n\nThe ship shuddered under the opening salvoes and high explosive started to burst around the low flying aircraft. Their crews, obviously surprised by such a heavy concentration from so few ships, promptly split into smaller groups and tried to penetrate the screen on a broader front. Even then gunfire continued to harass them, forcing them into individual units which dropped their torpedoes haphazardly and at such long range that all ships had time to tum towards their tracks, just as bombs from the high formation exploded in a compact mass well astern of the supply ships.\n\nMeanwhile, the two surface forces, exchanging rapid fire as they rolled, twisted and plunged through the heavy seas, were closing at a relative speed of fifty knots. The British were already partially hidden by smoke, which the Italians would have to penetrate if they were to get within range of the supply ships. Just before reaching effective gun range, the Italian Admiral swung his ships to port. To prevent him stealing the weather gauge, the British followed his movements and stretched at high speed eastwards.\n\nOn this course, British smoke drifted rapidly to leeward and, when its outer fringes reached the Italians, their Admiral, fearing a torpedo attack, edged his ships further to port. But the smoke still thickened around his ships, harassing them until the Italian Admiral suddenly lost his nerve and swung his cruisers, followed by a division of destroyers which had unexpectedly appeared astem, in a broad sweep to the northward. Rear Admiral Vian held on until satisfied that the enemy\nwas definitely retiring and then turned towards the convoy; some twenty miles to the south-westward.\n\nA bare chested ammunition supply party bringing up shells for the 5.25 inch guns, during a lull in the action, on board HMS EURYALUS, on convoy duty in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nThe Italian battleship Littorio outranged and outgunned all of the Royal Navy ships but dared not penetrate the British smokescreen. When darkness fell, without radar, she was forced to withdraw.\n\nIt was not all over. A very short time later another force appeared. Captain Eric Bush was in command of HMS Euryalus:\n\nThe enemy, as we know now, was in two groups at this stage, the nearer, about nine miles away, consisting ofthe two eight-inch and one six-inch cruisers and four destroyers we had met before, and the second group, at a distance of fifteen miles, comprising the modern battleship Littorio and four destroyers. We were in for something now, all right! I knew that Admiral Vian would never leave the convoy to its fate, so if needs be we would be fighting to the end.\n\nIn the next two hours the fate of our whole force was in the balance. With the powerful ships at his disposal the Italian admiral could easily have wiped us out, but he could not bring himself to enter the smoke-screen knowing that we were waiting for him on the other side"}

{"text":"Aeneas Lionel Acton Mackintosh (1 July1879 \u2013 8 May1916) was a British Merchant Navy officer and Antarctic\nexplorer who was a member of two of Sir Ernest Shackleton's\nexpeditions: the Nimrod Expedition (1907\u201309) and the Imperial Trans-Antarctic\nExpedition (1914\u201317). He was second officer on Nimrod, later transferring to the shore party, but his\ninvolvement with the expedition was quickly curtailed when an accident while\nshifting equipment aboard ship destroyed his right eye. Although he was\ninvalided back to New Zealand, his will and determination had impressed\nShackleton. In 1914, Shackleton appointed him to the key position of commander\nof the Ross Sea party, a depot-laying mission in support of the\ntranscontinental crossing during the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition.\n\nThe Ross Sea party was dogged with organizational difficulties and\nmisfortunes, which tested Mackintosh up to and beyond the limits of his\ncapacity. In the later stages of the main depot-laying journey on the Great Ice Barrier, he was overcome both physically and\nmentally, and yielded the effective leadership of the party to his subordinate,\nErnest Joyce\u2014but not before he had ensured that all of the\nrequired depots had been laid. Close to death from scurvy and exhaustion, he\nwas brought to safety by the combined efforts of Joyce, Ernest\nWild and Dick Richards. On recovery, however, he rashly\nattempted to walk on unsafe pack ice from Hut Point to the party's main base at Cape\nEvans, a distance of 13 miles (21 km), and disappeared during a blizzard,\ntogether with a companion, Victor Hayward.\n\nDue to lack of groundwork in Australia, and financial restrictions imposed\nby Shackleton, the Ross Sea venture began late and in a state of some\nconfusion[1] which,\nfairly or otherwise, reflected on Mackintosh's perceived leadership\ncapabilities. He apparently lacked the skills for dealing with the public or\nthe press,[1] while\nhis traditional, hierarchical style of command and aloof manner failed to\nestablish good relations with most of his men.[2] Chroniclers have further described him as \"haphazard\", and as\n\"erratic and accident-prone\".[3][4] On the other hand he\nhas been acknowledged by Lord Shackleton, the explorer's son, as one of the\nheroes of the expedition, together with Joyce and Richards.[5] Shackleton himself wrote of Mackintosh's iron\nwill, adding that he had \"died for his country as surely as any who gave up\ntheir lives on the fields of France or Flanders\".[6]\n\nMcMurdo Sound, frozen over. Mackintosh\nand Hayward set out on 8 May1916 from Hut Point (A), intending to walk\nacross the ice to Cape Evans (B). They disappeared in the area indicated\nas C; no trace of them was ever found.\n\nEarly life\n\nMackintosh was born in Tirhut, India, on 1 July1879.[7] He was one of six\nchildren (five sons and a daughter) of a Scottish indigo planter, Alexander\nMackintosh, who was descended from the chieftains of Clan Chattan. Aeneas would in due course be named\nas an heir to the chieftainship, and to the ancient manor at Inverness\nthat went with it.[3] His privileged expatriate background may explain some of the\ndifficulties he would experience later in dealing with subordinates\u2014his friend\nand contemporary Antarctic captain John King Davis referred to him as a \"sahib\".[8] When his mother, Annie Mackintosh, suddenly\nreturned to England, she brought the children with her, and the father\nthereafter disappears from the family story.[3] Back in England\nMackintosh attended Bedford Modern School. He then followed the same\npath as had Shackleton five years earlier, leaving school aged 15 to go to sea.\nAfter serving a tough Merchant Officer's apprenticeship[3] he joined the\nP and O Line,\nremaining with this company until recruited by Shackleton in 1907. He was\ncommissioned Sub-Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve in 1908.[9]\n\nNimrod Expedition\n\nThe Nimrod Expedition, 1907\u20131909, was the first of three\nAntarctic expeditions led by Ernest Shackleton. The purpose of the expedition\nwas, as stated by Shackleton, to \"proceed to the Ross Quadrant of the Antarctic\nwith a view to reaching the Geographical South\nPole and the South Magnetic Pole\".[10] It is not recorded how or where Shackleton and Mackintosh first\nmet, or how the latter's appointment as Nimrod's second officer was arranged.\nIt appears, however, that Mackintosh soon earned Shackleton's confidence, and\nimpressed others with, among other qualities, his will and\ndetermination.[11] While\nNimrod was in New Zealand prior to the journey south, Shackleton added\nMackintosh to the shore party.\n\nAccident\n\nOn 31 January1908, not long after Nimrod's arrival in the Antarctic,\nMackintosh was assisting in the transfer of sledging gear aboard ship when a\nhook swung across the deck and struck his right eye, virtually destroying it.\nHe was immediately taken to the captain's cabin where, later that day,\nexpedition doctor Eric Marshall operated to remove the eye, using\npartly improvised surgical equipment.[12]\nMarshall was deeply impressed by his fortitude.[11] This accident cost Mackintosh\nhis place on the shore party, since it required his return to New Zealand for\nfurther treatment. Mackintosh therefore took no part in the main events of the\nexpedition, but he came back south with Nimrod in January 1909, to participate\nin its closing stages.[13]\n\nLost on the ice\n\nOn 1\nJanuary1909 Nimrod, on its return trip south, was stopped by the ice, still\n25 miles (40 km) from the expedition's shore base at Cape\nRoyds. Mackintosh decided that he would lead a party in a march across the\nice, to carry the mails ashore. Thus began what polar historian Beau Riffenburgh describes as \"one of the most\nill-considered parts of the entire expedition\".[14]\n\nThe party, which left the ship on the morning of 3 January,\nconsisted of Mackintosh and three sailors, with a sledge containing supplies\nand a large postbag. Two sailors quickly returned to the ship, while Mackintosh\nand a companion went forward. They camped on the ice that evening, only to find\nnext day that the whole area around them had broken up.[14] After a desperate\ndash over the moving floes they managed to reach a small glacier tongue,\nwhere they camped and waited for several days for their snow-blindness to subside. When their sight returned, they\nfound that Cape Royds was visible, but the sea-ice leading to it had gone.\nAfter a further wait, they decided to make for the hut by land, an extremely\ndangerous undertaking given their complete lack of experience and\nequipment.[15]\n\nOn 11 January they set out. The next 48 hours involved a\nterrifying struggle over the hostile terrain, through regions of deep crevasses\nand treacherous snowfields. They soon parted company with all their equipment\nand supplies.[14] At one point, in order to proceed, they had to ascend to 3,000 feet\n(910 m) and then slide to the foot of a snow-slope. It was only after another\n24 hours of stumbling around in the fog that, by chance, they blundered into\nBernard Day, a member of the shore party, a short distance from the\nhut.[14] The\nship later recovered the abandoned postbag. There are pre-echoes in this\nescapade of Mackintosh's fatal ice-walk, seven years later. John King Davis[16]\nremarked: \"Mackintosh was always the man to take the hundredth chance. This\ntime he got away with it.\"[17]\n\nUndeterred by his ordeal, Mackintosh soon joined Ernest Joyce and others on\na journey across the Great Ice Barrier to Minna\nBluff, to lay a depot for Shackleton.[14] On 3 March, while\npacing the deck of Aurora, Mackintosh observed a flare from the direction of\nHut Point,[18] which signalled the arrival\nof Shackleton's southern party, returned from their record trek to\n88\u00b023'S.[19]\n\nBetween expeditions\n\nMap of Cocos Island in the Pacific Ocean, where Mackintosh searched for treasure in\n1911\n\nMackintosh returned to England in June 1909. On reporting to the P & O,\nhe was informed that due to his impaired sight he was discharged. This left him\nat something of a loose end, and he agreed, early in 1910, to accompany\nDouglas Mawson[20] on\na trip to Hungary, to survey a potential goldfield which Shackleton was hoping\nwould form the basis of a lucrative business venture.[21] Despite a promising report from Mawson nothing came of this.\nMackintosh later launched his own treasure-hunting expedition to Cocos\nIsland off the Panama Pacific coast, but again returned home\nempty-handed.[3]\n\nIn February 1912 Mackintosh married Gladys Campbell, and settled into an\noffice job as assistant secretary to the Imperial Merchant Service\nGuild[3] in\nLiverpool. He was, however, dissatisfied. He expressed his\nlatent Antarctic ambitions to a former colleague: \"I always feel I never\ncompleted my first initiation\u2014so would like to have one final wallow, for good\nor bad!\"[3]\n\nRoss Sea party\n\nEarly difficulties\n\nMembers of the Ross sea party,\nphotographed in Australia. Mackintosh is seated in the middle row, third from\nleft. Ernest Joyce is standing, extreme left, back row. Arnold Spencer-Smith is the tall figure, centre back\nrow.\n\nMackintosh readily accepted Shackleton's invitation to join the Imperial\nTrans-Antarctic Expedition, originally as one of the party that would make the\ntranscontinental crossing from the Weddell Sea.[22] However, he was appointed to captain the support vessel Aurora and to lead the Ross Sea party, after another Nimrod\nstalwart, Eric Marshall, had turned the assignment down.[23] The Ross Sea party's task was to lay a series of depots\nacross the Great Ice Barrier, to support the cross-continental party in the\nlater stages of its journey. Shackleton considered this to be a routine\nassignment.[24]\n\nMackintosh arrived in Australia in November 1914 to take up his duties, and\nwas immediately faced with major problems. Without warning, Shackleton had cut\nthe Ross Sea party's allocated funds from \u00a32,000 (2008 equivalent about\n\u00a380,000) to \u00a31,000; Mackintosh was instructed to \"get whatever you can free as\ngifts\",[25] and to\nmortgage the expedition's ship to raise further money. It then emerged that the\npurchase of Aurora had not been properly completed, which delayed Mackintosh's\nattempts to mortgage it.[25] Worse, Aurora was quite unfit for Antarctic work without an\nextensive overhaul, which required co-operation from an exasperated Australian Government.[25] The tasks of dealing\nwith these difficulties within a very restricted timescale caused Mackintosh\ngreat anxiety, and the ensuing muddles together with public relations failures\ncaused \"an unpleasant feeling with regard to the Expedition\" among the\nAustralian public.[26] Recruiting a full\ncomplement of crew and scientific staff was also problematic, many of the\nappointments being last-minute affairs leaving the party critically short of\nAntarctic experience.[27]\n\nDepot-laying, first season\n\nAurora finally left Hobart, Tasmania, on 24\nDecember1914, and reached McMurdo Sound on 16 January1915,\nestablishing its base at Captain Scott's old headquarters at Cape\nEvans.[28] Mackintosh was determined\nthat sledging work should begin at once, with supply depots being laid at 79\u00b0\nand 80\u00b0S\u2014he believed it possible that Shackleton would attempt a crossing in\nthat first season. Ernest Joyce, the expedition's only seasoned Antarctic\ntraveller,[29] protested that men and dogs\nneeded time for acclimatization and training, but was overruled.[30] The depot-laying journey which followed, led\nby Mackintosh during January to March 1915, was a series of mishaps which\nlargely justified Joyce's fears. A blizzard delayed their start,[31] a motor sledge\nbroke down after a few miles,[32] and\nMackintosh and his party lost their way on the sea ice.[31] Most of the stores\ntaken on to the Barrier did not reach the two depots, being dumped on the ice\nto reduce loads.[33] After Mackintosh\ninsisted on taking the dogs all the way to 80\u00b0S\u2014over Joyce's urgent\nprotests\u2014all died on the return journey.[34] The men, frostbitten and exhausted, reached Hut Point on 24 March, cut\noff from the ship and from their Cape Evans base by unsafe sea ice.[35] After this experience confidence in\nMackintosh's leadership was low, and bickering rife.[36]\n\nLoss of Aurora\n\nWhen Mackintosh and the Hut Point party finally arrived back at Cape Evans\nfrom Hut in mid-June, they were confronted with a new crisis: Aurora, with its\ncrew of 18 and most of the shore party's supplies and equipment, had been torn\nloose from its moorings on 7 May and been forced out to sea.[37] The condition of the sea ice and the oncoming winter made its\nreturn improbable.[38] On 26 June\nMackintosh gathered the marooned party of 10 together and summarised their\nsituation. In the absence of the ship their task now would be to salvage all\nusable supplies left over from Scott's \"lavish\" expedition,[39] improvise clothing and equipment from Scott's\nabandoned materials, and equip themselves as best they could for next season's\ndepot-laying journeys. It would, according to Mackintosh, require \"a\nrecord-breaking feat of polar travel to accomplish their mission\".[40] The entire ten-man\nparty pledged their unreserved support to this effort,[40] and Joyce,\nnormally Mackintosh's sharpest critic, recorded that \"the Captain was going\ngreat guns, stimulating us all, keeping us cheerful and bright\".[41]\n\nDepot-laying, second season\n\nThe long 1915\u201316 depot-laying mission began in September 1915. One man was\nrequired to stay at Cape Evans and watch for the ship, as the other nine began\nhauling stores on to the Barrier. One team of three men returned to base after\nan equipment failure while the other six men, under Mackintosh, carried out the\nfinal stage of the mission\u2014a line of depots between 80\u00b0S and the Beardmore\nGlacier. By January 1916 Mackintosh's health was deteriorating, as he showed\nthe first signs of scurvy, but he was still insistent that his duty was to see\npersonally that every depot was laid. Arnold Spencer-Smith, the expedition's chaplain and\nphotographer, had meanwhile collapsed and became a passenger,[42] but Mackintosh, in a\ndemonstration of what Shackleton called his \"will of iron\",[43] refused the suggestion that\nhe should remain with the invalid while the others went forward.[43] The last of the depots, at\nMount Hope near the foot of the glacier at 83\u00b045'S, was placed\non 26\nJanuary1916.[42]\n\nSpencer-Smith and Mackintosh being hauled\non the sledge\n\nOn the homeward march Spencer-Smith had to be drawn on the sledge.\nMackintosh, unable to pull, staggered alongside,[44] the safe return of the party now in the hands of Joyce. As the\neffects of his scurvy developed, Mackintosh was forced, from time to time, to\njoin Spencer-Smith as a passenger on the sledge. As they proceeded northward\ntowards safety, even the four fittest\u2014Joyce, Ernest\nWild, Dick Richards and Victor Hayward\u2014were all suffering from frostbite,\nsnow-blindness and incipient scurvy. Close to the safety of Hut Point,\nSpencer-Smith died on 9 March.[42]\n\nRichards, Wild and Joyce struggled on to Hut Point with the now stricken\nHayward, leaving Mackintosh alone in the tent until they were able to return\nfor him. By 18 March all five survivors were back at Hut Point, having\ncarried out Shackleton's orders in full.[42][45]\n\nDisappearance\n\nThe frozen waters of McMurdo Sound, where\nMackintosh and Hayward disappeared in May 1916. The Delbridge Islands, which\nwere searched during the following summer, are clearly visible.\n\nWith the help of fresh seal meat the survivors slowly recuperated. They were\nunable to complete the journey to the Cape Evans base because of the unstable\ncondition of the sea ice.[46] Conditions at Hut Point were gloomy and depressing, with an\nunrelieved diet of seal, and no normal comforts.[46] Mackintosh in\nparticular found the squalor of the hut intolerable, and dreaded the\npossibility that, caught at Hut Point, they might miss the return of the\nship.[47] After a few days' reconnaissance\nwith Hayward, Mackintosh announced, on 8 May1916, that he and\nHayward were prepared to risk the ice,[48]\nand against the urgent advice of their comrades they set off carrying only\nlight supplies.[49]\nShortly after they had moved out of sight of Hut Point a severe blizzard\ndeveloped which lasted for two days. When it subsided, Joyce and Richards\nfollowed the still visible footmarks on the ice up to a large crack, where the\ntracks stopped.[49]\nNeither Mackintosh nor Hayward arrived at Cape Evans and no trace of either was\never found, despite extensive searches carried out by Joyce after he, Richards\nand Wild finally managed to reach Cape Evans in June.[50] Searches for the bodies continued, even after the arrival of\nAurora in January 1917 brought relief to the party.[51] All the indications were that Mackintosh and Hayward had\neither fallen through the ice, or that the ice on which they had been walking\nhad been blown out to sea during the blizzard.[49]\n\nReputation\n\nMackintosh's own expedition diaries, which cover the period up to 30\nSeptember1915, have not been published; they are held by the Scott Polar Research Institute.[52] The two main sources available to Ross Sea\nparty historians are Joyce's diaries, published in 1929 as The South Polar\nTrail, and the account of Richard W Richards: The Ross Sea Shore Party 1914\u201317.\nMackintosh's reputation is not well-served by either, particularly Joyce's\npartisan record, described by one commentator as his \"self-aggrandizing\nepic\".[53]\nJoyce is generally scathing about Mackintosh's leadership: \"I never in my\nexperience came across such an idiot in charge of men\", he wrote in one diary\nentry.[54] Richards's account is much\nshorter and more straightforward, but decades later, when he was the only\nmember of the expedition still alive (he died in 1985, aged 91), he claimed\nthat Mackintosh on the depot-laying march was \"tremendously pathetic\", had\n\"lost his nerve completely\", and that the fatal ice walk was \"suicide\".[55]\n\nFour of the survivors from the Ross Sea\nparty: (l to r) Irvine Gaze, Ernest Joyce (seated), Keith Jack, and Dick\nRichards. The dogs are Oscar, Gunner, and Towser.\n\nThe ignominious circumstances of Mackintosh's death appear to justify the\nimpression of impetuousness and incompetence usually given in expedition\nhistories.[56] This generally negative\nview of him was not, however, unanimous among his comrades. Alexander Stevens,\nwho had travelled with the Ross Sea party as chief scientist, found Mackintosh\n\"steadfast and reliable\", and believed that the Ross Sea party would have\nachieved much less, but for Mackintosh's unwearying drive.[53] John King Davis,\ntoo, admired Mackintosh's dedication and called the depot-laying journey a\n\"magnificent achievement\".[53]\n\nShackleton was equivocal. In South he acknowledges that Mackintosh and his\nmen achieved their object, praises the party's qualities of endurance and\nself-sacrifice, and asserts that Mackintosh died for his country.[57] On the other hand, in a letter home he is\nhighly critical: \"Mackintosh seemed to have no idea of discipline or\norganisation ...\".[58] Shackleton did,\nhowever, donate part of the proceeds from a short New Zealand lecture tour to\nassist the Mackintosh family.[59]\n\nMackintosh had two daughters, the second born while he was in Australia\nawaiting the Aurora's departure.[3] On the return Barrier\njourney in February 1916, expecting to die, he wrote a poignant farewell\nmessage, with echoes of Captain Scott. The message concludes: \"If it is God's\nwill that we should have given up our lives then we do so in the British manner\nas our tradition holds us in honour bound to do. Goodbye, friends. I feel sure\nthat my dear wife and children will not be neglected.\"[60] Gladys Mackintosh eventually married Joseph Stenhouse,\nAurora's first officer and later captain, in 1923.[61]\n\n^ Shackleton, who had\nearlier fallen out with the ship's master, Rupert England, wanted Mackintosh to\ncaptain Nimrod on this second voyage south, but his eye injury had not healed\nsufficiently. Riffenburgh, p. 170\n\n^ Tyler-Lewis, pp.\n67\u201368. Joyce, in view of his superior experience, had expected that Mackintosh\nwould defer to him on sledging matters, and was shocked by Mackintosh's\nhierarchical style. \"If I had Shacks here I would make him see my way of\narguing\", the frustrated Joyce wrote in his diary.\n\n^ Joyce, Richards,\nWild and Hayward were all awarded the Albert\nMedal (the last two posthumously) for their attempts to save the lives of\nMackintosh and Spencer-Smith on the ice. In 1952 Richards's award was upgraded\nto that of the George Cross."}
{"text":"(The photo is from the collection of the Brewer family, whose father Geoff, served as a Mid-Shipman on HMS PINK)\n\nShips History\n\nOnce a ship had been built and launched she then had to be out-fitted, and then complete sea trials before being handed over to her new owners,in the case of a ship for the Royal Navy this meant she also had to be commissioned as fit for purpose, once commissioned she was then considered ready for action and would take her place in the fleet.\n\nThe Flower Class Corvette HMS PINK a sister ship to HMS LOTUS was one of the many gallant little fighting ships that were some what over shadowed by there larger more illustrious sister ships during the battle of the Atlantic, these little fighting ships were to help keep the United Kingdom in the war against the Nazi tyranny that was attempting to control the world at the time.\n\nThe small Corvette based on a design that came from a Whale Catching ship not only had to contend with some of the fiercest weather and seas in the world but the ever present danger from U-Boats and from attack by long range German Luftwaffe planes sent out to find the convoys that the Corvettes were tasked with protecting.\n\nHMS PINK was a \"later type design\" than the original Flowers a somewhat improved ship with her forecastle deck running aft to almost midships, this had the effect of more protection for the crew against the elements. Known as a Modified Flower ClassCorvette, she was on escort duty in the North Atlantic as soon as she was ready. She was the final \"Flower Class Corvette\" built at the Leith Shipyards of Henry Robb.\n\nWithin a couple of months she was in the thick of the battle to keep the supply lines to Britain open, and on the 16th of Dec 1942 she was on hand to pick up 7 survivors from the Norwegian tanker Bello that was torpedoed and sunk in the North Atlantic by the German submarine U-610.\n\nThen while on escort duty to convoy ONS-5 with Lt. R. Atkinson, DSC, RNR in command. On May 4th, she had been detached from the convoy to become the only escort of four stragglers. On May 5th, they were 80 miles behind the convoy, when at 1154 AM a positive ASDIC echo was heard (range 2,200 yards). Atkinson, in spite of being short of fuel, decided to attack. The ship run over the target, and dropped 10 depth charges. The second attack was a salvo of 24 HedgeHog projectiles from an estimated range of 250 yards. A thrid attack consisted in another salvo of 10 depth charges, set at 250 and 385 feet. A fourth followed, this time set at 350 and 550 feet. As three large bubbles were seen 500 feet astern, Pink fired again the HedgeHog, but the projectiles failed as they exploded in contact with the sea surface. Then she made the last attack, ten depth charges set at 350, 550 and 700 feet. Fifteen minutes later an explosion was heard, and Atkinson thought he han sunk the sub. He was credited by the Admiralty with a \"Probably Sunk\", but in fact the target, that turned out to be U-358, although very severely damaged, the stricken sub managed to make it back to base.\n\nMeanwhile, another u-boat, U-584, sunk the American merchant West Madaket that was under HMS PINK's protection, so she had the sad task of picking up the survivors from the sunken vessel West Madaket. The small convoy of three cargo ships and HMS PINK then continued on there way to port.\n\nHMS PINK also took part in the invasion of Europe as an escort to the landings on the Normandy beaches, she was hit by a \"Gnat\" torpedo while covering the landing of troops and supplys for the invading armies. The torpedo was fired by U-988 (which was sunk itself 2 days later) she was towed back to Portsmouth but declared a constructive total loss and in 1947 she was scrappedHMS PINK seen here in her camouflage paintwork, before the D-Day landings.\n\n(Photo credit unknown)\n\nFrom the Times newspaper May 3rd 2003\n\nTriumph in the 'black pit'\n\nChris Hulme salutes the North Atlantic convoy that changed the face of the Second World War\n\nAPRIL 28, 1943. The convoy of 43 merchant steamers, their names painted out, had slogged through a week of appalling weather in the North Atlantic en route from Britain to Halifax, Nova Scotia.\n\nGerman U-boats had been mauling such convoys since the start of the Second World War in what became known as the Battle of the Atlantic, exacting a terrible price in human lives for the food, raw materials and military supplies that Britain needed if it was to keep fighting.\n\nAs Andrew Williams writes in his book The Battle of the Atlantic: \"By mid-December of 1942, there was only 300,000 tons of commercial fuel in the country and yet consumption was running at about 130,000 tons a month.\" Some figures in the Admiralty were considering abandoning the convoy system \u2014 tantamount to an admission of naval defeat.\n\nDespite the heavy weather, Robert Atkinson, the 26-year-old captain of HMS Pink, one of five Royal Navy warships protecting the freighters, regarded the crossing as routine.\n\nHe was already an Atlantic veteran, credited with the first night-time sinking of a U-boat. Six days into the North Atlantic, a coded signal from the Admiralty made it clear that convoy ONS-5 faced a greater peril than heavy weather. The largest-known fleet of U-boats was massing ahead and they were beyond air support.\n\nThe fighting lasted a week, but instead of the slaughter the Germans had come to expect, the Royal Navy fought back, changing the course of the war.\n\nON APRIL 28, Atkinson and the other captains in ONS-5 received a one-word signal from Commander Peter Gretton, aboard the destroyer HMS Duncan, the largest warship. It said: \"Anticipate\".\n\nAtkinson, now 87, has vivid memories of what happened next. It was 5pm, already dark, cold winds buffeting the ship. He gathered his men on a lower deck. \"There's going to be a hell of a battle tonight,\" he told them. \"I'm not sure how many of us will see daylight. I intend to see it if I can. It's up to us.\"\n\nBy midnight five U-boats were harassing the convoy. This moonlit engagement spilt over into the next day, and the next. \"The weather got worse and worse,\" Graham Bence, Commander Gretton's operations officer, recalls.\n\n\"The convoy had to heave to. You put the ship's head into the wind and kept the screw turning. You were all but stationary.\"\n\nOn May 4 the skies cleared. Ahead of ONS-5 at least 53 U-boats \u2014 the largest pack ever massed in one patrol area \u2014 were waiting in the \"black pit\" between Iceland and Greenland. In the afternoon, the first of the U-boats made contact, sinking two freighters.\n\nBy midnight, another ship had gone. Five more merchant vessels were to follow in the night. Atkinson had been given the task of protecting four stragglers, struggling to keep up 80 miles behind the main convoy. They stayed clear of trouble until the following morning, May 5. Then HMS Pink picked up what Atkinson calls \"a first-class asdic (sonar) contact \u2014 the clearest and sharpest I ever heard\".\n\nBriefly, he agonised over whether to chase the U-boat or stay with his ships. \"It's a very human thing,\" he says. \"You wanted to fight back, to get at them.\" He opted to attack. \"The asdic operator was the key man,\" he says. \"He called continuously, 'Ship approaching, 1,500 yards. Sharp echo, ship turning to starboard. Ship stopped, sir. Ship turned away from us, got his wake.' We were persistent \u2014 we never let the submarine go.\n\n\"After about the fifth depth-charge attack, huge quantities of oil came to the surface and we could hear him trying to blow his ballast tanks.\" HMS Pink launched one more assault. \"A most powerful explosion shook the ship, low in note, like a deep grunt.\" It was not the hoped-for kill, but Pink was later credited with putting U-358 out of service.\n\nTheir victory was not without cost, however. Just before they caught up with the stragglers, a huge column of smoke began to rise. One of the merchant ships, West Madaket, had been hit. \"My worst fears had been realised,\" Atkinson says. \"But any officer would have done the same faced with my choice.\"\n\nAhead, in the main part of the convoy, another four freighters had been picked off during the day and one submarine, U-638, destroyed. In thick fog, the unprecedented battle raged on into darkness. One Navy commander noted succinctly in his report: \"23 ships in 10 columns . . . calm sea, heavy mist . . . at 00.41 the first of about 24 attempted attacks from every direction except ahead was detected and the battle continued without stopping until 06.20.\"\n\nWhile this barrage of torpedoes, depth charges, attempted rammings and drastic manoeuvring raged, the convoy ploughed on. Four more U-boats were sunk and several others seriously damaged before May 6 dawned. As more Royal Navy ships joined the fight, the mass of U-boats disbanded and slipped away. The battle had been won.\n\nHMS PINK at full ahead (note-the Bow Horn's attached to take the anti-mine acoustic hammer) thanks to Bob for pointing out that the \"A\" frame on the bow in fact held the anti-mine acoustic hammer box.\n\n(Photo credit unknown)\n\nAcoustic Hammer info:-\n\nFrom \n\nBy Rob Hoole\n\nThe first known use of an acoustic mine occurred in 1940. However work on an acoustic countermeasure had already been initiated by HMS Vernon and the Sweeping Division of its Mine Design Department. This resulted in the SA acoustic hammer box in the bow compartment of a vessel (usually a converted trawler) but later bow-mounted about 12 feet below the water. By 1942, the bow mounted hammer box was one of the most common acoustic countermeasures and was being streamed abeam, usually in combination with the LL magnetic sweep. The hammer boxes contained a pneumatic or electric driven riveting hammer mounted to strike against a 7\/16 inch thick 19 inch diameter steel diaphragm. The pneumatic hammers proved more reliable than the electric type and were incorporated into the standard hammer box designated 'A Mark 1' which was either suspended over the bow of a minesweeper or towed in combination with the magnetic sweep.\n\nEach Royal Navy commander received a congratulatory signal from Winston Churchill. \"While 13 merchant ships were lost,\" says Williams, \"nine U-boats were sunk and several others badly damaged. For the Germans it was an unsustainable rate of loss \u2014 one U-boat sunk for every two Allied merchant ships.\"\n\nFor several months, the Germans withdrew almost entirely from the Atlantic. When they did return, they were no match for the British ships.\n\nON MONDAY, a last public acknowledgement will be made of the immense contribution made by seafarers in the Second World War when the Admiralty commemorates the Battle of the Atlantic for the 60th and final time. (A 60th, as opposed to 75th, anniversary was chosen because of the advanced age of the dwindling band of veterans.)\n\nAbout 100,000 people are expected to attend the event in Liverpool, the Allied base during the campaign. Nine visiting warships from six navies will be open to visitors.\n\nAs for Atkinson, he came to understand the cost of war most devastatingly. He was one of four brothers from a Northumberland family who went to sea \u2014 two in the Royal Navy and two in the Merchant Navy. All his siblings were killed in action.\n\nA former chairman of British Shipbuilders, he was knighted in 1982. He says that harrowing memories of the war remain \u2014 picking up some survivors of torpedoed ships, but having to abandon others, for example. \"Dreadful,\" he says simply. \"Fire on the water, people struggling. I can still see them in my eyes.\"\n\nHMS PINK at sea (photo credit unknownGeoff Brewers story (Mid-Shipman)\n\nMy knowledge of my father's war are rather limited as he didn't speak of it all that much but he did speak of trying to sink, or perhaps blow up mines by shooting at the horns and I think he said Pink claimed a U Boat during one crossing, although I don't think he was aboard at that time. That may have been just before he joined her.\n\nGeoff Brewer Mid-Shipman HMS PINK (Brewer Family collection)\n\nHe served on three ships during the war. Pink was his first ship... as a 'mid' I think. I understand he did at least one trans Atlantic convoy in her and spoke of her being pretty uncomfortable in big seas.\n\nI believe he also served on at least one escort convoy to Russia after that, but possibly not aboard Pink. I don't think Geoff was aboard Pink during the Normandy landings.\n\nAt some point he served on two other ships: HMS Quality G62 and HMS Kempthorne G483.\n\nMid-Shipman Geoff Brewer (Far right with side arm) at the surrender of some unknown German U-Boats. (Brewer family collection)Some more words on the part played by the gallant little fighting Corvettes, from Ahoy Mac's web blog.\n\nA brief comment on Anti- Submarine Warfare Ships. With its available speed, manoeuvreability, and armament, the Destroyer was generally accepted as the ultimate and most deadly anti-submarine warfare ship. The eventual successor, the Destroyer Escort was yet to enter the scene and the Battle of the Atlantic in any significant numbers.\n\nThe River Class Frigates were very good anti-submarine vessels, of 1370 tons, and a reasonable speed of 20 knots gave them every chance of dealing with any threat posed by the opposing German boats. The Black Swan Class Sloops of similar size and speed were also most useful ships in this fight to the death.\n\nHowever, the real surprise in this seemingly never ending fight to the finish that raged across the Atlantic from the start of WW2 up to the present time of reporting was, the slower, smaller, Flower Class Corvettes, their names all coined from WW1 Flower Class Sloops. This class of WW2 ships started to come down the slipways in 1939, designed as Minesweepers, and for anti-submarine work in the English Channel and North Sea, their immediate relative was a commercial whaler Southern Pride.\n\nThe class was easy to construct, with a single screw, but above all they could be rolled out from non Naval Yards across the United Kingdom. In all, some 221 Flower Class or Modified Flower Class Corvettes came off the slipways in UK and Canada, alas only one of this breed remains today, launched in 1941, HMCS SACKVILLE, now fully restored , is on display at Halifax in Nova Scotia, the port of departure for so many east bound convoys over 1939- 1945. These little ships, with a relatively short length of 205\/208 feet, had a small turning circle, and eventually carried up to 50 depth charges, had a long range of 3,850 miles at 12 knots on only 213 tons of oil fuel, very economical.\n\nThey proved to be great ships on the Atlantic run, although never designed to sail those perilous seas, they survived the worst weather that the Atlantic could throw at them, they were uncomfortable sea ships, but most of all, they were safe ships, and throughout all their ordeals on the North Atlantic run, not a single man was ever washed overboard from a Flower Class Corvette. They took tons of ocean over their bows, they would \"Roll on a damp grass!\" but they always shook themselves clear and came up to plough on and on.\n\nThe Cruel Sea. It was the Flower Class Corvette on which Nicolas Monsarrat based his famous novel The Cruel Sea, and his Compass Rose went on to dominate Naval fictional history.\n\nComments\n\nMy grandfather served on the Pink cyril stone (nick name ted) stoker. he was on the pink when they hit the u boat and when the pink was hit, he was one of 4 to stay on board to keep the Pink a float, him the captain, another stoker and some one else. I believe it took 3 days to be towed back, as the ship that towed the Pink only did it at night and cut her loose in the day. my grandfather spent the whole time in the engine room with the other stoker chest deep in water and oil. and was fed rum and gin to keep them warm. when the HMS PINK arrived back to dry dock they were ordered off and the ship sunk because no one was pumping the water out.\n\nMy Dad (Alexander Esgate) was on board HMS Pink as Signalman, on both the Atlantic convoys and on the Normandy landings. They were assisting the Canadians at the time of the Landings. My Dad told me that he was on the beach with the Canadians when a shell hit nearby and he was paralysed (shell-shocked)by it and then taken to South Africa to recouperate in a hospital.Hi Pamela. My Grandfather was Sub Lieut (Engineer) Benjamin Poulter and was awarded the MBE for his part in saving the ship after it was torpedoed during the Normandy landings. I will see if I can find out any more about that...I believe my Father AB james Lewis served on HMS Pink and I can remember him describing the sinking as he said he was on watch at time and so survived the attack, was picked up by an American warship and taken to New York. Any further details would be welcome. He was later posted to HMS Ajax.\n\nMy late father Tom Robertson (Thomas James Robertson) served on the Pink, and I recall was involved in the reunions back in the early 80s(?). I've just read 'The Battle of the Atlantic' Men and Events, by Thomas Woodrooffe, which was most interesting, and got me thinking about the part my father played in WW2."}

{"text":"Allied Convoy Routes\n- New\nfast (F) and slow (S) convoys started in October and\nNovember between the UK and North African ports: UK out:\nKMF and KMS; Home to UK: MKF and MKS. From April 1943\nthese convoys sailed to and from the Gibraltar area\nmainly with OS and SL-convoyed ships.\n\n15th - The Germans\nreacted to the 'Torch' landings on French North Africa (below) by concentrating U-boats off\nMorocco and to the west of Gibraltar. A number of empty\ntransports were sunk, and on the 15th escort carrier AVENGERsailing with\nreturn convoy MKF1 was torpedoed by \"U-155\" and\nwent down off the Strait of Gibraltar. Only 12 men\nsurvived. That same day, destroyer \"Wrestler\"\nalso with MKF1 sank \"U-411\". Over the next few days US destroyers\naccounted for \"U-173\" and the RAF for \"U-98\".\n\n15th - Canadian\ndestroyer \"SAGUENAY\" escorting an iron ore convoy off\nCape Race, Newfoundland, was badly damaged in collision.\nShe was not repaired.\n\n18th\/20th,\nAttacks on UK\/North America Convoy ONS144 - Slow convoy ONS144 was heavily\nattacked in the mid-Atlantic and lost five ships. Escort\nwas provided by the British B6 group composed largely of\nNorwegian-manned corvettes. On the 18th the\nNorwegian \"MONTBRETIA\" was lost to \"U-624\" or\n\"U-262\", but two days later Norwegian\nsister-ship \"Potentilla sank \"U-134\".\n\nBattle\nof the Atlantic - World-wide\nlosses in tonnage due to Axis submarines were the highest\nof any month of the war - 119 ships of 729,000 tons,\nmostly in the Atlantic. By year's end, submarines in 1942\nhad accounted for 1,160 ships of 6,266,000 tons or a\nmonthly average of 522,000 tons. Losses in the North and\nSouth Atlantic made up most of this total. To deal with\nthis grave threat, a Cabinet Anti-U-boat Warfare\nCommittee (not the 1941 Battle of the Atlantic Committee)\nwas formed under the chairmanship of Prime Minister\nWinston Churchill. It saw the first need as closing the\nmid-Atlantic gap once and for all. Steps were taken to\nfurther expand Coastal Command and speed up the\nintroduction of VLR aircraft. Adm Sir Max Horton,\ncommander of home-based submarines since 1940 and a World\nWar 1 submariner himself, succeeded Adm Noble as C-in-C,\nWestern Approaches.\n\nMonthly Loss Summary: 93 British, Allied\nand neutral ships of 567,000 tons in the Atlantic from\nall causes, 1 escort carrier, 1 destroyer and 1 corvette;\n7\nU-boats including one by US aircraft off Iceland, and one\npossibly by the RAF in the North Atlantic\n\nEUROPE - NOVEMBER 1942\n\n11th - Submarine \"UNBEATEN\", on patrol in the Bay of Biscay\nfor U-boats on passage to and from Atlantic operations,\nwas accidentally lost in an attack by a RAF Wellington.\n\nEastern Front - In\nthe South, as the German forces in the Caucasus\nand within Stalingrad were slowly ground down, the\nRussians started a long-planned major offensive to\nrelieve the city and trap the invaders in the Caucasus.\nAlong 50-mile fronts to the north and the south of\nStalingrad, two large armies broke through the largely\nRumanian defenders. Before the month was out the Russian\npincers had met and Gen Paulus' Sixth Army was\nsurrounded.\n\nNorth Africa - By\nthe 4th the Second Battle of El Alamein had been\nwon by Eighth Army. Rommel's losses in men and material\nwere so great he withdrew, first to Fuka and then Mersa\nMatruh. The British got there by the 7th. New Zealand\ntroops entered Sidi Barrani on the 9th and two days later\nreached the Libyan border. As the remaining Axis troops\ncontinued to fall back, Eighth Army entered Tobruk on the\n12th and Benghazi a week later. Rommel had moved back to\nthe old 'start\/finish' line of El Agheila by the end of\nthe month. Montgomery halted Eighth Army after a 600-mile\nadvance in 14 days.\n\n8th - French North African Landings:\nOperation 'Torch'\n\nBy July 1942 the Allies had\naccepted that a cross-Channel assault on German-occupied Europe\nwas not yet possible, and instead opted to land an expeditionary\nforce in French North Africa. For political reasons the main\nlanding forces would be American. Their arrival was timed to\ncoincide with Eighth Army's offensive. Plans were formally\napproved in October, by which time the large amounts of shipping\nneeded had been organised and assembled. To provide them,\nRussian convoys and those to and from Britain and Gibraltar\/West\nAfrica had been suspended and the Home Fleet stripped bare. The\nAllies' greatest concern was the hundred or more U-boats at sea.\nOutline order of battle was:\n\nMost\nof the task force carriers were escort carriers,\nand the US totals included a heavy cover force.\nIn the Mediterranean, British Force H reinforced\nby Home Fleet and under the command of Vice-Adm\nSir Neville Syfret, covered the Algerian\nlandings. Their main task was to hold off any\nattack by the Italian fleet. Strength included\nthree capital ships, three fleet carriers, three\ncruisers and 17 destroyers. Various other forces\nadded to the number of Allied ships in the area.\nOver 300 ships were therefore directly involved\nin what at that time was the greatest amphibious\noperation in history, and the forerunner of even\ngreater ones to come before the war was won.\nThroughout October and early November convoys\nsailed for the landings on Vichy French soil in\nthe early hours of the 8th. Negotiations\nwith the French were not completed in time to\navoid resistance. There was bloodshed on both\nsides.\n\nCasablanca, Morocco - US troops landed at three\npoints along a 200-mile stretch of Atlantic\ncoastline. By the 10th they prepared to\nattack Casablanca itself, but this became\nunnecessary when the French forces stopped\nfighting. Before this happened the Western Task\nForce had fought a series of fierce actions with\nVichy French warships. Battleship \"Jean\nBart\" was seriously damaged and a cruiser\nand several destroyers and submarines sunk or\nbeached.\n\nOran, Algeria - Within the Mediterranean,\nthe landings to the west and east of Oran were\nfollowed by an attempt to smash through the\nharbour boom and land troops directly from ex-US\nCoast Guard cutters \"WALNEY\" (Capt Peters) and \"HARTLAND\". Both were disabled by\nship and shore gunfire and soon sank. (+ Capt\nFrederick Peters RN of the \"Walney\" was\nawarded the Victoria Cross for gallantry. Five\ndays later he was kiIled in an aircraft\naccident.) Cruiser Aurora\n(Capt Agnew) and destroyers fought off an attack\nby French destroyers outside the port. The large\ndestroyer \"EPERVIER\" was driven ashore\nand \"Tornade\" and\n\"Tramontane\" disabled. In addition,\ndestroyers \"Achates\" and\n\"Westcott\" accounted for submarines\n\"ACTEON\" and \"ARGONAUTE\". US\ntroops fought their way into Oran, which fell on\nthe 10th.\n\nAlgiers, Algeria - A similar opening attack\nwas mounted by old destroyers \"Broke\"\nand \"Malcolm\". The latter was badly\ndamaged but \"BROKE\"eventually\nbroke through the boom to land her troops. Hard\nhit by shore batteries, she got away but\nfoundered next day on the 9th. Algiers was\nsoon in Allied hands and Adm Darlan, C-in-C Vichy\nFrench forces captured. It was not Gen Giraud as\noriginally intended, but Adm Darlan who broadcast\nthe ceasefire on the 10th. Resistance was\nstopped, but confusion reigned for a number of\ndays as the Vichy French authorities were\npressurised by both the Allies and Axis. However,\nbefore long the forces of France were fighting on\nthe Allied side in French North Africa. Adm\nDarlan was assassinated in late December and Gen\nGiraud took his place.\n\nTunisia - On news of the 'Torch' landings, the first\nGerman troops were flown across from Sicily to Tunisia on\nthe 9th and within two days started a large build-up.\n\nSouthern France -\nHitler ordered German troops into unoccupied Vichy France\non the 11th. On the 27th, SS units tried to capture the\nFrench fleet at Toulon. They were too late to stop the\nscuttling of three battleships, seven cruisers, 30\ndestroyers, 16 submarines and many other smaller vessels.\n\nSpain - Throughout\nall these events Spain fortunately stayed neutral. There\nwas therefore no threat to Gibraltar directly from\nSpanish troops, or from Germans passing through the\ncountry. And the Americans in Morocco were safe from\nattack by the Spanish in Spanish Morocco.\n\n9th - Off Oran the\ncorvette \"GARDENIA\" was lost in collision with armed\ntrawler \"Fluellen\".\n\n10th - In addition\nto the Atlantic approaches to Gibraltar, a large number\nof German and Italian submarines were concentrated in the\nWestern Mediterranean to attack the 'Torch' follow-up\nconvoys. Transports and escorting warships were sunk and\ndamaged, but losses were never great, and seven Axis\nsubmarines (1-7) were sunk in\nexchange. On the 10th, destroyer \"MARTIN\"was sunk by \"U-431\" off\nAlgiers and Italian submarine \"EMO\" (1) scuttled after an attack by armed trawler\n\"Lord Nuffield\". 12th - \"U-660\" (2) was sunk by escorting corvettes\n\"Lotus\" and \"Starwort\" northeast of\nOran. 13th - Next day \"Lotus\", this time\nwith \"Poppy\" accounted for \"U-605\"\n(3) off Algiers. On\nthe 14th and 15th respectively, \"U-595\" and \"U-259\" (4-5)\nwere sunk by aircraft. 17th - \"U-331\" (6)\nwas damaged\nby RAF Hudsons of No 500 Squadron and tried to surrender.\nAircraft of 820 Squadron from carrier Formidable torpedoed her in error off\nAlgiers. 28th - North of Bone the Italian \"DESSIE\"\n(7) was\nsunk by destroyers\n\"Quentin\" and the Australian\n\"Quiberon\", now part of cruiser Force Q\noperating out of Bone.\n\n10th - Further\nAllied landings were made to the east of Algiers along\nthe Algerian coast, where there was little air cover.\nAttacks by German aircraft on these and other Algerian\ntargets sank or damaged a number of ships. On the 10th,\nsloop \"IBIS\"\nwas hit by an aircraft torpedo and went\ndown off Algiers.\n\nAlgeria - The first\nof the further Allied troop landings were made at Bougie\nand Bone on the 11th and 12th, well on the way to the\nTunisian border. 13th - \"U-431\" sent\nDutch destroyer \"lSAAC SWEERS\" to the bottom northwest of\nAlgiers. 20th - Cruiser Delhiwas damaged by bombs in Algiers Bay. 28th\n- Destroyer\"ITHURIEL\" in harbour at Bone was badly\ndamaged in bombing attacks and not repaired.\n\nThe Relief of Malta -\nAt the beginning of the month,\ncruiser-minelayer\nWelshman ran vitally needed\nstores to Malta. On the 11th, sister-ship\nManxman made a similar dash from Alexandria.\nThen on the 17th a convoy of four ships, escorted\nby three cruisers and 10 destroyers, left Alexandria\n(Operation 'Stoneage'). Although cruiser\nArethusawas\nbadly damaged by German torpedo\naircraft on the 18th and had to return with over\n150 casualties, the convoy got through on the 20th.\nIts arrival effectively marks the lifting of the long and\nbloody siege of Malta. Since Operation 'Excess' in\nJanuary 1941, two aircraft carriers, four cruisers, 16\ndestroyers and five submarines had been lost in the many\nattempts to supply and reinforce the island, and in the\nheavy air attacks launched against the George Cross\nisland.\n\nFrench North Africa\ncontinued - After the Bougie and Bone landings in\neastern Algeria, British paratroops were flown into the\nnorth of Tunisia and the advance began on Bizerta and\nTunis. US paratroops further south moved on to Gafsa from\nwhere they threatened to take the coastal town of Gabes\nand cut Tunisia in half. Fighting took place as the Allies\nclosed in, but by the time the main offensive started on\nthe 25th, the Germans had built up their forces around\nboth Bizerta and Tunis, and also occupied the east coast\ntowns of Sousse, Sfax and Gabes. However by month's end,\nunits of British First Army were within 12 miles of\nTunis.\n\n11th, Action of the \"Bengal\"\nand \"Ondina\"-Two Japanese raiders armed with 6in guns\nattacked the Dutch tanker \"Ondina\" (one 4in\ngun) and her escort, the Royal Indian navy minesweeper\n\"Bengal\" (single 12pdr) commanded by Lt-Cdr W.\nJ. Wilson RINR to the southwest of the Cocos Islands in\nthe Indian Ocean. \"Bengal\" hit \"HOKOKUKU\" which shortly blew up. The other\nraider soon disappeared. Both Allied ships were damaged\nand separated, but reached port safely after this small\nship action which ranks with the sinking of the\n\"Stier\" by the \"Stephen Hopkins\" just\ntwo months earlier.\n\nPapua, New Guinea -\nKokoda was captured on the 2nd, and by mid-month\nAustralian and American troops were attacking the\nstrongly fortified positions around Buna and Gona. Fierce\nfighting carried on throughout November and December.\n\nGuadalcanal, British Solomon Islands -\nThree\nmore naval battles took place as US forces started to\npush the Japanese away from the airfield towards Cape\nEsperance:First Battle of Guadalcanal - On the night of the 12th\/13th a\nlarge Japanese troop convoy approached accompanied by two\nbattleships which were to bombard Henderson Field. A US\ncruiser force set out to meet them in lronbottom Sound.\nThey lost two cruisers and four destroyers, and the\nJapanese two destroyers in the fighting. Also Japanese\nbattleship \"HIEI\" was disabled by gunfire and later\nfinished off by US torpedo aircraft attack. Second Battle of\nGuadalcanal - Two\nnights later the Japanese again tried to bring in troop\ntransports. This time a battleship action resulted and \"KIRISHIMA\" was sunk by the \"Washington\". Battle of\nTassafaronga - On the 30th in the same area, an eight-destroyer\n'Tokyo Express' was intercepted by US cruisers and\ndestroyers. One of the Japanese was sunk but at the cost\nof one cruiser lost and three severely damaged as the\n24in Long Lance torpedoed tore through the US lines.\n\nGerman Raiders - On\nthe 30th, German raider \"THOR\" was destroyed in Yokohama, Japan when a\nsupply ship laying alongside caught fire and blew up.\nSince leaving France in January she had sunk or captured\n10 ships of 56,000 tons.\n\nMerchant\nShipping War - A\nfew Japanese submarines continued to operate in the\nIndian Ocean and were now joined by a number of German\nU-boats on patrol off the east coast of South Africa.\n\nAtomic Bomb - The\nworld's first atomic reactor went critical at Chicago\nUniversity. By now problems had arisen over the sharing\nof the US work with Britain.\n\n16th - In attacks\non UK\/North America convoy ON153, \"U-211\" sank\ndestroyer \"FIREDRAKE\" in mid-Atlantic on the night of\nthe 16th\/17th. 26th - Outward bound \"U-357\" was detected by HF\/DF to the northwest\nof Ireland. Destroyers \"Hesperus\" and\n\"Vanessa\" of the British B2 group (Cdr\nMacintyre) with convoy HX219 located and sank her. 27th\n- \"U-356\" attacked slow convoy ONS154\nescorted by the Canadian Cl group to the north of the\nAzores. Destroyer \"St Laurent\" and\ncorvettes \"Battleford\", \"Chilliwack\"\nand \"Napanee\" all shared in her sinking. It was\na poor return for the convoy's loss of 13 of its 45\nships.\n\n31st,\nBattle of the Barents Sea &\nRussian Convoys JW51A and JW51B(see map above) -After a three-month gap the first\nof the JW convoys set out. JW51 sailed in two\nsections. Part A left Loch Ewe, Scotland on the 15th\nwith 16 ships bound for Kola Inlet. All arrived safely on\nChristmas Day, the 25th accompanied by supporting\ncruisers Jamaica and\nSheffield (right - NavyPhotos).\nJW51B\n(14 ships) left on the 22nd escorted by six\ndestroyers, a minesweeper and four smaller vessels under\nthe command of Capt St. V. Sherbrooke in\n\"Onslow\". Adm Burnett with \"Jamaica\"\nand \"Sheffield\" joined the convoy south west of\nBear Island on the 29th to provide close cover\nthrough the Barents Sea. By now \"Tirpitz\",\npocket battleship \"Lutzow\", heavy cruiser\n\"Admiral Hipper\", light cruisers\n\"Koln\" and \"Nurnberg\" and a number of\n5in and 5.9in gun destroyers were in Norwegian waters.\nThe Admiralty assumed they were for attacks on Russian\nconvoys. In fact, they were in Norway because Hitler\nfeared invasion.\n\nConvoy JW51B was\nreported an the 30th and 8in \"Hipper\"\n(Adm Kummetz), 11in \"Lutzow\" and six destroyers\nput to sea from Altenfiord to intercept north of North\nCape. Early on the 31st, New Year's Eve, the\nBritish ships were in four groups (1-4). The main convoy (1) with five remaining 4in or 4.7in\ndestroyers \"Achates\", \"Onslow\",\n\"Obdurate\", \"Obedient\" and\n\"Orwell\" headed due east. (Some of the escort\nand merchantmen had been scattered by gales and never\nregained the convoy). Northeast of the convoy, detached\nminesweeper \"Bramble\" (2) was searching for missing ships. Adm\nBurnett's two 6in cruisers (3) covered to the north. Further\nnorth still a straggling merchant ship and escorting\ntrawler (4) tried to reach the convoy. Capt Sherbrooke\nplanned to use the same tactics as Adm Vian in the Second\nBattle of Sirte and head for the enemy while the convoy\nturned away under smoke. Unfortunately Adm Kummetz\ndivided his force in two [1-2] and planned to attack\nfrom astern on both sides - \"Hipper\" [1] and three destroyers in the north and \"Lutzow\"\n[2] with the other three in the south.\n\nOn the 31st around 09.30,\nthe action started with \"Hipper's\" three\ndestroyers [1] heading north across the rear of the convoy (1), and opening fire on\n\"Obdurate\". The convoy later turned as planned,\nbut south towards \"Lutzow\" [2]. Then \"Onslow\",\nOrwell\" and Obedient\" sighted Hipper\" [1] and held her off until, at\n10.20,\n\"Onslow\" was hit and Capt Sherbrooke badly\nwounded (Capt Rupert St. V. Sherbrooke RN was awarded the\nVictoria\nCrossfor gallantry). Adm Burnett's cruisers [3] meanwhile, following a radar\ncontact, had diverted north towards the straggler and\nescort (4). They only headed towards the\naction at 10.00.Still to the north of the convoy,\n\"Hipper\" [1] and her destroyers came across the\nhapless BRAMBLE(2) and sent her to the bottom around 10.40.\nThey headed south, and 40min later the 8in cruiser [1] approached JW51B (1), opened fire and hit\n\"ACHATES\" which sank after the battle was\nover. Lutzow [2] had already come up on the convoy from the south but did not join battle until\n11.45.\nShe was driven off by the remaining destroyers. By now\nJamaica and Sheffield(3) had arrived on the scene. They\nquickly hit \"Hipper\" [1] and sank destroyer \"FRIEDRICH\nECKOLDT\".\n\"Hipper\" tried to get back to the convoy but\nagain the destroyers skillfully kept her at bay. By midday\nthe German ships were withdrawing with the two cruisers\nin pursuit. Contact was shortly lost. None of the\nmerchantmen were more than lightly damaged and all 14\nreached Kola on the 3rd January.\n\nReturn convoy RA51\nleft Kola on the 30th December. After being\nsupported part of the way by \"Jamaica\" and\n\"Sheffield\", the 14 merchant ships were safely\ndelivered to Loch Ewe on the 11th January.\nLearning his big ships had been driven off by light\ncruisers and destroyers Hitler flew into a rage and\nordered them all paid off. Grand-Adm Raeder resigned in\nprotest and was succeeded as C-in-C, German Navy, in\nJanuary by Adm Doenitz. The paying-off order was revoked.\n\nBattle\nof the Atlantic - Total\nU-boat strength at year's end approached 400 compared to\n250 in January, and this in spite of 86 submarines being\nlost in 1942. Of the total, over 200 were operational.\nMany were on passage but the numbers on patrol were still\ngreat and increasing. Most were in the North Atlantic or\nwest of Gibraltar although groups operated off West\nAfrica and South America with some success. The Allies\ncould deploy 450 escort vessels of all types against the\nU-boats: this was a large number but still not enough to\ncurb the menace and go over to the offensive. In December\nthe Royal Navy and its Allies regained an old advantage\nwhen after a 10-month gap, the U-boat 'Triton' code for\nAtlantic operations was broken.\n\nMonthly Loss Summary: 54 British, Allied\nand neutral ships of 305,000 tons in the Atlantic from\nall causes, 3 escorts; 1 German destroyer and 5 U-boats\nincluding 1 each by US and indirectly by RAF aircraft in\nattacks on HX217, 1 by US Coast Guard in mid-Atlantic\n\nEUROPE - DECEMBER 1942\n\n3rd - Escort\ndestroyer \"PENYLAN\", with Portsmouth\/Bristol Channel\nconvoy PW257, was sunk by E-boat \"S-115\" in the\nEnglish Channel off Start Point.\n\n'Cockleshell\nHeroes' - Maj H.\nG. Hasler led Royal Marine Commandos in canoes up the\nGironde Estuary in southwest France and damaged several\nblockade runners with limpet mines on the 7th.\n\nEastern Front - In\nthe south of the Front, a scratch German force\ntried to reach Stalingrad from the southwest but was soon\ndriven back. Further north, the Russians resumed their\npush and annihilated an Italian army. By now the Germans\nin the Caucasus were under heavy pressure. Fearing the\nRussians would reach Rostov-on-Don and trap them, they\nstarted to withdraw from the oilfields considered so\nimportant by Hitler.\n\nFrench North Africa -\nGerman forces counter-attacked in the north of Tunisia,\ndriving back the Allies. Much of the fighting took place\nin the Battle for Longstop Hill near Medjez el\nBab. By the end of the year Axis forces had established\nstrong defence lines around Bizerta and Tunis, and were\nholding on to the eastern half of the country. The Allies\nhad lost the race for Tunis. Throughout January 1943 both\nsides attacked along the line, but without much success. As this\nhappened more and more German and Italian troops were\ndrawn into Tunisia. When the Axis command eventually\nsurrendered in May 1943, it had drained Sicily and Italy\nof some of its best men.\n\nCruiser Force Q -\nBased in Bone, Force Q and a new Malta-based cruiser\nforce took turns attacking Axis shipping bound for North\nAfrica. On the 2nd, Force Q with\nAurora,\nArgonaut,\nSirius and two destroyers went into action in\nthe Strait of Sicily. All four transports in a convoy and\nItalian destroyer \"FOLGORE\" were sunk by gunfire. As they returned,\ndestroyer \"QUENTIN\"was lost to Italian torpedo aircraft\nnorth of Cape Bon. 14th - Two weeks after Force\nQ's success in the Strait of Sicily, cruiser\nArgonautwas badly damaged by Italian submarine\n\"Mocenigo\" northeast of Bone.\n\n4th - In the first\nUSAAF raids on Italy, Italian light cruiser \"ATTENDOLO\" was sunk and others damaged at Naples.\n\nRoyal Navy Submarine\nOperations - Throughout the month, British submarines\nwere on patrol in the Western Mediterranean and lost four\nof their number. In return they sank several Axis ships\nincluding two Italian warships. Early December - \"TRAVELLER\"left Malta on\n28th November for the Gulf of Taranto. Overdue by\nthe 8th December, she was presumed mined in her patrol\narea. 6th - \"Tigris\" sank Italian\nsubmarine \"PORFIDO\" north of Bone. 12th - In the Gulf of\nNaples submarine\"P-222\"was lost to Italian torpedo boat\n\"Fortunale\" while attacking a convoy. 17th\n- North of Bizerta, \"Splendid\" sank Italian\ndestroyer \"AVIERE\" escorting a convoy to North Africa. 25th -\nAs an Axis convoy headed into Tunis, \"P-48\"attacked and was\nsunk by Italian destroyer escorts \"Ardente\" and\n\"Ardito\". Late December - At the end of\nthe month submarine \"P-311\"sailed for\nMaddalena, Sardinia with Chariot\nhuman torpedoes for an\nattack on the cruisers based there. Her last signal was\non the 31st December and she was presumed lost on mines\nin the approaches to the port.\n\nAttacks off Algeria -\nAttacks on Allied shipping off Algeria led to more losses\nin return for the sinking of one Italian submarine. 9th\n- As destroyer \"PORCUPINE\" escorted submarine depot ship\nMaidstone from Gibraltar to Algiers, she was\ntorpedoed and badly damaged off Oran by\n\"U-602\", and never repaired. On the same day\ncorvette \"MARIGOLD\" was sunk by torpedo aircraft to the\nwest of Algiers while escorting North Africa\/UK convoy\nMKS3. 11th - Escort destroyer \"BLEAN\"sailing with fast North Africa\/UK\nconvoy MKF4 was lost to \"U-443\" west of Oran. 13th\n- Sloop \"Enchantress\" sank Italian submarine \"CORALLO\" off Bougie.\n18th\n- Porcupine's sister-ship\"PARTRIDGE\"was torpedoed by \"U-565\"\nwhile carrying out an A\/S sweep with Force H, and went\ndown off Oran.\n\nNorth Africa - On\nthe 11th, Gen Montgomery resumed Eighth Army's advance.\nUnder direct and flanking attack, Rommel abandoned El\nAgheila and withdrew to defence lines at Buerat on the\napproaches to Tripoli. By now he had decided to make his\nmain stand on the Mareth line in southern Tunisia. Eighth\nArmy reached Buerat by year's end. 19th -\nEscorting a convoy to Benghazi, corvette \"SNAPDRAGON\"\nwas bombed and sunk off the port by\nGerman aircraft.\n\nGuadalcanal,\nBritish Solomon\nIslands - After four months struggle, the US 1st\nMarine Division was relieved by the Army. Japanese\ndestroyers continued to run in supplies by nightly 'Tokyo\nExpress', but by the end of the month High Command in\nTokyo had decided to evacuate its troops. Meanwhile US\nforces pushed west from Henderson Field.\n\nRussian\nConvoys - Russian\nconvoy JW52 and return RA52 both set out in\nJanuary. Of the 25 ships in the two convoys, one left\nJW52 to return to port, and one merchantmen with RA52 was\nlost to U-boat attacks.\n\nBattle\nof the Atlantic -\nSevere weather and evasive convoy routing kept losses\ndown in January 1943. However, south of the Azores, out\nof range of air cover, Trinidad\/Gibraltar tanker convoy\nTM1 lost seven out of nine ships to U-boats.\n\nMonthly Loss Summary,\nincluding Russian Convoys: 30 British, Allied and neutral\nships of 189,000 tons in the Atlantic from all causes; 4 U-boats including\n1 by RAF in North Atlantic; 2 by US aircraft off Brazil;\n1 by unknown causes\n\nEUROPE - JANUARY 1943\n\nAir War - RAF\nBomber Command by night and increasingly the USAAF by day\nmounted a growing attack on Germany and occupied Europe.\nAs agreed at the Casablanca Conference, U-boat bases and\ntheir production centres would be major targets in 1943.\nYet in the first six months, not one U-boat was destroyed\nin air-raids and the construction programmes were hardly\naffected. Throughout the war not one U-boat was lost in\nthe incredibly strong, reinforced concrete shelters built\nby the Germans at their main bases.\n\nEastern Front -\nRussian strength was now great enough to attack along\nother parts of the front as well as in the south. In the north\nthey managed to open a narrow corridor through to\nLeningrad. The siege was partially lifted, but another\nyear was needed to complete its liberation. The offensive\nin the Centre\/South continued with the Russians\naiming (from north to south) for Kursk, Kharkov and\nRostov-on-Don. In the south itself, the pressure\non the trapped Germans at Stalingrad was increased. A\npowerful attack starting early in the month forced Gen\nPaulus and the remnants of Sixth Army to surrender on the\n31st January, with the last troops giving in on the 2nd\nFebruary. The Battle of Stalingrad wasat\nlast over. Further South still German forces in\nthe Caucasus retreated as the Russian attacks gathered\nmomentum. Those who could, escape through Rostov-on-Don\nbefore its inevitable fall.\n\nMerchant\nShipping War - By\nnow the attack was being carried into the waters of\nGerman-occupied Europe by Royal Navy coastal forces,\nstrike aircraft of RAF Coastal Command and minelayers of\nBomber Command. German aircraft, E-boats and mines\ncontinued to threaten shipping around the coasts of\nBritain, but few ships were now being lost due to the\ncombined effort of the RAF fighters, convoy escorts and\nminesweepers.\n\nCasablanca Conference -\nPrime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt with\ntheir Chiefs of Staff met for this important conference.\nMajor areas for discussion included the European invasion\nin 1944, landings in Sicily and Italy after the Tunisian\ncampaign, the bombing of Germany and the continuation of\nthe war in Burma and the Pacific. Losses due to U-boats\nand the shortage of shipping would prove to be\nsignificant constraints on Allied plans. At this time the\ntwo Allied leaders announced a policy of unconditional\nsurrender by the Axis powers.\n\nAttacks off Algeria -\nAxis attacks continued against Allied ships in Algerian\nports and convoys off the coast. There were losses on\nboth sides. 1st - Cruiser Ajaxwas severely damaged in Bone harbour by\nJu87s. 13th - Canadian corvettes on convoy escort\naccounted for two submarines. On the 13th, \"Ville de\nQuebec\" sank \"U-224\" west of Algiers. 19th - Canadian\ncorvette \"Port Arthur\" sank Italian submarine \"TRITONE\" off Bougie by gunfire.\n30th\n- As corvette \"SAMPHIRE\" escorted Gibraltar\/North African ports\nconvoy TE14 she was torpedoed by Italian submarine\n\"Platino\" near Bougie.\n\nAxis Supplies to\nTunisia - Attempts by the Italian Navy to supply the\nAxis armies in Tunisia led to heavy losses, especially on\nmines laid between Sicily and Tunis by fast minelayers\nAbdiel and\nWelshman, and\nsubmarine \"Rorqual\". 9th - Destroyer \"CORSARO\" hit one of \"Abdiel's\"\nmines northeast of Bizerta. 17th - Returning from\nTunisia, destroyer \"BOMBARDIERE\" was sunk off western Sicily by\nsubmarine \"United\". 31st - Torpedo boat \"PRESTINARI\" and corvette \"PROCELLARIA\" went down on mines laid by\n\"Welshman\" in the Strait of Sicily.\n\nAxis Supplies to Libya\n- Final supply trips to Tripoli by Italian submarines led\nto more losses north of the Libyan capital. 14th -\n\"NARVALO\" was attacked\nby a RAF Beaufort and finished off by destroyers\n\"Pakenham\" and \"Hursley\", escorts\nwith Malta\/Alexandria convoy ME15. 20th - \"SANTAROSA\"\nwas torpedoed off Tripoli by MTB-260,\none of the growing number of coastal forces operating\nalong the North African coast.\n\nLibya - Gen\nMontgomery resumed the advance on the 15th, and Bueret,\noutflanked by British Armour and New Zealand troops was\nsoon taken. The defences in front of Tripoli were\nsimilarly outflanked and on the 23rd the victorious\nEighth Army entered the capital.\n\nBurma - The First\nArakan campaign continued as Indian troops tried to\nmove on Akyab.\n\nGuadalcanal, British\nSolomon Islands - Unknown to the Americans the\nJapanese had been ordered to evacuate, but still resisted\nstrongly as US forces pushed them back towards Cape\nEsperance. 5th - Operating off the Solomons with a\nUS cruiser force, the New Zealand Achilleswas badly damaged in a bombing attack\noff New Georgia Island. 29th - The Japanese still\ncarried supplies to Guadalcanal by submarine, and \"I-1\" was caught by New Zealand armed trawlers\n\"Kiwi\" and \"Moa\" to the north. In a\nfiercely fought action they drove the 2,000-ton boat\nashore to the west of Cape Esperance and destroyed her.\n\nPapua, New Guinea -\nThe Buna and Gona area was slowly wrested from the\nJapanese, and by the 21st was in Allied hands. Papua, New\nGuinea had now been liberated. The first phase of the New\nGuinea campaign was over. Next was to clear the coast\nopposite New Britain and take the airfield at Lae. In\npreparation for this, Australian troops had already been\nairlifted to Wau, inland from Salamaua. Capturing the\nHuon Peninsula would take most of 1943.\n\nThe Russians\ngained a famous victory with the German surrender\nat Stalingrad in January 1943. Taken with the\nOctober 1942 British Battle of El Alamein and June 1942 American Battle of\nMidway, the\nthree Allied successes are usually considered as\nmarking the turning point in the 40 month old war\nagainst the Axis powers. The Battle for\nGuadalcanal,\nending as it did Japanese hopes of controlling\nthe South West Pacific should also be added to\nthis roll-call of victory.\n\nHowever, more\nthan 30 months of struggle and bloodshed\nremained before victory was certain. Even\nthen, one Battle was not over until the very\nend - the Battle of the Atlantic, although it\ndid reach its peak over the next four months."}

{"text":"HMC Dockyard was acquired by the Canadian government from the Royal Navy following the withdrawal of British military forces from Canada in 1906. Prior to 1906, it was known as Royal Naval Dockyard, Halifax and is one of the oldest defence establishments in Canada, having been established by the Royal Navy during the 18th century as HM Dockyard.\n\nHMC Dockyard is located on the western side of Halifax Harbour at the southern end of The Narrows. It hosts the headquarters of Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT), the formal name for the Atlantic Fleet. HMC Dockyard contains berths for Canadian and foreign warships, Formation Supply Facility, Fleet Maintenance Facility Cape Scott, shore-based training facilities as well as operations buildings for MARLANT and other organizations such as Joint Rescue Coordination Centre Halifax (JRCC Halifax).\n\nHMC Dockyard maintains exclusive control of several anchorage areas within the limits of Halifax Harbour and prevents civilian vessels from sailing in the vicinity of military facilities; a floating force protection boom system is currently being constructed to prevent small vessels from unauthorized passage near warships and pierside facilities.\n\nStadacona, formerly referred to as HMCS Stadacona (pre-1968) and frequently referred to as \"Stad\", is an adjunct to HMC Dockyard located west of the waterfront in the North End of the Halifax peninsula. Prior to the arrival of the French, the location that would become Quebec was the home of a small Iroquois village called \"Stadacona\", after which the base is named.[1] Stadacona contains the Canadian Forces Naval Engineering School (with facilities at Herring Cove\/York Redoubt, south of Halifax), the Canadian Forces Naval Operations School, the base hospital, the Canadian Forces Maritime Warfare Centre, and various messes. Stadacona is also home to the headquarters of Land Force Atlantic Area and the Maritime Command Museum.\n\nStadacona was built as the British Army's Wellington Barracks, later known as the Nelson Barracks, as part of the Halifax Defence Complex. After the departure of British military forces from Canada in 1906, the Royal Canadian Navy appropriated the site and it was transformed into HMCS Stadacona.\n\nHousing for CFB Halifax is provided to Canadian Forces personnel and their dependants at Windsor Park, a housing area built by the Department of National Defence in the West End of Halifax. Stadacona is home to the Atlantic Block, a barracks for single ratings. Base housing also used to be provided at Shannon Park and Wallis Heights in the North End of Dartmouth, however with defence cutbacks in the 1990s, this area has been sold for civilian use. Housing is available at the 12 Wing Shearwater site, which is part of CFB Halifax. A large number of service personnel own or rent civilian property in the area.\n\nThe entrance to the Stadacona facility at CFB Halifax. This building was demolished in March 2013 following staffing changes at the facility.[2]\n\nAlmost all the original Royal Navy 18th and 19th century buildings in the Dockyard were demolished in World War II to make way for machine shops, stores buildings and drill halls needed to man and maintain the hundreds of corvettes being commissioned during the crash expansion of the Royal Canadian Navy during the Battle of the Atlantic. Only one residence from 1814 and the Admiral's Residence from 1816 survived. The Admiral's residence (Admiralty House) in now the Maritime Command Museum. The original Naval Yard clock has been restored and moved to the Halifax Ferry Terminal entrance while the original Naval Yard bell is preserved at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, a museum which also features a large diorama depicting the Naval Yard in 1813 at its height in the Age of Sail.\n\nThe Canadian Forces Ammunition Depot Bedford, informally referred to as the \"Bedford Magazine\", is a major Canadian Forces property occupying the entire northern shore of Bedford Basin. It houses all of the ordnance for MARLANT vessels and has a loading jetty and several nearby anchorages.\n\nHMCS Trinity is the name of the organization housed at Stadacona which is tasked with maintaining MARLANT communications with vessels and other Canadian Forces and allied units, as well as developing strategic and tactical operational intelligence for unit commanders.\n\nHMCS Trinity operates two remote radio transmitter\/receiver stations near Halifax:\n\nFormerly a separate base known as CFB Shearwater, the airfield was realigned as part of CFB Halifax during the mid-1990s. 12 Wing, a Royal Canadian Air Force unit that reports to 1 Canadian Air Division, is the primary user of the Shearwater Heliport and is headquartered there. DND properties that were formerly aligned to CFB Shearwater, such as the Hartlen Point Golf Course and the Shearwater Jetty, are now part of CFB Halifax.\n\nHelicopter Operational Evaluation and Test Facility (HOTEF) is responsible for researching and testing state-of-the-art equipment for the CH-124 Sea King to enable crews to operate efficiently, ashore or while deployed."}

As you play you're going to get thousands of FOWed messages which you will need to decide to believe or not. Often you will have one of your own ships sunk where you know with 100% certainty which ship it is, and the game will report an incorrect name from the same ship class. It's the way it's designed. It all shakes out correctly over the following weeks and months in the Ships Sunk report.\n\n10-4 thx figured since combatreporter did'nt show it was to good to be true,oh well hope springs eternal.\n\nWith carriers (and sometimes cruiser\/BB float planes) there's a \"trick\" some people use (I don't personally) to verify a sinking immediately. Look at the lost planes report for the turn where the game reported a CV sunk. The entire air group might show up here, and if it does it should be \"fact.\" Sometimes planes in the air can re-base to another CV or a nearby land base and thus this won't work, but if the CV is surprised by a sub attack, or is alone, or for some reason has only a few planes in the air when attacked you can get some free intel. If you want to.\n\nWhy did they use the Saiun (Myrt) to take photos of the essex carriers instead of torpedoes?\n\nWhy did they use the Reisen (Zero) to attack B-24 and B-17 formations and carry small 60kg ordnance on strafing runs against heavy flak?\n\nWhy did they use Seiku (Emily) as transports instead of heavy ordnance or torpedoes?\n\nWhy did they build Gekko (Irving) when the Dinah was vastly superior?\n\nWhy did they wait so long to put the Ha-33-62 on the zero?\n\n... probably because hindsight gives all the right decisions..\n\nbut also they were not very smart.. and didn't have a clear understanding of how to co-ordinate their air forces and use the assets available in a way of a clearly defined weapon system (like 8th Air Force for example)\n\nSub Commander: Comms- Please send Radio message to CINCPAC - \"Scratch one Flattop!

It reminds indeed a bit of the 110s, Beaufighters or the faster Mosquitos, but it is substantially smaller and lighter. It seems the Japanese did test a light bomber version, but obviously the airframe does not support heavy external loads and the version was dropped. Since it was designed as a light, fast long-range recon aircraft that's probably not a surprise. It probably also suffered from a lack of armor.\n\nThe later Dinah types in AE are not bad, but I so far never produced them. Maybe it would be worth a try against 4EB? There is the Ki-46 III KAI and Ki-46 III KAII fighter versions, which have a comparably \"very high\" speed and maneuver bands and range exceeding those of the Ki-45 Ic and Id Nicks. They are armed worse than the d-Nick, but not much worse than the c version I would say (2x 20mm, acc. 56 or 58, don't remember exactly, range 500; plus a 37mm with acc. 6). The only big catch I can see is that the Dinahs are not armored, and the 4EB do already take some armored fighters for breakfast.\n\nSo maybe the Dinahs are just not worth it compared to the later Nicks. Has somebody used the Dinah as fighters in AE? Can you equip recon datai with the fighter versions later?\n\nYep Dinah was not well suited to be a fighter.. unless they went drastic and reduced the fuel load to the absolute minimum, making it a point-defence desteroyer, and even then.. would have been fast but not climb well\n\nalso on the Dinah III there are not many places to put armamament. The pilot basically sits in the nose itself.\n\nIf you removed the second crew member you could probably fit a 37mm cannon (like they did) and they changed the airframe back to a Dinah II style for the Dinah-III Kai interceptor.\n\nBoth of these caused bad aerodynamics and mitigated the advantages of the Dinah-III airframe.\n\nThese lessons were learned by Tomio Kubo and the Mitsubishi team when the Ki-83 was made. An overall streamlining and more space in the nose to house a battery of 4 guns.\n\nThough if the war progressed, few Ki-83 would have been built as it took two Ha-43 engines whereas a Shinden used 1xHa-43 and was faster and had the same firepower as the Ki-83."}

It wouldn't have rolled over and sunk like that did.\"\n\nOn its maiden voyage from Southampton, England to New York, Titanic struck an iceberg \u2014 one of many adrift in the Labrador Current \u2014 at about 11:40 p.m. on Sunday April 14, 1912. Less than three hours later \u2014 approximately 2:20 a.m. on April 15 \u2014 it was gone.\n\nThe massive ship could have withstood up to four compartment failures. The five that flooded were simply too much.\n\n\"Every good engineering design can be overcome by complacency and circumstances,\" Barker said.\n\nAnother fallacy is that Titanic suffered a long gash in its side.\n\n\"The gash was an easy way for writers to explain the damage, but in fact there wasn't any,\" Barker said. \"It was more just bending of the plates and popping of rivets the iceberg bumped and grinded the side that led to open plate seams in spots and the resulting inflow of water. The area of damage stretched for about 300 feet, one-third of the ship's length.\"\n\nOther ships preceding Titanic across the Atlantic sent messages, trying to alert its officers of the ice flow. However, radio operators got behind on sending out private messages from the Titanic's wealthy passengers, so some incoming warnings weren't delivered.\n\n\"They did receive many wireless reports of ice, but the captain felt that they didn't need to slow down because they would see the icebergs in time, not because he thought the ship was unsinkable,\" Barker said. \"He did have the ship take a course that was slightly farther south than usual, though. A couple of key wireless messages did not get delivered to the captain because they were not marked with the appropriate delivery suffix. Had these made it to the captain along with the others he had seen, it is possible they would have understood that what was ahead of them was a whole large area of sea ice and icebergs, and not just a few scattered bergs.\n\n\"Had they fully understood this, they might have slowed down. It was a moonless night without waves that made the bergs difficult to see. There may have been a very light patch of fog right around the berg that hindered visibility as well. The crow's nest did not have binoculars because they were accidentally not stowed on the ship before leaving Southampton. There was one set on the ship, but the bridge kept that set. There were supposed to be several sets on board but there was a provision stocking oversight in that regard,\" Barker said.\n\nThe Californian, another ship in the vicinity, turned off its wireless equipment at 11:35 p.m., so it never got the Titanic's calls for help.\n\n\"There was no 24-hour radio operation at that time,\" Barker said. \"The Californian never responded. The Carpathia did. That's the one that picked up all the people. I don't know if they (the Californian) could have gotten there any way. They were surrounded by ice.\"\n\nToday, it's beyond comprehension that ocean-going vessels wouldn't maintain constant radio communication. Mandatory 24-radio watch is one of many maritime changes brought about by this catastrophe.\n\nLack of lifeboats\n\nAnother change is the law requiring lifeboats and lifeboat drills for everyone on board. There's a misconception that Titanic didn't have enough boats because of the arrogant belief that it couldn't sink.\n\n\"That's another myth,\" Barker said. \"All the large ships didn't have enough lifeboats \u2014 the Lusitania, Mauritania, Olympic, Adriatic and many others. It wasn't just the Titanic. It was a widespread problem across the industry created by an outdated British Board of Trade shipping regulation established in 1894. There was a mathematical formula that described the carrying capacity of the lifeboats needed, based on a ship's tonnage. But the formula was flawed.\"\n\nAs a ship's tonnage grew, the formula didn't increase the corresponding amount of lifeboat space for all of its passengers and crew. Continued...\n\n\u2022 A rule stating that rockets could only be used to signal disasters. The Californian's crew saw flares from Titanic, but mistakenly thought it was a routine communication between commercial vessels, which did happen at times back then in this manner.\n\n\u2022 Design changes following the \"Safety of Life at Sea Conference.\n\nBuilding bigger and bigger\n\nIn 1840, Samuel Cunard started trans-Atlantic passenger service with a ship called the Britannia.\n\n\"Then other lines popped up,\" Barker said. \"A huge competition developed between the White Star Line and Cunard, just like Delta and American Airlines today. There was this race. Gradually the size of the ships increased.\"\n\nWhite Star built the 729-foot long Adriatic, only to be outdone by Cunard's 787-foot long Lusitania and Mauritania, the fastest ships yet that could cruise at 24-25 knots.\n\n\"White Star had to do something, so they came up with the Titanic,\" Barker said. Continued...\n\n\"Even by today's standards it's very impressive,\" Barker said. \"More than anything else they were proud of the electrification on this ship. It was the first ship to implement the massive use of ventilators. It was heavily ventilated, and all the first-class rooms had electric heaters. The power kept on going to the very end. It blinked out only when the ship split in half.\"\n\nDivided by class\n\nAnother myth promulgated by movies is that third-class passengers were trapped below deck by metal gates, Barker said.\n\n\"That isn't true,\" he said. \"The ship was a labyrinth. People panicked and got confused. They just didn't know where to go. There were no gates. Third class was almost as good as second class on a lot of other ships at that time. They weren't crowding people below decks. They actually had individual cabins.\"\n\nIn addition, class wasn't distinguished vertically, with the wealthiest people on upper decks and lower-income people on the bottom.\n\n\"The actual ship arrangement was mainly organized in a horizontal nature,\" Barker said. \"Third class was at the bow and stern areas, second class was near the fourth funnel area and a bit aft of that, and first class was from the bridge back to about the third funnel. All passengers in all classes had access to an open-air deck and could reach it in their own designated areas in their own staircases without any gates.\"\n\nLanguage barriers, lack of a good evacuation plan and invisible class barriers \u2014 the reluctance of lower-income passengers to go to first- and second-class areas \u2014 are the main reasons that many third-class passengers didn't reach lifeboats, Barker said.\n\nPrices ranged from $4,350 for a first-class parlor suite to the $36 to $45 charged for third-class tickets.\n\nNot booked to capacity\n\nTitanic was designed to carry about 3,500 people including 900 crew members. However, there were an estimated 2,207 people on board \u2014 roughly 1,300 passengers and the 900 crew when she sailed.\n\nOf these, 1,500 perished and slightly more than 700 survived.\n\n\"Many lifeboats were lowered with far less than full capacity,\" Barker said. \"Roughly, an extra 400 people could have been saved if the lifeboats had been full, maybe even 500 if they had been slightly overloaded. People just did not understand the seriousness of the situation until it was too late.\"\n\nThe number of passengers was about half what the ship could carry.\n\n\"In the movies they always portray the ship as being fully booked to add to the excitement of the film,\" Barker said. \"It was half full for a number of reasons. First of all, it was the off-season time of year for that sort of traffic. Second, there was a coal mining strike that caused great difficulty for many ships in those weeks and months leading up to the sailing. In fact, for the Titanic to have enough coal for the trip they had to take coal from other White Star vessels.\n\n\"I think another factor is that there had been a few delays getting the ship ready, so the trip had been postponed several times over the past 12 months and that uncertainty in the schedule might have prevented a few passenger bookings. J.P Morgan was going to be a passenger but had to cancel.\"\n\nAhead of its time\n\nOne of the most tragic aspects of the Titanic is that it had an outstanding radio system. Practices simply weren't in place to ensure its proper use as a tool for identifying navigation hazards and summoning emergency assistance.\n\n\"The ship had the most advanced wireless on the sea at the time,\" Barker said. \"It had a range of 2,000 miles. But radio as this kind of tool was still somewhat in its infancy. Wireless could have prevented the disaster if they had listened to the warning messages and plotted them correctly.\n\n\"What happened was the result of navigational mismanagement and bad luck,\" he said. \"The ship and the study of it is an interesting time capsule of the technology and culture of the era. We can learn a lot from it today and we are not all that far removed from it as we like to think.\""}

Sadly however her original timbers on her decks and and the upper part of her hull are badly charred. While some of these can certainly be salvaged, it will be at a cost of loss of thickness and mass. More serious is the fact that this ship's uniqueness is in part down to her having been built in a \"composite\" form, that is, wrought irn frames covered by oak planking. It is those frames that have suffered most through the fire. If they can be straightened, then she can be saved and restored.

{"text":"The UK did and did not favor heavy cruisers. The UK originally favored the 10,000 ton treaty cruiser size, as did the Japan and the US.\n\nThe UK, after the WNC 5 power treaty was signed, found it could not afford to build the number of cruisers that it felt it needed for trade protection if the cruisers were all 10,000 ton. The RN estimated the UK needed 70 cruisers. While the RN sought these, treasury said no.\n\nThe UK, thus, sought to have treaty cruiser displacement reduced to 7500 tons. The US and Japan thought this size was too small for the the Pacific and said no. (The US also felt that the UK was starting a naval race in cruisers and was none too happy about this, but the treaty allowed the UK to do this even if the US felt it was against the treaty's spirit.)\n\nFishers Follies were recognised as basically being ships without a job, their one action showed them to be fragile and not really fit for service, they would either be laid up pending disposal or looked at for conversions to CVs.

Not only were the G3s more expensive than the NelRods (and had most of the flaws that mad the NelRods probably the worst post WW I battleship class), the G3 were so long that they would required new facilities be built for mooring and servicing them.\n\nAnd as the British politicians recognized at the time, the construction of the G3s probably would have been even more unaffordable as it would have angered the Americans, who held huge amounts of UK debt. Beyond probably provoking a naval race with the US that the UK could neither afford nor win, the UK risked having the US destroy the UK's economy by taking such steps as demanding payment of the bonds at the original terms.\n\nThere was a strong distrust of imperialism in the US. Were the UK to have spent money on the G3s rather than making an attempt to repay their debt to the US, this anti-imperialism would have exploded.\n\nHow about Germany? What affect would the G3's have on the Kriegsmarine when it starts to rebuild a surface fleet?\n\nFishers Follies?\n\nCaptain Jack\n\nYou're got to allow for luck and also how much the G3's would have been upgraded or not. However:\na) 9x16\" [or 16.5\" is keeping the original design] guns v 8x15\"\nb) An advanced armoured design that includes many lessons from WWI plus tests afterwards against one that was designed by a nation which had built no capital ships since 1916, other than the twins. Not only did the Bismarck have less armour but it was markedly inferior in total and in layout. [The Bismarck had its main deck armour quite low, which maintained better buoyancy but meant anything above this deck was very vulnerable to bombs or shell fire. This is often cited as why Bismarck was disabled so quickly OTL].\nc) Probably also due to the lack of experience since WWI there were also doubts about the German shells, which had a lot of fires.\nd) Also I know the turrets of the twins were very poor, they even suffered serious flooding during action off Norway, I'm not sure if the Bismarck's was any better. While Britain did have problems with the 16\" shell, this was partly due to the design compromises made in cutting down the G3 design to the Nelson and partly to a mistaken interpretation of the lessons of WWI, which meant the Admiralty went from a heavy shell to a lighter one. However those problems had largely been resolved by the mid-30's.\n\nHence, the likelihood would have been that if the Bismarck came up against a G3 in Denmark strait its career would have ended there. Probably if it had come up against a Nelson the same would have applied, although in that case the Bismarck might have been able to use its superior speed to escapeThe failings of the armor scheme was that while the belt was thick, it was short and narrow relative to the practice of other nations.\n\nSimilar level of coverage length-wise as the Lexington class (60%); a taller belt (4.3m total with 1.4m below the waterline vs 2.8m) and greater slope (18 deg vs 11 deg)? Taller main belt than Hood (4.3m vs 2.9m... though Hood had two thinner belts above the main one)?\n\nNow I'm just a vaugly interested amature in this field and so may have missed some of the detai of armour perfomance but looking at that I'd say the G3's scheme compares quite well with contempary fast capitals ships.\n\nQuote:\n\nThey were less expensive to man and to fuel than the G3s would have been.\n\n400 men over and above a Nelson class? Or 600 men over an an Iron Duke or R class? Yeah... could be an issue but not to the extent it'd kill the program.\n\nQuote:\n\nThe NelRods did not require new facilities as they not nearly as long as the G3s would have been.\n\nDuring WW1 the poms had Hood and three sister ships on the slips... so it seems reasonable to say that the poms had at least four yards that should be capable of building G3s.\n\nQuote:\n\nAs I noted before, building the G3s may well provoke a naval race with the US. The UK could not afford afford a naval race with the US.\n\nThe poms retire a dozen old 12 inch gunned capital ships and shove a few 13.5in-ers into reserve... but somehow building four new Battlecruisers is going to drive the yanks into an arms race?\nEven if it does draw an american response it'll likely drive the yanks to complete the Eggshells-with-hammers they had on the slips rather than develop a new class.\n\n__________________\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by jamsodonnell\n\nOh come on, by the time Sealion appears the British will be covered head to foot in woad and throwing potatoes at the Panzers\n\nHow about Germany? What affect would the G3's have on the Kriegsmarine when it starts to rebuild a surface fleet?\n\nFishers Follies?\n\nCaptain Jack\n\nOops, sorry. Realised I mis-read your post. For some reason thinking it was how the German OTL ships would match against a G3 equipped fleet, most especially a G\u0141 v Bismarck.\n\nIn terms of actual German production difficult to say. If being logical then their existence might prompt the Germans not to build any new ships. The Bismarcks were about the best that Germany could produce before war would be likely and, with all experience of capital ship construction for two decades lost, were rather dated designs that would be outclassed by the G3s and probably anything Britain had produced since. Similarly the twins, which were the largest they could manage in the immediate aftermath of Hitler assuming power would be heavily outclassed. Hence possibly going for a trade war with more subs earlier.\n\nThis assumes of course that:\na) Germany considers only the UK as an enemy in naval terms. Since they could face a conflict with France, Russia or possibly some minor powers there are arguments for such ships.\n\nb) That Germany considers the issue rationally. Since for Germany we must read Hitler this is a big question. He rather liked the big ships, which were still the symbol of power at sea and wanted Germany to be number one at everything. Furthermore, even if you think subs can win a naval war with Britain, they can't support an invasion which Hitler might feel necessary.\n\nHowever there is more likelihood that Germany might go for a sub war a bit earlier, and\/or having some of the resources committed OTL to other areas. This would however mean than an even more powerful RN, which it would be without any treaties, wouldn't have as much of its strength tied down in Scapa watching for a German breakout. The only danger would be if Britain missed the signs of a sub build-up or because some gunnery fanatic gets too powerful doesn't develop the trade protection ships and doctrine of OTL. Which were only just about adequate once France suddenly fell.\n\nsharlin\n\nI'm not sure you're right here. They did build the three Hawkins but the latter E class were again markedly smaller.\n\nAfter the treaty was signed and with inadequate capital ship resources there was more argument for building up to the limit, hence the County's but Britain's primary need was for smaller trade protection cruisers, hence the smaller ships built latter. Numbers mattered more than size, at least until the government conceded to US demands in 1930 to number as well as tonnage limits. One of a series of errors in that period that turned a problem into a crisis later on.\n\nLarge ships were more important for the US, partly because of distances in the Pacific but, more importantly, because their purpose was offensive support of the fleet. Unlike Britain they didn't have a large overseas trade network or major possessions, let alone the criticality of the trade lines to the nation's survival. Even then it could be argued that they would have been better off with more, smaller cruisers as they were seriously deficient in scouts, the traditional fleet cruiser role. However they had the ability to spend more time tooling up for war than the other powers plus the increasing development of air power that increasingly covered the need.\n\nFor Britain the tonnage limits were a more serious problem and agreeing to numerical limits as well greatly compounded this. Hence Britain was always short of cruisers, despite building markedly more than the US pre-war and maintaining a lot of older C class cruisers from WWI.\n\nIt would have been better making clear to the US that while it fixated on Britain Britain had to deal with numerous more serious threats and hence needed a drastically different fleet that what the US desired for its own navy. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, the politicians of the period were unwilling to do this, or face up to the growing obsolescence of the fleet until it was too late. The mis-guided pacifism that was so strong at the time, along with the ill thought out economic programmes the assorted governments followed in the 20's and 30's.\n\nSteve, you may feel what I wrote is stupid but you have little reasonable or factual basis for your assertions. You misrepresent what I have posted in the past. You offer an interpretation of history that contrary to the facts and contrary to the interpretations of facts set out in scholarly texts. Basically, everything you wrote is wrong.\n\nI have indicated that the G3 was a flawed design, though not necessarily a \"bad\" design. (It was also an innovative design.) It would have had armor scheme with issues and other flaws. This is discussed in a number of sources. At my fingertips, is Jordan's Warships after Washington which makes the point that the G3s would have many of the same failings as the NelRods. I believe Worth also discusses these issues in his Fleets Of World War II. I believe I also have several other sources just in my own collection of naval books but I am going to comb through 80 or 100 volumes just to provide additional citations that you will just ignore explaining expansion was finally checked by the 5 Power Treaty of the Washington Naval Conference, which gave the the 5-5-3 UK, US, Japan ratios we are so familiar with. This treaty, which was engineered by Secretary of State Hughes, raised the ire of the US Navy. They felt betrayed. The US Navy's officials were not even allowed to testify in Congress at the hearings over the treaty, as they were opposed to it, and such testimony might have blocked the passage of the treaty or at least caused considerable political problems for the Republicans.\n\nWhat is particularly interesting to me is what O'Brien specifically points out about the US Navy's views at the time. Secretary of State Hughes and the US Navy both felt that the Japanese were a major adversary not to be trusted. But the Naval General Board had an official policy that also included a strong distrust of the UK. The US Navy Board felt that the UK was a major adversary and US needed to expand far beyond the 1916 plan to be able to meet and crush the threat the UK posed. The General Board set forth scenarios of an aggressive UK raiding the US eastern seaboard and invading from Canada.\n\nBeyond the US Navy, there were others who did have strong interests in larger US Navy. These did include business interests and Anglophobes (one of the few correct assertions you make). It also included such diverse groups as those who felt the US needed a stronger Navy to protect against foreign imperialism and those who wanted the US to have its own empire. President Harding, after all, campaigned on having a stronger US Navy.\n\nThus, the well documented scholarship in these books and similar well researched volumes set out, rebuts any claims of isolationism running rampant in the post-war United States.\n\nHence, pretty much everything you posted about my positions, the G3s, and the US political climate lacks support, Steve. Just because others have posted inaccurate and incorrect assertions does not make them correct when you repeat them.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by stevep\n\nPhilKearnyI am pretty sure that the Hood's sisters were scrapped on the yard before the end of the war.\n\nA RN that constructs the G3 and N3's isn't going to have any money for carriers, so they're probably only going to have the Argus and the Eagle. The Couragous\/Glorious\/Furious are likely to be scrapped instead.\n\nRodney Howe and Anson were authorised to be scrapped in October 1918 and had been scraped by August 1919. explainingWhile individuals in the UK such as Jellicoe and Churchill favored having the UK try to match the US 1916 program, cooler heads prevailed. Similarly, Sec. Hughes in the US saw continuing the 1916 plan as a waste if the US could end up through negotiations with a fleet equal to the UK and greater than Japan.\n\nI have read that Wilson argued for planning a bigger fleet to bring about disarmament, as it did. Likewise, I have read various sources that state that the G3s and N3s were attempts to bring about a treaty limiting the US fleet, as the UK could not afford to actually have a naval race.\n\nHence, the idea of G3s (and even more so the N3s) is very unlikely.\n\nAs our time reveals, due to budget cuts the UK had enough trouble in maintaining the ships it had over the next 15 years. Moretz goes into this in great detail.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by AdA imperial Japan after its naval race with the US ruins it's economy leaves the Pacific safe in US ( and Dutch, Australian and New Zelander hands)That article blames primarily the unreliability on the weight savings in the NelRods. It does not address the inaccuracy of the guns. The inaccuracy was inherent in the design as made clear from the article I cited. The combination of lighter shell and increased velocity yielded a less accurate gun with shorter barrel life. Thus, the G3s would have been armed with a weapon that would have been less accurate and with a very limited barrel life.\n\nFurther, some of what is in that article not supported by the sources that the article cites, most of which I have purchased. (I do admit that I have not been to Imperial War Museum or National Maritime Musem to review original documents. I do have copies the other sources.) For example, Campbell notes that the switch from water to oil hydraulics was done to decrease maintenance, not to save weight. Campbell also notes that the slower loading was endemic to British turrets of the period. Thus, given the heavy shell, the fact at best only part of the slow rate of fire is accounted for by weight savings, and the performance of the turrets that were actually built, odds are the rate of fire would have been an issue for the G3s.\n\nBottom line is that the turret and guns as finally built did not work well. Given the history of the NelRods, along with numerous problems with the later KG V turrets, there is little to suggest that the G3 turrets would have been much better.\n\nI would go on but I have a 4 hour drive I need to make. That is all until next weekend.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by PMN1 imperial Japan after its naval race with the US ruins it's economy leaves the Pacific safe in US ( and Dutch, Australian and New Zelander hands)\n\nAdA\n\nSo you're basically saying that Britain finds it cheaper and better to maintain and upgrade 10BB and 6BCs that are effectively obsolete rather than a smaller number of new ships? I could see Australia keeping its BC for prestige reasons plus some suggestion that with an extensive rebuild it might make a efficient cruiser killer. However, while that might be effective I doubt the RN would be interested in any of the other three I class. [New Zealand paid for her BC but didn't have the resources to maintain it so left it to the RN to man and maintain]. Can't see Lion or Princess Royal being worthwhile upgrading significantly and definitely not the old coal-fired BBs.\n\nI agree that the balanced fleet with a decent force of cruisers and DDs would be the RN's saving grace. Even more so than OTL as with no treaty Britain wouldn't have its cruiser and DD strength artificially restrained.\n\nNot sure the US carrier forces would be that much weaker as pretty certain the US wouldn't be building more than the 4 Washington's as willingness was exhausted, so suspect they would still convert a couple of BCs. Not sure what Japan would do as they would probably seek at least 4BB, including the Nagato and Mutsu to match the US and also what Britain would almost certainly build. [There might be doubt about the G3s in political circles, but with both the US and Japan producing major new ships I think public pressure would outweigh the desire to cut costs further.\n\nIf somehow the US built all their 1916 programme then their fleet is going to be in deep trouble as its going to be highly unbalanced and very short of funding for any updates. If it does do this then the Japanese could well bankrupt themselves to try and compete and Britain will build something additional to the 4G3s.For compability with the Dutch in a combined low cost force with British support to give some political weight to the \"we're not totally dependent on the US\" argument. The French would still build ships, but for the Atlantic and the Med."}
{"text":"just a pun - as so many ships in the past came from the Navy after WWII. Some of which where vary nice - the 205ft sea going tugs were great little shipsActually, the problem with nuclear power for smaller ships is power\/weight ratio - smaller ships (escorts, destroyers, frigates, cruisers, etc.) generally need to be capable of higher speeds than nuclear power can deliver for their weight.

{"text":"After the Battle of the Denmark Straights and the destruction of the HMS Hood on May 24th. The Bismarck was successful in alouding it's pursuers and for a brief time disappears into the North Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe location and destination of the Bismarck became a matter of wide speculation among the British. If she had been heavily damaged by the Prince of Wales, would she double back and return to Germany? If she was only slightly damaged, would she head for the French coast for repairs or rendezvous with a naval auxiliary vessel to accomplish any necessary repairs at sea? Would she rendezvous with a tanker to take on more fuel? Would she immediately begin operations against convoys in the North Atlantic? The British did not have sufficient resources to adequately cover all of those possibilities, so it became a matter of assessing their probabilities and prioritising the allocation of resources to cover the various alternatives.\n\nDuring the day of 25th May, the Bismarck was forced to reduce her speed during the day to a more economical 20 knots instead of her maximum sustained speed of 28 knots. A repair crew was later able to bypass some of the damaged pipes and valving and thereby allow part of the fuel reserves earlier cut off to be tapped for use, but this only slightly alleviated the problem.\n\nAt 0300 on 26th May, two American-built Consolidated PBY-5 (Catalina) flying boats assigned to RAF Coastal Command took off from their base in Northern Ireland to conduct a long-range search for the Bismarck.\n\nAt about 1030, an observer aboard one of the aircraft spotted the wake of a ship below, and the pilot (Dennis Briggs) immediately turned the plane toward the ship for a closer look.\n\nAs soon as the ship could be identified as a large warship, possibly a battleship, its position was radioed back to their base.\n\nAs soon as the Catalina flying boat had come into view, the Bismarck immediately opened fire on it with her anti-aircraft batteries, thereby advertising the fact that she was an enemy warship. About an hour after being spotted by the Catalina, the Bismarck had another unwelcome intruder, a Swordfish on a scouting mission from the Ark Royal, which had just arrived in the area with Force H\n\nAfter more than 31 hours of breaking contact, the Bismarck had been discovered again. Now that the Bismarck had been discovered, it would just be a matter of time before all of the available resources of the Royal Navy would be thrown against her.\n\nThe only hope of destroying the Bismarck was to slow her down sufficiently for the battleships to be able to catch up with her. This task obviously fell to the aircraft carrier Ark Royal, as only her torpedo planes had the range and weapons to do the job.\n\nPreparations were immediately undertaken to launch an air strike against the Bismarck as soon as possible that afternoon. The Swordfish aboard the Ark Royal were fuelled, and 18in torpedoes were latched to their underbellies as their crews were being briefed. At 1450 on 26 May, 15 Swordfish aircraft took off from the Ark Royal and headed for the last known position of the Bismarck. Their pilots had just been advised that their target was alone in the area, but in fact the light cruiser Sheffield had been ordered to move up astern of the Bismarck and keep her under observation. The signal concerning the Sheffield had not been deciphered on the Ark Royal in time to alert the Swordfish pilots.\n\nThe Swordfish pilots obtained radar contact with what they thought was Bismarck (Sheffield) at 1540 and pressed their attack against the ship shortly after. Fortunately, the Sheffield was not hit by any of the 11 torpedoes that were launched against her. All of the Swordfish aircraft returned safely to Ark Royal at about 1700.\n\nAboard the Ark Royal they knew they only had one more attempt in trying to stop or at least slow down Bismarck as the German battleship would reach the French coast the next day.\n\nAt 1915, another fifteen Swordfish took off from the Ark Royal.\n\nThe Swordfish attack took place at 2047. Bismarck was hit by a torpedo amidship which caused no damage. But then she was hit by a torpedo in the starboard rudder area. According to the rudder indicator, the rudder was jammed at 12\u00ba or 15\u00ba to port. Despite that the German anti-aircraft fire was very intense none of the Swordfish aircraft was shot down.\n\nAt 2140, Admiral L\u00fctjens sent the following message to Group West: \"Ship unable to maneuver. We will fight to the last shell. Long live the F\u00fchrer\".\n\n(the battle continues)\n\nCheers mates David\n\nEdited by Skylark (05\/26\/1203:14 PM)\n\n_________________________ \"The further backwards you look, the further forwards you can see\" Winston Churchill"}

{"text":"Superior's Shipwreck Coast\n\nNot all that go down are found\n\nJuly 29, 2012\n\nMARQUETTE - Nothing inspires a good ghost story or a legend like a graveyard.\n\nLying at the bottom of Lake Superior are hundreds of enticing mysteries, shipwrecks buried in one of the many graveyards of the Great Lakes. But one 200-mile stretch of water between Grand Marais and Whitefish Point has earned the name the \"Shipwreck Coast.\"\n\nMore ships have perished on Shipwreck Coast than in any other location on Lake Superior. Nearly 100 ships have met their demise on this shoreline, taking numerous people with them. The most well-known sinking is the Edmund Fitzgerald ore carrier, which sank to the bottom of Lake Superior about 17 miles north-northwest of Whitefish Point on Nov. 10, 1975.\n\nArticle Photos\n\nThis file photo by Bob Campbell shows the Edmund Fitzgerald in the St. Marys River in May 1975. (Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society photo)\n\nA photo of the restored Fitzgerald bell in the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum. The bell was recovered on July 4, 1995. (Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society photo)\n\nOn Nov. 14, a U.S. Navy plane with a magnetic anomaly detector was able to detect a magnetic pull 17 miles from Whitefish Point. In the days proceeding, a side-scan sonar was used to locate two large pieces of a ship. In May of 1976, The U.S. Navy's CURV III controlled underwater recovery vehicle was used to take pictures of the ship and on May 20, the words, \"Edmund Fitzgerald\" were seen, upside down on the ship's stern, 535 feet below the surface.\n\nAfter the ship was discovered, family members of the 29 crew members lost on the Fitzgerald voiced their concerns of leaving the ship undisturbed, out of respect for the dead. The family members did, however, suggest recovering one artifact from the ship, to serve as a symbol of remembrance of those who had perished. The Fitzgerald Bell was chosen and after numerous dives, was recovered July 4, 1995. It is now on display at The Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum in Whitefish Point.\n\nMany theories have been formulated over the years as to why the Fitzgerald, and many ships like it, have sunk along that coast.\n\nArticle Links\n\n\"When you have a stretch of 200 miles of water with prevailing northwest winds, it builds terrific seas that cause these shipwrecks on dangerous waters,\" said Fred Stonehouse, a local maritime historian. Stonehouse said the greatest number of shipwrecks were between the 1880s and 1900, a period that saw a high volume of shipping.\n\n\"Although there was less shipping on this lake (Lake Superior), it was far more deadly,\" Stonehouse said.\n\nAside from severe weather patterns, another cause of ships sinking was collisions. As shipping lanes grew more crowded, any cause of reduced visibility could, and often would, result in ships colliding. Still another possible cause was brittle steel. When large steel plates were manufactured for ships, the quality control capability during this period wasn't sufficient.\n\n\"When subjected to the right conditions, they would literally crack, causing the ship to break into pieces and sink. One theory is that the Titanic had brittle steel and cracked when it came in contact with the iceberg,\" Stonehouse said, adding, The Shipwreck Coast \"is the most desolate coast you will ever see. It makes you wonder how many bodies are buried on that beach.\"\n\nScuba enthusiasts are attracted to ships that have been discovered and are dive-able, including the Comet, the John B. Cowle, the steamer Vienna and the Cyprus.\n\nThe Cyprus, a new steel freighter bound with ore to Minnesota in 1907, broke up and sank. Only one crew member survived the wreck. The ship was recovered by the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society in 2007.\n\nBut an even greater lure is the undiscovered shipwrecks.\n\nAmong the ones that haven't been located is the S.S. Henry B. Smith. The Smith was set to leave port during the Great Storm of 1913, which blew from Nov. 8 through Nov. 13 and caused 20 ships to sink on the Great Lakes. Capt. James Owen, who was pressured by the owners of the ship to make his deliveries, left the dock before his crew had a chance to secure the hatches.\n\n\"The whole town is watching Smith pull out. ... Finally the storm became too heavy to see the ship and that was the last it was ever seen,\" said Sean Ley, development officer for The Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society.\n\n\"Every diver wants to find the Smith wreck ... people would just go crazy if is was found\" Ley said.\n\nToday, The Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society works to highlight local shipwrecks. One program the group initiated was the Underwater Documentation Project. In 2008, the society received a grant from the Michigan Department of Transportation to document five wrecks. The funds paid for 80 percent of the cost to record the ships with still imagery and video.\n\n\"With so many wrecks in Michigan waters, it's not going to be up to us to document all of them, but at least we did this project as a model to show how it could be done,\" Ley said."}

{"text":"The Brooklyn Navy Yard Was a Ground Zero for Asbestos\n\n\"My father worked as a welder for the Brooklyn Navy Yard during and just after the war. He'd come home from work, very dusty\u2026.full of soot\u2026powder. I would take his clothes to the Laundromat twice a week. I don't remember how long I did it\u2026I just wanted to help my mother. She knew the stuff was bad, and tried her best to keep it out of our house, but it didn't matter, really. My father said he literally laid in the asbestos powder and the dust\u2026\"\n\nThe Brooklyn Navy Yard, located in Brooklyn, New York, was one of the most important shipbuilding facilities on the east coast. In an effort to fortify American efforts during World War II, employees were expected to perform a number of potentially life threatening tasks. They were in charge of repairing Navy vessels and constructing new ones. They routinely conducted electrical work, sandblasting, welding, pipe fitting and insulating. Most, if not all, of these activities involved asbestos in some capacity, which meant that the workers were in contact with the deadly fibers on a regular basis.\n\nDuring World War II, \"the Brooklyn Navy Yard's workforce swelled to over 70,000 employees,\" including women. By 1966, when former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara closed the Brooklyn Navy Yard the amount of employees dropped to \"approximately 9,000.\" (Brooklyn Navy Yard)\n\nHere is a list of some of the sea vessels constructed or repaired at the Brooklyn Navy Yard:\n\nUSS Austin (LPD4)\n\nUSS Alexander Hamilton\n\nUSS Algonquin\n\nUSS Bennington\n\nUSS Brooklyn (CL40)\n\nUSS Constellation (CVA64)\n\nUSS Dolphin (SS169)\n\nUSS Fairfield\n\nUSS Helena (CL50)\n\nUSS Iroquois\n\nUSS Mosholu\n\nUSS Wasp (CV18)\n\nDuring World War II, \"airplanes of all types- fighters, bombers, transports etc., developed rapidly. The Americans produced the largest numbers of generally superior warplanes,\" (Ace Pilots) and the Brooklyn Navy Yard witnessed the building and launching of three such carriers:\n\nUSS Constellation\n\nUSS Independence\n\nUSS Saratoga\n\nWhy was the construction of these vessels so perilous?\n\n\"The health hazards of asbestos were known for some time prior to the 1940s. In 1942, Philip Drinker of the Harvard School of Public Health issued a report on asbestos dangers. It stated: \"Asbestosis is caused in connection with the handling of asbestos. This is not unlike silicosis in its effects and we rather expect it to occur in shipyards because we have seen asbestos being handled in installation work with little or no precautions.\" (CRC Net Base)\n\nAside from the expected dangers that accompanied the handling of heavy equipment, employees of the Brooklyn Navy Yard had to contend with an additional danger: asbestos. The carcinogen was used to insulate virtually every chamber in the naval ships, from engine rooms to sleeping quarters. Those who participated in the construction of aircraft carriers also risked exposure to asbestos. It was used in the construction of airplane engines, brakes, valves, adhesives and hundreds of other items.\n\nInvolvement in the construction and repair of the ships and planes was not the only way a Brooklyn Navy Yard employee such as your father could have been exposed to asbestos. Asbestos was used in the construction of buildings and others facilities in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, which meant that even those who did not personally handle asbestos, were at significant risk of exposure.\n\nLike many Americans, the workers of the Brooklyn Navy Yard praised the victory of America and her allies, which could not have been accomplished without the grueling work of shipyard employees across the United States. Sadly, as the decades passed, many of these men and women found that they could not perform the most basic tasks without tremendous effort. This was not a result of advanced age, but of their exposure to asbestos as young people. Brooklyn Navy Yard employees and other shipyard workers \"account for a large percentage of asbestos plaintiffs\u2014about half of all asbestos claims pending in 1983 were brought by shipyard workers.\" (Lexis Nexis)\n\nNot long after our inception, Weitz & Luxenberg secured a $75 M dollar verdict for a group of former Brooklyn Navy Yard workers, who had been exposed to asbestos in the 1940s and 1950s. This money was invaluable in helping them finance any necessary medical treatments, and also to establish a trust fund for their families. It was one of our landmark cases.\n\nWeitz & Luxenberg: We can get justice for you\n\nWeitz & Luxenberg has been a leader in Mesothelioma and asbestos related litigation for over two decades.

Based on the Spanish Navy's PRINCIPE DE ASTURIAS design and constructed by Spanish shipbuilder Baz\u00e1n, CHAKRI NARUEBET was ordered in 1992, launched in 1996, and commissioned into the RTN in 1997. The aircraft carrier is designed to operate an air group of V\/STOL fighter aircraft and helicopters, and is fitted with a ski-jump. Initial intentions were to operate a mixed air group of Matador V\/STOL aircraft and S-70B Seahawk helicopters. However, by 1999, only one Matador was operational, and the entire V\/STOL fleet was removed from service in 2006. Although CHAKRI NARUEBET was intended for patrols and force projection in Thai waters, a lack of funding brought on by the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis means that the carrier has spent much of her career docked at the Sattahip naval base. CHAKRI NARUEBET has been deployed on several disaster relief operations, including in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, and in response to separate flooding incidents in late 2010 and early 2011. Outside of disaster relief, the carrier's few other departures from port are for a single training day per month, and transportation of the Royal Family of Thailand, leading to claims by some naval commentators that the ship is merely an oversized royal yacht. When Typhoon Gay hit Thailand in 1989, the Royal Thai Navy, as the main unit responsible for search and rescue missions, found that its ships and aircraft were unable to withstand the rough weather at sea. Moreover, the Royal Thai Navy needed a new, high-technology ship to modernize its fleet. The original plan was to acquire a 7,800 ton vessel from Bremer Vulcan, but the Thai government cancelled the contract on 22 July 1991. A new contract for a larger warship to be constructed at Baz\u00e1n's shipyard in Ferrol, Spain, and was signed by the Thai and Spanish governments on 27 March 1992.The proposed vessel was based on the design of the Spanish Navy aircraft carrier PRINCIPE DE ASTURIAS, which in turn was based on the United States Navy's Sea Control Ship concept. Some defence industry websites refer to the ship as an \"Offshore Patrol Helicopter Carrier\". CHAKRI NARUEBET is the smallest aircraft carrier in operation in the world. CHAKRI NARUEBET is fitted with two 0.5-inch machine guns, and three Matra Sadral sextuple surface-to-air missile launchers firing Mistral missiles. The missile launchers were installed in 2001. The vessel is also fitted for but not with an 8-cell Mark 41 Vertical launch system for Sea Sparrow missiles, and four Phalanx close-in weapon systems. The carrier was designed to operate an air group of up to six AV-8S Matador V\/STOL aircraft, plus four to six S-70B Seahawk helicopters. CHAKRI NARUEBET is also capable of carrying up to fourteen additional helicopters; a mix of Sikorsky Sea King, Sikorsky S-76, and CH-47 Chinook. There is only enough hangar space for ten aircraft. The Matador is a first generation export version of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, acquired secondhand from the Spanish Navy in 1997. The nine Spanish aircraft (seven standard version plus two TAV-8S trainer aircraft) were refurbished by Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uticas SA firm before delivery. By 1999, only one aircraft was operational, and the RTN was looking for other first-generation Harriers to cannibalize for spares. In 2003, the navy attempted to acquire several second-generation, ex-Royal Navy Sea Harriers FA2 aircraft from British Aerospace, but the deal did not go ahead. The inoperative Matadors were finally eliminated from service lists in 2006. Thailand was the last remaining government using first generation Harrier airframes. The flight deck measures 174.6 by 27.5 meters (573 by 90 ft). A 12\u00b0 ski-jump assists V\/STOL aircraft to take off. There are two aircraft lifts, each capable of lifting 20 tons. She arrived in Thai waters at the start of August 1997, and formally entered service on 10 August. CHAKR NARUEBET cost US$336 million to build. CHAKRI NARUEBET is the first aircraft carrier to be operated by a Southeast Asian nation She is assigned to the Third Naval Area Command, and her intended duties include operational support of the RTN's amphibious warfare forces, patrols and force projection around Thailand's coastline and economic exclusion zone, disaster relief and humanitarian missions, and search-and-rescue operations. However, at the time the carrier entered service, the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis prevented the necessary funding to operate the ship from being available. Consequently, CHAKRI NARUEBET is usually only operational for a single day per month for training, with the rest of the time spent alongside as a \"part-time tourist attraction\". The ship rarely leaves the proximity of the Sattahip naval base, and when she does, it is usually to transport and host the Royal Family of Thailand. Naval commentators consider CHAKRI NARUEBET to be less an aircraft carrier and more the world's most expensive royal yacht, while the Thai media have nicknamed the ship \"Thai-tanic\", and consider her to be a white elephant. Between 4 and 7 November 1997, CHAKRI NARUEBET participated in disaster relief operations following the passage of Tropical Storm Linda across the Gulf of Thailand and the Kra Isthmus. The carrier's main task was to search for and assist any fishing vessels affected by the storm. Flooding in the Songkhla Province resulted in the carrier's mobilization in late November 2000. CHAKRI NARUEBET was anchored at an island marina off Songkhla, and used as a base for helicopters and small boats transporting food, supplies, and wounded. In January 2003, anti-Thai riots were sparked in Phnom Penh by incorrect news reports of a claim by a Thai actress that the Angkor Wat temple complex belonged to Thailand, not Cambodia. CHAKRI NARUEBET was sent to help with any evacuation of Thai citizens from Cambodia. Following an undersea earthquake in the Indian Ocean, tsunamis struck multiple regions around the Indian Ocean, including the Andaman Sea coast of Thailand. The personnel of CHAKRI NARUEBET were part of a 760-strong response by the Thai military to the disaster. This task force was involved in search-and-rescue around Phuket and the Phi Phi Islands, treatment of wounded and handling of dead, and repair work to schools and government facilities. During the August 2005 filming of Rescue Dawn, a dramatized biographical film of US Navy pilot Dieter Dengler and his capture during the Vietnam War, the flight deck of CHAKRI NARUEBET was used to represent the carrier USS RANGER. In November 2010, the ship was involved in flood relief operations following the 2010 Thai floods; anchored off Songkhla Province, relief supplies and food were airlifted to people in the region, while hospital patients were evacuated by the ship's helicopters.

By September 1946, she began her shakedown cruise in the Caribbean area with Air Group 20 embarked.\n\nUpon returning from shakedown exercises, PHILIPPINE SEA was ordered back to Boston to prepare for the Navy's Antarctic Expedition, Operation Highjump. On 29 January 1947, in the Antarctic region of the South Pacific, Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd and his party were flown from the ship to begin their polar explorations from Little America.\n\nDuring the remainder of 1947, PHILIPPINE SEA operated in the Atlantic and Caribbean. In the spring of 1948, the ship was deployed to the Mediterranean to join Vice Admiral Forrest Sherman's 6th Fleet. With Air Group 9 on board, PHILIPPINE SEA showed the American ensign in France, Greece, Tunisia and Sicily. In June 1948, the huge carrier returned to the United States.\n\nDuring the summer, PHILIPPINE SEA was engaged in developing doctrine for carrier control approach landings, the sea going equivalent of GCA. November found her exploring the lower rim of the Arctic Circle in a cold weather operation designed to test planes, ships, and equipment.\n\nIn January 1949 the ship was again ordered to the Mediterranean, with Air Group 7 embarked. Returning at the end of May' the ship went immediately into overhaul at the Boston Naval Shipyard. Early autumn found the ship once more in the Caribbean, \"shaking down,\" this time with Air Group 1. Operational development projects with jet fighters and task force exercises in the North Atlantic kept the ship and her air group busy until the end of the year.\n\nOperating again from her base at Quonset Point, PHILIPPINE SEA was employed during the winter of 1950 in qualifying carrier pilots and, for part of February and most of March, took part in extensive fleet exercises in the Atlantic and Caribbean. April and May were taken up with demonstration cruises for guests of the Secretary of the Navy, the Armed Forces Industrial College, Air War College, and the Armed Forces Staff College.\n\nOn 24 May, PHILIPPINE SEA sailed from Norfolk, Va., passed through the Panama Canal, and arrived at her new homeport of San Diego, Calif., to become a welcome addition to the Pacific Fleet.\n\nWith the outbreak of war in Korea, PHILIPPINE SEA was ordered to Pearl Harbor, She sailed for Hawaiian waters on 5 July with Air Group II embarked. The ship departed for the forward area 24 July. Leaving Pearl Harbor, PHILIPPINE SEA sailed at full speed for the Western Pacific, reaching Okinawa 4 August.\n\nPHILIPPINNE SEA sailed into action off Korea as flagship of Task Force 77 on 5 August. She launched air strikes to rain thousands of tons of bombs, rockets, and napalm down on strategic targets. As many as 140 sorties a day were launched from the carrier. Except for time out to re-arm, refuel, or repair for brief periods, PHILIPPINE SEA was in action continuously.\n\nOperating with other carriers of Task Force 77, she hit North Korean rail and communication centers from Seoul to Wonsan in September. In the Yellow Sea she put on a major performance softening up the Inchon invasion coast. D-Day, 15 September, found PHILIPPINE SEA planes ranging far inland to destroy any attempts by the enemy to bring up reinforcements. Following the initial assault, she continued to provide close and deep support for the thrust inland to Seoul.\n\nTwo months later when the Chinese Communists surprised the United Nations ground troops with a smashing drive south, down the middle of the peninsula, PHILIPPINE SEA planes dived through snow and sleet to hold back the Red hordes. Throughout the long retreat from the Yalu, the ships' Panther jets, Skyraider attack bombers and Corsair fighter bombers blasted the path for the trapped Marines. Hill after hill was cleared all the way to Hungnam where PHILIPPINE SEA and other carriers of Task Force 77 sent up a virtual aerial umbrella Hundreds of carrier planes swarmed over the tiny evacuation perimeter from which 150,000 troops and civilians came sea.\n\nPutting into Yokosuka Naval Base, Japan, in late March 1951 for rest and repair, PHILIPPINE SEA exchanged Air Group 11 for Air Group 2 from Valley Forge. The same date as the transfer, 28 March, PHILIPPINE SEA became flagship of Vice Admiral H. M. Martin, Commander 7th Fleet.\n\nFrom the Sea of Japan in April, PHILIPPINE SEA led Task Force 77 and other elements of the 7th Fleet down through the Strait of Formosa to the South China Sea. From the Formosa Strait, planes paraded over the island of Formosa in an attempt to bolster Nationalist morale. After this demonstration of strength, the force steamed back to Korea three days later, in time to lend close air support to the embattled ground forces. Every Chinese offensive of the spring of 1951 suffered staggering losses in personnel as planes of PHILIPPINE SEA peppered the Reds with deadly fragmentation bombs.\n\nPHILIPPINE SEA returned from her operations in Korean waters and the western Pacific to arrive at San Francisco 9 June 1951. Yard availability and operations along the West Coast continued until the ship departed from San Diego 31 December. Arriving at Pearl Harbor 8 January 1952, PHILIPPINE SEA continued on to Yokosuka, Japan, arriving 20 January.\n\nPHILIPPINA SEA returned to San Diego in August 1952. Her designation was changed to CVA in October. With Carrier Air Group 9 embarked, she got underway once more for the Far East early in December 1952. Air strikes from the carrier cut Communist supply and transportation arteries. The North Korean offensive, begun at the same time the first truce overtures were extended, marked the beginning of a series of \"round the clock\" air sorties in support of frontline UN troops.\n\nThe ship arrived in Alameda Naval Air Station 14 August 1953 to off-load Air Group 9, then entered dry-dock at Hunter's Point for overhaul. On 9 January 1954 PHILIPPINE SEA once more began training off the coast of San Diego. She then headed west 12 March for her fourth tour in the Far East. She operated out of Manila.\n\nThe most significant event of the cruise occurred in late July. Communist planes had shot down a Cathay-Pacific Airways passenger liner somewhere near Hainan Island off the Chinese coast. PHILIPPINE SEA was ordered into the area as part of a search mission with the hope that the remaining survivors might be found. While engaged in the search mission, a flight of the ship's Skyraider aircraft was attacked by two Communist fighter aircraft. Under orders to fire only if actually attacked, the Skyraiders returned the fire and shot down the Communist planes. Later this came to be known unofficially as the \"Hainan Incident.\"\n\nThe ship returned to San Diego, Calif., in November. Remaining in the area for four months, PHILIPPINE SEA conducted extensive training operations off the California coast. She began her fifth cruise of the Far East 1 April 1955 en-route Yokosuka. She operated in waters of Japan, Okinawa, and Taiwan. On 15 November she was redesignated as a...\n\nFOCH (R 99) was the second Clemenceau-class aircraft carrier of the French Navy. She was the second warship named in honour of Marshal Ferdinand Foch, after a heavy cruiser commissioned in 1932, and scuttled in Toulon on 27 November 1942. Ironically Ferdinand Foch is famously quoted in 1911 saying \"Airplanes are interesting toys but of no military value\" although this was only eight years after the first powered human flight. The draft statute prepared by the Naval General Staff in 1949 asked four aircraft carriers of 20,000 tons to be available in two phases. At its meeting of 22 August 1949, the Supreme Council of the Navy was even more ambitious where they asked six aircraft carrier fleet. On 15 July 1952, the French Navy still wanted two to five with the French Union (not available to the NATO ). According to the RCM 12, the final document of the Lisbon Conference of 1952, France should make available NATO aircraft carrier in the D-day, two on day 30, three on day 180. But by 1953, the Navy had to be satisfied with two aircraft carriers. The PA 54 Clemenceau, budgeted in 1953, was delayed until November 1955, the PA 55 Foch, budgeted for 1955, was delayed until February 1957. Between 1980 and 1981, she underwent a study to certify the platform before catapulting aircraft carrying missiles, bombs, AM-39 Exocet and tactical nuclear bombs. Like her sister ship the CLEMENCEAU, the FOCH underwent a modernization and refit, replacing 4 of her 8 100mm guns with 2 Crotale air-defense systems. Unlike the CLEMENCEAU, the FOCH lemen in 1997 also received 2 Sadral launchers (for 6 Mistral missiles each); those launchers were purchased by France in 1994. The Dassault Rafale was test flown from the FOCH (but not CLEMENCEAU) after deck modifications in 1992 and operated from this carrier after further 1995-6 deck modifications. After a 37-year career in the French Navy, on 15 November 2000, she was sold to the Brazilian Navy, and renamed NAe SAO PAULO. In the French Navy, she was succeeded by the CHARLES DE GAULLE (R 91). In 1977 F-8 Crusaders from 14.F squadron on FOCH participated in the Saphir missions over Djibouti. On 7 May 1977, two Crusaders went separately on patrol against what were supposedly French Air Force (4\/11 Jura squadron) F-100 Super Sabres stationed at Djibouti. The leader intercepted two fighters and initiated a dogfight as part of the training exercise, but quickly called his wingman for help as he had actually engaged two Yemeni MiG-21 Fishbeds. The two French fighters switched their master armament to \"on\" but, ultimately, everyone returned to their bases. This was the only combat interception by French Crusaders. In 1983\u20131984, the ship was sent to Lebanon for combat operations during the civil war with an air wing consisting of six F-8 Crusaders, fifteen Super-Etendards, three Etendard IVPs, five Br 1050 Aliz\u00e9s and six SA-321G Super-Frelons. She would rotate with CLEMENCEAU providing constant on station air support to French peacekeepers. In October 1984, France sent FOCH for operation Mirmillon off the coast of Libya, in response to tension in the Gulf of Sidra. She was involved in the Yugoslav Wars between July and August 1993, in February and March 1994, and in February and from May to July 1994 in support of UN operations. 15 November 2000 decommissioned. NAE SAO PAULO (A12) is a Clemenceau-class aircraft carrier currently in service with the Brazilian Navy. The SAO PAULO was first commissioned in 1963 by the French Navy as the FOCH and was then transferred to Brazil in 2000 where she became the new flagship of the Brazilian Navy. The aircraft carrier SAO PAULO was constructed in France between 1957 and 1960, and served in the French Navy as the FOCH. In September 2000, she was purchased by Brazil to replace the aged World War II-era carrier MINAS GERAIS (which had been in commission for over 40 years) for US$12 million, no aircraft included. The government of Brazil had already purchased a flotilla of used A-4 Skyhawk fighters from Kuwait for $70 million which, together with the existing helicopters already in the national defense inventory, were to compose the fighter-bomber group of SAO PAULO. These A-4s (designated AF-1) are capable of carrying armament including rockets, free-fall bombs and Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. The SAO PAULO was purchased while still operational, which was an unusual process for such a large ship. She was received by the Brazilian Navy and was incorporated into the Brazilian Navy on November 15, 2000. The incorporation of SAO PAULO and the AF-1 fighter group marked the realization of Brazil's long-held goal of being able to conduct aerial defense of its naval forces with fixed-wing aircraft. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso noted during the transfer ceremony that \"The transfer of the aircraft carrier SAO PAULO to the Operative Sector of the Navy adds to our naval power an important magnification in its ability of defense of the Brazilian interests at sea. A country as ours, possessing an extensive coast, with more than 7,000 kilometers of coast, requires a naval power compatible with its stature in the international scene. Today, as before, Brazil is concerned about implementing concrete measures that offer the nation the guarantee of respect to its sovereignty. We are and we will always be a nation that fights for peace, however, that does not mean being able to do without modern Armed Forces, enabled and endowed with adequate dissuasive potential. Few countries, even today, have the capacity to operate with efficiency in the high seas. It is important that Brazil continues to be one of them.\" Since her construction, the SAO PAULO has received multiple upgrades, leaving her with a diverse range of technologies. In her current form, she is expected to remain effective in her role for the foreseeable future, though further modernization efforts are expected as she is converted into a combat ready vessel. In the first three years of service as the SAO PAULO, the ship completed several missions, some in foreign waters, particularly Operations ARAEX, PASSEX, and TEMPEREX, which is used annually to qualify and train Super Etendards and S-2T Turbo Trackers of the Argentine Navy.[ The SAO PAULO currently serves mainly to train pilots to fly carrier operations. She is actively used for the qualification and re-qualification of rotary and fixed-wing pilots (with about 500 catapult launches) and the first Brazilian exercises to practice carrier-based attack missions. During 2005-2010, the SAO PAULO underwent an extensive modernization program. The upgrade included inspection and repair of the steam turbines, maintenance of the surface condensers, retubing of boilers, repair of two high-pressure compressors, revision of the AC electrical generator, purchase of spare parts; maintenance of pumps, valves, and structural items, purchase of two API oil-water separators, installation of two water cooling units, upgrade of the chemical oxygen generator, repair and treatment of oil tanks, substitution of the Naval Tactical Data...\n\nThe Barbados stamp shows the CALAMAR, the first of this type of ship to appear on stamps, for she is a fishery training ship, and is owned by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.

{"text":"Tag Archives: shipwreck\n\nIn my last post I touched on the shipwreck of the Dundonald on Disappointment Island in 1907, and the rescue of its survivors by the Hinemoa when she was taking scientists to the Auckland Islands. The Auckland Islands were on a major shipping route, but the available charts were not always accurate, and several ships were wrecked there in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The twelve Dundonald crew who survived spent eight months on the islands during a freezing sub-antarctic winter, eating what they could catch, and making shelter without any equipment.\n\nSurvivors of wreck of the barque \"Dundonald\". From the album: 1907 Sub-Antarctic Expedition. November 1907, Auckland Islands. Attributed to Samuel Page. Te Papa\n\nSmashed on the cliffs\n\nThe Dundonald was sailing from Sydney to England with a cargo of wheat when she ran aground on the 6th of March, 1907. Some survivors gave their story to the newspapers when they finally returned to the mainland. These extracts from Charles Eyre's account were published in the Auckland Star on 2 December 1907.\n\n\" The weather on the night of the 6th of March was very thick and heavy \u2026 Suddenly the land was seen right ahead. We tried to wear the ship short round, but she would not stay, and went stern first into a crevice of the cliffs. Orders were given to clear the lifeboats, but it was found to be useless, as there was a big sea, and rocks all around us \u2026 One tremendous sea washed clean over us, and although we managed to hang on, the next one washed us all away \u2026 I caught hold of one of the shrouds and climbed up (the mast)\".\n\nThe next day Eyre found that several other men had spent the night clinging to the mast. Eventually they struggled to shore. \"There were sixteen of us out of 28 that got ashore, which left twelve to be accounted for as drowned \u2026 we were all very much exhausted when we got ashore, being very hungry and cold \u2026 Later on we discovered there was no depot (of emergency supplies) on that island. This was a great disappointment to the mate \u2026 he sank rapidly and died the twelfth day after the wreck.\" The mate was an elderly man called Jabez Peters, from Glasgow. Among those who died in the wreck were Captain Thorburn and his young son, and sailors from around the UK and Scandinavia.\n\n\"The first day after getting ashore, we subsisted on raw mollymawk. \u2026 We managed to scrape through the winter all right by living on sea hawks, mollymawks, and seals \u2026 we did not know how to kill (the seals). At first we used to whack them with a stick, but one of the fellows happened to hit one on the nose, and it rolled over, so after that we had no difficulty in dispatching them.\"\n\nThe men soon realised they would need some form of shelter to survive the snows of winter. \" We then decided to dig holes in the ground, which we did with our hands. Above the holes we built up sticks and put sods on top, forming huts about six feet long and four feet wide\". One of their huts was used as a cook-house by the scientific expedition which eventually discovered and rescued the men.\n\nShipwrecked mariners camp, Disappointment Island. The Auckland Islands are just visible on the horizon. From the album: 1907 Sub-Antarctic Expedition. November 1907, Auckland Islands. Attributed to Samuel Page. Te Papa\n\nA desperate plan\n\n\"(We) knew the depot was on the other island, which was about six miles distant, but we did not know how to get across. \u2026 In July three men built a boat of canvas and sticks. To do this we had to put pieces of our clothes and blankets and sew them together, and the task was all the harder as the ship's sailmaker and carpenter were both drowned.\"\n\nThe first boat made it to the main island, but the men couldn't find the depot, and returned empty handed after several days of searching. A second boat was smashed as it left shore. \"We build a third (boat) in October \u2026 we got to the large island, but as we reached the shore we struck a rock and the boat was smashed, sending us all into the water \u2026 the mishap put out a fire we had carried in the boat on a sod. We had carried it in order to save matches, of which we had only two. These got wet, and even after drying them for three days we could not get a light.\" Without a fire, the men subsisted miserably on raw seal meat.\n\nFrame of coracle used by shipwreck survivors to reach Relief Depot, Auckland Islands, where whaleboat was stored. Charles Eyre is on the left, and another survivor, John Gratton, on the right of the boat. From the album: 1907 Sub-Antarctic Expedition. November 1907, Auckland Islands. Attributed to Samuel Page. Te Papa\n\nThe men walked fifteen miles across the island to locate the depot. \"There was a good boat at the depot, but no sails, so we cut up our clothes to make a sail \u2026 we had found clothes at the depot and exchanged them for what we were wearing, and we had also cut each others' hair and beards, which over the seven months we were on the other island had grown so long that we looked like a lot of 'spring poets'. As we got near our old camp our mates did not know us in our new 'toggery' and they thought we were sealers.\"\n\nThe survivors then moved over to the main island and kept close watch for the Government steamer which called at the islands every six months. The small amount of biscuits and tinned meat they found in the depot was carefully rationed in the meantime \u2013 the butter, coffee, tea and sugar which should have been there had been stolen.\n\nRescue\n\nCharles and the others were finally rescued when the Hinemoa arrived on 16 November. Before they left the islands, they retrieved the first mate's body from Disappointment Island and buried him at the small cemetery at Port Ross, alongside other shipwrecked mariners. The ceremony was attended by all the survivors, the crew of the Hinemoa, and the members of the scientific expedition.\n\nI awoke to find that the boat had moved over night to the bottom end of the Auckland Islands, into Carnley harbour, with Adams island to our south. Adams island is home to Gibson's wandering albatross \u2013 DNA research is currently being carried out to determine if Gibson's Albatross is distinct from other wandering albatross species.\n\nWe had incredibly calm weather and took a zodiac ride up one of the arms of the misty harbour to visit what was left of the wreck of the Grafton. One of the great tales of survival of early sailing in the our sub-Antarctic seas. The five men aboard set about extending one of their life dingies, they had to even make their own nails! they made a sturdy little craft to take three of them back to New Zealand in search of help for the two men left behind.\n\nWreck of the Grafton. Photo Anton van Helden, copyright Te Papa.\n\nNow what is left of the Grafton is used primarily as a sealion hangout.\n\nOur investigations on the rocky shore revealed something that surprised me, a spider living in the intertidal zone! I hope that when I get back to Te Papa that my photo will be enough to help Phil Sirvid identify it.\n\nWe spent the morning looking at areas within Carnley Harbour, including an area where rata trees were once cut down by the crew of a German merchant vessel at the start of World War Two. They used the wood as fuel to enable their vessel to reach Chile.\n\n\"Figure of Eight\" Island is home to the most southern breeding site for NZ sealions in the Auckland group. Unlike sealions at Sandy Bay on Enderby Island these sealions breed in the bush on this small flat islet.\n\nIt has been a calm sailing so far, and so there has been a chance to give lectures and have debates. The primary one today being about the NZ sealion and their interactions with the commercial fishery for arrow squid. Lots of things may be influencing the decline of the this sealion population, however it seems clear that fisheries are unlikely to be completely blameless in this. Female NZ sealions, have to work very hard to get the food they need to be able to keep themselves in good condition and to pass that on to their dependent pups. The squid fishery coincides with the exact time when female sealions are foraging hardest to meet the demands of supplying milk to their pups. NZ sealion is the only sealion in the world where the survival of females is less than that of males: it is mostly female sealions that historicaly have been caught as by-catch in the squid fishery. Which surely can not help when a population like this is affected by other influences like disease outbreaks and even normal levels of predation.\n\nSealion Exclusion Devices (SLEDs) have been put in the trawl nets of the fishery. There is much debate about the chances of a sealion surviving being thrown out of a net at 200m depth. the fishing industry claims that they are now not catching any sealions, but perhaps these SLEDs are just removing the evidence of mortality from their catch.\n\nI have been keeping a look out for Whales\u2026you can only see them if you look!\n\nHeading south.

{"text":"ship that sank\"You can mark Gettysburg or Manassas, (but) how do you mark a battlefield in the sea?\" said Jim Delgado, the director of maritime heritage for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, and the person overseeing the project.\n\nOn Monday, a team of archaeologists and technicians began two days of scanning the wreckage using a sonar imaging technology that hadn't been used yet at sea, Delgado said.\n\nOn Monday aboard the research vessel, Manta, researcher Christopher Horrell gleefully pored over computer images of the Hatteras' stern and paddlewheels that had just been transmitted from the seafloor.\n\n\"This is what I got into archaeology for. It's fantastic,\" said Horrell, a senior marine archaeologist for the Department of the Interior.\n\nThe images, taken by a roughly 2-foot-long cylindrical device deposited near the wreckage, were used to position divers who then used 3-D scanning devices to map the site. The sand and silt-filled water near the seafloor limited the divers' visibility to 3 to 10 feet, and it makes filming or photographing the wreckage difficult. But it doesn't affect the sonar technology, which produces images by analyzing sound waves bouncing off of objects, allowing scientists to capture a more complete look at the wreckage.\n\nDelgado said he's hoping to post the images online for the public by January, in time for the 150th anniversary of the battle. He said he also hopes researchers review them to look for ways to preserve the wreckage.\n\n\"Whatever we can do to make it accessible,\" Delgado said. \"We want to share this with folks and show people history is real.\"\n\nThe wreckage site was discovered in the early 1970s by a Rice University professor, according to Amy Borgens, the Texas state marine archaeologist.\n\n\"We knew it was here but didn't know exactly,\" she said. \"One of the problems with shipwrecks is you can't take people down there to show them.\n\n\"And there's all this drama with shipwrecks, which are almost always the result of a tragedy.\"\n\nThe Hatteras wreck is in waters administered by the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the ship itself still remains property of the U.S. Navy.\n\nAccording to the Navy Historical Center, the 1,126-ton Hatteras was built in 1861 in Wilmington, Del., as a civilian steamship. Later that year, it was purchased by the Navy, commissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard and assigned to join the blockade of the Florida coast to keep vessels from delivering supplies and munitions to the Confederacy. It had an active tour, in Florida, raiding Cedar Keys, destroying at least seven schooners and facilities before being transferred to the Gulf.\n\nOn Jan. 6, 1863, it joined the fleet commanded by David Farragut, of \"Damn the torpedoes\" fame, for similar assignments off of Galveston, which was then the most prominent city and port in Texas, which had joined the Confederacy. Five days later, it pursued and tracked down a three-masted ship that identified itself as British, but later opened fire on the Hatteras from 25 to 200 yards away and revealed it was actually the CSS Alabama, a notorious Confederate raider.\n\nForty-three minutes later, with the Hatteras was burning and taking on water, Cmdr. Homer Blake surrendered, and he and his crew were taken aboard the Alabama as prisoners, eventually winding up in Jamaica. Of the 126-man crew, two were lost and are believed entombed in the wreck, which became the only Union warship sunk by a Confederate raider in the Gulf.\n\n\"It's hard to believe we're in the middle of a battlefield,\" said Ed Cotham, the project historian, who carried with him Monday an original photograph of Blake, a formal portrait showing the officer in his uniform. \"It's the first time he's returned since January 1863.\"\n\nBefore the work began, a wreath was placed in the Gulf, red and white rose petals were scattered on the water's surface and a priest, the Rev. Stephen Duncan, conducted a brief memorial service for the two crewmen, William Healy, 32, a coal heaver, and John Cleary, 24, a stoker, in what was likely the first religious service for them ever at the site. Both men, from Ireland, probably were Catholic, he said. No relatives are known to be in the U.S. and it likely took years for their relatives back in the Civil War times to learn of their fate, he said.\n\nThe Alabama, which was credited with some 60 kills, was eventually sunk thousands of miles away, when a Union ship attacked it in the English Channel in June 1864 after it underwent repairs in a French port.\n\nEarlier on HuffPost:\n\nLoading Slideshow\n\nA group of seven Civil War battlefield photos of unidentified persons is seen at he Museum of the Confederacy in Richmond, Va., in a Friday, May 25, 2012 photo.

Two examples of leg irons, also called shackles or bilboes, have been recovered from the QAR site so far. One shackle was identified via X-radiography and still remains in concretion. The second has been cleaned and exhibits cord wrapping in a manner as those recovered from the wrecked slave ship Henrietta Marie. The wrapping may have helped protect the legs of the ship's enslaved human cargo.\n\nA brass sight for a surveying device was found 3 ft. from the pivotal mount, and the two pieces may have came from the same instrument. The sight (height 6 in.) is slotted twice for rough and pinpoint aiming, and the larger slot (1.8 x 0.4in.) is bracketed by two holes that would have held a crosshair. A setscrew attaches the sight to an index that is broken at a threaded fastener hole. When intact, the index would have held a second sight with opposing slots.\n\nA rectangular sandstone whetstone (4.2 x 1.5 x 0.6 inch) exhibits considerable usage patterns along the edges. This artifact may have been used to sharpen cutlasses, knives, boarding axes, or other edged weapons and tools.\n\nA brass bar with logarithmic scales on three of its four faces features decorative finials on either end. This lone representative has been identified as gunner's bar or tally stick that would have been used to calculate shot and bore diameters.\n\nA brass side plate, fashioned in a serpent motif was recovered from the concretion containing Cannon 4. \"Serpent sideplates\" are well documented in the archaeological record and were common on firearms throughout the 18th century.\n\nThe lock is a true flintlock, with no dog latch and is set on the half cock position. Locks of this type can be easily distinguished from the earlier dog locks by the shape of the tumbler that incorporated a reliable half cock, thus eliminating the need for the dog latch. Though the French possibly invented true flintlocks in the middle 17th century, dock locks were being used by the English military in the first decades of the 18th century.\n\nThis is an example of an English gun barrel or musketoon barrel of a style typically found aboard ships during the latter half of the 17th century, and throughout the 18th century. Though commonly referred to as a blunderbuss, the English Board of Ordnance distinguished flaring muzzle shotguns with barrels less than 20-inches in length as gun barrels, and those over 20-inches as musketoons. With a length of 27-inches, this example clearly falls into the latter category. The letter V beneath a crown indicates that the weapon had been \"viewed\" and approved for testing. Read more \u00bb\n\nTwo hand grenades were found attached to a pewter platter recovered in 1998. The grenades are cast iron spheres packed with gunpowder and pierced to accept a hollow wooden fuse. The fuse also contained powder and a paper match, and was lit and thrown at the enemy with devastating results. Occasionally the fuse was too long, giving the intended victims the opportunity to return the grenade to the pirates. Identical examples were recovered from the pirate ship Whydah Galley, lost off Cape Cod in 1717.\n\nBar-type shot are represented in the cannon ammunition assemblage. These contrivances consisted of two parts connected by an iron bar. They were used at close range to slash through the rigging and sails of an enemy ship.\n\nOf the cannons that have been cleaned, four were loaded and each contained waddage used to pack their respective cannon loads. Since most cannons recovered from shipwrecks are not loaded, these cannon and their contents contain important information concerning naval artillery practices from the early 18th century. The variation of the fiber types used to make waddage indicates that sailors used what ever pieces of old ropes were available. The cordage scraps, generally made of hemp, were picked apart and combined to form the wads for any one of the cannon."}

{"text":"Youth\n\nIn the year 1900, a socialist agitator visited \u00d6sterby to talk to\nthe workers of the mills. Karl Kilbom, only 15 years old, was one\nof the 7 people who stayed after the meeting to participate in the\nformation of a socialist club in \u00d6sterby with the goal to establish\na union. However, company spies had been\npresent at the meeting and soon Kilbom was told he would not only\nlose his job, but also that his family, who lived in a house owned\nby the company, would be evicted, if he didn't quit political\nactivism. This time, Kilbom gave in to the\nthreats.\n\nBecoming a Socialist\n\nIn 1903, Kilbom moved to Sandviken where\nhe joined a socialist club. However, he didn't remain active there for\nlong when he soon found job on a ship named Thetis, embarking from G\u00e4vle shipping\nlumber from Sweden to England and other\nplaces. The conditions for the workers on the boat were\nwretched and the pay was low, but Kilbom saw this as a great\nopportunity to explore the world, although, according to his\nautobiography, he had severe problems with seasickness.\n\nIn 1905 Kilbom disembarked the Thetis in G\u00e4vle.\nUnemployed, he joined the Social Democratic youth organization in\nthe city, and he was schooled by the prominent socialist Fabian M\u00e5nsson to be an agitator.\nKilbom\nsoon moved to Krylbo and Avesta to work for the party there.\n\nWearing a navy uniform.\n\n1907.\n\nIn 1907,\nKilbom was conscripted to do military service in the Swedish Navy and he soon found himself on the\nnavy base of Skeppsholmen in Stockholm, and stationed on the battleship Svea. While in the navy, Kilbom got in\ntrouble with the commanders for spreading, what they called,\n\"illegal\" Social Democratic papers with anti-militarist messages.\n\nAfter\nmilitary service, Kilbom moved to Gothenburg and started working at a plant manufacturing\nsafes, and became a leader of the union\nthere. He also became more and more active in the Swedish Social Democratic\nParty and started to study Marxism. He\nwas asked by the party to go on national speaking tours to spread\nthe word of socialism to the workers in every corner of Sweden, and\nfor many years Kilbom was without a home, always on the road.\n\nBecoming a Communist\n\nIn 1910,\nKarl Kilbom moved to Halmstad to do work for the Social Democratic party\nthere. Within the party, Kilbom sided with the Left\nOpposition led by Zeth H\u00f6glund\nagainst the reformist party leader Hjalmar Branting. In 1917 the party\nsplit in two and Kilbom joined its Left-leaning faction, which\nsupported the Bolsheviks in Russia and was\ncalled the Social Democratic Left Party of Sweden.\nIt soon evolved into the (original) Communist Party of Sweden. Already in\n1915, Karl Kilbom had been made one of the main Swedish contacts\nwith the Russian Bolsheviks and worked closely with Bukharin who lived in Sweden during the war.\n\nIn the\nspring of 1917, Kilbom was sent to Finland on behalf of\nthe Swedish Left-Socialist to persuade the Finnish Social Democrats\nto turn left too, but he soon realized that the Finnish socialists\nwere already further to the left than himself, and in less than a\nyear Finland would experience its own workers revolution.\n\nFrom\nFinland, Kilbom traveled to Russia together\nwith his Finland-SwedishcomradeKarl\nH.Wiik, and after\nsome difficulties at the border, they arrived in Petrograd and were greeted by Alexandra Kollontay. In Petrograd\nKarl Kilbom was taken to see a debate between Kerensky and Lenin in front of\na huge crowd of workers and soldiers. Kilbom did not understand\nwhat the speakers said, but afterwards Kollontay told him Lenin had\nspoken about the importance of making peace with Germany, while\nKerensky had been speaking of continuing the war. The same evening,\nKilbom had a chance to talk to Lenin briefly. They had met once\nbefore in Stockholm, and the Bolshevik leader now told him that a new\nrevolution, in which the communists would take power, was imminent,\nand that he hoped the Swedish comrades would be prepared for the\nsame.\n\nBack in Sweden, Kilbom started working for the newly launched Left\nParty paper Politiken.\n\nRevolutionary Work\n\nK.\n\nKilbom - membership card of the Comintern\n\nIn December 1917, a month after the October Revolution, Kilbom, together with\nZeth H\u00f6glund, went to Soviet\nRussia to spend the New Years and show their support for the\nBolsheviks. At the Smolny the Swedes\nmet with their Finnish Comrades, who were very happy after Finland\nfinally having been given independence from Russia by the Bolshevik\nGovernment.\n\nIn 1919, Kilbom was approached in Stockholm by the American\ndiplomats William C.Bullitt and Lincoln Steffens, who asked him if he could\nhelp them get to Russia and into contact with the Bolshevik\ngovernment. Kilbom took the Americans to meet Lenin in\nMoscow and he greeted them as they said they wanted establish\ndiplomatic relations between the USA and Soviet Russia. However, soon,\nPresident Wilson repudiated the\nproject and Bullitt resigned from Wilson's staff.\n\nIn 1921,\nKarl Kilbom was the head of the Swedish delegation at the Profintern congress (Red International of Labor\nUnions) held in Moscow.\nTheir interpreter was a 17-year old girl named Zoia and they soon\nbecame good friends. One morning, Zoia didn't show up, and Kilbom\nlater found out that she had been arrested by the Soviet Secret\nPolice as one of many suspects in a counterrevolutionary\nconspiracy. Kilbom refused to believe these allegations were true\nand spoke to high ranked Soviet officials like Karl Radek and Alexandra Kollontay to have the young\ngirl released. Zoia was freed, and when she said she didn't want to\nstay in the Soviet Union, Karl Kilbom decided to marry the young\ngirl so she could come with him to Sweden, where she helped the\nparty working as a translator of Russian.\n\nIn 1921,\nSweden held its first democratic election where workers and women\ncould vote, and Karl Kilbom was elected to the Lower House of the\nRiksdag.\n\nLeader of the Swedish Communist Party\n\nIn August 1924, Zeth H\u00f6glund was\nexpelled from the Swedish Communist Party, after having begun\ncriticizing the development of the Comintern. Kilbom now took over\nas leader of the party.\n\nIn 1925, Karl Kilbom headed a delegation of 300 Swedish workers on\na several weeks long visit to the Soviet Union. The tour ended with a\nparade on the Red\nSquare in Moscow, where Kilbom, together with Bukharin and Rykov, held a\nspeech from atop the Lenin Mausoleum.\n\nThe same year, Kilbom was asked by Bukharin to go to Germany as a\nrepresentative of the Communist International to overlook the\ndevelopment of the Communist Party of Germany. Kilbom had been to\nGermany on political missions several times and the German police\nhad started to recognize him. Because of this, Kilbom was now\ndenied visa by the German Embassy in\nStockholm. He decided to take the train to Copenhagen, where he made a new attempted at the German\nEmbassy in Denmark. Kilbom was denied visa once again, but\ninstead he managed to get help from some sailors and was smuggled\nonboard a boat that took him to Germany. There he was greeted by\nWilli M\u00fcnzenberg who bought\nhim a new suit and provided Kilbom with a fake passport with the\nname Karl Derry. He spent over three\nmonths in Germany and Austria, working to eliminate the ultra-leftist fractions within the Communist\nparties.\n\nBack in Moscow in 1926, Kilbom reported to Stalin about his work in Germany and expressed his\nconcern about Ernst Th\u00e4lmann not\nbeing a capable leader for the KPD. Stalin met the allegations\nagainst Th\u00e4lmann with silence, and Kilbom would soon find out that\nTh\u00e4lmann would be one of Stalin's closest allies in the unfolding\ninternal struggle of the world communist movement.\n\nZinoviev wanted to send Kilbom on\nnew missions for the Comintern to China and France, but Stalin\nobjected. In 1927, Zinoviev together with Trotsky were expelled from the CPSU.\n\nIn 1927, Karl Kilbom tried to work within the Comintern on how to\ndevelop strategies to combat fascism and to\ndefend the Soviet Union against attacks from the Capitalist world.\nKilbom advocated the creation of a popular\nfront suggested that communists should try to collaborate with\nradical social democrats. The\nItalian communist leader Togliatti\nagreed with Kilbom that the only way to defeat the fascist leader\nMussolini in Italy would be for the\ncommunists to unite with the social democrats. Stalin opposed\nKilbom's suggestions and together with Ernst Th\u00e4lmann, who now saw\nKarl Kilbom as a personal enemy, Stalin started to develop the idea\nof Social fascism, i. e. that social\ndemocrats were just as bad as fascists.\n\nExpelled from the Communist Party\n\nIn the fall of 1929, a Stalinist coup took\nplace within the Swedish Communist Party, and Karl Kilbom together\nwith the majority of the party's members were expelled by a group\nled by Hugo Sill\u00e9n and Sven Linderot.\n\nKarl Kilbom in the 1950s\n\nThat same year, Kilbom launched a new Communist Party of Sweden,\none that would be independent from Moscow, and became more critical\nof Stalin and the Soviet Union. In 1934 his party took the name\nSocialist Party\n(Socialistiska partiet). The party's supporters were generally\ncalled Kilbommare after Kilbom while the Comintern affiliated Communist Party members were\ncalled Sill\u00e9nare after their party leader Hugo Sill\u00e9n. The first couple of years, the\nKilbom-Party was much bigger than the official Communist Party.\nKilbom also managed to keep control over the communist daily\nFolkets Dagblad\nPolitiken.\n\n1931 was the year of the \u00c5dalen\nMassacre, when the Swedish military opened fire on a\ndemonstration of strike, killing five\nworkers. Kilbom wrote in Folkets Dagblad Politiken,\ncalling the Swedish conservative government of Carl Gustaf Ekman a murder regime.\nFor this\n\"slander\", Kilbom was sentenced to two months in prison to be\nserved at L\u00e5ngholmen, but he was eventually pardoned due to lung disease.\n\nBack to Social Democracy\n\nIn 1937 Karl Kilbom was expelled from the Socialist Party, as the\nleadership was taken over by Nils Flyg.\nLater, during World War II, Nils Flyg turned the remnants of the\nparty into a pro-nazi organization as he sided with Hitler in the\nwar against Stalin. But by then, most members of the party had\nalready left together with Kilbom.\n\nIn 1938 Karl Kilbom rejoined the Swedish Social Democratic Party.\nKilbom became very active as a leader within the Folkets hus movement."}

{"text":"Ernest Shackleton's Tin of Sardines\n\nErnest Shackelton was captain of his famous Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, on which he was determined to reach the South Pole and be the first person to cross Anartica coast to coast, via the South Pole. He was going to start at the southernmost part of South America and finsh at the southernmost part of New Zealand. The ship left for the South Pole on December 5, 1914. Sadly, when the ship was only one day from its destination it got stuck in the ice. The ice proved to be too thick and solid to break through and all the ship and crew could do was drift with the ice. The crew soon came to the conclusion that they'd be stuck there until the ice thaws in the spring. The only fresh meat the crew had to eat were seals and penguins. After 281 days of being trapped in the ice, the crew came to the inescapable conclusion that the ice had crushed the ship beyond any hope of repair. They abandoned the ship, walked across the ice, and began to search for land. Before abandoning the ship the crew saved as many supplies as they could. The 28 men of the expedition were now isolated on the drifting pack ice hundreds of miles from land, with no ship, no means of communication with the outside world and with limited supplies. What was worse was that the ice itself was now starting to break up, as the Antarctic spring got under way. Ernest never gave up hope, that was the only reason his men didn't give up. They made landfall on Elephant Island, 5 months after they abandoned the Endurance and 497 days since they last set foot on solid ground. Sadly, they weren't out of the woods yet. They had no way of calling for help and no ships passed by Elephant Island. The nearest whaling station was 800 miles away across the most inhabitable place on the planet. Shackleton and a few of his men decided to go for help while the rest would endure on Elephant Island. It took Ernest 16 days to reach South Georgia Island, but they were still 22 miles away from the whaling station. Two of Shackleton's men were too weak to make the journey and decided to stay behind. They crossed glaciers, icy slopes and snow fields to reach their destination. After reaching their destination, they first put some dry clothes on and got some rest. The next thing they did was retrieve the sailors that were wailting for them on the South Georgia coast and then headed for Elephant Island. In 1917, after four attempts to reach the island, the remaining crew of the Endurance had been rescued, surrviving 105 days on the island. Shackelton died at the age of 47 and was buried on South Georgia Island; today his grave is a popular tourist attraction. Supposedly the only items that surrvived the journey were Shackleton's logbook, adze and cooker."}

{"text":"Fleets & Commanders\n\nBattle of Dogger Bank - Background:\n\nThe opening months of World War I saw the Royal Navy quickly assert its dominance around the world. Taking to the offensive soon after the beginning of hostilities, British forces won the Battle of Heligoland Bight in late August. Elsewhere, a surprise defeat at Coronel, off the coast of Chile, in early November was quickly avenged a month later at the Battle of the Falklands. Seeking to regain the initiative, Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, commander of the German High Sea Fleet, approved a raid on the British coast for December 16. Moving forward, this saw Rear Admiral Franz Hipper bombard Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby, killing 104 civilians and injuring 525. Though the Royal Navy attempted to intercept Hipper as he withdrew, it was unsuccessful. The raid caused widespread public outrage in Britain and led to fears of future attacks.\n\nSeeking to build on this success, Hipper began lobbying for another sortie with the goal of striking at the British fishing fleet near Dogger Bank. This was motivated by his belief that fishing vessels were reporting the movements of German warships to the Admiralty allowing the Royal Navy to anticipate the operations of the Kaiserliche Marine. Commencing planning, Hipper intended to move forward with the attack in January 1915. In London, the Admiralty was aware of the of the impending German raid, though this information was received through radio intercepts that were decoded by Naval Intelligence's Room 40 rather than reports from fishing vessels. These decryption activities were made possible by using German code books which had been captured earlier by the Russians.\n\nBattle of Dogger Bank - The Fleet Sail:\n\nPutting to sea, Hipper sailed with the 1st Scouting Group consisting of the battlecruisers SMS Seydlitz (flagship), SMS Moltke, SMS Derfflinger, and the armored cruiser SMS Bl\u00fccher. These ships were supported by the four light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group and eighteen torpedo boats. Learning that Hipper was at sea on January 23, the Admiralty directed Vice Admiral Sir David Beatty to immediately sail from Rosyth with the 1st and 2nd Battlecruiser Squadrons which were comprised of HMS Lion (flagship), HMS Tiger, HMS Princess Royal, HMS New Zealand, and HMS Indomitable. These capital ships were joined by the four light cruisers of the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron as well as three light cruisers and thirty-five destroyers from the Harwich Force.\n\nBattle of Dogger Bank - Battle Joined:\n\nSteaming south through good weather, Beatty encountered Hipper's screening vessels shortly after 7:00 AM on January 24. Approximately half an hour later, the German admiral spotted the smoke from the approaching British ships. Realizing that it was a large enemy force, Hipper turned southeast an attempted to escape back to Wilhelmshaven. This was hampered by the older Bl\u00fccher which was not as fast as his more modern battlecruisers. Pressing forward, Beatty was able to see the German battlecruisers at 8:00 AM and began moving into a position to attack. This saw the British ships approach from behind and to the starboard of the Hipper. Beatty chose this line of approach as it allowed the wind to blow funnel and gun smoke clear from his ships, while the German vessels would partially blinded by their own.\n\nCharging forward at speeds of over twenty-five knots, Beatty's ships closed the gap with the Germans. At 8:52 AM, Lion opened fire at a range of around 20,000 yards and was soon followed by the other British battlecruisers. As the battle began, Beatty intended for his lead three ships to engage their German counterparts while New Zealand and Indomitable targeted Bl\u00fccher. This failed to occur as Captain H.B. Pelly of Tiger instead focused his ship's fire on Seydlitz. As a result, Moltke was left uncovered and was able to return fire with impunity. At 9:43 AM, Lion struck Seydlitz causing an ammunition fire in the ship's aft turret barbette. This knocked both aft turrets out of action and only the prompt flooding of Seydlitz's magazines saved the ship.\n\nBattle of Dogger Bank - An Opportunity Missed:\n\nApproximately half an hour later, Derfflinger began scoring hits on Lion. These caused flooding and engine damage which slowed the ship. Continuing to take hits, Beatty's flagship began to list to port and was effectively put out of action after being struck by fourteen shells. As Lion was being pummeled, Princess Royal scored a critical hit on Bl\u00fccher which damaged its boilers and started an ammunition fire. This led to the ship slowing and falling further behind Hipper's squadron. Outnumbered and short on ammunition, Hipper elected to abandon Bl\u00fccher and increased speed in an effort to escape. Though his battlecruisers were still gaining on the Germans, Beatty ordered a ninety degree turn to port at 10:54 AM after reports of a submarine periscope.\n\nRealizing this turn would allow the enemy to escape, he revised his order to a forty-five degree turn. As Lion's electrical system was damaged, Beatty was forced to relay this revision via signal flags. Desiring his ships to continue after Hipper, he ordered \"Course NE\" (for the forty-five degree turn) and \"Engage the Enemy's Rear\" to be hoisted. Seeing the signal flags, Beatty's second-in-command, Rear Admiral Gordon Moore, misinterpreted the message as Bl\u00fccher lay to the northeast. Aboard New Zealand, Moore took Beatty's signal to mean that the fleet should focus its efforts against the stricken cruiser. Relaying this incorrect message, Moore broke off the pursuit of Hipper and the British ships attacked Bl\u00fccher in earnest.\n\nSeeing this, Beatty attempted to correct the situation by hoisting a variation of Vice Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson's famed \"Engage the Enemy More Closely\" signal, but Moore and the other British ships were too far away to see the flags. As a result, the assault on Bl\u00fccher was pressed home while Hipper successfully slipped away. Though the damaged cruiser managed to disable the destroyer HMS Meteor, it finally succumbed to British fire and was finished off by two torpedoes from the light cruiser HMS Arethusa. Capsizing at 12:13 PM, Bl\u00fccher began to sink as British ships closed to rescue survivors. These efforts were broken off when a German seaplane and the zeppelin L-5 arrived on scene and began dropping small bombs at the British.\n\nBattle of Dogger Bank - Aftermath:\n\nUnable to catch Hipper, Beatty withdrew back to Britain. As Lion was disabled, it was towed to port by Indomitable. The fighting at Dogger Bank cost Hipper 954 killed, 80 wounded, and 189 captured. In addition, Bl\u00fccher was sunk and Seydlitz severely damaged. For Beatty, the engagement saw Lion and Meteor crippled as well as 15 sailors killed and 32 wounded. Hailed as a victory in Britain, Dogger Bank had severe consequences in Germany. Concerned about the potential loss of capital ships, Kaiser Wilhelm II issued orders stating that all risks to surface vessels were to be avoided. Also, von Ingenohl was replaced as commander of the High Seas Fleet by Admiral Hugo von Pohl. Perhaps more importantly, in the wake of fire on Seydlitz, the Kaiserliche Marine examined how magazines were protected and ammunition handled aboard its warships. Improving both, their ships were better prepared for future battles. Having won the battle, the British failed to address similar issues aboard their battlecruisers, an omission that would have disastrous consequences at the Battle of Jutland the following year."}
{"text":"In 1912, the Titanic, the world's most luxurious passenger ship, set out across the Atlantic for New York City. It would never see it's destination.\n\n1500 people were on the ship, some first class, others restrained to the lower decks where windows were limited. Either way, the passengers on board the Titanic held high hopes, not because it was deemed \"the unsinkable ship\" but because they were leaving their past behind them and preparing for a new life in America.\n\nTo Jack, a homeless artist, winning two tickets on the luxery liner was the best thing that ever happened to him. His life, as well as everyone else on the ship, would be changed forever. Even before he discovered the fate of the Titanic did he know what his destiny was; he met Rose.\n\nRose was a troubled young woman living in a rich society, engaged to a millionaire that her mother had sought out. She was living in a fantasy, a fantasy that she didn't want, and she was looking for a way out.\n\nJack heroically saved Rose's life and was immediately thrust into her world though no one knew he fit in. He was the only one that could see the anguish that Rose was in... He was the only one who could get her out of it.\n\nTheir love affair would be cut short. Nighttime was a dangerous time for ships in that time period, manually having to look for obstructions in the ocean.

He was told to dress and go on deck. After sitting on his bunk for about ten minutes second steward George C. Dodd popped in and told the men to get up to the Boat Deck. He sent Morris aft to the baker?s pantry to get some bread for the lifeboats. As Morris made his way he met J. J. Thompson, the second storekeeper, and several other stewards engaged in the same activity. Finding there was no bread left, he made his way up to his boat station at No. 16 (he had seen his boat assignment on a list placed in the first-class pantry the previous Thursday). He worked helping load women and children into the boat then went to No. 12, helping there, and finally No. 14.\n\nHe recalled having trouble getting the women to enter the lifeboats, as well as some trouble with ?some third-class passengers who were foreigners? trying to get into No. 14. Fifth officer Harold Lowe took command of lifeboat 14 and called on Morris to help man her. The boat was lowered with orders to pull away from the ship, but to remain close by. Morris recalled some bit of trouble with the falls as boat 14 was being lowered down the ships side, the tackle possibly getting twisted. He recalled the ship listing slightly to port at the time. After rowing away from the ship some quarter of a mile they came upon a knot of four lifeboats, which Lowe took charge of. Then women and children of boat 14 were transferred into these other boats, and, following the sinking, after waiting some time for those in the water to thin out, boat 14 went back and sought to rescue those it could. They managed to pick up three. During the course of the morning as the boat made their way towards the Carpathia they came upon the swamped Collapsible A.

{"text":"What are Lighter Aboard Ships (LASH)?\n\nLighter Aboard Ships (LASH)is a type of ship which can carry other ships, especially lighter barges.\n\nLighter barges are those kinds of barges that are laden with cargo, but cannot be operated on their own. As a result these barges are placed over the lash vessels and then are towed onto their intended position or to other cargo vessels waiting for their cargo load.\n\nThe concept of LASH \u2013 Lighter Aboard Ships \u2013 was introduced in the 1960s by an American marine engineering pioneer Jerome Goldman. The main reason behind the vessels' invention was to tackle the ever-growing increase in the requirement of cargo containers which were in their nascent stages of development at that point of time.\n\nThe main areas of movement of lash barges are in smaller and narrower water parts where bigger vessels cannot enter. In order to aid feasibility of the unloading of the barge from the cargo vessel, the lash vessel is equipped with cranes and derricks. These cranes and derricks help in lading and unloading processes of the barges from the lash ships.\n\nFeatures and Advantages of LASH Ships\n\nA lash vessel streamlines the process of cargo lading and unloading\n\nThis ship's main operational area is the transportation of the lighter barges. As such there is no conflict of functionality at any point of time\n\nThese ships were regarded as the most advanced vessels at the time of their introduction\n\nAs compared to the other ships, the lash vessels spend a majority of their time being operational on the required water areas\n\nOver the years there have been several developments in the concept of cargo ship.\n\nVarious innovators have come up with their own unique ideas to make the vessel more compatible with the modernised times.\n\nThe Sea Bee concept involved a support structure, know being immersed under the surface of the water so that the lash barges could be placed atop this structure and then later on transferred to the cargo ship. The vessels that function as Sea Bee vessels can, in addition to being used as Lighter Aboard Ships, also be utilised tanker vessels.\n\nThe Barge-Catamaran (BACAT) technology involved the development of a similar cargo vessel but with the specific objective to transport lighter barges in the water network between Britain and the northern part of the European continent.\n\nA major distinguishing factor between these two technologies is that the Barge-Catamaran can only be utilised to carry lighter weight lighter barges.\n\nLash vessels are still being used extensively and are quite in vogue in the shipping industry. However, the cost involved in their operation is a huge factor that needs to be considered by operators. The cost factor working appropriately, then the deployment of the cargo ships can be considered as being hugely successful"}

{"text":"Lightships in America\n\nby\nMike Boucher\nCourtesy of The Beam, New Jersey Lighthouse Society\n\nLightships in America span just 165 years: 1820 - 1985. They marked dangerous moving sandbars, shoals, low water, harbor entrance, river's mouth or a spot where a lighthouse could not be built. They could be moved around as a channel moved due to shifting sands. A total of 120 stations were established on America's coast lines and the Great Lakes. The number was always changing- some of these were for a short time while others were permanent. During 1909, a total 56 lightships were in use, the highest number ever placed in service. As times changed with technology, so did the number of lightship stations-until 1985 and the last lightship was replaced. From 1820 to 1952 (when the last lightship was built), 179 vessels were constructed with wooden hulls and sail powered ships, to iron hulls with diesel engines.\n\nThe first lightship was placed in service in the Chesapeake Bay in 1820 to mark the Willoughby Split in Virginia. The first lightships date back to Roman times, but were not located at a fixed site. England had the first true lightship in 1732-a ship was placed on the Thames River to mark the Nore Sands.\n\nThe first true American lightship was placed off the coast of New Jersey to mark the entrance to New York Bay. The wooden hull ship cost $17,700 to build and was 90 feet long. Placed off Sandy Hook, it was known as the Sandy Hook Lightship and was in service between 1823 and 1829. From 1829 thru 1839 there was no lightship to mark this entrance. Prior to the Sandy Hook Lightship's replacement by a Texas tower, eight lightships marked this spot. At the turn of the 20th Century, a deeper and wider channel into New York Harbor was being dredged. The name of the Sandy Hook Lightship was changed to the Ambrose Channel Lightship with the opening of the new channel in 1908.\n\nThe boats did not have a numbering system. When a boat was placed in service it was known by the location it marked-which was fine in the beginning. As older ships were replaced by newer ones, the older ones were a problem to keep track of. Some ships were transferred to other districts causing more problems, while others were used as relief boats. With the tight-fisted purse strings of the early Lighthouse Boards, repainting the hull of a lightship with the new name was a tough sell. Some districts just painted the word \"RELIEF\" in front of the older name.\n\nStarting in 1867, the older lightships were given a letter to identify them. The letters went from \"A\" to \"XX\" for the older ships and as new ones were built they received the numbers 1 to 91. With both sets of letters and numbers, some letters and numbers are missing. There were also eight lightships with no numbers or letters to identify them. The Coast Guard renumbered all active lightships in April 1950 with a WAL and number identifier LV-83\/WAL-508. They renumbered the vessels again in 1965 to LV-83\/WLV-508.\n\nOver the years sailors on lightships saw many changes-from poorly designed wooden ships, lighting apparatus, living conditions, and pay. The poor design of the ship's hull tossed the ship around in storms, some driving it miles from its assigned location once the anchor chain was broken. The lighting apparatus was lowered from the mast and had many wicks to produce a dull light. Each day the sailors would spend a couple of hours getting the ship ready for that night's duty-the rest of the time it was boredom. They would spend eight months out at sea and two months on leave, all for twenty cents a day.\n\nThere were over 150 collisions with lightships and other vessels. Five lightships have been sunk in these collisions. Storms have taken four boats to the bottom, three without a trace. Another was sunk by a German U-Boat during World War 1.\n\nToday only 17 lightships are left, mostly as museums with a few in private hands. The oldest surviving lightship is the Lake St. Clair (LV-75) which dates back to 1902. She is privately owned and is being restored. Two more are in bad shape: LV76\/WAL-504 Relief is located in Vancouver, BC and LV-79\/WAL-506 Barnegat is located at a marina at Camden, NJ. The lightship LV\/WAL 114 New Bedford and was kept in New Bedford, MA-until she sank in 2006 and was sold for scrap.\n\nThe information in this article was gathered from the National Park Service, Maritime Heritage Program \"Lightships in the America\" by James P. Delgado and the website \"Lightship Sailors\" at:  uscglightshipsailors.org\/. This fantastic website has many stories and information on all of America's lightships and stations.\n\nWhat's in a Name\n\nBy Wayne Kirklin\n\nIn reading Mike Bouchar's excellent article on Lightships in The Beam, I was struck by the many different ways we identify the remaining lightships. I hadn't seen LV 118 referred to as the Cornfield for many years. It has been known as the Overfalls for the past thirty-five of its seventy year life.\n\nWhile the ship numbers are unique, the names we now use seem to have a history of their own. These names refer to one of the stations where the lightship served or to what the current owner would like the ship called.\n\nThere are three vessels called Nantucket floating around in New England. Each served for a while on Nantucket Shoal but among them they also served the Ambrose Channel, Blunts Reef, San Francisco, Portland and as relief ships.\n\nWhile South Street Seaport's Ambrose did spend the first twenty-four years of its life at that location, it served on several other stations for the remaining thirty years of its service.\n\nThe Columbia served all twenty-eight years of its service on the station of that name while the Huron spent the last thirty-four of its forty-nine year history on its named station. The Frying Pan also spent all but its last year covering the location for which it is known.\n\nSitting in Alaska is WLV 196 which was known as Pollock Rip, Nantucket and Umatilla Reef before it became the current Marine Bio Researcher.\n\nBoth LV 107 and LV 116 served along the mid-Atlantic Coast between the Chesapeake and Delaware Stations. After retirement LV 116 became the Chesapeake, now at the Baltimore Maritime Museum, and LV 107 was saved from the scrap yard to become an office suite at Liberty Landing Marina in New Jersey.\n\nThe USLHS Relief served nine years at the Overfalls Station on the east coast and then nine years on the west coast at Blunts Reef before six years as a relief vessel. If this vessel were renamed San Francisco this would be consistent with the Swiftsure in Washington and the Overfalls in Delaware, named by their owners to reflect a former local lightship station.\n\nThe Portsmouth in Virginia and the New Bedford in Massachusetts were both named after the city in which they were located, neither of which was a lightship station. Unfortunately the New Bedford was scrapped in July 2007.\n\nIt has been over thirty years since the last U.S. lightship was on station so perhaps we should accept and use the names by which these historic vessels have come to be known."}

{"text":"Until Federation in 1901, each Australian State maintained its own navy. See: \n\nThe biggest issue facing the founding fathers was to decide which responsibilities of the States would be handed over to the new Federal Government. Clearly Defence would but several others such as Education and Health were not, a situation that still exists.\n\nSo in March 1901 the various navies were combined and placed under the care of Rear Admiral Creswell.\n\nHe was born and educated in Gibraltar. He joined the RN at age 13 as a cadet on Britannia and was promoted to Midshipman in 1867 and 2nd Lt. in 1871. He saw service with the Channel Fleet and at the China Station where in 1873 he was wounded, his bravery at the time gaining him promotion to Lt. After recuperating in England, he joined the East India Station and later commanded a flotilla off Zanzibar.\n\nHe retired in 1878 and tried farming in the Northern Territory but became convinced that he was unsuited to this. In 1885 on a visit to South Australia, he was persuaded to take command as 1st Lt. of the only naval vessel this State had - HMCS Protector. It was during this time that he formed the idea of the need to establish an Australian naval force to supplement the RN Squadron based in Sydney.\n\nIn 1895 he was promoted Captain and was now arguing strongly for the establishment of an Australian navy. In 1900 he was appointed commander of the Queensland navy but resigned from this soon after in order to take command of HMCS Protector on its deployment to China to assist in suppressing the Boxer Rebellion.\n\nAfter Federation, Creswell's lobbying for an Australian navy gained momentum. Creswell had never wavered in his fight for an autonomous navy despite the scoffing of some influential citizens who believed that Australia should shelter under the umbrella of the powerful Imperial Fleet and in return contribute to Royal Navy Funds. He was regarded by many as Australia's chief spokesman on naval matters, hence his appointment in February 1904 to the new position of Naval Officer Commanding the Commonwealth Naval Forces. He had retained his position in Queensland and accepted the role of Naval Commandant in Victoria but his energies were primarily focused on the national navy.\n\nBusy times lay ahead for Creswell. he had inherited a defence service which in his own words was 'practically on the verge of collapse' and with insufficient trained men even to crew the hotchpotch of ships. There were only two Lieutenants on the Permanent List for seagoing duties. As a remedy Creswell recommended a seven year plan to bring into service three destroyers of 1300 tons, one destroyer of 800 tons and four fast torpedo boats.\n\nThe Government sent Creswell to London in 1906 to discuss his proposals and to study naval development but the Committee of Imperial Defence declared that Creswell's proposed navy would have no 'strategic justification' and, indeed, would be a 'misapplication of naval power, opposed to every sound principal of naval strategy'.\n\nNaturally Creswell was disappointed with the ridicule levelled at his well-conceived plan but he was far from demoralized and on his return to Australia was encouraged by the then Prime Minister Alfred Deakin, who budgeted 250,000 pounds for expenditure on coastal defence including harbours.\n\nHowever in 1908 Andrew Fisher took over from Deakin and he had other plans for the 250,000. He was no less enthusiastic than Deakin for the development of Australia's own navy and his cabinet immediately approved a recommendation by Creswell for the procurement of 24 destroyers, three of which were ordered immediately without Admiralty consultation.\n\nThey were River Class Torpedo Boat-Destroyers of 700 tons with a top speed of 28 knots and were named Parramatta, Yarra and Warrego - The first new vessels destined soon to bear the proud prefix HMAS. Parramatta was launched in February 1910 and, with Yarra, arrived in Australia nine months later. Meanwhile a tender had been accepted for the building in Britain of the battle-cruiser Australia destined to become flagship of the fleet.\n\nIn 1911 Creswell was promoted to rear admiral in the service of the Royal Australian Navy.\n\nInfluenced no doubt, by the enormous expenditure which would be required over some years to establish the navy, the Australian Government appointed an ex-Royal Navy officer, Admiral Sir Reginald Henderson, as a consultant. Henderson submitted a paper in March 1911 which proposed a massive fleet for that time of 52 warships, 15,000 men and six major bases, to be attained over two decades. It was far too ambitious for the financial resources of Australia with a population of less than 5 million.\n\nThe fact that Australia's navy was ready for service when the World War I began was largely the result of Creswell's hard work and lobbying. During the war he was involved as an administrator in ship construction, the development of shore support, and the arranging of convoys. After the war he worked on developing a defence program for Australia, focussing mainly on ensuring the continued strengthening of the RAN.\n\nConsidered the father of the RAN, Creswell retired in 1919 and took up farming in Victoria; in the same year he was created KBE.

{"text":"Spanish Trawler, Monte Galineiro sinks off Flemish Cap\n\nIs Ottawa Party to a Maritime Cover Up?\n\nOver the past few days several individuals and news agencies have been questioning the validity of a conspiracy theory making the rounds.\n\nThe theory speculates that perhaps someone onboard may have intentionally scuttled (sank) the Spanish Trawler, Monte Galineiro, which went down near the Flemish Cap off Newfoundland earlier this week.\n\nAccording to media reports the vessel was being closely tracked by a Canadian Coast Guard patrol vessel, with the intention of conducting a fisheries inspection once the weather cleared, when she suddenly issued a distress call. The vessel sank minutes later.\n\nAll hands onboard were plucked from the frigid North Atlantic but questions have since arisen about the incident and whether the sinking might have been intentional.\n\nThe theory itself is deeply flawed but there are never the less a lot of valid questions that should, and likely never will be, answered.\n\nFor a fairly large vessel to sink as quickly as this one did it would need to take on a lot of water very rapidly.\n\nThe most likely reason for such a sinking would be a large hole in the hull. The other likely possibility is that the \"sea cocks\", which allow water to be taken in for ballast, were opened, either intentionally or not, thus the conspiracy theory.\n\nSince the ship did not impact with a foreign object like an ice berg, the concern over why a four year old vessel took on water and sink so rapidly is a real one.\n\nAnother question is what she was doing on the very edge of Canada's 200 mile limit when she sank? Some estimates put her at about 214 nautical miles from shore.\n\nIt would be of value to know what direction she was traveling in when observed by the Canadian Coast Guard. Was she heading toward Canadian waters? Was she heading away from them? Did the vessel appear to be attempting to evade or outrun the patrol vessel?\n\nThe captain of the Monte Galineiro claimed he heard an explosion in the engine room and reported a fire onboard. Why wasn't there smoke visible before the Monte Galineiro went down and why did some crew members claim to be wakened from their sleep by an emergency alarm, not an explosion as claimed by the ship's Captain?\n\nThese are valid questions. Unfortunately the Canadian government, under the auspices of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, has said it will not be conducting any investigation into the incident. Preferring instead to leave that to the ship's Country of origin, Spain.\n\nPersonally I doubt very much that anyone would intentionally sink their own vessel during February in the North Atlantic while sailing in 10 foot waves.\n\nIf they did, the majority of the 22 member crew, some of whom were rescued in their underwear, could not have been informed. To do so before putting them in such a frightening life and death situation would almost ensure that they would want to get their revenge on the perpetrator by telling authorities.\n\nIndeed the crew knew a Coast Guard vessel was in the area but in reality, would anyone, other than a total psychopath, throw himself and more than 20 others into a situation where mere minutes mean the difference between life and death?\n\nWhat could the motive be?\n\nWould someone take that gamble simply to avoid the slap on the wrist that would be waiting for them even if they were found to have tons of illegal cod onboard?\n\nI doubt it.\n\nPerhaps the most sensible statement regarding the conspiracy theory came from St. John's Maritime Lawyer, Owen Myers, in a \"Sou'Wester\" article, when he said the Monte Galineiro wouldn't face serious fines under \"toothless\" North Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) rules, even if it was convicted of illegal fishing. \"It seems very unlikely to scuttle a $20-million vessel in order to escape a Canadian fisheries inspection,\" Myers said. \"It's kind of like getting a traffic ticket. You're not going to blow up your Ferrari sports car because you've been given a parking ticket. I think it's really well-known that that is the problem with the NAFO convention - there are just no penalties in it.\"\n\nThere's a lot of truth in those words.\n\nIt seems that nobody really knows what happened out there on the high seas but isn't that the problem?\n\nShouldn't somebody be trying to find out?\n\nPutting aside the conspiracy theory itself for a moment, since it only clouds the issue, the question of exactly why this ship sank and what she was doing in the area prior to the sinking should not be cavalierly brushed aside, as is being done by Canadian authorities.\n\nLate last week Newfoundland and Labrador premier, Danny Williams, issued a press release saying his government would not sign onto, or support, the latest trade discussions between Ottawa and the EU because of a number of ongoing issues, including NAFO's lack of control over illegal fishing, the EU's continued flouting of fisheries law and Canada's lack of concern for protecting Newfoundland and Labrador's interests.\n\nThe federal government's lack of interest in finding answers to the questions being asked only serve to prove Mr. Williams point.\n\nWith trade talks taking place between Ottawa and the EU, with the premier's position publicly known and with the lingering questions about this particular vessel left unanswered there is ample reason for the Newfoundland and Labrador premier and the people of the province to have concerns.\n\nWas the vessel so loaded down with illegal fish that she ripped her engines apart, causing a fire, by pushing the ship to her limits in an effort to avoid inspection?\n\nWere her fishing trawls in the water or onboard when the incident happened? Knowing this, or even if they were in neither place (had been cut) would add valuable information to the situation.\n\nWas the crew of the Monte Galineiro doing nothing illegal at all? If so, an independent investigation would help clear the crew's reputations, and that of their home nation.\n\nWas there a design flaw in the ship, perhaps allowing the sea cocks to accidentally open or water to enter around the propeller shaft? If so, knowing the answer might save lives in future.\n\nThere are a lot of important questions left unanswered, not the least of which is why the government of Canada is doing nothing to find those answers"}

They travel day and night until they got to the location they were suppose to land but the ice sheets were hundreds of feet high. They thought that there plans were going bad until they saw a crack in the ice. The Captain said \"hey, maybe we could go inside there and explore from the inside\". His crew did not agree with him but they would not disobey an order.So they went through the crack, they travel until it go so dark they needed a person with a lantern to go to the bow and tell them if anything is going to hit the ship. They travel for an hour until they started to see a little bit of light in the distance and an opening. The crew were happy because they though they were going to the other side of this ice but they were wrong it was just an opening to a cave which had the light coming from the sealing. The captain try to cheer them up by saying \"ha, sheer up mate the tunnel still continue through there other end and...\" but he was cut short by one of his crew saying \"hey there is a city in the bottom of the ocean, look\". So everyone went to the edge and they saw what was a beautiful city but was ravage by the sea. Then they notice how there were other ships there, some of them most have been there just some few months. Then they knew they were not the only one that went through there. All of the ships had the bottom destroy like the ice crush them and they were their next victim. The ice pices of around them did not at first try to crush them it just started when they were half way to the other cave in the end that is when they saw the chunk grew bigger, they started to connect with each other until it cover around them. One of the crew said \"This look like magic, it must be a defense system of this city\". He was right when the ice cover around them it crush the bottom of their ship and at last the ice retreated to see the ship sink with all of his crew to join the rest of the ship in"}

Her designer\nwas W.D. McLaren of Vancouver.\n\nThe Prince George was primarily a cruise\nship, although she did have two holds for carrying cargo. She could also carry\ncars, although these had to be lifted on board by crane and were taken to the\nright deck by lift.\n\nHer interiors were like these of the\nother Canadian National ships: lots of wood panelling could be found onboard.\nMeant to sail for tourists visiting Alaska, she had a forward facing observation\nsaloon which for example today still is a prominent feature onboard the\nHurtigrute, the Norwegian coastal express service sailing the Norwegian Fjords.\nBesides her beautiful woodwork, Prince George was noted for her classic diningroom and central staircase with bronze handrails.\n\nCabins on board Prince George\n\nLaunched in 1947 and completed in mid\n1948, she followed the same pattern for several years: cruising in summer out of\nVancouver through the Inside Passage to her most northern destination Skagway\nbefore returning.

{"text":"Liberty ships were cheap and quick to build; between 1941 and 1945 2,751 of them were built by 16 American shipyards easily the largest number of ships produced to a single design. The production of these vessels in the Second World War mirrors the manufacture of similar standardised types on a much smaller scale during the First World War, in particular the Hog Island ship .\n\nIn 1936 the American Merchant Marine Act was passed, which provided for the subsidized construction of 50 commercial merchant vessels a year to be taken over by the United States Navy as naval auxilaries in the event of war. The number was doubled in 1939 and again in 1940 to finally 200 ships a year. The sophisticated designs were for a tanker and three types of merchant vessel, all to be powered by steam turbines. However because of the limited building capacity, and in particular the ability to build the many steam turbines required, relatively few of these ships were built.\n\nMeanwhile, faced with the loss of merchant vessels to German U-boats and an increased requirement for mechant tonnage the British Government placed an order for 60 tramp steamships with American yards in 1940, to be known as the Ocean class.\n\nThese were fairly large (for the time) but simple ships with a single 2,500 horsepower reciprocating engine of obsolete but reliable design. Although the earlier designs upon which Liberty Ships were based were coal fired, the Liberty Ships themselves had oil fired boilers. The similar \"Ocean\" vessels built for England were coal fired, since that country had abundant supplies of coal mine but no indigenous source of oil. The predecessor designs, including the Northeast Coast, Open Shelter Deck Steamer, were based on a ship originally produced in Sunderland by J.L. Thompson & Sons in 1879, and as a 60-year old design was simple and easy to build. This type of ship had been widely manufactured until the 1930s, the last being the SS Dorrington Court . The order specified an increase in draught by 18 inches allowing a displacement increase from 9,300 tons to 10,100 tons.\n\nThe accommodation, bridge and main engine of these vessels were located in the middle of the ship. A long tunnel connected the main engine shaft to the aft part of the shaft connected with the propeller.\n\nThe design was modified by the United States Maritime Commission to conform to American construction practices and to make it even quicker and cheaper to build, and was designated EC2-S-C1 \u2014 Emergency Cargo, 2 = large ship. Welding was used extensively, and accounted for one third of the labour costs. The order was given to a conglomerate of West Coast engineering and construction companies known as the Six Companies, headed by Henry J. Kaiser and also adopted as the Merchant Marine Act design.\n\nOn 27 March1941 the Defense Aid Supplemental Appropriations Act which increased the number of lend-lease ships to 200, and in April this was increased to 306, of which 117 would be Liberty ships.\n\nThe ships initially had a poor public image and to try to assuage public opinion, 27 September1941 was designated Liberty Fleet Day, and the first 14 \"Emergency\" vessels were launched that day. The first of these was Patrick Henry, launched by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In the speech which he delivered when launching the vessel, referred to Patrick Henry's speech of 23 March1775 which Henry finished with the words \"Give me liberty or give me death\". Roosevelt said that this new class of ships would bring liberty to Europe, which gave rise to the name Liberty Ship.\n\nOn 15 October1941 the first of the original British Ocean class ships, Ocean Vanguard was launched was a publicity stunt and was not repeated. The ships were made assembly-line style, from premade sections. In 1943, three new Liberty ships were being completed every day. They were mainly named after famous Americans, starting with the signatories of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nAny group which raised War bonds worth $2 million could propose a name, for instance the SS Francis J. O'Gara was named for the purser of the SS Jean Nicolet who was thought to have been killed in a submarine attack but in fact survived the war in a Japaneseprisoner of war camp. He was the only living person to have a Liberty ship named after him. Although most were named after people, there were exceptions such as the SS Stage Door Canteen named for the USO club in New York and the SS U.S.O. named after the organisation itself [1].\n\nSS Carlos Carrillo\n\nA few suffered structural problems including cracks in the deck or hull and it is reported that a very few foundered for this reason, including the SS John P. Gaines which broke in half on 24 November1943 with the loss of 10 lives. Balancing these problems are the facts that (a) the ships were built in great haste by often inexperienced personnel, (b) they were frequently grossly overloaded, and (c) a number of the problems were associated with severe storms at sea that would have placed any ship at risk. The successor to this design, the Victory ship was both strengthened and made less stiff to address Liberty Ship structural concerns.\n\nThe success of the immense effort to build Liberty ships, the sheer number of ships built, and the fact that some of the ships survived far longer than the original design life of five years, have combined to make Liberty ships a subject of much study.\n\nLate in the war, the building of Liberty ships was replaced by that of Victory ships. Several designs of mass-produced petroleum tankers were also produced, the most numerous being the T2 tanker series with about 490 built between 1942 and the end of 1945.\n\nThe last Liberty ship constructed was the SS Albert M. Boe, launched on 26 September 1945 and delivered on 30 October 1945. She was named after the chief engineer of a United States Army freighter who had stayed in the engine room to shut down his ship's engines following an explosion there on 13 April1945, and for which he was awarded a posthumous Merchant Marine Distinguished Service Medal [2].\n\nMany Liberty ships survived the war, and made up a large percentage of the postwar cargo fleet. The term \"Liberty-size cargo\" for 10,000 tons may still be heard in the shipping"}
{"text":"The stories of all seven Alabamas, including the Confederate ship carrying that name, are a highlight of our city, state and country's long naval heritage.\n\nAmerican warships have been named Alabama even before we became a state in 1819. The first of the five U.S. Navy ships to bear the state's name was laid down in the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Maine. It was to be one of nine ships of the line authorized by Congress in 1816 during the aftermath of the War of 1812. Although she was ready for launch in 1825, she remained in the shipyard until 1864 to save the government money. Due to the damage caused by the CSS Alabama, the most deadly commerce raider in the Civil War, it was decided that the previously unused ship would be renamed and launched as the New Hampshire. Under her new title, the wooden sailing vessel, already 40 years old, served the U.S. Navy as a supply ship for the blockading squadrons off the Carolinas. She continued to provide support and training for the Navy until she burned and sank in 1921 off the New York coast.\n\nThe USRC Alabama\n\nAnother Alabama was built in New York City in 1819. Though it was not a Naval vessel, it served in the United States Revenue Cutter Service (USRC), a precursor of today's Coast Guard, from 1819 to 1833. Costing $4,500, the wooden topsail schooner sailing vessel displaced 56 tons and stretched 52 feet long, with a draft of less than 6 feet of water. With armament consisting of a single pivot gun, alongside the USRC Louisiana, she captured the pirate ship Bravo after a fight on Aug. 31, 1819. USRC Alabama was stationed in Mobile, and spent most of her service in the Caribbean suppressing piracy and the slave trade there. She was sold in 1833 after failing to make a trip to New York.\n\nBattleship No. 2\n\nIn 1851, the second USS Alabama, a side-wheeled wooden merchant ship, was built in New York. During the Civil War, she was used to transport troops. Eventually the Navy bought the vessel and converted her to a warship. She was stationed in various blockading spots along the Atlantic coast of the Confederacy for the duration of the conflict. In 1864, she captured CSS Admiral off Charleston and aided in the closing of the last major port for blockade-runners, Wilmington, N.C. The second USS Alabama was decommissioned and sold in 1865 and served as a merchant ship until she burned in 1878.\n\nThe USS Alabama (BB-8) is seen anchored off New York City in 1905. U.S. Naval Historical Center\n\nThe CSS Alabama\n\nThe most famous warship named Alabama, at least in the South, was the CSS Alabama. Captained by Raphael Semmes, this Confederate commerce raider captured 65 vessels during her two years on the high seas, a remarkable record which has never been surpassed. Built in England, she was secretly commissioned in 1862. She sank in 1864 after her years at sea left her with ruined powder and a barnacled bottom. Semmes' Alabama had been the terror of the high seas. After the war, Adm. Semmes was accused of being a pirate, which he was not, and nearly hanged by the federal government. Semmes was never allowed to reclaim his U.S. citizenship so he retired to his adopted hometown of Mobile, where he was highly respected. Divers later recovered many objects from the wreck of the CSS Alabama, sunken deep in treacherous waters off Cherbourg, France; the relics are now on exhibit in the History Museum of Mobile.\n\nA white phosphorus bomb explodes over the USS Alabama (BB-8) during bombing experiments at San Marcos Proving Area, Chesepeake Bay, Md., September 1921. These bombings were conducted by Army Corps Bombers. U.S. Naval Historical Center\n\nBattleship No. 3\n\nThe third naval vessel to be named USS Alabama was a battleship No. 8 (BB-8; 11,565 tons displacement) laid down in 1896 and commissioned in 1900. She cruised in the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico in her first years of service in the Navy. In 1908, she was part of Theodore Roosevelt's Great White Fleet that circumnavigated the globe. She sailed with that fleet from\n\nHampton Roads around South America to San Francisco where she had to go in for repairs. Thus she missed out on the rest of the voyage, although she did later sail west across the Pacific, around India, through the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean and Atlantic, docking finally in New York. Thereafter, she had a period of quiet service as a training ship that included preparation for World War I. In 1920, the old ship was finally decommissioned. A year later, the Army used her as part of the target fleet that Billy Mitchell, father of the U.S. Air Force, and his aircraft bombed and sank, thus proving the power of air attack.\n\nThe \"Lucky A\"\n\nThe construction of the fourth USS Alabama (BB-60; 35.000 tons displacement) began in 1940. The South Dakota-class battleship joined the fleet in 1942. USS Alabama was a sophisticated, heavily armed, fast battleship. For most of the war, she served as an escort for various fast aircraft carriers using her array of anti-aircraft guns, not her main firepower 16-inch guns, against attacking Japanese planes. The ship participated in attacks on Japanese islands and was involved in the eventual liberation of the Philippines, as well as several important fleet actions throughout 1944 in the islands campaign. Along with other ships, she used her main armament to bombard Saipan. Then, the ship resumed her role defending the carriers, which were fighting off large numbers of kamikaze attacks. These suicide attacks were very damaging to many ships in the American fleet, including her sister ship USS South Dakota, but Alabama sustained no losses. She never lost a man in combat during World War II, earning the nickname \"Lucky A.\" At the end of the war, Alabama along with other fast battleships, bombarded targets in the home islands near Tokyo. Action was suspended when Japan surrendered, and USS Alabama returned to San Francisco in late 1945. She was eventually decommissioned and put in mothballs in 1947 in Bremerton, Wash., where she remained until 1964, when Mobilians Jimmy Morris, Stephens Croom and Henri Aldridge spearheaded the effort to save her from a trip to the scrapyard. Gifts of money from across the state, especially from schoolchildren, contributed toward preserving the ship and moving it to its present location at Battleship Memorial Park. In exchange for their donations, children were given lifetime passes to visit the ship. A few are still in existence.\n\nTaking a tour of Battleship Park has become a tradition for Mobilians and\nthe city's visitors alike. Photo by Sharon Whelton.\n\nThe Current Ship\n\nThe most recent USS Alabama (SSBN-731) is a nuclear-powered fleet ballistic missile submarine. Her keel was laid in 1980 at Groton, Conn., and she was commissioned in 1985. She is an Ohio-class ship, displacing 18,750 tons when submerged. By comparison, USS Drum, now on display at Battleship Park, displaced just more than 2,000 tons when submerged. The current USS Alabama has been in continuous service since joining the fleet in 1985. After extensive training and shakedown cruises, she visited Mobile in February 1986 for Mardi Gras. Assigned to Bangor, Wash., she had made 47 patrols when she was extensively refit in 1999 to carry the fleet's latest missiles. She now carries 24 Trident II D5 nuclear missiles, each with multiple, independently targeted warheads, and a complement of torpedoes. This USS Alabama continues to be homeported in Bangor, Wash."}

{"text":"Mysterious shipwreck identified by researchers\n\nA MYSTERIOUS shipwreck that lay at the bottom of the Solent for 160 years has been identified by archaeologists.\n\nThe wreck, which lies on the Horse Tail Sands in the eastern Solent, was first discovered by fishermen when they caught their nets on it in 2003.\n\nNow, after eight years of painstaking research, experts say the wreck is that of the Flower of Ugie, a 19th century wooden cargo ship that sank on December 27, 1852, following a great storm in the English Channel.\n\n'In terms that of all the shipwrecks we know of around the British coastline, we didn't previously have one from this period that has been identified.'\n\nThe Flower of Ugie was a three-masted sailing barque built in 1838.\n\nIt made regular voyages around Africa, on to India and the Far East and was later employed in the Mediterranean, the Baltic and across the Atlantic, carrying cargo to and from the US and Canada.\n\nIt would take British goods such as coal and beer abroad and bring back items such as raw cotton, saltpetre and sugar.\n\nOn the night of Boxing Day 1852, while carrying coal from Sunderland to Cartagena, Spain, the ship ran into a storm off Portland.\n\nThe ferocious weather, which battered the whole of the south coast, nearly capsized the ship and the crew were forced to cut down two masts.\n\nIn the early hours, the Flower of Ugie sought shelter in the Solent, but it grounded on the Horse Tail Sands and the order was given to abandon ship.\n\nThe wreck was identified after divers analysed the hull structure, fastenings and sheathing \u2013 which narrowed the search to five ships which sank in the eastern Solent in the mid-19th century.\n\nKey features such as copper bolts, which have a chemical composition unlikely to have been used after 1850, and the use of yellow-metal \u2013 an industrial brass patented in 1832 \u2013 led researchers to positively identify the ship"}
{"text":"Friday, March 14, 2008\n\nWhen the new Discovery World opens at Pier Wisconsin on September 9, it will feature a stunning array of cutting edge technology. But one of the main attractions, a replica of the 1852 schooner The Challenge, was built in the old, traditional craft of wooden boat building. It's an art that has few practioners left. One of the crew of boat builders working on The Challenge was Amy \"Shredder\" Schaub. Unlike many people her age, Amy has decided to pursue a career in boat building, sailing, and teaching these skills to others.\n\n\"SHREDDER'S\" SEA CHANTY Amy began as a volunteer crewmember on the S\/V Denis Sullivan, a recreation of an 1880's era three masted schooner that now calls Pier Wisconsin home. The schooner was built under the direction of shipwright Rob Stevens, who has been building boats for over 25 years. He has built a replica of a Viking boat, the Snorri, among others. Amy took a basic boat building and sailing class. When the Denis Sullivan was set to cruise on it's second voyage, Amy joined the crew as a deckhand. The voyage took the boat up through the St. Lawrence Seaway, and then down the East coast as far South as Florida. It was here in Florida that she took a test and received her Captain's license. The following year, Amy again voyaged with the Denis Sullivan, this time as Second Mate. They stopped at the Tall Ships Festival in Green Bay, and then again headed through the St. Lawrence Seaway, stopping in Halifax, and then heading to the Bahamas and Bermuda. The crew met Bermuda's Governor, who joined them in a round of Bermuda's official drink- the Dark and Stormy. This delicious cocktail consists of Gosling's rum mixed with ginger beer and lime. The next spring, Amy returned to Caribbean shores to teach Semester at Sea, a six week program for High school girls, who learned new skills as well as experiencing seasickness first hand. Subjects for the class included Sail Training, Water Science, Navigation, Maritime History, and Weather. Returning to Milwaukee, she taught on the ship Neeskay for the UWM Great Lakes Water Institute.\n\nA TRAINING IN MYSTERY BAY Amy decided to advance her boat building skills at the Northwest School of Boat Building in Port Hadlock, which lies on Mystery Bay in Washington State. After a semester she graduated with an associate's degree in large vessel construction. The skills she obtained would be useful for her return to Milwaukee.\n\nTHE CHALLENGE While in Port Hadlock, she received a call from Rob Stevens. He had work for her helping to build the Challenge. William Wallace Bates originally built the boat in 1852 in Manitowoc. It was built for speed, delivering cargo throughout the Great Lakes area. The ship met its fate in 1910 when it began to take water. The crew tried to pump the water out, but soon had to run the ship aground in the Milwaukee River. Folklore says the ship crashed into a shoreline saloon, but there is no official record of this.\n\nBUILDING THE BOAT Hundreds of steps, big and small go into building the schooner. Amy began working on the boat October of last year, after she graduated. Construction of the boat started with the \"backbone\" which includes the stem and keel. Next the frames or \"ribs\" are added to form the skeleton of the ship. Planking begins. The planking is the wood that makes up the hull, the skin of the ship. The rudder is added. Deck beams, which support the deck floor, are placed. A system of spars, masts, the jib boom, and bowsprit are constructed. All of these are parts, which hold the sails and the ropes, and parts that help move the sails, known as rigging. The pilothouses and cabins start to be constructed, and the deck is laid down. The anchor windlass, which houses the anchor and chain, and the anchor support system, is built. Lots and lots of sanding, painting, and detail work happen. One of the last steps is to add the sails and rigging. In order to get an authentic look, the shipwrights wanted to get pieces made for the ship, from the same source the original builders of the Challenge would have gone, a blacksmith.\n\nCALLING IN THE BLACKSMITH Like Amy, Nathaniel Reinartz is practicing a career in an uncommon art- blacksmithing. He was contracted to build several small working pieces for the Challenge, straps, plates, runners, and other parts. Some of the UnderCurrents crew traveled to Kewaskum, where Nathaniel was working in the Bighorn Forge on a piece called the traveler, a device that helps move the boom, which helps move a sail. The forge is on a pleasant farm housed inside a barn with dirt floors. The shop is filled with fiery furnaces, anvils, and racks and shelves full of hammers, tongs, rulers and various other tools and materials. A cow skull hangs above the doorway, and a rooster crows periodically in the background. \"The definition of Blacksmith has changed a lot over the years. The craft has always been somewhat ornamental, but now it's 100 percent ornamental.\" Nathaniel tells us. He's glad to be working on functioning pieces, even if the ship isn't setting sail. The Challenge is suspended from the ceiling inside Discovery World. People can walk underneath the ship and then board it on the second level of the museum. I asked Amy how she felt about putting so much work into a ship that will never sail the high seas. She said basically that she was just glad to practice her boat building skills. The Challenge has helped Amy and Nathaniel apply their trade, but where can they go from here? Amy is returning to Port Townsend to teach on the schooner Martha, a two masted schooner that has survived since it was built in 1905. It has had a lot of work done, and although it can't make long voyages, it can go on short class length trips. Nathaniel will carry on seeking freelance work, ornamental fences and other work.\n\nMORE ATTRACTIONS AT DISCOVERY WORLD In addition to the Challenge and the S\/V Denis Sullivan, displays will include saltwater and freshwater aquariums, and touch tanks with sturgeons, sharks and stingrays.

I love what it's become, and that's mostly the people.\" \u2013Warwick\n\nThings change. I remember rocking out the Doctor Who pinball machine while slamming Blatz in the back room of the Stork Club. The space is now Nessun Dorma, and the back room is usually full of people enjoying wine, imports, and antipasta. Onopa \"cleaned up its act\" and became Stonefly. Quarters is still Quarters, but it went from a sonic boom blasting rock and roll palace to a hip hop palace. And consider this: The Unicorn was a rock club that used to be housed in the basement of the Sydney Hih building. Some of the acts included pre superstardom groups like Nirvana, Soundgarden, Nine Inch Nails, etc. and a ton of great punk bands. The club closed mid nineties. Gus Hosseini, who ran the club, now owns Club Belize (among other businesses), a Caribbean themed bar with card-carrying members and a dress code. There are other great Milwaukee clubs that closed before I got a chance to experience them. Circle A, which opened five and a half years ago, has closed for set business hours, although it will be open sporadically for special events, at least until the bar's license is up for renewal in Fall. Warwick Sealy, the bar's owner has a \"wait and see what happens then\" attitude toward that date. Warwick lives upstairs from the bar, which rests at the end of Chambers Street next to the lot occupied by North Side Lumber and Fuel Company. Inside flyers from 80's punk shows featuring bands like The Cramps, Bad Brains, UK Subs, TSOL and others decorate the wall. Three Television sets play nothing but static. The beautiful Jukebox, a treasure, has an unusual mix of Hank Williams, The Ventures, Bow Wow Wow, Led Zepplin, and The Buzzcocks, as well as local bands like The Mistreaters (who released a Live At Circle A 7\"), Rusty P's, and Bear Proof Suit. This isn't just a place of great music, but great thinking. And if you can't find the right word for your thought, a double box set of the Oxford English Dictionary rests next to the cash register. Circle A has become famous locally for a couple things, the first being it's cramped \"Alive At 8\" series. This music showcase featured dozens and dozens of local bands. It was early enough that it didn't piss off the neighbors, didn't conflict with other shows, and was a great alternative to those who wanted to check out a band they liked but didn't want to stay up until bar close to see them. Many of these performances were taped and Warwick hopes some of these are released in some form. The other thing that energized Circle A was a solid line up of DJs spinning pop records, which wasn't common at the time they opened. The bar had DJs almost every night of the week, many of which have developed their own following. I went to the Circle A to hang out for the last night they were open on a regular basis, Sunday, February 25. It was a dark and snowy night. Just after 9 p.m., photographer Paul Kjelland and I showed up. The \"Alive At 8\" set is halfway through. Aaron Schleicher of the local band Juniper Tar is playing an acoustic set, and his brother Ryan will play after him. 9:45 p.m. Warwick pops in and greets the patrons. He has the gift of conversation, which makes him a favorite bartender to many. 10 p.m. In the men's room the writing on the wall is, \"Death to the Weird\" and, uh-oh, \"It Burns When I Pee\". 10:30 p.m. It's not a place where everyone knows your name, but you're sure to run into someone you know. Big Terrible Easy, a Brew City Bruiser, recently voted \"Best Party Animal\" by her league shows up. By now it has cleared out some because the \"Alive At 8\" set has ended. A DJ has set up and plays straight up 1950's rock and roll on the ones and twos. Paul and I grab some theater seats against the wall and take it all in. 11 p.m. I'm looking at a giant poster by the window for a Ramones gig in London. As if on cue, the DJ cranks \"I Wanna Be Sedated\". 11:10 p.m. The crowd has had enough drinks to start dancing, cutting a rug to Gene \"The Duke\" Chandler's Duke-Duke-Duke of Earl-Earl-Earl, followed by \"Book of Love\" by The Monotones. I tried to write down the lyrics in real time for some reason, and the page is just a scribble of \"boop boopy doops\". I see faded, scratched lettering on the window, \"The New Wheel\". I ask the bartender about this artifact and she says the bar was \"The New Wheel\" and then \"A Likely Story\" in its past lives. Midnight. I'm having a blast and my handwriting is barely legible, but I can read a note about people dancing to \"Short Shorts.\" It's by The Royal Teens, and yes, we like short shorts. I go to the bar to get another beer and knock it over when I hand Warwick the money. Beer spills across the bar. Warwick's unfazed. He's seen worse. Around 1:30 a.m., as best I can tell, I'm in the bag. I'm three sheets to the wind as they say. I say goodbye to everyone, even strangers.\n\nOne week later, and I'm again sitting at the bar of the Circle A. It is empty now, except for Warwick and I, and really quiet. The coolers, the neon signs, the static filled Televisions are all shut down. A pile of shredded cardboard covers part of the floor, chewed up by Warwick's pitbull Hazelnut. I start the conversation by trying to backtrack to why he opened the bar in the first place. He tells me it was largely inspired by his love of music. I ask him what the first memorable shows he attended were. He started out going to coliseum shows by monsters of metal like Black Sabbath, Blue Oyster Cult, and Kiss. He soon came across punk rock when he moved to New York City in the late 1970's. There he was blown away by The Ramones at a small bar called Zappa's, and saw The Cramps and Richard Hell and the Voidoids at Max's Kansas City. Warwick moved to Milwaukee in 1996 and quickly became part of the local basement scene. At that point there were maybe four or five houses having basement shows on a regular basis. He even played in a band briefly himself as the keyboardist for the short lived but well loved band The Moles, which also featured a bass player and a percussionist playing oil drums. \"Playing a show at Circle A is like playing a basement show, minus the furnace, leaky pipes, and washer and dryer.\" So why close? \"I've been edging this way for awhile, I've gotten tired of it and the work involved. I'm not whining, I've had a great staff. Its just time for something new.\" The non stop party has distracted him from other projects he wants to take on, although he's quick to add that he's grateful for all the people who have showed up regularly to support Circle A over the last five years. \"For all the things that could go wrong running a bar, thankfully few of those things happened to us.\" I asked him if crime was a factor in his decision. Circle A has been held up twice, the last time a year and half ago. \"No it didn't. It sucks, but it didn't sway my decision. It's a concern, but a separate concern.\" Is Circle A the last of the great rock bars in Milwaukee? Where can the masses turn?

Leah Jee and The Boys (her back up band, Jim Sinicki, bass, Lior Dar, drums, Bryan Burch, guitar) have played it all, from the sweat soaked, beer swilling masses at Summerfest to intimate serenades on a stormy night at the Riverwest Commons. The band toured in November, playing dozens of gigs in home, sweet home, California, from San Francisco to San Diego. \"The California music scene was absolutely receptive to us, and we had a great fan response every show we played.\" Jee told me. The band will hit the road again in May for a mid atlantic and east coast tour. On March 8, Jee will rock the BBC, celebrating the release of her new EP, All The Things I Forgot To Mention, recorded at Studio Z in Milwaukee over several months. Leah Jee and the boys always has an energetic live performance, and if the audience is lucky, they'll hear a rockin' cover of Paula Abdul's \"Straight Up\" which wowed the crowd so much at one performance, that they demanded the band play it a second time. Speaking of Paula Abdul, Miss Jee will be one of three guest judges for the Alverno College Idol contest, a replica of American Idol. Jee will certainly bring a healthy dose of Vitamin C to the contest.\n\nThe CD is available at  This story originally appeared at"}

The air wing of the navy is made up of maritime\nreconnaissance aircraft and helicopters used for search and rescue,\ngenerally with minimal armament.\n\nEngagements with terrorists and other\nlow-intensity conflicts neglected the need for larger ships such as\ncruisers or destroyers. The Navy makes full use of its smaller\nmissile craft and interdiction vessels to keep the Eastern\nMediterranean and Red Seas clean.\n\nIn recent years, the Navy has invested time and energy to intercepting cargo vessels loaded with weapons intended for terror organizations. In 2009, the IDF intercepted the MV Francop and seized some 500 tons of weapons destined for use by Hezbollah against Israel's civilians. In 2001, the Navy intercepted the Santorini - a fishing boat that had sailed from Beirut in Lebanon towards Israel. On board, commandos discovered a large cache of concealed weapons including missiles, rockets, mortars and rifles as well as instruction manuals for the manufacturing of explosives.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Navy first won\nacclaim in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 when it sank eight Arab FFLs without a the loss of a single\nIsraeli vessel; the crews of the Israeli Navy successfully destroying\nor otherwise evading over seventy Arab Soviet-supplied SS-N-2 Styx\nmissiles.\n\nDuring the 1982\nPeace for Galilee war with Lebanon, the Israeli navy proved to be\ncapable of missions beyond policing its waters and landed troops and\narmor on the beaches near Sidon using their small flotilla of\namphibious craft with relative success. In Operation\nGrapes of Wrath in 1996, Israeli missile craft shelled the coastal roads of\nLebanon. Even still, this defensive role has not relegated the\nIsraeli Navy to a coast guard mission. The Israeli Navy, while\nstrategically defensive, is highly offensive tactically and conducts\nits mission dynamically and with a high degree of elan.\n\nModernization\n\nIn 2013, the Navy unveiled the latest acquisition to its growing fleet: the INS Rahav \u2013 its fifth Dolphin-class submarine. The Dolphin is considered to be among the world's most powerful and advanced submarines. A versatile vessel, the INS Rahav possesses a wide range of stealth, surveillance and strike capabilities which suit it for a large variety of missions.\n\nWith the added capabilities of Dolphinsubmarines and Sa'ar V missile corvettes the Navy\npossesses the power to operate as far off as the coast of Libya.\n\nThe Navy has always been keen to\nmodernize and one such program is in place today. New systems and\ntechniques are being developed to meet the unsettling and quickly\nchanging realities of modern naval warfare, from thrust vectored\npropulsion on the Super Dvora MkII patrol craft to the new\nElisra ECM\/ESM electronic warfare suite on the Sa'ar Vs. The\nwell established Israeli high-tech industry has been well prepared to\nmeet the needs of the ever-mightier fleet of fast attack craft and\nthis mutual cooperation is ever so visible in the new look and\nequipment of the T'sva Hagana L'Yisrael HeylHa'Yam.\n\nThe Navy has begun incorporating the\nIsraeli-designed Typhoon naval gun system into its operational\nscheme. The gun, manufactured by El-Op and Rafael,\nis targeted thermally and will employ either a 25mm cannon or a .50\ncal-triple barrel Phalanx gun. It is intended to be used on patrol\nboats and operated by remote control, thus reducing the risk to the\nsailors manning it."}

{"text":"The Cod Wars\n\nIn November, 1975, the third Cod War between Great Britain and Iceland began. This dispute centered on Iceland's decision to extend its zone of control over fishing from 50 miles beyond its shores to 200 miles. Great Britain did not recognize Iceland's authority in this matter and so continued fishing inside the disputed area. Iceland deployed 8 ships, six Coast Guard vessels and two Polish-built stern trawlers converted into Coast Guard ships to enforce her control over fishing rights. In response, Great Britain deployed a total of twenty-two frigates (although no more than six to nine frigates at one time), seven supply ships, nine tug-boats and three support ships (Miranda, Othello and Hausa) to protect its 40 fishing trawlers. While few shots were fired during the seven-month conflict, several ships were rammed on both sides, causing damage to the vessels and a few injuries to the crews.\n\nThis was the third time Iceland and Great Britain had clashed over fishing rights, particularly over the rights to fish for cod. The first \"war\" occurred in 1958 when Britain was unable to prevent Iceland from extending its fishing limits from 4 miles to 12 miles off Iceland's coast. The second dispute was in 1972-1973, when Iceland extended its limits to 50 miles. This conflict was concluded with an agreement between the two countries that limited British fishing to certain areas inside the 50 mile limit. In addition, Britain agreed that British vessels could not catch more than 130,000 tons of fish annually. This agreement was valid for two years, and expired on November 13, 1975, when the third \"Cod War\" started.\n\nThe Icelandic position was similar in all three conflicts. The major point was that Iceland depends on its fishing industry more than any other state in the world. Iceland has few natural resources, no timber, no fuel, little agricultural potential, and no mineral deposits. Its economy is uniquely dependent on fishing for survival and for exports, to fund the imports needed for the other parts of the economy. \"Fish and fish products of one form or another\u2026have on average accounted for 89.71 per cent of Iceland's total export in each year during the period 1881-1976.\" Iceland argued, therefore, that it had an overwhelming need to ensure the survival of the fish stocks in its area.\n\nIn addition, Iceland stated that foreign fishermen, from the Faroe Islands, Belgium, West Germany, and the majority from Great Britain, were causing an over-exploitation of the fish stocks around Iceland. The tonnage of fish catches had been decreasing since a peak in the 1950\u2032s, even though technological improvements allowed greater catches for fishing vessels. The size and age of the cod caught had also steadily decreased over the years. This meant that there were fewer cod spawning, thus reducing the total population of cod existing. Stocks of cod had decreased by a third during the 1970\u2032s. Iceland stated that fish catches would have to be reduced. Since Iceland's survival depended on fishing, it argued that other nations should bear the reduction of catches. Since Icelandic fishermen were able to catch all of the allowable tonnage of fish, all foreign fishing activity took fish from Icelandic fishermen, not in addition to the fish caught by Iceland.\n\nIceland was concerned that the cod might follow the pattern of the Icelandic herring, which during the 1960s almost disappeared. From a population of 8.5 million tons in 1958, the herring population declined to almost nothing by 1970. This decline could have been prevented by adequate conservation methods. This fear prompted conservation efforts by Iceland. Iceland had attempted in the past to organize international conferences on establishing conservation regulations on fishing, with no response. Iceland had also offered suggestions to the United Nations conferences on the Law of the Sea regarding regulating fishing, such as closing nursery grounds to fishermen, placing quotas on tonnage of fish caught, and rotating preservations areas, where no fishing would occur. Most of these ideas were ignored, or retired to endless committees. In order to enforce these conservation efforts, Iceland saw its 200 mile economic exclusion zone as necessary. No nation would be able to fish within 200 miles of Iceland without Iceland's permission. In addition, the Icelandic Coast Guard would be able to board any ship inside that limit, in order to determine its compliance with Icelandic fishing regulations. With marine biologists predicting that if these efforts were ignored there would have been no cod left by 1980, Iceland became convinced that it had to act unilaterally. Due to the failure of the international arena regarding the Icelandic herring, Iceland acted on its own to protect the cod.\n\nIn addition to the survival of the cod and the survival of Iceland arguments, there was the legal argument. In the United Nations conferences on the Law of the Sea, international opinion had tended towards a 200 mile economic exclusion zone, with a 12 mile limit on territorial waters. At the first meeting of substance on the Law of the Sea, from July to August of 1974, more than 100 States supported the right of coastal States to establish an Exclusive Economic Zone of up to 200 nautical miles from baselines. This included Great Britain. Iceland stated that it was merely enforcing what would soon be an international law and that it was following precedents set by other nations.\n\nGreat Britain had different opinions. While it agreed that the number of cod had been decreasing, Britain was not convinced over- fishing was the cause, nor over what the limit on the catch should be. Iceland based its limit of 230,000 tons of cod allowed on how many four-month old cod are caught in sample catches. Great Britain based its proposal for 280,000 tons of cod on samples of older fish. However, little was actually known about the whole ecology of the fishery stocks, let alone the relationship between what numbers of what age of fish caught and the effect on the spawning population. Britain also argued that, while the international system was arriving at an agreed 200 mile limit, Iceland had no right to unilaterally enforce the limit.\n\nAs noted above, the conflict lasted for seven months. The United Nations' Security Council was consulted, after a particularly violent collision incident, but took no action. The Nordic Council issued a statement of support for Iceland. NATO and the United States became involved, due to Iceland's threat of closing the NATO base at Keflavik if the conflict with Great Britain continued. While the United States offered to mediate between the two parties, it was NATO intercession that helped end the dispute.\n\nWith mediation by the Secretary-General of NATO, Dr. Joseph Luns, Iceland and Great Britain were able to come to an agreement on June 2, 1976. This agreement limited the British to 24 trawlers from a list of 93, allowed inside the 200 mile limit at any one time. The amount of cod that Great Britain could legally catch was limited to 50,000 tons annually. There were four conservation areas that were completely closed to all British fishing. In addition, Icelandic patrol vessels were allowed to halt and inspect British trawlers suspected of violating the agreement. The duration of the agreement was 6 months, after which Great Britain had no right to fish inside the 200 mile zone.\n\nThe British fishing industry based on Icelandic fish produced about 23.1 million pounds worth of catch. The agreement with Iceland caused about 1,500 fishermen to become unemployed, plus about 7, 500 people on shore became unemployed.\n\nMany thanks to The Miranda Website for the information and images for this article.\n\nsorry did not get back to you earlier, after the collision I had to return to Hull for repairs the St Leger had some damage to the bow\nwhich was repaired in a very short time then we returned to Iceland\nthe Icelandic gun boats did not bother us too much after that as they knew we would fight back.\nOf cause we knew it was wrong and it was a pity it all happened but it is all history now.

I ask respectfully are you sure it was the St Leger, as i dont recall her having flared white on her focsle. I have sailed in the leger 5 trips is why i ask are you sure. perhaps to enlighten the matter. I sailed in her sister ship St Keverne 5 trips to the best of my recollection she did not have a white flair either? St Gerontius, St Giles, St Dominic, St Loman were the only ships that had the white flair on the focstle. I trust this helps clarify the incident.\nAnyway Danny i read your book it's quite interesting refer Somerset st school, hessle road etc. I had no idea your expreiences in foreign lands was so extensive, the same applies to your moving homes so often.\nI sailed with you in the St Jasper you was skipper your brother in law Syd Trolley was with us. i was engine room staff, Trevor Hardwicke was Chief engineer. We called into Akureyri i broke my specs and you sent me to Opticians for a new pair thanks for that Danny! Albert Reeves was mate, we had a broken trip Forefoot was cracked extensively thru hitting a growler?\nAnyway Danny would like to see you after all these years of long time no see.

{"text":"Construction of Hood began at the John Brown & Company shipyards in Clydebank, Scotland, on 1 September1916. Following the loss of three British battlecruisers at the Battle of Jutland, 5,000 tons of extra armour and bracing was added to Hood's design. The intention behind this change was to give her protection against 15 inch guns, such as her own - in theory moving her to the status of a true battleship. This has led to some describing her as the first fast battleship . To add to confusion, Royal Navy documents of the period often describe any battleship with a speed of over 24 (or so) knots as a battlecruiser, regardless of the amount of protective armour.\n\nHowever, the re-working was hurried and flawed. Only the forward corditemagazines were moved below the shell rooms\u2014cordite explosions destroyed the RNbattlecruisers lost at Jutland. The combination of the deck and side armour did not provide continuous protection against shells arriving at all angles. Most seriously, the deck protection was flawed\u2014spread over three decks, it was designed to explode an incoming shell and then absorb the damage. The development of effective time delay shells at the end of the WWI made this scheme worse than useless. In addition she was grossly overweight compared to her original design, making her a wet ship with a highly stressed structure. It was seriously suggested that she should be scrapped before she was launched - the post war economy drive made replacing her impossible, however.\n\nConstruction on her sister ships Anson, Howe, and Rodney was stopped in March 1917, but work continued on Hood. Two factors were at work regarding this decision. Firstly, the German ships that the class were a response to were never completed. Secondly, the flaws in her protection and design were apparent - the repeated redesigns of the sister ships did not solve them. Instead, a series of studies leading to the N3 and G3 battleship and battlecruiser designs was started.\n\nShe was launched on August 22, 1918 by the widow of Admiral Sir Horace Hood , a Jutland casualty and distant relative of the famous Lord Hood for whom the ship was named. After fitting out and trials, she was commissioned on May 15, 1920 under Captain Wilfred Tomkinson and became flagship of the British Atlantic Fleet 's Battle Cruiser Squadron. She had cost \u00a36 million.\n\nIn the inter-war years she was the largest warship in the world at a time when the British public felt a close affinity with the Royal Navy. Her name and general characteristics were familiar to most of the public, and she was popularly known as the Mighty Hood. Because of her fame, she spent a great deal of time on cruises and \"flying the flag\" visits to other countries. In particular she took part in a world-wide cruise between November 1923 and September 1924 in company with Repulse and several smaller ships. This was known as the Cruise of the Special Service Squadron and it was estimated that 750,000 people visited Hood during that cruise. In 1931 her crew took part in the Invergordon Mutiny.\n\nShe was given a major refit in 1930 and was due to be modernised in 1941 to bring her up to a standard similar to other modernised World War I-era capital ships. The outbreak of war made it impossible to remove her from frontline service, and so she never received the scheduled update.\n\nHood was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in late 1936. In June 1939 she joined the Home Fleet's Battle Cruiser Squadron at Scapa Flow; when war broke out later that year, she was employed principally in patrolling the vicinity of Iceland and the Faroes to protect convoys and intercept German raiders attempting to break out into the Atlantic. As the flagship of Force H, she took part in the destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir in July 1940. In August she rejoined the Battle Cruiser Squadron and resumed patrolling against German raiders.\n\nThe exact cause of her loss was never ascertained. The Royal Navy's war-time Board of Inquiry concluded that her loss was:\n\ndue to a hit from BISMARCK's 15-inch shell in or adjacent to HOOD's 4-inch or 15-inch magazines, causing them all to explode and wreck the after part of the ship\n\nbut no determination was made as to exactly how such a shell penetrated Hood's armour to reach the magazines. A recent lengthy technical analysis has confirmed that conclusion, and also discovered several paths by which a lucky hit might have reached the magazines. Interestingly, it reveals that the much-maligned deck armour was almost certainly not a factor.\n\nThe dramatic loss of such a well-known symbol of British naval power had a great effect on many people; some later remembered the news as the most shocking of World War II.\n\nThe wreck of Hood was discovered in 3,000 metres of water in July 2001 by an expedition funded by UK-based Channel Four Television and ITN, and led by shipwreck hunter David Mearns. In 2002 the United Kingdom government designated the site a war grave"}
{"text":"Wrecking, sponging, farming, fishing, turtling, cigar, salt and charcoal\nmaking, and the military were early Keys industries. Wrecking in this use\nmeans 'salvaging.' Of the above, wrecking and farming significantly shaped\nthe early settling of the Upper Keys. Ships and their crews became known\nas 'wreckers.'\n\nThe end of wrecking overlapped with the beginning of farming and most of\nthe products from both wrecking amd farming were taken to Key West for\ndisposition. In Key West, cigar manufacturing replaced the wrecking economy.\nSponging, turtling and mackerel fishing also flourished for awhile; however,\nthey were almost completely controlled by Havana at first. Control by Key\nWest, then Key West and Miami, followed Havana's control.\n\nThe following is a very brief discussion of the complex subject of wrecking.\nIt was the industry that dominated the Florida Keys from the first wrecked\nSpanish ships to about 1890. Most of the shipwrecks were in the Tortugas\nand middle\/Upper Keys' areas. Wrecking included, but seldom mentioned the\nwrecking of slave ships such as the Spanish Guerrero in 1827. Human\ncargoes turned out not to be very lucrative.\n\nFrom the beginning of commerce with the New World, ships crashed onto the\nreefs of the Florida Keys. Some were simply grounded high and dry while\nothers had their hulls ripped open, and were sinking or sunk.\n\nMany factors were involved. The early square-rigged merchant ships were\noften overloaded, very difficult to control and did not sail into the wind\nvery well. What charts there were did not indicate the dangers that lay\nbeneath the water's surface. Precise navigation equipment and accurate\ncharts were still centuries away. Little was known of weather conditions\nin this part of the world. There were no lighthouses and little communication\nexisted when bad weather threatened.\n\nThe word \"wrecking\" in this use refers to the salvaging or the saving of\ncrews, ships and\/or cargoes -hopefully, in that order. Of course, some\nkind of reward, or payment was expected and this became the function of\nthe wrecking court to adjudicate. When Florida became a territory in 1821,\nthere were no U.S. statutes, only the \"Common Laws at Sea\" and a Bahamian\nAdmiralty Court. From its inception, wide differences of opinion and almost\nconstant controversy on the pros and cons, ethics and nature of wrecking\nexisted.\n\nThe Florida indigenous Indians were the first salvagers or wreckers. For\nexample, they were employed to assist the Spanish in saving what they could\nfrom the 1622 Spanish Fleet wreck in the Marquesas. The Atocha and\nthe Margarita are the better known ships of the fleet. About eight\nyears of salvaging of the treasure of the two ships by the Spanish was\npartially done with hired Indians.\n\nMeanwhile, Dutch mariners frequently harassed the Spanish salvagers. With\nlittle doubt, the native Indians profited one way or another by diving\nfor sunken goods. Quite possibly the Bahamians were the ones who developed\nwrecking into an industry. Once it was organized, the adjudication of salvage\nclaims was done at Gnaws, Havana, or mutually between the parties involved.\n\nMaritime records abound with events where complete ships, cargos, passengers\nand crews were saved. Most expect that the entire gambit from heroism to\noutright piracy existed. Tales of moving navigation lights to placing false\nlights exist. The Georgia Gazette of October 7, 1790 ended an article\nof two English ships, one saved and one lost, ended as follows: \". . .\nThe wreckers [Bahamians] generally set the ships on fire after they have\ndone with them, that they may not serve as a beacon to guide other ships\nclear of those dangerous shoals.\" This editorializing by the writer implies\nthat the wreckers did not want markers showing other ships where the dangerous\nreef were. The same arguments can be made that wreckers moved navigation\nlights to cause groundings. Most likely when any ship saw any light it\nwould immediately know it was far too close and steer away to seaward.\nA better argument would be that they extinguished the lights. There is\nno real data to substantiate these allegations.\n\nShipwrecks occurred everywhere. In the Upper Keys, Carysfort Reef was an\nespecially dangerous reef and the waters around Tavernier Key was a favorite\nanchorage location while awaiting for wrecks on the off-shore reefs to\nhappen. In early times, the name Carysfort was frequently used generically\nto include all the reefs in the general area. It was while waiting for\nwrecks here that Captain Ben Baker started growing pineapples on Plantation\nKey and Key Largo, and quite possibly launched the pineapple industry.\nOne wrecking report actually stated that Captain Baker spotted a wreck\nwhile sitting on his front porch on Key Largo. Almost all wreckers performed\nwork other than wrecking. Most were also spongers, turtlers, fishermen\nor something that placed them in a good position when a wreck occurred.\n\nOn May 7, 1822, Key West was declared an official port of entry. The following\nyear, Commodore David Porter with his West Indies Anti-Piracy Squadron\nwas sent to clear the waters of pirates so U.S. shipping could proceed\nin peace and safety. (see photo) During this process Commodore Porter wrote\nto the Secretary of the Navy of the dilemma in regard to the lack of written\nlegal statutes.\n\nThe federal legislature took no immediate action. The legislative council\nof the Territory of Florida passed its own wrecking act on July 4, 1823.\nIt contained 14 sections provided that salvagers of wrecked property brought\ninto the territory must report it to the nearest justice of the peace,\nor notary public (section one). Section two gave the officer the\nduty to gather a jury of five. Section three gave the composition of the\njury as two members nominated by the salvagers, two by the owners and one\nby the justice or notary. Other sections established court costs, advertisement,\nrequired a certified copy to be sent to the clerk of the Superior Court,\netc. As there was not a Superior Court in Key West until 1828, early records\nare difficult to locate. Section 14 covered the making or holding false\nlights, devices, or anything \"with the intent to mislead, bewilder or decoy\nthe mariners of any vessel on the high seas, whereby such vessel may be\ncast ashore, or get aground . . .\" If convicted, . . . be deemed guilty\nof felony, and shall suffer death.\"\n\nThe act gave far too much power to minor offices as a Notary. Section two\nallowed the officer to appoint representatives for the owners if none were\npresent. Key West only had a population of a few hundred. Ships and entire\ncargoes were sold. Therefore, wrecking got off to a bad start in the Keys.\n\nThe June 10th, 1826 Pensacola Gazette reported that gross duties\npaid on goods landed in Key West increased from $389 in 1823 to $14,108\nin 1824, and this was only the beginning.\n\nIn these early territorial times, as well as later, settlement could be\nresolved by agreement or arbitration. A court was only required in cases\nof disagreement. In some cases the ship's owner did not agree with the\nship's master and neither agreed with the salvager, in which case a court\nwas usually necessary. In maritime law, the word \"master\" referred to the\nperson in charge of a civilian vessel and \"captain\" was used for a military\nvessel. In some cases there was the fourth party, the insurer, who had\nto represent his interests. Appeals of decisions could and did last for\nyears.\n\nA recent 1990 court case involved the sinking and salvaging of the U.S.S.\nCentral\nAmerica, which had sunk off of South Carolina in the 1850s. It was\ntransporting gold from California to Washington, D.C. and the gold was\nsalvaged. The insurance company recovered part of its losses by court action.\n\nTo prevent the spoils of shipwrecks within U.S. jurisdiction from being\ncarried to foreign ports for adjudication, Congress passed the Federal\nWrecking Act on March 3, 1825. It mandated that all property shipwrecked\nin these seas had to be brought to a U.S. port of entry. Businessman John\nSimonton reported in 1826 that \"\u2026from December, 1824, to December, 1825,\n$293,353.00 of wrecked property\u2026\" was sold in Key West.\n\nIn 1828, the U.S. established a Superior Court in Key West with maritime\nand admiralty jurisdiction and James Webb was appointed as its judge. Judge\nWilliam Marvin replaced him in 1839 and wrote the book on wrecking laws.\nJudge Marvin made considerable improvements on the then adversarial system\nagainst the ship owners. The only other courts were at St. Augustine and\nPensacola, so almost all of the Florida Keys wrecking property was taken\nto Key West. The wrecking act was further tightened in 1847.\n\nThe first Superior Court case tried in the Key West court was that of the\nship Nanna, which had run aground on Carysfort Reef and was able\nto be pulled off once lightened of 456 bales of cotton. The un-grounding\nwas accomplished by three wreckers who happened to be near. This was often\nthe case when a ship ran aground at low tide, if her hull was not split\nopen and quick acting assistance was near. The wreckers would secure their\nanchors in deeper water, lighten the ship's cargo and as the tide rose,\npull the stricken ship off of the reef using their capstans. There are\na lot of \"ifs\" in doing this, like principally, weather permitting.\n\nKeep the above case in mind as you read the remaining and ponder what if\nthe wreckers were not immediately available, the ships ran aground at other\nthan low tide, the weather was fierce, and the cargo did not lend itself\nto be easily off-loaded rather than throwing it overboard. In the Nanna's\ncase, the salvaged cotton was valued at $60,000, of which the wreckers\nwere awarded $10,000.\n\nThere were many wreckers operating during the wrecking hey-day. Some of\nthe better known were Jacob Housman, Ben Baker, Brandish \"Hog\" Johnson,\nJohn Geiger, \"Bull\" Weatherford and John Lowe.\n\nJacob Housman of Indian Key was involved in salvage court with a French\nship, the Vigilant, which had run aground near present-day Marathon.\nHe was found guilty of consorting with the ship's master to cheat the ship's\nowner. Evidently Housman and the ship's master split the reward. In this\ncase there were $32,000 in coins aboard. To learn more about Mr. Housman\ngo to the History of Indian Key.\n\nThe courts employed 13 rules of wrecking which are quite involved so I\nwill only summarize. These were legal rules and defined all parties, dealt\nwith collusion, licensing, discrimination, bribery, price fixing, using\na disaster to make a profit, wharfage, providing the ship's master with\na copy of rules, rights of the master wrecker, et cetera.\n\nThe wrecking ship and its master had to be licensed; its owner's name only\nto be recorded. The ones who really got rich were the ship owners and warehouse\nowners. William Curry, John Lowe and Asa Tift of Key West are good examples.\n\nConsortiums existed when various ships worked together. There were basically\ntwo types of consortships, one more or less permanent and another which\napplied only to a specific shipwreck and was null and void after that specific\nsalvage.\n\nWreckers also rewarded agents, such as fishermen, who reported a shipwreck\nto them. Being the first to arrive at the wreck site meant being capable\nof being the \"wrecking master,\" who could, but not necessarily, receive\na larger reward. This designate also was able to choose other wreckers\nwhich he wanted to assist in the project. The ship's master could choose\nwhomever he wished to be the master wrecker or none; however, in any circumstance\nother than a simple low tide grounding, he usually needed assistance as\nsoon as the first wrecker arrived on the scene.\n\nIdeally, only sufficient cargo should be removed to float the ship free\nat the next high tide. Often this required the assistance of other wreckers,\nwho would divide a reduced number of shares of the first, or master wrecker.\nThere is a case where a beer-laden ship was salvaged and considerable cargo\nwas consumed in the process. The court decreed no additional fees. In another\ncase, the wreckers consumed considerable food from the wrecked ship and\nthe judge deducted this from the award.\n\nThe wrecking industry began to wind down with the advent of effective lighthouses.\nCape Florida, Sand Key and Dry Tortugas had lighthouses since the 1820s.\nMany of the wrecks, though, were occurring in the Upper Keys. The Carysfort\nlighthouse was lit in 1852. Possibly before, at the same time or later\nwere a series of fixed iron day beacons along the outer edge of the refine.\nAccording to a 1855 dated U. S. Coast Survey chart each beacon had an alphabet\nletter from A through P and \"Erected by Lieut. James Totten U. S. Army.\"\nThe letter \"A\" was at Eastern Sambo off of Key West and the last was \"Beacon\nP\" off of Fowey Rocks south of Cape Florida. The total height of the beacon\nassembly was about 45 feet depending on the water depth. Each beacon had\na five-foot square lettered vane that rotated with the wind direction and\na 3 foot wide and five foot high cylinder of hoop iron on top. Some remains\ncan still be found.\n\nThe Sombrero Reef lighthouse off of Marathon was placed into operation\nin 1858. Slowly navigation was improved with the addition of lighthouses\nat Alligator (1873), Fowey (1878), American Shoal (1880) and Rebecca Shoal\n(1886). The advent of the steam powered steamship -steerable regardless\nof wind conditions- doomed wrecking as an industry. As a time reference,\nsteam powered ships were fairly common by the end of the Civil War.\n\nThe grounding of the steamship Alicia of Bilbao on Ajax Reef off\nMiami while en route to Havana is usually acknowledged as the end of the\nwrecking industry. The year was 1905 and wreckers came from many parts\nto assist. Captain \"Hog\" Johnson was the master wrecker. With much of the\ncargo was removed, the ship was floated only to be sunk again the next\nday in a severe wind squall.\n\nFor further information, all of the records of each shipwreck are in the\nMiami and Key West libraries. They are known as admiralty records, but\nare officially titled The Federal Court, Southern District of Florida,\nSetting in Admiralty.\n\nThe Wrecking License Bureau of the court closed in 1921. The last known\nlicensed wrecker, Captain Chet Alexander, passed away in 1984 -the final\ncurtain.\n\nThe book and movie, \"Reap the Wild Wind,\" starring Paulette Goddard\nand Ray Milland dramatized the life of a wrecker.\n\n------End------\n\nTHIS CONCLUDES THE TOUR, HOWEVER IN THE\n'INDEX' ON THE HOME PAGE THERE ARE OTHER LINKS TO FURTHER DOCUMENT THE\nHISTORY OF INDIAN KEY.

{"text":"Sunday, December 21, 2008\n\nMORE ABOUT BOATS (What are called ships on the ocean are called boats on the Great Lakes).\n\n\"The typical lake boat of the day was 200-300 feet long and displaced about 1,500 tons. Many were propelled by paddle wheels at the sides. The engines were one huge cylinder in an upright position. The connecting rod ran up through the center of the boat to one end of a \"walking beam\". From the other end of the beam another connecting rod ran down to a huge crank on the paddlewheel shaft which ran across the boat. The walking beam was at the very top of the boat and could be seen rocking whenever the boat was in motion. Sidewheel boats were in favor then because of the relatively shallow. small harbors. One wheel could be stopped with the other turning making it much easier to manuver the boat. Sidewheelers have all disappeared, however, probably none being built since 1910 or earlier\".\n\nThe lake boats were primarily built for passengers, but the lower deck would be stacked to the ceilings with fruit in season. They were marvels of naval archiecture. The larger ones--about 250 feet long were built with lavish use of mahogany and highly polished brass in an attempt to justify the use of ' Palatial' in the advertisements\".\n\n\"My first crossing of the lake was aboard the Graham and Morton steamer 'City of Chicago', about 1908. It was an impressive experience for a child, and for that matter most adults. Crossings were usualy begun at 11:00 P.M. to accomodate the arriving loads of fruit. The docks then were in Benton Harbor and the boat was towed by a tug through the canal about a mile to the St. Joseph harbor. As you left the piers and started out into the dark waters of the lake you got the impression of beginning a long voyage, not one of a mere 60 miles. After staying up to watch the boat leave the harbor we went to our stateroom. Upon awakening we found the boat docked at the foot of Wabash Avenue (no bridge there then) and were in the very heart of Chicago\"."}
{"text":"Friday, January 20, 2006\n\nFrom the archives, circa 1999: a particle on the waves.\n\nOcean shipping is the biggest real-time datastreaming network in the world.\n\nBy Stewart Taggart\n\nStaggering in from the sea, a cargo container ship heaves into the Port of Singapore every few hours. At the mouth of the harbor, tugboats take charge, guiding the ship into port like paramedics escorting a stretcher. Within minutes of each ship's docking, multiton containers are shifted from the decks. Sweaty crane operators, dangling in glass booths from the hoisting arms, hump cargo with amazing speed. They'd better hustle. The ships sail again with the tides.\n\nAway from the water's edge, trucks roar in and out of the port's gates. As each arrives, digitized data about its load is transmitted to a central port computer. Within seconds, the driver's beeper is paged by the computer, sending instructions for where to drop the truck's load among acres of five-deep container stacks. The cargo will land in a spot that minimizes the number of times it'll be moved before sailing.\n\nLest it seem that transporting physical goods by sea is hopelessly offline in a world of next-day delivery, consider that 95 percent of world cargo volume still moves by ship. FedEx and Airborne Freight, which handle but a tiny fraction of earth's cargo, generally carry small, high-value, time-sensitive goods, things like blood supplies or Wired magazines. The real heavy lifting happens down here, amid the grunting trucks and heaving cranes of cut-rate economy class. This is the domain of the lower-value, higher-volume majority of the world's cargo. Stuff like clothing, stereos, construction goods, household items. FedEx may be the planet's Formula 1, but ocean shipping is its 18-wheeler.\n\nAnd with the exception of bulk commodities like grain and oil, most sea cargo travels the world locked into standard-size containers commonly 8 feet wide, 8.6 feet tall, 20 or 40 feet long, and weighing up to 20 tons. In 1998, the steamy equatorial port of Singapore moved more than 15 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of such containers. That's the same as shifting around one of New York's World Trade Center towers each day. A close second to Singapore, Hong Kong moved 14.6 million TEUs. Today, enough shipping containers exist on the planet to build an 8-foot-high wall around the equator - twice.\n\nAt its heart, ocean shipping is a network business, just like airlines and telecommunications. Passengers, bulk goods, data - all three represent uniform-size cargo, shooting through global transport and sorting systems 24\/7\/365. Viewed this way, airline seats, data packets, and 40-foot shipping containers are much the same - commoditized units for carrying content.\n\nSo it's not surprising that container shipping has enjoyed its own network effects since its early years in the '50s. As more ports and ships carried containers, the benefits of being a container shipper or port grew. As more ports came online, carriers were able to expand their containerized fleets. And containers brought untold economies to shipping from the start, causing costs to drop steadily - and with them margins, which have fallen to around 5 percent, roughly one-third that of the average company in the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500.\n\nThe effects of the network continue to drive the business today. An otherwise sluggish industry, subject to a tangle of international regulations and charged politics, is nevertheless seeing innovation in the engineering of ships and ports. More marked, though, is the drive to advance using new information technologies. Forty-plus years after the introduction of the container, ubiquitous communications - new means for circulating and managing data - are hitting the industry like a 30-foot wave. Experts contend that the future of shipping lies in services that ride atop the shrinking margins of low-cost container transport - services like shipment tracking, flexible routing, stopwatch scheduling, and logistics management - each extended throughout the supply chain.\n\nAs this revolution unfolds, a once all-brawn industry, seen as the domain of musclebound stevedores and union toughs, is morphing into a brawn-and-brains business, peopled with computer geeks and systems whizzes.\n\nThe Packets\n\nJust as the Net and deregulated telephony spelled the death of distance for telecommunications, containers spelled the death of distance for manufacturing. By breaking down cargo into standard units, greater amounts could be more efficiently pushed through a network.\n\nToday this seems almost common sense. But look back to the 1954 film On the Waterfront and you'll get a good idea of how things used to be. New York dockworker Terry Malloy (played by Marlon Brando) climbed into the rusting hulls of cargo ships and used brute muscle to move freight using nets and grappling hooks. Loading and unloading was so slow, ships might remain in port for days, even weeks. Only four decades ago, contemporary photos of Singapore's port showed shirtless workers stumbling down wooden gangplanks carrying enormous bundles of bananas on their backs. It was called break-bulk shipping.\n\nThis inefficiency irked Malcom McLean, a crusty North Carolina trucker who defied convention to spark a logistics revolution that continues to reverberate today. Dubbed the Father of Containerization, he laid the foundation in the 1950s for what would arguably become the world's first truly packetized transport network.\n\nMcLean reckoned there had to be a better way of loading and unloading ships than the clumsy, slow, and theft-prone process of break-bulk. His first brainstorm: stacking sealed truck trailers on flatcars for long train journeys, trucking them only the few final miles to their destination. But the railroads weren't interested, so in 1955 he bought a small tanker company named Pan Atlantic and modified two of its ships to carry 58 detachable trailers. In order to stack the trailers, he removed the wheels and strengthened the sides. In April 1956, the first of these converted ships sailed from New York Harbor to Houston, and containerization became a sunrise industry.\n\nThe enterprise worked so well, he bought more ships and converted them, eventually operating out of Elizabeth, New Jersey, and renaming the company Sea-Land Service. In 1966 he sent the first container ship across the Atlantic to Rotterdam in the Netherlands, and within the next few years the company became a major carrier of mat\u00e9riel for the US military in Vietnam. To fill empty containers on the return leg, Sea-Land sought cargo for export to the US from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan. The region soon found its niche as a low-cost producer of consumer goods for export - all carried away on ships piled high with containers. Without containers, says Bill Flynn, Sea-Land's Hong Kong-based vice president for Asia, \"conventional shipping would have had a hard time handling Asia's volume of exports at any kind of affordable cost.\"\n\nThe result of this international shipping-unit standardization has been an economic win just about all around. Coupled with falling global tariffs, collapsing freight-transport costs provided a huge boost to postwar trade and living standards as an unprecedented range of goods came within reach of the world's consumers. Since 1950, world trade has grown more than twice as fast as the overall global economy.\n\nIn 1997, the volume of world merchandise exports rose 10.5 percent, more than double the world GDP growth of 4.1 percent. In 1998, export growth stood at 3.5 percent, still nearly double the 2 percent increase in world GDP. Between 1997 and 2005, according to UK-based analyst Drewry Shipping Consultants, container port throughputs worldwide are likely to rise by nearly 60 percent, to 271 million TEUs.\n\nNow, moving nearly seamlessly among ships, trucks, and trains, numbered boxes course through a system optimized to carry them. Each carries its own kind of header, known as a bill of lading, which identifies its contents and owner and directs its progress. On a single ship, thousands of containers are headed to different end destinations. Dangerous cargo, such as chemicals, is segregated; refrigerated containers are placed near the ship's power supply. Some containers are piled high up on the ship and some ride low, but all are strategically stacked to minimize a ship's loading and unloading time in port.\n\nFrom a small base of about 6.3 million in 1972, the number of containers handled by the world's ports had risen 26-fold, to 163.7 million, by 1997. As scale efficiencies grew, prices dropped. Over the past 20 years, nominal unit-transport costs on the key Asia-US route have fallen by about one-third, or roughly two-thirds in inflation-adjusted terms. Translated into walkmans and toys, this has put downward price pressure on just about any internationally traded good you've bought since the mid-'70s. Today, transport costs account for about 1 percent of the final price of consumer goods, making country of origin largely an afterthought in purchasing decisions.\n\n\"Remember the old westerns where the bartender points to the mirror above the bar and says, 'That came all the way from St. Louis!'?\" says Bruce Lambert, senior economist at Standard & Poor's DRI trade-forecasting service in Washington, DC. \"Today, it's often cheaper to move things from the Far East to the US than it is to move them domestically.\"\n\nBy breaking down cargo into standard units, containers spelled the death of distance for manufacturing.\n\nThe Hardware\n\nTake out your calculator. Assuming there's a modest $20,000 worth of shoes, shirts, clock radios, and computers in each 20-foot container, a fully loaded 6,000-TEU ship is hauling $120 million worth of cargo. Since each ship costs about $120 million itself, that's about a quarter-billion dollars afloat. At 5 percent interest, that's nearly $33,000 ticking away each day on just the inventory and the ship's value. That's why efficiency matters. And efficiency can be increased in only a limited number of ways.\n\nFor years, innovation in shipping centered on the ships. As ports handled more containers, the ships grew, from a petite 600 TEUs in 1966 to today's common 5,000. In 1999, when you talk of massive scale, it's hard to imagine what can surpass the gargantuan silver ships operated by the Maersk Line, a low-key Danish company with an Ozymandias complex. The 6,600-TEU container ship Sovereign Maersk and others like it cast among the biggest shadows in the business. Stand it up vertically and it's one-third taller than San Francisco's Transamerica Pyramid.\n\nBut bigger ships are on their way. A Maersk competitor, P&O Nedlloyd, has a ship on the sea, P&O Nedlloyd Rotterdam, with a capacity of 6,690 TEUs. Maersk is cagey about its plans, but few theorists see any engineering reason ships can't grow to 8,000 or 10,000 TEUs, or even into the 15,000- to 25,000-TEU realm. That kind of growth would require new efforts to expand the width of vessels, allowing room for more containers while providing better vessel balance. As dimensions of the huge craft change, ships become subject to the dangers of torsion, corkscrew effects that can cause vessels in heavy seas to bend at the center as much as 16 feet from bow or stern. According to Thomas Boyd, a spokesperson for Maersk, which is cranking out a new 6,600-TEU ship every three months - for a total of 13 - \"We've gone about as long as we can go without going wider.\"\n\nFar tougher, though, than any structural challenges in increasing the bandwidth of this network are the challenges of improving the routers. Already, the constraints of current ports are showing. In July 1998, Maersk sent another of its largest ships - the 6,000-TEU Regina Maersk - to the East Coast of the United States. Arriving to fanfare at Port Newark, New Jersey, the vessel had to enter the harbor less than full, riding the high tide and with its bridge mast down to avoid either being grounded in the harbor mud below or hitting the Bayonne Bridge above.\n\nJust as Manhattan's finger piers eventually became health clubs and condos as the shipping industry gravitated to huge container facilities along the New Jersey coastline, so New Jersey was almost bypassed as the revolution progressed. Earlier this year, Maersk and Sea-Land decided to keep their major East Coast hub in the New York\/New Jersey area, but not before seriously considering rival bids from Baltimore and Halifax, Nova Scotia.\n\nTo eliminate the need for dredging as bigger ships sit ever deeper in the water, some suggest building huge ports totally offshore, using them as scalable transshipment hubs for even larger ships. But physical space is hardly the only challenge posed by gigantic vessels. As ships grow to 8,000 TEU and above, ports may need to move as many as 330 containers per hour, more than twice what the average modern terminal handles today. Already, the Port of Singapore must hustle to get a ship like the Sovereign Maersk in and out within 24 hours, and Singapore is built to move more than double the containerized cargo handled by second-tier ports like Rotterdam and Kao-hsiung, Taiwan. That's almost four times the traffic of North America's biggest container port, Long Beach, California.\n\n\"We can easily build a much bigger ship,\" says Tom Winslow, former chief naval architect for APL, a top-tier US container carrier, and now a private consultant in Oakland, California. \"But you need the infrastructure to serve a ship of that size. It could take two to three days just to unload.\"\n\nAt its simplest, port container handling has much in common with how airports handle people. Units are checked in, stored in a departure area, and then put on a plane or ship. Packet throughput is always maximized, and speeding this flow is one of the holy grails of both businesses. That's because it allows planes and boats to do what they do best: earn money by being in transit.\n\nIn both industries, the bottlenecks occur in the transfer infrastructure. In aviation, ticketless travel, preissued boarding passes, and curbside check-in all aim at speeding the movement of travelers. In sea freight, storing containers as close as possible to their departing ships and increasingly digitizing the data exchanged among shippers, ports, and ship owners are high priorities. At your average container port, two sets of cranes are at work: loading cranes, which lift the containers on and off ships, and stacking cranes, which move containers around storage areas. Shuttle trucks move boxes between the two. And it's this process of unload, shuttle, and stack that ports now target for efficiency gains.\n\nThe Republic of Singapore's penchant for order and efficiency is suited to the controlled environment of handling cargo for transshipment. Today the Port of Singapore is spending heavily to build a new container terminal with a technological edge. In the new storage area, stacking cranes will slide along overhead tracks, instead of being moved by independent wheeled vehicles on the ground. In addition, crane operators will work from a central control room away from the stacks, and each operator will be able to control more than one crane.\n\nIn the Port of Rotterdam, pilotless automated guided vehicles (or AGVs) in a terminal operated by Sea-Land have been on the job since 1993. Some 50 AGVs circulate in a cordoned-off area of the terminal, ferrying containers from the stacking area to the ship-loading cranes. Using top-mounted infrared eyes, the AGVs travel freely, connecting the container stacks and the loading cranes. The system allows Sea-Land to work in fog that would otherwise have slowed or halted operations, and, what's more, the site is a drawing card for tourists, who journey out to the windy northern extremity of the Rhine to have a look. Jan Gelderland, Sea-Land's general manager for western Europe, says the unmanned vehicles have helped boost productivity at the port by 25 to 30 percent. He thinks they'll be most appropriate for high-volume, high-labor-cost ports.\n\nWhile crane technology has improved, landing a container on a freighter's deck is still like bowling in the dark. Lee Chok Leung is a 20-year veteran of crane operations at one of Hong Kong's busiest terminals, Modern Terminals Limited. Working for hours in a glass-enclosed perch 100 feet above the dock, he often must be directed via radio on the deck for stowage instructions - and as a safety precaution.\n\n\"It's hard, for instance, at night when it's raining,\" he says. \"But when I get one in just correctly, it feels a lot like playing a videogame well.\"\n\nElsewhere, other new technologies for increasing port efficiency are on the drawing board. One, called Speedport, would consolidate the functions of cranes and shuttle trucks, shifting containers between the ship and storage stacks on interlocking overhead tracks. \"We think of the system like ants at a picnic taking one crumb at a time in a continual assembly line,\" says John Arntzen, president of ACTA Maritime Development, a startup in Staten Island, New York, devoted to developing and marketing the system. \"It's kind of nature inspired.\" Arntzen believes Speedport could move more than 270 containers per hour.\n\nBut at press time, it had no takers. \"It's an interesting concept,\" says Maersk's Boyd, \"but it's still hypothetical.\" Other players in the industry tend to agree: The huge investments involved in ports make radical shifts to untried new technologies a menacing bet.\n\nInstructive innovations in port management are taking place in China, however, where brand-new ports - free of the problems of legacy technology - are nipping at the heels of established facilities. Take Shenzhen. This special economic zone bordering Hong Kong took off following China's economic reforms in 1979. Two Shenzhen ports, Yantian to the east and Shekou to the west of crowded Hong Kong, are building up volume rapidly. The three ports are expected to be the international spillway for a torrent of low-cost goods from southern China in the years ahead. With up-to-date equipment, such as new cranes, being installed on greenfield sites, Yantian and Shekou are in the vanguard of Chinese ports.\n\nLocated just three miles from the Hong Kong border, Yantian is mainland China's first developed deep-water port to handle a 6,000-TEU ship, the Knud Maersk. On the other side of Hong Kong, at the mouth of the silty Pearl River, the muddy port of Shekou likewise is ramping up. This port saw its container-throughput volume double in 1998, to 463,100 TEUs, a figure that could rise by 30 percent or more in 1999 as the region cranks out clothing, toys, and other goods for export.\n\nAs southern China continues to grow economically, the entire region may well become a kind of collective transport organism, breaking down into micromarkets such as international direct shipments, transshipments, and feeder traffic between larger ports and smaller ones. Hong Kong itself, one of the most cramped harbors in the world, broke ground this year for a major new container terminal expected to expand the port's current throughput by nearly 20 percent. It's scheduled to begin operations in 2002.\n\nOf course, aside from the challenges of dredging and loading, increased volume raises other problems. The bigger a hub port becomes, the more vulnerable it becomes to niche players. Think Southwest Airlines in the US: By offering low-cost direct service between secondary cities, the airline developed a profitable new service and stole business from hub-oriented lines. As bigger ships concentrate on fewer ports, the flexibility they can offer on routes and times will be crimped.\n\nIn ocean shipping, the Southwest Air equivalent may be small, superfast container ships able to deliver heavy goods much more promptly than monsters like the Maersk ships, but at lower cost than air freight. One company, called FastShip, plans to offer high-speed container service using jet-powered vessels traveling from Philadelphia to Cherbourg, France, at speeds up to 40 knots, compared with the Sovereign Maersk's 25. The idea is to offer a seven-day North Atlantic door-to-door service comparable in speed to air freight, but with a cost closer to that of liner shipping. \"Air freight can take on average five days,\" says FastShip spokesperson Thomas C. Beck, \"while many shipping companies use a thumbnail figure of 17 days for ship crossings.\" Time-sensitive industrial parts, expensive but heavy medical equipment, and even computers would be suitable cargo. FastShip plans to build four vessels for about $220 million per ship, with service expected to begin in 2002. Each ship would make 78 crossings a year, with the capacity to carry 1,432 TEUs per voyage.\n\nThe Network\n\nLarger ships, faster ports - these steady advances may guarantee the lumbering giants of ocean shipping the fiscal stability they've enjoyed for decades. Many in the industry, however, don't think so.\n\nStandard & Poor's Bruce Lambert breaks down the evolution of postwar shipping into three stages: The first was Malcom McLean's introduction of containers in 1956. The second was intermodalism, which allowed containers to be shifted more easily between trucks and trains, further integrating the land and sea shipping networks. Now, electronic data interchange and its Web-based offspring are ushering in a third era, marked by ubiquitous data about all goods in the supply chain, from factory to cargo ship to warehouse to retail store.\n\nUS carrier APL is a major believer in this third wave. In 10 years, the company thinks, half its business will come from moving information about goods, rather than moving the goods themselves. \"Ships are getting bigger and bigger, and transit times are becoming only marginally different between carriers,\" says Hans Hickler, APL's vice president of consumer-support processes. \"The difference between companies will come from services outside basic transport.\"\n\nFor APL, that means taking its cues from Web companies like Yahoo! and Excite. APL goes so far as to dub its own Web site a \"portal,\" where clients get personalized HomePort pages that give them customized shipping and arrival information - and let them track individual goods and shipments. Software made by firms like Oakland, California-based Navis allows the shippers themselves to plan out stacking arrangements for everything from weight to types of cargo to final destination.\n\nAs bigger ships sit ever deeper in the water, some suggest building huge ports totally offshore.\n\nTo Bruce Lambert, innovations like this begin putting every asset in transit under a spotlight as intense as any in a Hollywood movie. \"I'm reminded of the last scene in the film Raiders of the Lost Ark, in which some guy pushes the Ark of the Covenant into a huge warehouse, never to be seen again,\" Lambert says. \"Today, it would be barcoded and simply wouldn't get lost.\"\n\nWith this kind of visibility, goods in transit are not so different from goods stored, and some envision the transport network supplanting the function of traditional warehouses. As data exchange between shipping companies and customers becomes more integrated, ships like the Sovereign Maersk could replace those crusty warehouses at the edge of town. Why pay for a hotel if you can sleep in your Winnebago?\n\nMany of these changes are being pushed by cost-cutting discount retailers as they move toward just-in-time inventory-delivery systems. A store doesn't care if its offsite stocks are in a warehouse or on a ship as long as it can get delivery when it needs it. In this environment, a shipping company that can deliver within a specified time frame - and change that delivery time if need be - gains a competitive advantage, says Sea-Land's Flynn. Eventually, shipping companies might receive planning data from customers before goods are even produced. \"The further upstream you get information about an order or a shipment, the more you can do with the delivery process,\" Flynn says.\n\nHong Kong-based carrier Orient Overseas Container Line (OOCL) is already moving business upstream through smarter information management. At a collection center near Hong Kong, a wholly owned subsidiary consolidates goods from some 200 Asian suppliers into containers destined for Arcadia, a UK clothing chain. Once packed, most containers go direct from Hong Kong to individual stores, bypassing Arcadia's UK distribution warehouses. Arcadia saves both time and money, says Jeffrey Lau, director of OOCL's logistics subsidiary, Cargo System (Asia Pacific), so long as goods are packed into the containers in precisely the right order, right down to colors and clothing sizes needed by individual outlets. The company reduces the need for warehouse space and gains on delivery time in the UK. These savings more than offset the cost of sometimes air-shipping items in short supply.\n\nOOCL also provides packing services for electronics manufacturers. In Singapore, it packages stereo equipment, combining stereo components from Indonesia with speakers from Malaysia into boxes with the manufacturer's brand name. It then ships final goods to the manufacturer's warehouses for distribution to retail stores.\n\nBill Villalon, APL's head of global marketing, calls all this a reengineering of the supply chain \"from the factory floor to the retail store.\" Villalon works out of the Singapore headquarters of APL's parent, Neptune Orient Lines, and was around during APL's heady \"stacktrain\" days. In 1984 in the US, APL introduced low-slung railroad cars that carried shipping containers stacked two high instead of just one, boosting railroad freight efficiency roughly as much as compression software sped up Internet file transfers. Today, Villalon thinks the transport system can be tweaked again to APL's advantage by pushing its services further upstream; for instance, to the front doors of low-cost factories far inland in China. \"Customers often come to us and say they want low-cost goods from immature infrastructure environments like China, but without sacrificing the information richness they're used to,\" he says. \"We can handle some of that planning and coordination for them. These days, if you concentrate on being just an ocean carrier, you'll miss the boat.\"\n\nIn this new world, the fiber wire and the microchip are set to create the same supply-chain cost savings containers did - possibly greater ones. By lifting days and dollars out of the supply chain, the end-to-end cost of making and selling goods globally should continue to fall toward the vanishing point. As in so many other industries, a main enabler is the digital network.\n\n\"What we're seeing here is an exercise in mass synchronicity that's just never happened before,\" Villalon says. \"The Internet allows real-time gathering and dissemination of information on both the supply and demand sides.\" As such, everyone from ocean carriers to startup companies is getting involved in \"third-party logistics\" - a fancy name for outsourced management of some segment of the supply chain.\n\nThis new business remains highly fragmented. Over time, consolidation should occur as barriers between industries like shipping, trucking, and warehousing break down. For now, in a world growing accustomed to getting best-sellers from Amazon.com the day after tomorrow, the challenges are monumental. Glen Margolis, a onetime naval architect and former head of the supply-chain strategy team at Ernst & Young, is now at BigWords, a San Francisco ecommerce startup dedicated to distributing new and used college textbooks. With 2 million titles to track, and the need to turn orders around quickly, all his logistics needs at BigWords have to be satisfied in-house. The company can't find a vendor that can do a comprehensive job. \"Everyone has their specialty; they're all good at certain things,\" says Margolis. \"But no one has really emerged that's able to do everything well.\"\n\nUltimately, the logistics business will earn its profits through cutting costs for customers, and that's a finite profit horizon, Margolis says. The real winners, he thinks, will be manufacturers who collaborate with suppliers to reduce inventory costs. As this logistical synchronicity sinks ever deeper roots, it's the systems and information products flowing from interlinked corporate networks that will rise the most in value. Without those, you're flying blind.\n\nJust ask the US military. Under pressure to rapidly mobilize for the Gulf War in 1991, the military had no effective way to keep track of some 37,000 containers it shipped to the Middle East. \"We didn't have a good system for telling people what was in the containers,\" says Gary Adams, chief of the intermodal branch of the US Transportation Command at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois. \"Many piled up in open container lots. They had to be opened to see what was in them.\"\n\nSome firms believe that in 10 years half their business will come from moving information about goods, rather than moving the goods themselves.\n\nWith expertise in information management exploding across so many industries, it seems only a matter of time till ocean shipping gets its ammo labeled and makes these sorts of difficulties obsolete. Related businesses, such as suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors - and their banks - will demand it. The three information flows linked with freight cargo - the physical goods themselves, information about the goods (their location, value, route, and delivery time), and the financing of the goods (such as letters of credit) - will have to become more precise and thorough.\n\nImagine, for example, a US factory making finished goods - shoes and dresses - out of leather and textiles shipped from Mexico and China. If a storm disrupts the supply of leather from Mexico, that leaves the factory with the prospect of shutting down for a short time. Knowing the whereabouts of incoming textile shipments from China, though, a plant manager can decide to pay extra to the shipping line to give its textiles unloading priority at Long Beach - while simultaneously speeding up payment through its bank for the goods. The plant manager might also arrange for part of the textile shipment to be delivered by air to keep the plant busy until the rest of the shipment arrives by rail. Indeed, putting this capability on a plant manager's desk may determine who gets the plant's business.\n\n\"Providing the information part of the supply chain may well become the price of admission to the overall shipping business,\" says Doug Coates, a principal of Manalytics International, a San Francisco-based transport and logistics consultancy. \"If you don't have the service, you'll be eliminated before you get to the ballgame.\"\n\nThe Beast\n\nDespite all the big thinking and ideas for the future, some shipping specialists, like Glen Margolis, are pessimistic. Maritime freight shipping, they say, is a business that takes a long time to change. \"The shipping industry has been around almost as long as nations have existed,\" says Margolis, \"so thousands of years of tradition have built up around it. This is an industry centered on capital assets that can last up to 50 years.\"\n\nPeter Koch, the philosophical, free-speaking captain of the giant Sovereign Maersk, pilots one of these assets. A 50-year-old Dane who's been at sea for 32 years, Koch thinks more about the weather, pirates, and the need to plan several miles ahead in steering his oceanic beast than he does about moving data up the supply chain. Idle for several hours in the Port of Singapore, he taps an unlit cigarette on the ultrasophisticated instrument panel that drives this swollen floating warehouse and speaks of his lonely days out on the empty sea. \"Coming from the Suez Canal,\" he says, \"you can go eight to nine days with nothing happening. Not even a bird.\"\n\nMost of those days are spent on autopilot. Koch wears away the time pacing, checking the containers and the ship's equipment. His favorite part of the semiglobal voyage between Europe and Asia is the busy waters around Singapore, Japan, and Taiwan. \"I like a lot of traffic,\" he says. \"I thrive on the adrenaline.\" Bearing down at 75,000 horsepower and 25 knots, the Sovereign Maersk makes initial radio contact with Singapore just a few miles short of the port. Koch is preparing for docking, the most sensitive part of the journey. Easing the ship into a berth without crashing into the pilings is a task that makes docking the space shuttle on Mir look simple. The worst news the captain can hear at that point is that a berth isn't vacant. \"They may tell us to slow down,\" Koch says ominously, \"but we can't do that easily. This isn't a car. It takes time to reduce speed.\"\n\nThe irony of comparing the processes of container shipping with those of telecommunications is obvious. How can the mammoth bricks stacked on Koch's freight ship be reduced, through analogy, to nothing but a series of electrical impulses coursing through a thread of glass? Yet the redolence of the concept of \"network,\" pumped full of the corporate giddiness set off by the Internet, makes the comparison irresistible. And worthwhile. Since Malcom McLean, it's safe to argue, no single shift in the big-picture view of the business has been as important as the introduction of systems and insights produced by digital networking.\n\nBut the ironies linger. Perhaps they even stand out all the more. Still tapping his unlit cigarette, Koch gazes out from the bridge over stacks of bolted-down containers stretching from the bow to the stern. He doesn't see these boxes as part of the unitized superhighway of the networked economy. He sees only a field of silver metal over which the ocean's waves will crash in the heavy weather of the Indian Ocean, en route to Algeciras, Spain.\n\nThursday, January 19, 2006\n\nWe like to look.\n\nThe world's most profitable magazine is its own celebrity story.\n\nTHE FUTURE OF PUBLISHING As other publications in its stable come under pressure, Time Inc wants to squeeze even more value from People. Martha Nelson, the force behind the title, tells Joshua Chaffin of her new challenge.\n\nBy JOSHUA CHAFFIN 1264 words 17 January 2006 Financial Times London Ed1 Page 14 English (c) 2006 The Financial Times Limited. All rights reserved\n\nLast Tuesday, reporters and editors at People magazine were bracing for another late night as they prepared to send the latest issue to the printers. The magazine they were wrapping up was pregnant with one of the biggest scoops in celebritydom: the news that actress Angelina Jolie was carrying Brad Pitt's baby, which would soon be picked up by newspapers and websites around the world.\n\nYet sitting in her 30th floor office at the Time Inc building, surrounded by congratulatory bouquets of flowers, Martha Nelson felt strangely removed. For the last three years, Ms Nelson has been at the centre of the action as People's managing editor. But that has changed following her promotion two weeks ago to head a newly created People Group.\n\nIn her new post, Ms Nelson has been asked to step back and find ways to wring even more value from People and offshoots such as Teen People, People en Espanol and People.com. It will not be easy. People is already the most profitable magazine in the world. Although Time Inc does not disclose numbers, it is believed to have generated Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 736m) in revenue in 2004, according to Advertising Age, the industry trade publication, and contributed between one-quarter and one-third of Time Inc's Dollars 1.2bn in operating income that year. Since being founded 32 years ago, its weekly readership has grown to more than 40m.\n\n\"How do you take something that's big already and pick it up and turn it over and shake it from all sides and say: 'How much bigger could this be?'\" is how Ms Nelson sums up the -challenge.\n\nA lot is riding on her performance. While Time Inc remains the world's largest publisher, this reliable generator of cash has begun to come under pressure. Under former chief Don Logan, Time Inc racked up a legendary streak of consecutive quarterly earnings growth. Yet that was broken in 2003 for the first time in 13 years, and last year featured double-digit declines in advertising pages at Time and -Fortune.\n\nThat forced Ann Moore, Time Inc's chairman since 2002, to lay off 105 workers in December, many of them senior executives. With Carl Icahn, the activist investor pressing Time Warner to trim costs and possibly dump the publishing division, the industry is rife with rumours that more cuts are on the horizon.\n\nAs if that were not enough, there is also the looming challenge of the internet, which has already taken a toll on the newspaper industry and may also threaten magazines.\n\n\"Time Inc is really going through a transition right now,\" says Reed Phillips, a partner at DeSilva & Phillips, the media investment bank, who believes thatPeople Group could be part of a broader strategy for Time Inc's other major brands, such as SportsIllustrated and Entertainment Weekly.\n\nMs Nelson grew up in South Dakota, and prides herself on retaining a Midwestern sensibility about what people want to read. This allowed her, for example, to ignore Time Inc's strenuous consumer research and champion a People cover featuring Al Roker, the Today show weatherman, following his crash diet.\n\n\"The cover research said people weren't interested,\" Ms Nelson recalls. \"I said: 'Here's a man - a beloved television personality - who's just lost 100lbs. Believe me, people care.' \" And they did.\n\nShe joined Time Inc in 1992 in Australia to work on Who Weekly, was promoted to People and then sealed her reputation with the creation of InStyle, a fashion monthly that quickly grew to a circulation of 1.5m.\n\nIn spite of the fairytale aspects of her CV, Ms Nelson insists that she has faced publishing adversity. When, for example, she was named managing editor of People three years ago, she was well armed with ideas about how to make the celebrity and lifestyle bible into a faster, newsier read.\n\nHowever, no sooner had she landed in the editor's chair than the magazine was besieged by a group of new celebrity titles, including a relaunched US Weekly, In Touch Weekly, Star and Hello. Like a pack of glossy \"mean girls\" they were intent on knocking People from its throne as the queen of supermarket checkout lines. \"Any sane person would be worried, and I was worried,\" Ms Nelson recalls.\n\nEventually, however, she stopped being obsessed with the competition and focused on People's strengths. The magazine is broader and deeper than its competitors. While it maintains a stalker's interest in Tom Cruise, for example, People also dispatches reporters to places such as New Orleans and West Virginia to cover national tragedies. \"This is a magazine that can cover Angelina Jolie's pregnancy one minute, a child dying from a food allergy the next minute and the mining catastrophe another minute,\" she says. \"The people who work here are really best in class.\"\n\nMs Nelson also outflanked the competition with a series of new one-off, branded publications. These include People's Hollywood Daily, a showbiz guide to awards such as the Oscars and Grammies, and Your Diet, a handbook for recipes and healthy eating. It has also turned 20 years' worth of its annual Sexiest Man Alive issue into a book.\n\nEven in a more crowded market, People posted its best results ever in 2005, with circulation and advertising revenues both rising to all-time highs. \"You have to be aware of the competition,\" says Ms Nelson, who still features US Weekly and other competitors on the rack outside her office. \"But you have to lead with your own vision - not looking back at the competition.\"\n\nLooking ahead, Ms Nelson says she is still deciding \"where to place the bets\". She sees limited growth opportunities overseas; most foreign markets tend to have a local equivalent. Instead, like other media groups, she is focusing on the internet. Visitors to People.com have doubled in the past year after Ms Nelson moved the web staff to the same floor as the magazine. The site is now used to break celebrity news, such as the Jolie pregnancy. Yet its advertising, which is sold by corporate sister AOL, is not yet a significant contribution to the bottom line.\n\nMs Nelson is also testing a mobile phone service that might send paying subscribers breaking news, such as the break-up of actors Hilary Swank and Chad Lowe.\n\nIn spite of excitement surrounding digital initiatives, Ms Nelson is not yet ready to give up on the printed page. Magazines, she believes, are better insulated from the threat of theinternet than newspapers because readers tend to have more intimate relationships with them. This appears to be especially true of women's titles.\n\nDuring a recent investor presentation Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's president and chief operating officer, said that this was because men - particularly young ones - had flocked to the internet in greater numbers. Ms Nelson declines to speculate on this. Nonetheless, she intends to launch more People-branded special issues this year - although she will not disclose what subjects she is considering.\n\n\"Right now, you hear a lot of people say that print is a mature industry,\" Ms Nelson says. \"Personally, I see print as a growth opportunity.\"\n\nChocolate city.\n\nHow a tough-minded businessman and philanthropist catered to the nation's sweet tooth.\n\nBy Jonathan Yardley\n\nSunday, January 15, 2006; BW02\n\nDuring the Gilded Age of the late 19th and early 20th centuries -- the age of rapacious corporate bullies characterized by Theodore Roosevelt as \"malefactors of great wealth\" -- Milton S. Hershey was a man apart. The candy that he manufactured in idyllic, small-town Pennsylvania made him a millionaire many times over, he could be exceedingly tough in his dealings with competitors and employees, and he liked to live the high life during his frequent overseas jaunts. Yet he was a member of the \"progressive crusade\" that formed in reaction against the robber barons, and, as Michael D'Antonio puts it, he \"had a strong sense of morality and responsibility\" as well as firm convictions \"about the purpose of wealth and the promise of American life.\"\n\nThese convictions led him to do some remarkable things. When he moved his business from the lovely old city of Lancaster into the Pennsylvania countryside, he built an entire town -- Hershey, of course -- that was \"neat and inviting,\" in which modern houses were made available to employees at reasonable prices and numerous civic amenities were provided. For many years he gave employees generous bonuses; if in part these were aimed at scaring off unions, they also reflected a belief that labor as well as management had a stake in private enterprise. Perhaps most remarkably, he established the Milton Hershey School for the housing and training of orphan boys and eventually turned over to it what amounted to his entire fortune.\n\nD'Antonio, a Pulitzer prize-winning journalist, begins his biography with events that occurred in 2002, nearly 60 years after Hershey's death. Members of the Milton Hershey School Trust, which oversees the school -- which by then had grown to \"an eleven-hundred-pupil residential school for needy children\" -- and controls the Hershey Foods Corporation, \"decided that the charity's dependence on the firm's stock was unwise.\" The trust's $5 billion portfolio was immense, but the trustees believed that diversification was in the school's best interests. Therefore they proposed to sell the Hershey Foods Corporation to the highest bidder and to spread the portfolio among numerous blue-chip investments.\n\nThe school scarcely needed more money, but from a purely fiduciary point of view, the decision made sense; the trustees merely proposed to act in the trust's best interests, which is what trustees are supposed to do. But the people of Hershey didn't see it that way. They feared that a new owner might move the candy-making operation elsewhere, putting 6,000 townspeople out of work, and that their picture-postcard town would no longer be a prime tourist attraction. So they appealed to the press (this newspaper included), which sent in reporters who heard their message: \"a uniquely benevolent and impossibly cute village, which called itself 'the Sweetest Place on Earth,' was being bullied out of its dreamy existence by coldhearted money managers.\"\n\nThat was oversimplification, of course, but it did arouse a lot of sympathy elsewhere, including in the governor's office -- eventually the trustees caved in, though not happily -- and it served as a reminder that the company, the town and the school were the legacy of a remarkable and unusual man. Hershey is scarcely so well known as many of his approximate contemporaries -- Rockefeller, Carnegie, Morgan et al. -- but to just about every American, his name is synonymous to this day with chocolate, and at a moment when too many of the Gilded Age's corporate excesses are being repeated in 21st-century style, it is useful to contemplate his far more modest example.\n\nHershey was born in Lancaster in 1857, the son of Henry Hershey and the former Fanny Snavely, a name right out of W.C. Fields's \"The Fatal Glass of Beer.\" His father was an amiable ne'er-do-well who was better at dreaming than working, while his mother came from a comparatively prosperous family and expected her son (there was also a daughter, who died young) to make a mark on the world. Milton's education ended when he was 12, and when he was 15 he got a job downtown at Joseph P. Royer's Ice Cream Parlor and Garden. It was there that he began to learn the fine art of candy-making, to which he brought his father's penchant \"for playful schemes and big ideas.\"\n\nHe soon set out on his own. Bankrolled by the Snavely exchequer, he opened his own candy shops, first in Philadelphia, then in New York. Both failed, but he learned a lot -- not just about making candy but also about the lives of the \"poor, neglected, and abused boys and girls\" he observed in New York. He returned to Lancaster determined \"to make a candy no one else produced in the East -- Denver-style caramels.\" This time the Snavelys said they'd lost enough on him: \"Years later he would say, with a hint of pride, that he realized he had become, like his father, a 'black sheep' in the eyes of his Snavely uncles. This rejection was a great motivator.\" Indeed it was. He figured out a formula for making caramel candy that would \"keep fresh for weeks and perhaps months\" and got a big order from a British buyer. He was on the way:\n\n\"After so much struggle it was strange that one big break -- an order from an importer who happened to pass through town -- would make Milton Hershey a success. The classic script would call for, at the very least, some minor setbacks and skirmishes with tough competitors. But none of those things happened. Instead, Hershey's sales abroad increased steadily, giving him a secure base for his business. He also exploited his recipe, and the advantages of his location, to build his business at home.\"\n\nHe called the company Lancaster Caramel. By the early 1890s, it was in a 450,000-square foot building in Lancaster, then in satellite factories elsewhere in Pennsylvania and in Chicago. He had more than 1,400 employees and a burgeoning bank account. He also had, by the turn of the century, the sense that caramel's day was done, that milk chocolate -- successfully produced in Europe and England but not in the States -- was the next big thing. He sold Lancaster Caramel for $1 million, bought up about 4,000 acres between Lancaster and Harrisburg, and began to build his factory and town.\n\nHe did all this without having lit upon a formula for mass-producing milk chocolate, but with the help of an old hand from the Lancaster factory he came up with one. It had -- and has -- \"a distinctive flavor,\" sweet, of course, but with \"a single, faintly sour note\" that soon came to \"define the taste of chocolate for Americans, who would find harmony in the sweet but slightly sour flavor.\" The flavor is so familiar, so part of the American grain, that I can taste it as I type these words.\n\nYou know the rest of the story, at least the most famous part of it. The candy on which Hershey put his own name was a colossal success. M.S., as he was by then known, soon had the money to indulge his taste for luxury; a wife, Catherine, with whom to share it; and the home (established in 1910) for boys who were known locally as \"replacements for the children the couple could not have on their own.\" It was a time when \"wayward, needy and orphaned children, whose ranks increased with every epidemic, war, and natural or man-made disaster, were a great social concern.\" It \"was fashionable to worry about these children,\" but Hershey actually did something about them.\n\nThe remaining three decades of his life were devoted to spending as much time as possible with Catherine, who died in 1915 after a long illness, and to following various other business ventures. He got into sugar production in Cuba for a while, weathered the Depression thanks to the low cost of candy bars, and during World War II made \"millions of bars per week for the armed services.\" The \"Hershey chocolate that traveled with the troops was a sweet reminder of home and it became an icon of Americanism for the people who were liberated by U.S. forces,\" all of which was very good for business.\n\nHershey was no saint. As a businessman he \"was controlling . . . and would not share power with anyone. He squeezed wages and resisted workers' attempts to form unions,\" though finally, in 1937, they got the better of him. He had a temper, and his kindness, though very real, was unpredictable; he \"could be both generous and short-fused.\" Within Hershey, though, both the company and the town, his legend was clear: \"He was tough-minded but fair. He wanted his workers and their families to live in dignity.\" To an impressive degree, he accomplished precisely that.\n\nD'Antonio's biography is thorough and fair. He's a better reporter than writer, but there's nothing unusual about that. Hershey is a valuable addition to the literature of American business and philanthropy. \u00b7\n\nJonathan Yardley is The Washington Post's book critic.

But businesses collect, too: The documents, products and records a company keeps in its archive help create institutional memories. Sometimes those memories are of products that worked, sometimes not.\n\nThe Texaco Star Theater was a Tuesday night TV staple from 1948 to 1954. Each week four men in crisp matching gas station uniforms sang their jingle and introduced the show's star: Milton Berle.\n\nBerle's show was one of the most popular on TV at the time and Texaco reaped the rewards. Over the years, the company also linked its petroleum products to aviation daredevils, movie stars, and even radio broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera.\n\nFor years, Texaco kept these clips and other corporate records in its archive in New York. But in 2001, Texaco merged with the Chevron Corporation in California -- and the archives of both century-old companies were combined.\n\nThe commingled archive is located eight miles from Chevron's headquarters. In an unmarked building in a non-descript office park, boxes are stacked in rows 35 feet high, almost to the ceiling.\n\nIn among millions of photographs, documents and artifacts are the contents of a corporate time capsule and a stash of service station give-away items.\n\nJohn Harper, who oversees the archive, also discovered a rare 1939 short film made for Chevron's predecessor -- Standard Oil Company of California -- by Walt Disney. The film features a parade of cartoon characters -- including the Three Little Pigs and the Big Bad Wolf.\n\nThe film touted a new marketing campaign and was shown only to oil company staff and service station owners. Staff can still see it. And it can still be useful, says Christina Fong, an assistant professor in the business school at the University of Washington in Seattle.\n\n\"Companies that can really leverage from the information stored in their archives can do things like prevent past mistakes and use older ideas,\" says Fong. \"Those types of things can really help them to succeed in the marketplace.\"\n\nThat's how Nike designers say they use the 23,000 pieces of sports memorabilia at the company's Beaverton, Ore., campus, where Cindy Romaine is corporate archivist.\n\n\"It's like, why do we read the Constitution of the United States?\" she says, \"because if we can tap into what that thinking was we're a lot further in our current situation trying to solve the problems of today.\"\n\nComparing Nike's collection of running shoes to the U.S. Constitution is a bit of stretch. Still, Romaine says Nike designers often visit the collection for inspiration. The boots Nike designed for the first Batman movie are here, as is the extra large baseball uniform -- and jock strap -- the company created for John Candy to wear in the 1985 sports movie Brewster's Millions. Today 143 pairs of shoes from the 1970s and '80s are laid out on 10 long folding tables. They were purchased recently from a collector in Japan to fill holes in the archive.\n\nNike's goal is to collect at least one of every item Nike has produced. There are still about 50 models missing. Romaine hopes folks will check their closet floors for old sneakers that might have stories to share with today's Nike designers.\n\nSunday, January 15, 2006\n\nhistory is history\n\na sillicon valley maven no less than larry ellison declared the valley dead in 2005. to be more accurate, he said valley is headed towards becoming the next detroit. labor outsourcing and high cost of living were the two most cited reasons why media pundits were skeptical if the valley would survive. many saw 2005 as the tech market top and end of the economic growth cycle. fears of bubbles abound and inevitable comparisons to 2000 have been whispered. the consumer has been declared overspent, over-indebted, and dead. housing market is said to be at a peak.\n\nthe view from the ground level is considerably different. commercial and residential real estate is getting tight. job market is blossoming. VC money is pouring into the community. most tellingly, the backyard barbecues are abuzz with ideas and optimism. there is a huge disconnect between the valley we read about in the Mercury News and the valley we see everyday. if anything, 2005 felt a lot more like 1995 than 2000. if so, we may be at the early stages of a significant boom in the valley. and due to clear memories of the false start of 2005, this one may prove more enduring and far more grand.\n\nnaysayers would point to the fact that history repeats itself and those that ignore it will get burned. all true as human nature has not had sufficient time to evolve about from dislocations exposed by modernity. however, the way we use history is rapidly changing. in the past, history could repeat itself in part because no one could remember it. were people heading into the great depression reminded incessantly about the tulip bubble? point is, history itself has become a participant in history unlike ever before as we have information about the past like never before. these history lessons become sources of distortions and agendas. nowadays, declared reminders of the lessons of history means that the re-enactments will be considerably distorted. no doubt the past will occur again, but perhaps not in the exact way, since we keep reminding ourselves that it will happen and are too vigilant about it.\n\nnot that cyclical nature of history is about to disappear. we started 1990 at the peak of optimism that was destroyed by recession and war the next 5 years. by 1995 optimism had returned but noticed only be the leading edge whlie the pack was licking its wounds.\n\ngetting back to the state of the valley, what happened during the last decade was a ideal set of events compressed into a short 10 years. tons of wealth transfer to SV, which raises the standard of living. tons of first-hand experience of failure (largely at other's expense, unfortunately) that teaches important lessons. importing of enormous talent both nationally and internationally into the community. emergence of a new meritocracy and social order and reduction of complacency. outsourcing of functions that have become low-value such as software programming as valley continues to climb the levels of intellectual abstraction. rising cost of living which acts as an effective filter for talent by weeding out the non-leaders.\n\nif all this holds true, it may be time to fasten our seat-belts. 2005 may be the 1995 of this decade and we all know what ensued."}

I think sea trials was the biggest laugh because the majority of people that went out on sea trials had never been to sea in their life and the smell of burning paint, once the heat starts to get into the ship fully and the smell for the galleys and the toilets, where people were being sick and people being sick in the passageways and on the companionways!\n\nSo what was sea trials?\n\nSea trials is the actual trail of the machinery on the ship \u2013 the full ship where your proving to the Ministry of Defence that everything is up in a working condition.

A full rigged ship is said to have a ship rig.\nSometimes such a vessel will merely be called a ship, particularly in 18th - early 19th Century and earlier usage, to distinguish it from other vessels such as schooners, barques, barquentines, brigs, et cetera. Also a full rigged ship may be referred to by its function instead, as in collier or frigate, rather than being called a ship."}
{"text":"Since 1861, ferries have provided a faster and more reliable means of transport for residents along Sydney Harbour and the Parramatta River, helping to play an important role in the growth and development of such suburbs as Manly, Mosman, Circular Quay and Balmain. This half-ship model of the SS 'Lady Napier' represents the type of ferries that serviced the Balmain run, the only south shore ferry service which has continued uninterrupted to the present day.\n\nThe 'Lady Napier' was the second ferry commissioned in a series of 'Lady' vessels (after the 'Lady Mary' 1892) and is a class of ferry which is still in use today. The 'Lady' series, as shown with the 'Lady Napier', were double-ended ferries that characterised the refined operation of the double-ended type. They marked the beginning of the mainstay of ferry operations and also act as a legacy for Norman Selfe, the designer of the first double-ended screw ferry (the 'Wallaby'), who was to be succeeded by the eventual pioneer of this design, Walter Reeks.\n\nThe 'Lady Napier' was built in Sydney and attests to a once vibrant shipbuilding industry that operated on the shores of Sydney Harbour and the Parramatta River, while this particular model, also made in Sydney, is an excellent example of the model making abilities and ingenuity of the Scottish expatriate shipwright, James Scott.\n\nShip models such as this one were made for shipbuilders to assist in their full-scale construction, helping to provide the builder with an idea of the vessel's fittings, riggings and sail plans, as well as helping to show the ratio of length to beam and the fining of her entry and stern. This ship model also acts as a legacy of the SS 'Lady Napier' which was disposed of in 1934.\n\nThis quarter block model of the 'Lady Napier' was designed by Norman Selfe and made by G. Ellis of the Balmain New Ferry Company, Sydney in 1892.\n\nNorman Selfe was a civil and mechanical engineer, inventor and teacher who was born in Teddington, Middlesex, England on December 9, 1839. In January 1855, Selfe arrived in Australia and one year later (at the age of 17) began work as an apprentice for P.N. Russell & Co where he later became chief draftsman. From 1865-1868, Selfe was in partnership with James Dunlop and was responsible for designing and building major installations for the Australasian Mineral Oil Company, the Western Kerosene Oil Company and the Australian Gaslight Company. In 1869, he became chief engineer and draftsman for Mort's Dock & Engineering Co, designing the machinery for the 500 tonne 'Governor Blackall'.\n\nIn 1876, Selfe set up private practice, designing over 50 steamships including 2 torpedo boats for the New South Wales Government and the first double-ended screw ferry, the 'Wallaby'. Selfe reputedly introduced the compound engine in Australian boats and was also an expert in dock design, building the first concrete quay wall in Sydney Harbour and most of the wharves for deep-sea vessels. Furthermore, Selfe was a strong advocate of a 'Circular City Railway' linking Sydney's outlying suburbs to the ferries and was also responsible for introducing ice-making machines and lifts into Australian society.\n\nSelfe died on October 15, 1911 at Normanhurst, Sydney (the suburb which is aptly named after him) and is buried in the Gore Hill cemetery.\n\nThe 'Lady Napier' was the second ship produced in a series of 'Lady' vessels after the 'Lady Mary', 1892 and before 'Lady Manning', 1893 and 'Lady Hampden', 1896. The 'Napier' was built for ownership and use by the Balmain New Ferry Company and was primarily used for servicing the Balmain run.\n\nThe Balmain New Ferry Company can be traced back to 1842 when Henry Perdriau established a Sydney ferry service to the city of Sydney (the Balmain Ferry Fleet). This company operated until 1882 at which time it was sold to the Balmain Steam Ferry Company. For 10 years the company operated uninterrupted until a rival group, the Balmain New Ferry Company was formed in 1892 to offer more competitive fares for passengers (one penny instead of three pence). The Balmain New Ferry Company bought out the Balmain Steam Ferry Company in 1900 and in 1906 also bought the Hunters Hill and Lane Cove Ferry Company from Jules Joubert. In 1917, the Balmain New Ferry Company was taken over by Sydney Ferries Ltd. The Balmain ferry service, however, is still in operation today and is the only south shore ferry service which has been able to continue uninterrupted.\n\nThe 'Lady Napier' worked until 1928 (at which time it was converted to a houseboat) before being broken up in 1934"}

NOAA towed the ship from VT Halter Marine, which said that it was 98 percent complete, and completed it elsewhere.\n\nThe 124-foot, twin-hull ship will conduct basic hydrographic surveys of the sea floor using side scan and multibeam sonar technologies. The ship is also equipped to deploy buoys and unmanned submersibles and conduct general oceanographic research. Ferdinand R.

{"text":"The Black Pearl, originally Wicked Wench, is a fictional ship in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series. In the screenplay, the Black Pearl is easily recognized by her distinctive black hull and sails. The ship was originally named Wicked Wench before she was ordered burned and sunk by Lord Beckett...\n\n. Pintel and Ragetti, along with Barbossa and the crew of the Black Pearl, share in the Aztec curse and are immortal for the majority of the film., Pintel and Ragetti serve under Captain Jack Sparrow, again providing comic relief and additionally the occasional important insight into other characters. They join the ever-lengthening list of people who want the Dead Man's Chest, hoping to \"remove temptation\" from the other characters' path and make a profit themselves.\n\nIn Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, Ragetti and Pintels' roles play a bit more importance to the plot while still supplying comic relief. In this installment, they serve under Hector Barbossa in the journey to rescue Jack, and then serving in the joint effort by Barbossa and Sparrow to defeat the East India Trading Company. Ragetti's wooden eye is used by Barbossa as his \"Piece of Eight\" (one of a group of nine Pieces of Eight used to free Calypso) and his empty eye socket is later covered with an eye patch.Early life\n\nLittle is known about the background of either Pintel or Ragetti. Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook had decided that Pintel is Ragetti's uncle and Ragetti is the son of a prostitute, although this has not been confirmed in the movies.\n\nAccording to Pirates of the Caribbean: The Visual Guide, prior to serving as cannoneers aboard the Black Pearl, Ragetti and Pintel spent a year as naval sailors, press-ganged into service for the British Royal Navy before deserting to escape the bad food and abusive treatment.\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\n\nThe two pirates served aboard the Black Pearl under Captain Sparrow until first mate Hector Barbossa\n\nHector Barbossaturned them against him. The crew maroons Jack on an island and leave him to die (though he eventually escapes). Later Captain Barbossa becomes \"Captain\" much to Bootstrap Bill's infuriation. Bootstrap was the only one that vouched for Jack during the mutiny and sent a coin to his son Will in order to keep the crew cursed for betraying Jack. Barbossa in response tied a cannon to Bootstrap and threw him overboard the Pearl only to discover that Bootstrap is needed to lift their curse. They are first seen in The Curse of The Black Pearl when they invade the governor's house and take Elizabeth Swann\n\nElizabeth Swann\n\nElizabeth Swann is a major character in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series produced by Walt Disney Pictures. She appears in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl and its two sequels, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End...\n\nprisoner. In the sea battle between the Black Pearl and the H.M.S. Interceptor, they fire the chainshot that smashes the H.M.S. Interceptors foremast, making pursuit impossible. They also facilitated the cursed pirates boarding the doomed ship by dressing in women's clothing to attract the attention of the men on the ship. Their characters provide comic relief during the movie's more intense scenes and provide storyline information. When the curse is broken and the pirates defeated, they are captured and jailed. They serve as secondary antagonists of the movie.\n\nA running gag, or running joke, is a literary device that takes the form of an amusing joke or a comical reference and appears repeatedly throughout a work of literature or other form of storytelling....\n\nthroughout the first movie involves characters surrendering themselves to Ragetti and Pintel while invoking the right of \"par\". At first they are pleased with invoking parley but according to the story's premise parley guarantees a prisoner will be escorted unharmed to the captain in order to conduct negotiations. Then they become irritated when all their captures invoke parley especially when Jack Sparrow invokes parley after he was discovered alive. At one point, Pintel snarls at his captives, \"If any of you so much as thinks of the word 'parley', I'll have your guts for garters!\". Ironically, after they are captured, Pintel attempts unsuccessfully to invoke parley himself which The East India Company took as a surrender tone.\n\nThere are also frequent gags involving Ragetti's wooden false eye, which causes discomfort and is often knocked out of its socket and has him frantically searching for it; one of Ragetti's professed desires is to have a real glass eye. It is not known how he lost his real one, though in At Worlds End, it is revealed that the wooden eye is one of the nine \"pieces of eight\" the Brethren Court used to imprison Calypso in her human form. Barbossa, a pirate lord, gave it to Ragetti for safekeeping.\n\nThere are also jokes about the two characters' feelings of closeness. Whenever they do, they become embarrassed or angry, and the moment quickly passes; therefore directorjokingly described the two as more of a \"married couple\".\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\n\nIn the sequel, the pair have escaped jail and are rowing a boat to Pelegosto island, along with the dog who holds the keys to the jail cells to which they name the dog \"Poochie\". Ragetti has become somewhat religious, telling Pintel, \"Since we're not immortal no more, we gotta take care of our immortal souls\" when attempting to read the Bible\n\nBible\n\nThe Bible refers to any one of the collections of the primary religious texts of Judaism and Christianity. There is no common version of the Bible, as the individual books , their contents and their order vary among denominations...\n\n(unsuccessfully, holding the book upside down). When they find the Black Pearl run aground on the island, Pintel convinces Ragetti that taking the ship would be salvage, and that salvaging would be saving it. Although they attempted to steal the Black Pearl, Jack magnanimously, if unintentionally, allows them to rejoin his crew. Although they become more or less loyal members of his crew, the writers state in the DVD commentary that Jack considers them, as well as James Norrington\n\nJames Norrington\n\nJames Norrington, CB is a fictional character in Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean film series. He is played by English actor Jack Davenport.-Character history:...\n\n, as the most expendable crew members.\n\nLater, when Jack is searching for Davy Jones's heart and a fight breaks out between himself, Norrington, and Will Turner\n\nWill Turner\n\nWilliam \"Will\" Turner, Jr. is a central character in the first three titles of the Pirates of the Caribbean film series produced by Walt Disney Pictures. He is played by Orlando Bloom . Will is a blacksmith's apprentice working in Port Royal...\n\n, Pintel and Ragetti once again have an opportunity to steal something valuable; to convince his partner, Pintel tells Ragetti they will be \"removing temptation from their paths\" by stealing the Dead Man's Chest. They take it, but do not get far before Elizabeth catches up to them. Pintel greets Elizabeth much as he greeted her when they first met by saying, in an eerie tone, \"'ello, poppet\". Before they can do anything to her, however, Davy Jones's crew attacks and they drop the chest. When the Flying Dutchmans crew overtakes them, they fight alongside Elizabeth, with whom they share the two swords that Ragetti and Pintel had.\n\nDespite their fighting success, they quickly hand their swords to Elizabeth and take off with the chest again, which they promptly lose. When cornered by Jones's men, they still fight with various objects used as improvised weapons.\n\nThe two pirates are not without loyalty or humanity. When the Kraken attacks the Black Pearl, Ragetti saves Elizabeth from its deadly tentacle. Both Ragetti and Pintel shed genuine tears of respect and grief over Jack's demise and join the pledge to resurrect their fallen captain; this is ironic, considering they supported and participated in Barbossa's mutiny against Jack and marooned him on the island (the change seems to have come from the fact that he came back for and \"sacrificed\" himself for his crew, including them).\n\nThe comic duo (especially Ragetti) can unexpectedly engage in erudite and intelligent discussions. In these discussions, Ragetti often proves that he is more educated than he appears, even though he is illiterate, though Ragetti argues the point. When Tia Dalma\n\nTia Dalma\n\nTia Dalma, played by Naomie Harris, is a fictional character from the movie Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and a primary character in the movie Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, in which a significant amount of the plot revolves around her and her powers...\n\nsays that something vexed Davy Jones so much that he abandoned land for an eternal life at sea, Ragetti asks whether this was \"the dichotomy\n\nDichotomy\n\nA dichotomy is any splitting of a whole into exactly two non-overlapping parts, meaning it is a procedure in which a whole is divided into two parts...\n\nJoshamee Gibbs, often referred to as Mr. Gibbs, Master Gibbs, or simply Gibbs, is a fictional character in the Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise, played by Kevin McNally and voiced by Steven Jay Blum in video game adaptations .-Character overview:Gibbs is a generally...\n\nto give him astonished looks. The two also engage in a debate over the proper pronunciation of \"Kraken\n\nKraken\n\nKraken are legendary sea monsters of giant proportions said to have dwelt off the coasts of Norway and Iceland.In modern German, Krake means octopus but can also refer to the legendary Kraken...\n\n\", with Pintel saying he believes the correct pronunciation is \"kray-ken\" while most say \"krack-en\". Ragetti explains that the derivation of the word is from original Scandinavian\n\nNorth Germanic languages, and thus should be pronounced \"krah-ken\". Pintel points out they are not \"Original Scandinavians\", to which Ragetti retorts, \"It's a mythological creature, I can calls it what I wants!\". Ragetti also displays a knack for knowing things he should not, such as the reasons for which Jack, Will, and Norrington each want the heart of Davy Jones(Jack to control Jones and protect himself, Will to free his father from the less-than-friendly bond between the Flying Dutchman and her crew, and Norrington to restore his honor). This tendency had earlier appeared in The Curse of the Black Pearl, wherein Ragetti compares a ruse used by himself and Pintel to the ruse ofwhile they were distracting the Royal Navy by pretending to be women: \"It's just like what the Greeks done at Troy... 'cept they was in a horse, not dresses. Wooden horse\".\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\n\nBefore the movie was released, the actors announced that the characters of Ragetti and Pintel would play roles of some importance to the plot. In an interview with Empire magazine (Australia) Mackenzie Crook says \"You sort of discover that Lee (Arenberg) and I are there for more than just comic relief in the third movie. It turns out that we do have a purpose in the grand scheme of things\". As seen in the trailer and in the movie itself, the two throw swords up through floorboards of Sao Feng's bathhouse to Elizabeth and Barbossa, allowing them to defend themselves when both Feng and the East India Trading Company attack.\n\nIn Davy Jones' Locker, when Jack is \"choosing\" his crew members, he refuses Ragetti, saying, \"Don't need you, you scare me\", though he comes anyway. When Barbossa asks 'Where you would be going Jack?' with the charts in his hands, clearly alluding to the fact that he, and not Jack ought to be the captain, Pintel and Ragetti are seen standing behind Barbossa with a sadistic smile in their faces, indicating that once they have learnt that contrary to what they had been thinking up to then, Jack hadn't really \u2032sacrificed\u2032 himself to Kraken to save their lives, but was rather pushed into it courtesy Elizabeth, they are no longer loyal to Jack. When Jack asks the crew if anyone saved him because they missed him and not to serve their own ends, the two are among the few (including Jack the Monkey) to raise their hands. Later, when Barbossa and Sparrow arguing over who is Black Pearl's captain, Pintel yells at them to stop arguing, leaving the two briefly stunned into silence. Realizing his precarious position, he apologizes, saying he is under the impression that the position of captain is open to election. Ragetti consoles his old friend by saying \"I would have voted for you\".\n\nRagetti's eye is used in a ritual to free Calypso; when Barbossa fails to release her, Ragetti steps in, correctly delivering the incantation \"as if to a lover\", triggering the spell in a well-deserved 'shining moment' for his character.\n\nAt the film's end, the two serve aboard the Black Pearl, which Barbossa has again commandeered from Jack. Pintel says about the matter: \"Some of the men don't feel entirely settled about leaving Captain Jack behind again\". When Barbossa asked if that was so, Pintel says \"It would make us feel a whole lot better, regarding our fortunes, if we could see that item you told us about.\", the item meaning(This mirrors Barbossa asking for the coordinates of the Chest of Cortes while planning a mutiny.) When Barbossa shows them the charts, a big hole appears where the map's crucial component was removed by Sparrow. Ragetti is also seen making a new wooden eye for himself.\n\nIn the third installment, Ragetti again shows that he is more educated than he appears when he says \"Actually, it's a cephalopod\n\nCephalopodPirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a 2011 adventure fantasy film and the fourth installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean series...\n\n, claims that the Black Pearl has been destroyed, which suggests that Pintel and Raggeti either died or deserted piracy after Blackbeard's attack on the ship. However, it is latter learned that the Black Pearl was minaturized and placed in a bottle by Blackbeard and it is possible that Ragetti and Pintel may be alive on the minaturized Black Pearl and may resurface in a latter sequel.\n\nBehavior\n\nPintel and Ragetti appear and act nearly always together; therefore their roles in the film series have been compared with those of Mr. Wint & Mr. Kidd in Diamonds Are Forever\n\nDiamonds Are Forever (film).\nSeveral scenes that feature them became recurring jokes\/motifs in the series with the release of the sequel. For example:\n\nIn the first movie, during a scene where Ragetti and Pintel are manning a cannon, Ragetti's removable eye was hit by a fork (which is being used as a replacement for a cannonball by the Interceptors crew), Ragetti and Pintel look at the fork and then slowly look through the cannon gunport at the Interceptor. This scene is repeated in the second movie (with exactly the same camera angles) when Ragetti and Pintel look out at the Kraken's tentacle, which is pressed against the Pearl. The shot is repeated a third time in the final movie, wherein they have loaded the cannon with Jack the Monkey.\n\nThe scene where Ragetti looks frantically for his eye (the first movie it is during the fight against Norrington's fleet, and in the second it is as they are attempting to steal the Pearl) is repeated with the same camera angles.\n\nIn the first movie, when Ragetti and Pintel find Elizabeth, Pintel says \"'ello, Poppet\". This scene is repeated in the second movie; when both turn on Elizabeth for the treasure, Pintel repeats that line. Towards the end of At World's End, Pintel says \"Goodbye, Poppet\" to Elizabeth as she leaves the ship.\n\nTheir first scene in Dead Man's Chest involves them travelling into a rowing boat; large waves causes the boat to capsize, knocking the two into the sea. This is repeated briefly in At World's End, wherein the two are attempting rowing to the shore of an uninhabited island, their boat capsizing again.\n\nThey are the counterparts to the two Royal Marines Murtogg and Mullroy. The two comic relief\n\nComic relief\n\nComic relief is the inclusion of a humorous character, scene or witty dialogue in an otherwise serious work, often to relieve tension.-Definition:...\n\npairs are united at the end of the movie, where Murtogg and Mullroy, disguised as pirates, celebrate the victory of the pirates after running away from their posts after they failed to keep Davy Jones' heart safe.\n\nBy the second movie, Ragetti becomes very religious. He is seen trying to read a Bible upside down, even when Pintel reveals that Ragetti cannot read (to which Ragetti retorts, \"It's the Bible, you get credit for tryin'.\"). His reason for doing so is the idea that, having lost his immortality, he is worried about the afterlife of his Viewers can also see his new look on life in the scene in Tia Dalma's Swamp, wherein he suggests that the thing that vexes all men is \"the dichotomy of good and evil\". We can again see his religious\/philosophical\/intellectual side in the third movie, when the crew is frost-covered and he calmly contemplates aloud, \"There must be a good reason for our suffering\". This may have also been a sarcastic complaint\/question to Barbossa. Also in this film, when Pintel sees the kraken's body at the beach, he calls it a \"Stupid fish!\", but Ragetti reminds him that the Kraken is a cephalopod, thus making another joke about the contrast of his intellect over his appearance.\n\nExterior\n\nLike most pirates, Pintel and Ragetti wear old, threadbare clothes. According to Pirates of the Caribbean: The Visual Guide, Ragetti's green jacket was stolen from a French nobleman, Pintel's trousers are washed within an attempt to remove bloodstains, and Ragetti's trousers are covered with make them water-proof. It also was mentioned in The Visual Guide that Pintel spends hours in front of a mirror in order to practice his famous gloomy face expression. Their coats are similar to that of Jack Sparrow.\n\nAbilities\n\nPintel and Ragetti are skilled fighters; both before and after their immortality is lost, they are shown standing up to many times their number. Normally, they both fight with cutlass\n\nCutlass\n\nA cutlass is a short, broad sabre or slashing sword, with a straight or slightly curved blade sharpened on the cutting edge, and a hilt often featuring a solid cupped or basket shaped guard...\n\nes, but in a scene in Dead Man's Chest, when Elizabeth had taken their swords from them, they continue fighting with incredible efficiency using only the chest, an oar, and a net. They also use flintlock pistols, while it should be noticed that Pintel uses a double-barrelled one, which you can see clearly as he points it at Jack Sparrow in the Curse of the Black Pearl. In At World's End, Ragetti uses the butt of a pistol as a club. They are skilled gunners during sea battles; in the battle between the Black Pearl and the H.M.S.

{"text":"What's new\n\nMaritime New Zealand can trace its origins back to the establishment of the Marine Board in 1862. This was one of the first organs of State established in the colony of New Zealand. The organisation has been restructured many times since then.\n\nAfter a period of Customs Department control during the last decades of the 19th century it became the Marine Department. The Department operated until 1972 when it was then absorbed into the Marine Division of the Ministry of Transport.\n\nIt was in turn renamed and restructured into the Ministry of Transport's Maritime Transport Division, during the initial stages of government restructuring in 1988.\n\nThe Maritime Safety Authority (MSA) was established as a Crown entity, separate from the Ministry of Transport on 20 August 1993.\n\nThe establishment of the Maritime Safety Authoritywas one part of a far-reaching Transport Law Reform Bill. The Bill addressed the full range of New Zealand maritime law and brought about the first major reform of the country's shipping legislation in nearly 40 years.\n\nThe Maritime Safety Authority was subsequently charged with administering the new Maritime Transport Act 1994 when it came into force in February 1995.\n\nThe Maritime Safety Authority was renamed Maritime New Zealand on 1 July 2005. The new name was introduced by Parliament in order to better reflect the widening of the organisation's responsibilities to include maritime safety, security and marine environment protection."}
{"text":"Superpower at sea\n\nNorway has been a major player in shipping for more than 150 years. This small country on the fringe of Europe, which has less than a thousandth of the world's population, controls one of the world's largest merchant fleets.\n\nWhat's more, the numerous and varied maritime activities that have grown up around traditional shipping operations enjoy strong and often leading positions in the international market. The Norwegian Government's vision is for Norway to be among the world's leading maritime nations and a supplier of the most innovative and environmentally friendly solutions for the future.\n\nTechnologically advanced\n\nSince the 1970s, when petroleum operations first began on the Norwegian continental shelf, Norwegian maritime companies have targeted the offshore sector. Advanced assignments in tough weather and under difficult working conditions have led to the development of what is now the world's most technologically advanced offshore fleet. A strong domestic market has also laid the foundation for companies to take their expertise abroad. Today, more than half the revenue of Norwegian maritime offshore companies is generated from operations outside the Norwegian continental shelf. The Norwegian maritime industry will have a central role to play when resources in deeper and even more challenging waters are to be explored in a sustainable manner.\n\nThe Norwegian maritime industry is a complete cluster comprising leading shipping companies, shipbuilding yards, equipment manufacturers, designers, service providers, universities, research and development centres and regulatory bodies. The Norwegian maritime industry accounted for 5.5% of Norway's GDP in 2009. The Norwegian maritime industry is Norway's second largest export industry, after the oil and gas sector.\n\nEnvironmentally friendly\n\nSea transport is a cost-effective, reliable and environmentally friendly mode of transport. Some 90% of world trade is transported by sea, and shipping accounts for 2.7% of global CO2 emissions. Only 40 % of trade between European countries is transported by sea. However, a single vessel has the capacity to replace several hundred trucks, thus reducing congestion and the risk of accident and pollution, as well as being a more cost effective mode of transport. It is a common goal of the European Union and the Norwegian authorities to ensure that a greater proportion of goods are transported by sea.\n\nModern fleet with innovative solutions\n\nThe Norwegian fleet is one of the most modern in the world. Norwegian shipping companies are engaged in all shipping segments, and have a particularly strong position in specialised shipping such as transport of petroleum products, chemicals, gas, paper, vehicles and rolling stock (ro-ro) and offshore shipping.\n\nThe Norwegian maritime cluster is at the forefront of efforts to develop new, innovative solutions. Norwegian shipowners, for example, are spearheading the development of gas-powered ships and the use of fuel cells as an alternative energy source on board. Continuous efforts are being made throughout the industry to further improve engines, hulls and propellers with a view to increasing energy efficiency and thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions from ships."}

{"text":"Subject:\nBritish SSBNs, Do we need all 4? RM-Nod12\/22\/2004 11:18:28 PM\n\nSo...do we?\nIn my opinion the answer is no. I remember hearing that the UK usually only has a single boat on patrol at any one time. With that in mind, why do we need 4 boats? Wouldn't it be much cheaper to simply run the SSBN force as we do the carriers, ie one in refit\/deep reserve, on in reserve and one on patrol. I'm sure it wouldn't be too difficult to get the one in reserve out in an emergency and in many cases the third might be available as a deterant anyway.\nEach boat can carry up to 16 missiles, this represents a maximum of 192 100-120kt warheads, under START maximums this is 128 and under UK policy this is around 48-64 warheads. More than enough to represent a credible threat to even the largest of nations. Along with the boat held in reserve the UK would always have at least 96 warheads going up to 128 while remaining within current British policy.\nGiven the current situation with money and what not, would it not make sense to reduce our force to 3 SSBNs?\n\nfrench stratege\nRE:British SSBNs, Do we need all 4? 12\/23\/2004 11:00:09 AM\n\nYes: if one is in major overhaul (like midlife update), you will have 3 boat available.\nIf one is also in normal overhaul: two remains available for deploiement.And you can not be sure that one of your SSBN will not be sunk.\nMoreover you can not have a flexible response with one SSBN: if one fired its missiles it is likely to be sunk soon after.\nWith two boat you can use one for counterforce or\/and industrial potential destruction ,and keep one available to avoid counterpopulation reprisal.\nOr even three in crisis.\nI would add that a boat will use faster its life potential if you have to use only three boats.\n!\n\"48-64 warheads. More than enough to represent a credible threat to even the largest of nations\":\n.\nGermany have received the equivalent of 400 Hiroshima bombs in WW2!\n\nWe need at least 4.\nIf we have such a small number of boats, a likely enemy could attempt to destroy them in port and the likes.\nSo, if we only had 3 boats and one was destroyed, we would only have two boats, which is not enough to keep one at sea all the tme.\nIn my opinion we should bring back the V wings and all.\n\n\"Moreover you can not have a flexible response with one SSBN: if one fired its missiles it is likely to be sunk soon after.\"\nHow so? I don't know of any force on this planet that has the resources to detect a launch thousands of miles from it's coast and then mount a responce before the sub moves away.\nI don't agree with the enemy targeting our boats in port theory, what's to stop anyone doing that now? Obviously we wouldn't have all the subs in port at the same time.\nBy managing the SSBNs as we do the carriers we could have one on patrol and one in reserve at all times, there by having 2 boats available.\n\"!\"\nI agree, but it would spare some money and would offer major saving when it comes to replacing them; having only to order 3 boats instead of 4.\n\".\"\nWhat, so having an extra 64 warheads that aren't usually on patrol anyway will be a credible threat as opposed to having 64 fewer? I disagree. And if it is that bad then each boat can carry an extra 64 warheads while keeping within the START limits. In my opinion 64 warheads is enough to destory the major infrastructor of any nation and more importantly it is enough to trigger a major nuclear war. The threat only has to be enough to stop any leader wanting to launch an attack against you. For that you need to have a nuclear capability of destroying any forces that are moving against you; the UK easily has that with 3 SSBNs, further more you must be able to harm a country to the point it is not worth starting a war with you. 64 warheads can do that. It may not completley destroy a country (only a few countries though) but it could turn any country into it's own hell hole; destroy it's economy, probably destroy any system of power etc etc\n\n\"I don't agree with the enemy targeting our boats in port theory, what's to stop anyone doing that now? Obviously we wouldn't have all the subs in port at the same time.\"\nThat is hardly the point; they could be attacked before the start of hostilities in such a manner where it was unclear who done it.\nYou can hardly comission a couple new boats in a matter of months to fill the gap.\n\nfrench stratege\nRE:British SSBNs, Do we need all 4? 12\/23\/2004 1:05:44 PM\n\nFor the French the R&D cost nearly as much than the first four of the Triomphant class which is 2 billion $\/per boat.\nYou have much more opportunity of saving R&D cost (and much more than a single SSBN price) by fielding a derivative of your SSN class (like Astute) than to build a special class.\n64 warheads of 120 kt is equivalent of 256 Hiroshima warheads.As I said Germany survived with much more dammages.For China it is putting them only 20 years backward and let them to dispose 90% of their power.\nTo dammage big countries need at minimum 300 nukes according to US.\nUK deterrent allow them to avoid their population threaten by nukes but not war even with nukes.\nTo have a credible deterrent means to inflict much bigger dammage of great countries and have a little flexibility for two strikes.\nEven with 2 subs, UK could have the risk to get boat sunk even by US (it would become a potential way for US to get a control on UK deterrent - a sort of double key control).\nIf you want more saving for next generation, make 4 smaller boat on a SSN basis like US did in the 60ies.\n\"How so? I don't know of any force on this planet that has the resources to detect a launch thousands of miles from it's coast and then mount a responce before the sub moves away.\n\"\nIn cold war I know two: US and Russia.It was the reason for nuke SUBROC.\nAn ICBM can destroy your subs also after a first salvo (which take 8 minutes for all 16 missiles).Ballistic missile launch detection satellites (DSP) pinpoint the subs and a ICBM\/IRBM strike the sea maybe less than 20 minutes after (the boat have moved few miles only and a megatonic(s) bomb will crush it 10 miles away) or a SUBROC or ship equivalents in minutes.Your sub will fire one time only.\nNations with this capacity today: US, Russia\nIn few years: France (if satellites are developped as planed) and China.\n\n\"That is hardly the point; they could be attacked before the start of hostilities in such a manner where it was unclear who done it.\"\nBut my point still stands. What is to stop an enemy destroying our boats in port now? Obviously they can't since they aren't all in port at the same time but the same would be true of 3 boats.\nStrat, sorry, should hace said moved away AND fired it's missiles. That's the point, it doesn't matter if the sub get's destroyed as long as it has fired it's missiles, which it has ample time to do. A second boat would make little to no difference. I don't think that there is any country that would risk being hit by 64 120kt warheads, most likley 128 (depending on range). You may need 300 nukes to literally destroy a country but you don't have to be able to destroy a country, you just have to be able to destroy the governments control thereby providing a reason for the country's leaders not to push the button. If you destroy the control then the country will most likley destroy itself.\n\nfrench stratege\nRE:British SSBNs, Do we need all 4? 12\/23\/2004 2:30:51 PM\n\n-it means you can't launch a single salvo so no flexibility by moving target scale: military then industry then civilians in case of retaliation.\n-if a ennemy SSN is in the vicinity you are sunk even before launching all warheads if it has SUBROC equivalent. A single sub is not a robust deterrent.\n\n\"But my point still stands. What is to stop an enemy destroying our boats in port now? Obviously they can't since they aren't all in port at the same time but the same would be true of 3 boats.\"\nOf course, but you agree that at least one boat is laying vulnerable in port at any one time?\nNow, with four boats, one could be lost in such a manner, and we still have enough boats to ensure one is at sea at any one time.\nIf we only had three boats, and one were to be destroyed (at port, or by any other means), then we would be left with two boats. And two boats are not enough to garuntee that one will be at sea at any one time.\nYou see my point?\nI have always been more a fan of V bombers than subs anyway, but that is probably through watching Dr Strange Love too much.\n\nFrench Strateg is right. 4 boats is minimum figure. There is a general misunderstanding of the effects of nuclear warheads. Yes, even 1 will cause death and destruction on a scale you wouldnt believe. So if your goal is to just be able to nuke someone the just build 1 boat. Or even cheaper, just make a few silos and scrap the boats. That would be a nuclear strike capability, but not a nuclear deterent.\nI know 64 warhead sounds like a lot but its really not against a big country. They would survive it in the short term and retain the ability to make war. Now if you ally yourself with other nuclear powers so that the totality of your nukes is at the 300+ mark. then you could do that. But you would also be placing your fate in the hands of others. The actual number of nukes required to be a truly credible nucler war fighting force is 1000+ with the actual number a highly classified secret. But U.S.\/Russia arent just keeping several thousand for bragging rights. Short of Jesus Christ return to earth and ruling the world, you will never see superpower nuke forces go below 1500 warheads.\nKeep the 4 boats if you know whats good for you."}

{"text":"Throughout their careers, some vessels\nacquire a certain mystique that sets them apart from other ships.\nCSS Acadia, the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic's\nCanadian Scientific Ship, is one such vessel.\n\nDuring her 56-year career in the Canadian Hydrographic Service, Acadia became a popular ship, loved by her crew and a favourite at the many ports she visited.\n\nWhat's in a Name?\nAcadia was Nova Scotia's name in the French colonial era. CSS stood for, at different times, \"Canadian Scientific Ship\" and \"Canadian Survey Ship\".\n\nAcadia was launched in 1913 at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England at the yards of Swan, Hunter and Wigham Richardson Ltd. She was the first vessel specifically designed and built to survey Canada's northern waters, and her career took her from the dangerous, ice-infested waters of Hudson's Bay to Nova Scotia's South Shore. In her early years, she was responsible for pioneering hydrographic research in Canada's Arctic waters. At the end of her career, she was used to chart the coast of Newfoundland after it joined Confederation in 1949, creating entirely new charts and updating some that were nearly a century old.\n\nAcadia also holds the distinction of being the only surviving ship to have served the Royal Canadian Navy during both world wars. She served as a patrol and escort vessel from 1916 to 1919. She received minor damage in the Halifax Explosion in 1917 while acting as a guard ship in Bedford Basin, making her the only vessel still afloat today to have survived the Halifax Explosion. Acadia was recommissioned as a warship in 1939 serving first as a patrol vessel and later as a training ship until the war's end in 1945.\n\nAcadia remains a classic example of the best that her British builders had to offer. Built during the Edwardian era, her splendid lines run uninterrupted from the straight bow to a graceful counter stern. With her two masts and her single funnel, she resembles a small steam yacht more than a hardworking survey vessel.\n\nHer interior displays a class of marine craftsmanship typical of that great tradition. Beautiful mahogany and oak panelling and fine brasswork are found throughout the quarters of the hydrographic staff and officers, giving them accommodations that suggest the great ocean liners of the same era.\n\nSo strongly built was Acadia's ice-strengthened hull, that she was often employed as an auxiliary ice breaker in her early years, something for which she was not really designed and which gave her masters and crew an occasional nervous moment.\n\nAs a state-of-the-art vessel and an important part of the operations of the Canadian Hydrographic Service, Acadia often pioneered the testing and development of new technology. But despite all the cutting edge equipment introduced aboard Acadia, her triple-expansion steam engines and two coal-fired, Scotch marine boilers were in operation until she retired. This made her a rarity among the Hydrographic Service's fleet and made her easy to spot as she entered port trailing an unmistakable trail of black smoke.\n\n1913 \u00ad Acadia was the first ship in the hydrographic fleet to be outfitted with the new wireless telegraphy system designed by Marconi to keep the ship in contact with shore stations and other vessels. This later included the introduction of an alarm system to alert operators of incoming distress calls, devised by Marconi after the loss of RMS Titanic in April of 1912.\n\n1928 \u00ad A Sperry gyro-compass was added to the ship, a tremendous advance over the older magnetic compass, as it improved accuracy and reduced magnetic deviation. The new system was tested extensively during Acadia's Arctic expeditions.\n\n1929 \u00ad A British Admiralty\u00addesigned echo sounder capable of recording depths over 500 fathoms was tested on the ship, and subsequent improved devices have also been used aboard Acadia.\n\n1956 \u00ad DECCA navigational system is installed. This complex device paved the way for present-day LORAN and GPS systems.\n\nAcadia Today\n\nAfter 56 years of service, Acadia was retired in 1969. For the next 12 years, she remained berthed at the Bedford Institute of Oceanography.\n\nMany of her former crew volunteered to assist with her maintenance and to give tours, a testament to the devotion they retained for the grand old lady. Further recognition came in 1976 when she was designated a National Historic Site.\n\nIn 1982, she moved to the wharves behind the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic and became part of the Museum's collection where she is the subject of a program of continuous restoration and maintenance.\n\nEvery five years, Acadia is towed across the harbour to be dry-docked for an underwater hull inspection and repainting. The work also involves placing zinc anodes along Acadia's underwater hull. These sacrificial anodes, as they are called, prevent underwater corrosion of ships' hulls. The more active metal of the anode will be \"sacrificed\" before any of the less active metal on \u2039the steel hull\u2039it protects.\n\nHer ice-strengthened hull is still impressively strong, but during her last visit to Dartmouth, a piece of new steel plate was fitted above the rudder. The placement of the new plate was done with remarkable skill, and with the addition of simulated rivets, it is difficult to see where the new section was placed.\n\nHer boilers no longer function, but the engine remains immaculately maintained. Throughout her new career, Acadia has continued one of the sea's great shipboard traditions, that of keeping a faithful ship's cat. Since 1982, Acadia has been home to three rodent control officers.\n\nShe is still a popular spot for her former staff and 1988 saw over 100 former crew and families return to the museum for a gala 75th anniversary tribute. Prior to this many interviews were conducted with the crew, giving us an impressive oral history of the vessel and her career.\n\nCSS Acadia remains a most beautiful reminder of her era, the finest example of a rivetted hulled vessel in the museum world today. As such and because of her splendid career, she is more than just another ship. CSS Acadia continues to fascinate, intrigue, and delight young and old alike.

Gillen (see References below, p.445) gives the following statistics:\n\nEmbarked at Portsmouth\n\nOfficials and passengers: 15\n\nShips' crews: 323\n\nMarines: 247\n\nMarines wives and children: 46\n\nConvicts (males): 582\n\nConvicts (females): 193\n\nConvicts' children: 14\n\nTotal embarked: 1420\n\nLanded at Port Jackson\n\nOfficials and passengers: 14\n\nShips' crews: 306\n\nMarines: 245\n\nMarines wives and children: 54\n\nConvicts (males): 543\n\nConvicts (females): 189\n\nConvicts' children: 22\n\nTotal landed: 1373\n\nDuring the voyage there were 22 births (13 males, 9 females), while 69 people either died, were discharged, or deserted (61 males and 8 females). As no complete crew musters have survived for the six transports and three storeships, there may have been as many as 110 more seamen. See section below for list of notable Fleet members.\n\nPreparation for the voyage\n\nThe decision to send convicts to Botany Bay was taken by the British Government on 18 August 1786. Preparations to obtain ships, convicts, guards and provisions began soon after. At the time the five hulks in service held about 1300 men, and selected convicts, including women from county gaols were transferred to the Dunkirkhulk at Plymouth and the New Gaol in Southwark. Optimistically, it was hoped to be able to sail in October, but a series of postponements were made. In mid April 1787 the St James's Chronicle commented that \"strange as it may appear, we are credibly informed of the Fact that the Transports for Botany Bay have not as yet sailed\". [Gillen, p.xxiv]\n\nBy October 1786, more than 200 marines had volunteered for Botany Bay duty, and Major Robert Ross was chosen to command them. The man chosen to lead the expedition, command HMS Sirius, and take on the governorship of the colony, was Captain Arthur Phillip, of whom the first lord of the admiralty said \"the little I know of [him] would [not] have led me to select him\". [Gillen, p.xxiv]\n\nThe convict ships were fitted out with strong hatch bars between decks, bulkheads to divide convicts from crew, and guns and ammunition. Provisions included food such as flour, pease, rice, butter, salted beef and pork, bread, soup, cheese, water and beer. Coal and wood were provided for fuel. Beads, looking glasses and other gifts for native inhabitants were included. Other items included tools, agricultural implements, seeds, spirits, medical supplies, bandages, surgical instruments, handcuffs, leg irons and chains. A prefabricated house for the governor was constructed and packed flat. 5000 bricks for construction were loaded. As the party was venturing into unknown territory, it had to carry all its provisions to survive until it could make use of local materials, assuming suitable supplies existed, and could grow its own food and raise livestock.\n\nConvicts were delivered to the transports from the hulks and gaols with no reference to skills, or fitness to contribute to the creation of the new colony. The first arrivals embarked on the transports at Woolwich and Gravesend in early January, and continued throughout the next three months. Gradually the ships made their way to Portsmouth, where the last convicts were loaded on the day the fleet sailed. Eventually the fleet set sails and moved off down the English Channel on 13 May1787.\n\nThe voyage\n\nThe departure of the fleet must have been greeted with fear and trepidation by the convicts and marines. They were embarking on the longest voyage ever attempted by such a large group. They were heading for a destination that was completely unexplored by Europeans, and whose conditions were only to be guessed at. Few would have had any confidence in seeing England, their families and friends, ever again.\n\nWith fine weather the convicts were allowed on deck, and on 3 June 1787 the fleet anchored at Santa Cruz at Teneriffe. Here fresh water, vegetables and meat were taken on board. Phillip and the chief officers were entertained by the local governor, while one convict tried unsuccessfully to escape. On 10 June they set sail to cross the Atlantic to Rio de Janeiro, taking advantage of favourable trade winds and ocean currents.\n\nThe weather became increasingly hot and humid as the fleet sailed through the tropics. Vermin, such as rats, bedbugs, lice, cockroaches and fleas, tormented the convicts, officers and marines. Bilges became foul and the smell, especially below the closed hatches, was over-powering. On Alexander a number of convicts fell sick and died. Tropical rainstorms meant that the convicts could not exercise on deck, and were kept below in the foul, cramped holds. On the female transports, promiscuity between the convicts and the crew and marines was rampant. In the doldrums, Phillip was forced to ration the water to three pints a day.\n\nThe fleet reached Rio on 5 August and stayed a month. Ships were cleaned and water taken on board, repairs were made, stores bought. The clothing of the women convicts was disintegrating and was replaced. While the convicts remained below deck, the officers explored the city and were entertained by its inhabitants. A convict and a marine were punished for passing forged quarter-dollars made from old buckles and pewter spoons.\n\nThe fleet left Rio on 3 September to run before the westerlies to the Cape of Good Hope, where they arrived in mid October. This was the last port of call, so the main task was to stock up on plants, seeds and livestock. The women convicts on Friendship were moved to other transports to make room for livestock purchased there. The strength of the convicts was built up with fresh beef and mutton, bread and vegetables. This Dutch colony was the last outpost of European settlement which the fleet members would see for years, perhaps for ever. \"Before them stretched the awesome, lonely void of the Indian and Southern Oceans, and beyond that lay nothing they could imagine.\" (Hughes, p.82)\n\nAssisted by the gales of the latitudes below the fortieth parallel, the heavily-laden transports surged through the swells and troughs. A violent storm struck as they began to head north around Van Diemen's Land, damaging the sails and masts of some of the ships.\n\nIn November Phillip transferred to Supply. With Alexander, Friendship and Scarborough, the fastest ships in the Fleet and carrying most of the male convicts, hastened ahead to prepare for the arrival of the rest. He intended to select a suitable location, find good water, clear the ground, and perhaps even have some huts and other buildings erected. However, this 'flying squadron' reached Botany Bay only hours before the rest of the Fleet, so no preparatory work was possible.\n\nOn 19 January, the coast on mainland Australia was sighted, and by next morning all the vessels were anchored in Botany Bay. This was one of the world's greatest sea voyages - eleven vessels carrying about 1400 people and stores had travelled for 252 days for more than 15,000 miles without losing a ship. Forty-eight people had died on the journey, a death rate of just over three per cent. Given the rigors of the voyage, the navigational problems, the poor condition and sea-faring inexperience of the convicts, the primitive medical knowledge, the lack of precautions against scurvy, the crammed and foul conditions of the ships, poor planning and inadequate equipment, this was a remarkable achievement.\n\nArrival at New South Wales\n\nIt was soon realised that Botany Bay did not live up to the glowing account that Captain James Cook had given it in 1770. The bay was open and unprotected, fresh water was scarce, and the soil was poor. First contacts were made with the local indigenous people, the Eora, who seemed curious but suspicious of the newcomers.\n\nSirius was sent to explore the coastline and the crew soon returned with news of a harbour to the north, with sheltered anchorages, fresh water and fertile soil. This was Port Jackson, which Cook had seen and named, but not entered. A decision was taken to relocate the party to this new site.\n\nThe party was startled when two French ships came into sight and entered Botany Bay. This turned out to be a scientific expedition led by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de La P\u00e9rouse. The French group remained until 10 March, but never returned to France, being wrecked with the loss of all lives in the New Hebrides.\n\nOn 26 January, the fleet weighed anchor and by evening had entered Port Jackson. The site selected for the anchorage had deep water close to the shore, was sheltered and had a small stream flowing into it. Phillip named it Sydney Cove, after Lord Sydney the British Home Secretary. This date is still celebrated as Australia Day, marking the beginnings of the first European settlement, although it is remembered as 'invasion day' by many indigenous Australians.\n\nUnknown to the first European arrivals, it was to be almost two and a half years before other ships arrived with their cargo of new convicts and provisions. These were the Lady Juliana and the three ships of the infamous Second Fleet."}

American treasure hunting company Odyssey Marine Exploration recently found two British ships full of silver that were sunk by the Germans.\n\nThe company was hired by the British government, and it turns out the Brits are actively trying to find a bunch of treasure ships they lost at sea as a way to boost their budgets.\n\nIs that an answer to Washington's budget problems?\n\nThe silver haul from those two ships alone could be over $200 million. While no ships were torpedoed off the Washington Coast, hundreds of them have gone down in bad weather over the last 200 years. A lot of them near the Columbia River on the Southwest Coast, and an even bigger number of them off the Northwest tip of state.\n\n\"The boats would miss the Tatoosh Lighthouse, and they would keep sailing north,\" says local dive expert Scott Boyd. \"They would pile up on the rocks on southwest Vancouver Island. There are hundreds and hundreds of wrecks up there.\"\n\nBoyd, who is with NW Wreck Dives has been diving wrecks around Puget Sound and the world for about ten years.\n\nHe's written the book on where to go and what to see, whether it's on the bottom of Lake Washington or in Elliott Bay or in Puget Sound.\n\nBoyd said there is one gold ship out there that has had hunters searching the Northwest coast for years.\n\nThe Pacific went down in 1875. It was a gold rush ship heading from British Columbian to San Francisco. There were several hundred people on board. Only one survived.\n\n\"As is typical with treasure hunting,\" Boyd said. \"The size of the treasure grows with the age.\" Some estimates put the haul at $40 million, though the only confirmed gold on board was $80,000 in the safe.\n\nMost of the wrecks off the Washington Coast were full of lumber and furs. So the chances of cashing in here, Boyd said, are slim.\n\n\"You start talking around the world, and there are some very famous ships that have gone down with large cargoes of gold that have never been discovered. They're there but not up here.\"\n\nAnd even if there were, he said, the chances of finding one and making money on the find aren't very good.\n\n\"My understanding of most treasure hunting ventures is that they never actually make any money. I know the search for the Pacific, several companies have spent millions and millions of dollars, and I'm not sure there's millions of dollars to be gained.\"\n\nI checked with the governor's office, the office of financial management,and department of revenue, and none of them said the state has looked at treasure hunting as a novel way to fix the budget.\n\nWatch shipwreck hunt video: can hire another 100 state-employees with guaranteed pensions to comb our beaches with metal detectors looking for nickels and quarters that people dropped in the sand, or require movie theaters to search their seat cushions and floors for loose change and tax it at 100%.\n\nHow about with this, a substainable spending\/budget. STOP sending this to the next generation on this and that quick fixes. This type of deal should be a small one time perc, NOT a part of the regular budget fix. Can you wash. people be responsible ????? Thats like draining your house equity when the market is high, then complain, I did not know better, its their fault.\n\nhope this idea was not thought up by someone paid with my tax dollars. Stupidity is endemic in government and we all accept that. This is in the realm of crackhead fantasy. How's about cut spending and focus on CORE FUNCTIONS?\n\nHey genius,\n(And I quote) \"I checked with the governor's office, the office of financial management,and department of revenue, and none of them said the state has looked at treasure hunting as a novel way to fix the budget.\" Unbundle your little girly panties, Hnuh. Nothing to get self-righteous about here. You can shelve your chronic chest beating and incredibly tiresome rap until the next (non)story comes along...\n\nYour comments regarding personal attacks are duly noted. I'll conduct myself with greater decorum in the future. As I seem to temporarily have the ear of someone in a position of authority perhaps I can make the following suggestion. Can you kindly pass along my request to make a change to the process that MYNW uses when appending comments to an 'ongoing story'? When a new story is written about an ongoing topic MYNW seems to append all past comments to the story rather than starting fresh. For example, let's say Amanda Knox arrives back in Seattle and MYNW writes a piece about the event. The comments following the piece often (always?) date back to the start of the story. It makes it arduous to wade through the past comments to get to the current comments. I'm doing a poor job of explaining the issue so please feel free to follow up if I haven't been clear. I've seen other commenters make the same request but no one from MYNW ever seems to respond. Perhaps it's a limitation of your systems or maybe there's just no one tasked with being concerned about such things. If there is someone you can think of that would be interested in the feedback I'd be grateful if you'd pass it along. Thanks!"}

They preferred the junk, a ship using a more robust sail layout. Marooned navy officers, consisting mostly of Cantonese and Hokkien tribesmen, set up their small gangs near river estuaries, mainly to protect themselves. They recruited locals as common foot-soldiers known as 'lang' (lanun) to set up their fortresses. They survived by utilizing their well trained pugilists, as well as marine and navigation skills, mostly along Sumatran and Javanese estuaries. Their strength and ferocity coincided with the impending trade growth of the maritime silk and spice routes.\n\nHowever, the most powerful pirate fleets of East Asia were those of Chinese pirates during the mid-Qing dynasty. Han Chinese ( are an Ethnic group native to China and by most modern definitions the largest single Ethnic group in the world.Not to be confused with Qin Dynasty, the first dynasty of Imperial China Pirate fleets grew increasingly powerful throughout the early 19th century. The effects large-scale piracy had on the Chinese economy were immense. They preyed voraciously on China's junk trade, which flourished in Fujian and Guangdong and was a vital artery of Chinese commerce.

Others, the buccaneers, arrived in the mid-to-late 17th century and made attempts at earning a living by farming and hunting on Hispaniola and nearby islands; pressed by Spanish raids and possibly failure of their means of making a living, they turned to a more lucrative occupation (not to mention more active and conducive to revenge).

Bureaucracy is the structure and set of regulations in place to control activity usually in large organizations and government In reality, many pirates ate poorly, did not become fabulously wealthy, and died young. Unlike traditional Western societies of the time, many pirate crews operated as limited democracies[20]. Democracy is a form of government in which the supreme power is held completely by the people under a free electoral system Both the captain and the quartermaster were elected by the crew, they in turn appointed the other ship's officers. Quartermaster refers to two different military occupations In land armies it is a term referring to a military individual or unit who specializes in supplying and provisioning troops The captain of a pirate ship was often a fierce fighter in whom the men could place their trust, rather than a more traditional authority figure sanctioned by an elite. However, when not in battle, the quartermaster usually had the real authority. Many groups of pirates shared in whatever they seized; pirates injured in battle might be afforded special compensation. Often all of these terms were agreed upon and written down by the pirates, but these articles could also be used as incriminating proof that they were outlaws. A pirate code is a Code of conduct invented for governing Pirates. Pirates readily accepted outcasts from traditional societies, perhaps easily recognizing kindred spirits, and they were known to welcome them into the pirate fold. Such practices within a pirate crew were tenuous, however, and did little to mitigate the brutality of the pirate's way of life.\n\nEven though pirates raided many ships, most did not bury their treasure, or booty. Often, the \"treasure\" that was stolen was food, water, alcohol, weapons, or clothing. For this reason, there was no need for the pirates to bury these goods.\n\nThe classical age of piracy coexisted with a rise in British imperialism which required merchant vessels to transport goods and warships to protect the trade ships from pirates and privateers. Imperialism has two meanings one describing an action and the other describing an attitude Living conditions on the warships were horrible even by 17th-century standards; sailors were often fed rotten, maggot-infested food, frequently suffered from scurvy or other nutritional disorders, and could be counted lucky to escape their service without a crippling injury. Scurvy (NLat scorbutus is a disease resulting from a deficiency of Vitamin C, which is required for the synthesis of Collagen in humans British captains were known to have been extremely brutal; the captain held a nearly sovereign power aboard his ship and many were unafraid to abuse that power. To fill the warships, officers would forcibly pressgang boys and young men to replace lost crew. Impressment (colloquially &quot the Press &quot or &quot press-ganging &quot is the act of conscripting people to serve in the military or navy usually The horrid living conditions, constant threat to life, and brutality of the captain and his officers pushed many men over the edge. Possessing seafaring skill, a learned intolerance for absolute authority, and a disdain for the motherland they might have believed abandoned them, many crews would simply mutiny during an attack and offer themselves and their ship as a new pirate vessel and crew. Mutiny is a conspiracy among members of a group of similarly-situated individuals (typically members of the Military; or the Crew of any ship even\n\nPrivateers\n\nA privateer or corsair used similar methods to a pirate, but acted while in possession of a commission or letter of marque from a government or monarch authorizing the capture of merchant ships belonging to an enemy nation.

The Constitution of the United States of America is the supreme Law of the United States.The United States Congress is the bicameral Legislature of the federal government of the United States of America, consisting of two houses The letter of marque was recognized by international convention and meant that a privateer could not technically be charged with piracy while attacking the targets named in his commission. This nicety of law did not always save the individuals concerned, however, as whether one was considered a pirate or a legally operating privateer often depended on whose custody the individual found himself in--that of the country that had issued the commission, or that of the object of attack. Spanish authorities were known to execute foreign privateers with their letters of marque hung around their necks to emphasize Spain's rejection of such defenses. Furthermore, many privateers exceeded the bounds of their letters of marque by attacking nations with which their sovereign was at peace (Thomas Tew and William Kidd are notable examples), and thus made themselves liable to conviction for piracy. Thomas Tew (?-1695 aka the Rhode Island Pirate was a 17th century English Privateer turned Pirate.William &quot Captain &quot Kidd ( c 1645 &ndash May 23, 1701) was a Scottish sailor remembered for his However, a letter of marque did provide some cover for such pirates, as plunder seized from neutral or friendly shipping could be passed off later as taken from enemy merchants.\n\nThe famous Barbary Corsairs of the Mediterranean were privateers, as were the Maltese Corsairs, who were authorized by the Knights of St. John, and the Dunkirkers in the service of the Spanish Empire.

A warship is a Ship that is built and primarily intended for Combat.Commerce raiding is to destroy the logistics (supplies of an enemy on the open sea rather than engaging the combatants themselves or enforcing a Blockade against themMerchant raiders are Ships which disguise themselves as Non-combatant Merchant vessels whilst actually being armed and intending to attack enemy commerce Commerce raiders operated successfully during the American Revolution. In this article the inhabitants of the thirteen colonies that supported the American Revolution are primarily referred to as &quotAmericans&quot with occasional references to &quotPatriots&quot During the American Civil War, the Confederacy sent out several commerce raiders, the most famous of which was the CSS AlabamaHistory Construction Alabama was built in secrecy by British shipbuilders John Laird Sons and Company in Liverpool, Merseyside During World War I and World War II, Germany also made use of these tactics, both in the Atlantic and Indian OceansGermany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany ( \u02c8b\u028and\u0259s\u0281epu\u02ccbli\u02d0k \u02c8d\u0254\u028ft\u0283lant is a Country in Central Europe.The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's Oceanic divisions covering about 20% of the water on the Earth 's surface Since commissioned naval vessels were openly used, these commerce raiders should not be considered even privateers, much less pirates - although the opposing combatants were vocal in denouncing them as such.\n\nModern piracy\n\nModern pirates favor small boats and taking advantage of the small crew numbers on modern cargo vessels. Modern pirates can be successful because a large amount of international commerce occurs via shipping. For commercial reasons, many cargo ships move through narrow bodies of water (such as the Suez Canal, the Panama Canal, and the Strait of Malacca) making them vulnerable to be overtaken and boarded by small motorboats. The Suez Canal is a Canal in Egypt. Opened in 1869 it allows Water transportation between Europe and Asia without circumnavigationThe Panama Canal is a man-made Canal in Panama which joins the The Strait of Malacca is a narrow 805 km (500 mile stretch of water between Peninsular Malaysia (West Malaysia) and the Indonesian island of SumatraA motorboat is a vessel propelled by an Internal combustion engine driving a jet pump or a Propeller. Other active areas include the South China Sea and the Niger Delta. The South China Sea is a Marginal sea south of China. It is a part of the Pacific Ocean, encompassing an area from Singapore to the The Niger Delta, the delta of the Niger River in Nigeria, is a densely populated region sometimes called the Oil Rivers because it was once a As usage increases, many of these ships have to lower cruising speeds to allow for navigation and traffic control, making them prime targets for piracy. Small ships are also capable of disguising themselves as fishing vessels or cargo vessels when not carrying out piracy in order to avoid or deceive inspectors.\n\nAlso, pirates often operate in regions of developing or struggling countries with smaller navies and large trade routes. Pirates sometimes evade capture by sailing into waters controlled by their pursuer's enemies. With the end of the Cold War, navies have decreased size and patrol, and trade has increased, making organized piracy far easier. Cold War is the state of conflict tension and competition that existed between the United States and the Soviet Union (USSR and their respective allies from the Modern pirates are sometimes linked with organized-crime syndicates, but often are parts of small individual groups. Pirate attack crews may consist of 4 to 10 sailors for going after a ship's safe (raiding) or up to 70 (depending entirely on the ships and the ships crew size) if the plan is to seize the whole vessel.\n\nThe International Maritime Bureau (IMB) maintains statistics regarding pirate attacks dating back to 1995. The International Maritime Bureau (IMB is a specialised bureau of the International Chamber of Commerce. Their records indicate hostage-taking overwhelmingly dominates the types of violence against seafarers. For example in 2006, there were 239 attacks, 77 crew members were kidnapped and 188 taken hostage but only 15 of the pirate attacks resulted in murder. [22] In 2007 the attacks rose by 10% to 263 attacks. There was a 35% increase on reported attacks involving guns. Crew members that were injured was 64 compared to the 17 in 2006. [23] That number does not include hostages\/kidnapping where they were not injured.\n\nIn some cases, modern pirates are not interested in the cargo and are mainly interested in taking the personal belongings of the crew and the contents of the ship's safe, which might contain large amounts of cash needed for payroll and port fees. In other cases, the pirates force the crew off the ship and then sail it to a port to be repainted and given a new identity through false papers often purchased from corrupt or complicit officials. [24]\n\nModern piracy can also take place in conditions of political unrest. For example, following the US withdrawal from Vietnam, Thai piracy was aimed at the many Vietnamese who took to boats to escape. Vietnam (\u02ccvi\u02d0\u025bt\u02c8n\u0251\u02d0m Vi\u1ec7t Nam) officially Further, following the disintegration of the government of Somalia, warlords in the region have attacked ships delivering UN food aid.

The attackers were armed with automatic firearms and an RPG. RPG or rocket-propelled grenade, is a loose term describing hand-held shoulder-launched Anti-tank weapons capable of firing an unguided [28]\n\nMany nations forbid ships to enter their territorial waters or ports if the crew of the ships are armed in an effort to restrict possible piracy. [29] Shipping companies sometimes hire private security guards.\n\nIn modern times, ships and airplanes are hijacked for political reasons as well.

It has been reported that crimes of piracy have involved the use of mobile phones, modern speedboats, assault rifles, shotguns, pistols, mounted machine guns, and even RPGs and grenade launchers. A motorboat is a vessel propelled by an Internal combustion engine driving a jet pump or a Propeller.An assault rifle is a Selective fire Rifle or Carbine (not to be confused with a semi-automatic only replica firing Ammunition with muzzleA shotgun (also known as a scattergun) is a Firearm that is usually designed to be fired from the shoulder which uses the energy of a fixed shell to fire a numberFor other uses of the phrase see Machine Gun (disambiguation.RPG or rocket-propelled grenade, is a loose term describing hand-held shoulder-launched Anti-tank weapons capable of firing an unguided A grenade launcher is a Weapon that launches a Grenade with more accuracy higher velocity and to greater distances than a soldier could throw it by hand However, more primitive weapons such as knives, batons, or boat-hooks are also often used.

[30] Figures reported by the International Maritime Bureau indicate incident reporting fell for the third year in a row in 2006. Ships reported 239 incidents to the IMB during the year 2006, down from 276 in 2005, and 329 in 2004. [31] But the piracy rose by 14 percent in the first nine months of 2007.

Piracy tends to be a feature of areas where there is either lawlessness or real economic deprivation and it's very difficult to eradicate. \"[33]\n\nThe recent downward trend in piracy worldwide follows a period when attacks tripled between 1993 and 2003. The first half of 2003 was the worst 6-month period on record, with 234 pirate attacks, 16 deaths, and 52 people injured worldwide. There were also 193 crew members held hostage during this period[34][35] In the first 6 months of 2004, 182 reported cases of piracy turned up worldwide, 50 of which occurring in Indonesian waters.

{"text":"Bulk cargoes\n\n2\nStability of the ship can also be affected by the cargo shifting during the course of the voyage. This can occur because the cargo is inadequately trimmed (levelled-off) or improperly distributed. In some cases cargoes can liquify as a result of vibration and the motion of the ship and then slide or flow to one side of the cargo hold. This usually happens when the cargo consists of finely-grained material, such as fine coal and ore concentrates, which are damp when loaded. However it occurs, a shift of cargo can lead to the ship listing and ultimately capsizing.\n\n3. Spontaneous heating. Some cargoes carried in bulk have a tendency to heat spontaneously during the course of a voyage. The result can be a fire or explosion.\n\n4. Chemical hazards.

{"text":"Battleship 'Maine' Explodes, Triggering Spanish-American War\n\nSubmitted by tonyp on Fri, 02\/15\/2013 - 09:41\n\nAt 9:40 the night of Feb. 15, 1898, a massive explosion sank the U.S. battleship Maine in Havana Harbor, Cuba, killing over 260 men and whipping the American public into a war frenzy against Cuba's colonial overlord, Spain. The battleship had entered Havana Harbor on January 25 to protect American interests in the face of a popular insurrection on the island against Spain's harsh rule. The cause of the explosion remains a mystery to this day, despite four separate investigations, but the verdict with the most impact was the conclusion of the U.S. Naval Court of Inquiry, announced on March 28, 1898, that a mine had sunk the Maine.\n\nThis was all the confirmation the U.S. public and press needed to demand a war against Spain, and the popular cry \"Remember the Maine! To hell with Spain!\" reverberated throughout the land. Americans had become increasingly upset with the harsh measures the Spanish military was using to suppress a Cuban insurgency that had been fighting for Cuban independence since 1895. To prevent Cubans from giving aid to the rebellion, Spanish authorities rounded up villagers and placed them in fortified areas. The reconcentrados, as they were called, suffered from unsanitary conditions and a lack of food, and thousands of them died.\n\nAmerican commercial interests, especially the sugar industry, were concerned about Spain's inability to maintain stable conditions in Cuba. With the public, newspapers, and business community all calling for action, a reluctant President William McKinley could not stem the war fervor. After Spain rejected an ultimatum to leave Cuba, Congress declared that a state of war with Spain had existed since April 21, 1898.\n\nSome historians say the Spanish-American War was an honorable affair, fought by altruistic Americans to free the oppressed Cubans from the yoke of Spanish colonization. Others say this was America's foray into imperialism: its first war fought not to consolidate its holdings on the North American continent but rather to gain overseas possessions.\n\nHere are two newspaper articles helpful in understanding the war fever gripping the American public. The first, printed the day before the Maine blew up, is a sermon delivered by a reverend to stir up his congregation. The second is a news report of the disaster in Havana Harbor.\n\nThis article was published by the Springfield Daily Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts) on Feb. 14, 1898:\n\nA Plea for Cuban Relief\n\nRev. Allen E. Cross, in his sermon yesterday morning at the Park church, spoke as follows upon the subject of Cuban relief:\n\nNot so far from the shores of America as Boston from Springfield is the island of Cuba, and upon it, like an incarnate prayer to God for pity and vengeance, lie the bodies of 200,000 men. Were these bodies slain in battle? No! Did they die of their own rashness? No! Was it by nature's famine? No; for the soldiers about them did not die of any famine. What, then, brought them to this end? They were starved like cattle in the pens of crowded towns, driven there and herded, lest they feed their Cuban brothers in arms\u2026But what of this. We can do nothing for the dead except it be to punish their murderers. Ah! but the living!\u2014more than 200,000\u2026More in peril of a like death! The facts are admitted by Spain herself. At last, at last, the terrible secrets are disclosed, and the horror is set before the eyes of the world, and the hearts of the world are asked for pity! An appeal has come to me from the New England Cuban relief committee. It is a very remarkable document in its frank disclosure of facts and in its straight summons to our hearts for help. It comes to supplement the Christmas appeal of our president for the same end, and to it are affixed the names of some of our most trusted New England citizens.\n\nYet is it not strange that such a reinforcement of the president's proclamation is needed, and so long after, and from private citizens? Why has not this appeal been better heeded? Perhaps it is because in the hearts of American citizens there is a kind of deep rebellious protest that the suffering which America has failed to prevent by diplomacy her citizens should be asked to relieve by charity. Nay, more\u2014there is a stronger protest, that what Spain has failed to do for her loyalists (for they are such, most of those men at least, or they would be in the ranks of the insurgents) is demanded of us in the United States. But Spain is poor, you say; yes, poor, poor Spain! She can spend $640,000,000 to bring men into misery, but not a dollar to bring them out, or to relieve that misery. Ah, she will be condemned by the ages as much for her inhumanity to Cuba as for the horror of the Inquisition.\n\nThe kind of relief that Americans now desire for the Cubans is not in food, or coin or clothing, but in bullets and bayonets. The unfortunate De Lome has exposed the lying scheme of autonomy, and the duplicity of the proposed commercial treaties. The end draws on! The fall of stocks or the rise in sugar cannot avert it. The ultimate form of Cuban relief must be from the guns of the Maine and the Montgomery.\n\nThis news report of the Maine explosion was published by the Aberdeen Daily News (Aberdeen, South Dakota) on Feb. 16, 1898:\n\nThe Maine Blown Up\n\n253 of Her Crew Missing, Most of Them Being Undoubtedly Lost\n\nOnly 42 of the Entire Ship's Company Escape without Injury\n\nSpanish Treachery Suspected, but Accident the Probable Cause\n\nThis city, in common with every other portion of the United States within reach of the telegraph, was thrown into a state of excitement at an early hour this morning by the report that the battleship Maine had been blown up in Havana harbor during the night. The first advice of the awful affair was received by the News in a special telegram from its Washington correspondent as follows:\n\nLaid It to the Spaniards\n\nWashington, D.C., Feb. 16.\u2014The U.S. ship Maine was blown up at Havana by Spanish treachery. One hundred lives were lost.\n\nBoard of Trade Reports\n\nWithin a few minutes after this time the wheat men of the city received advices to the same effect from their correspondents at Minneapolis, but although there was some inclination to attribute the disaster to Spanish deviltry there was no direct charge to that effect.\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nAbout 9:30 a.m. the Associated Press forwarded the following telegram to the News from their headquarters at St. Paul:\n\nSt. Paul, Minn., Feb. 16.\u2014The battleship Maine was blown up by an explosion during the night in Havana harbor and is a total wreck. Probably a hundred men were killed and many injured. The cause of the explosion is not known.\n\nCalms Resentment Somewhat\n\nThis telegram, which placed a doubt upon the origin of the disaster, had a mollifying effect upon the public, but many were loath to believe the fanatical population of the Cuban seaport were innocent of the outrage and wholesale murder of innocent men. The war spirit was rife and there is not a doubt but that two-thirds of the able-bodied men of the city would have volunteered at any hour of the day to enlist in a war of extermination against Spain. Almost everyone believed for a time that the disaster was equivalent to a declaration of war, if a state of war did not really exist, and while all deplored the loss of life and the destruction of one of the bravest ships of the new navy, there seemed to be a general feeling of grim satisfaction that at last the United States was about to wipe the curse of Spanish domination from the new world. The latest information regarding the explosion was the following telegram to the News from the Associated Press, which placed the loss of life at 253 and the number of injured at 59, and attributed the affair to accident:\n\nThe Captain's Account\n\nWashington, D.C., Feb. 16.\u2014Secretary Long has received a dispatch from Captain Sigsbee of the Maine saying 253 of the crew are missing and that most of them are undoubtedly lost. Fifty-nine were injured and forty-two were uninjured. Indications point to an accident, though just how it happened is not known.\n\nPart of the wounded men of the Maine were taken on board a Spanish war vessel for treatment. Washington authorities ask the public to withhold judgment pending an investigation.\n\nIndefiniteness Significant\n\nThe indefiniteness of this statement on the part of Captain Sigsbee is decidedly significant and lends color to the theory that the Spaniards are to blame and must be called to account. Diplomatic usage would make the ship's officers slow to attribute the loss of the ship to Spain in the absence of positive proof. If the dastardly act can be traced to either the Spanish government or to citizens of that country there is no doubt war will result. If the act was done by citizens, Spain will be held accountable for the loss of the ship and for damages for the lives of the crew. This sum would amount to many millions and would be beyond the power of Spain to pay. In that event war only could result, as this government would probably demand possession of Cuba by way of indemnity. It is hard to believe, however, that the vigilance of the Maine's officers was such as to permit the Spaniards to commit the deed, although it may have been done by a submerged torpedo.\n\nSomething about the Ship\n\nThe Maine was a battleship of 6,682 tons displacement, 318 feet long on the water line, 57 feet wide, and had a mean draught of 21 feet 6 inches. Her engines were 9,293 horsepower. She carried 4 ten-inch breech loading rifles, [plus 6 six-inch guns \u2013ed.], besides 7 six-pounders and 8 one-pounders. Her complement of hands was 29 officers and 370 men. Her cost was $2,500,000, and her keel was laid in 1888.\n\nNothing like a similar disaster has occurred in naval circles for many years either in war or peace, with the single exception of the sinking of the British war ship Victoria, by a sister ship, while maneuvering in the Mediterranean a few years ago. A complete investigation is [a]waited by the American people with impatience and anxiety"}

{"text":"Titanic\n\nApril\/May, 2012\n\nby Nicholas McIndoe - images Emory Kristof, National Geographic\n\nInterest in the sinking of the RMS Titanic on 15 April 1912 has endured for 100 years. The accident remains one of peacetime's worst maritime disasters, capturing the imagination of generations like no other. The tragic events of that fateful April night continue to affect our lives today and will generate interest for another 100 years.\n\nThe Olympic-class Royal Mail Ship Titanic was owned by the White Star Line and built at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, Ireland, using some of the most advanced technologies of the time and featuring extensive safety measures.\n\nIt had a gross tonnage of 46,000, it was 883 feet (268m) overall length (about as long as the Empire State Building is high), had nine decks and could accommodate 3500 passengers and crew at a cruising speed of 23 knots, making it the largest, most luxurious passenger steamship of its day.\nUnder the command of Captain Smith, Titanic departed Southampton for its maiden voyage to New York at 12 noon on 10 April, with 2, 223 people aboard.\n\nCaptain Edward J Smith, Commander of the Titanic, joined the White Star Line in 1880, quickly rising through the ranks to become one of the world's most experienced and respected sea captains. It became customary for him to command White Star Line's newest ships on their maiden voyages.\n\nTravelling first class on the maiden voyage were some of the most prominent people of the day, as well as J Bruce Ismay (President of White Star Line) and the ship's builder, Thomas Andrews.\n\n'Iceberg, right ahead!' was the call from lookout Frederick Fleet to Sixth Officer James Moody on the bridge at 11.40pm on a clear, calm night about 400 miles south of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. The iceberg struck Titanic a glancing blow along its starboard side, buckling the hull in several places and popping rivets below the waterline over a length of 90m. This opened the first six watertight compartments to the sea.\nTitanic's hull was divided into 16 watertight compartments, however they were separated only by bulkheads that did not reach the ceiling. The ship was designed to stay afloat if the first four compartments flooded, but no more. She eventually sank at 2.20 am, two hours and 40 minutes after hitting the iceberg.\n\nTitanic carried enough lifeboats for 1,178 people, little more than half those aboard. Incredulously, this complied with regulations at the time. A total of 1,517 people lost their lives in the disaster, around 700 survived. Captain Smith went down with his ship, but four of the eight officers survived. One notable survivor was J Bruce Ismay, who was criticised for saving himself by getting into a lifeboat.\n\nDespite several ice warnings on 14 April, Titanic was steaming at close to maximum speed when it struck the iceberg. Upon receiving the ice warnings, Captain Smith ordered a new sailing course, further south. However, many 'non-essential' ice warnings never reached him and at one stage, Titanic's wireless operator, Jack Phillips, angrily responded to ice messages by saying he was busy.\n\nOn 1 September 1985, an expedition led by Dr Robert Ballard and Jean-Louis Michel, located the wreck of the Titanic 13,000 feet (3962m) down on the bed of the North Atlantic Ocean. She was upright with the hull in two separate sections some 2,000 feet (609m) apart, with debris spread over a large area.\n\nIn 1986 Dr Ballard led another expedition to the Titanic site, on board the ship Atlantis II. On board the ship was a newly-developed deep-diving submersible named Alvin, capable of carrying three people to previously unobtainable depths. As a way to test Alvin, the US Navy funded this expedition.\nAlvin was equipped with a small, self-propelled device that carried a high-resolution camera named Jason Junior which was sent into the Titanic wreck. An amazing sight met their eyes: plates, glasses, bottles of wine, still in perfect condition, preserved by the sea.\n\nNo human remains have ever been found; only personal belongings where bodies once lay. It is a poignant reminder that the disaster claimed over 1,500 lives, and one of the most disturbing images is that of a pair of shoes - not just a pair of shoes; they once belonged to a living person. A point of much debate is that many artefacts from the Titanic are displayed in museum collections.\n\nA number of events are planned to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the sinking, including a re-release of James Cameron's 1997, blockbuster hit Titanic in 3D.\n\nThe sinking of Titanic brought about sweeping changes in the maritime industry, the most important of which was that lifeboat numbers were to be determined by number of people on board, not by gross tonnage. Ice patrols were also set-up in the North Atlantic. But sadly and somewhat ironically, the Titanic's innovative watertight design proved to be a mistake and led to its tragic demise. The wreck now lies as a memorial to 1,517 hapless but brave souls. It will eventually disappear but their memory never will."}

{"text":"(known as perhydrol) as a fuel. His engines were to become famous for their use in rocket-powered aircraft\u2014notably the Me 163 Komet\u2014but most of his early efforts were spent on systems for submarine propulsion.\n\nIn these cases the hydrogen peroxide was reduced chemically and the resulting gases used to spin a turbine at about 20,000 rpm, which was then geared to a propeller. This allowed the submarine to run underwater at all times, as there was no need for air to run the engines. The system also used up tremendous amounts of fuel, and any boat based on the design would either have to be absolutely huge, or have terribly limited range.\n\nThus the system saw only limited development even though a prototype was running in 1940. But when problems with the existing U-boat designs became evident in 1942, the work was stepped up. Eventually two engineers came up with a simple solution to the problem.\n\nInstead of running the submarine 100% on the perhydrol, they used it strictly for bursts of speed when needed. Most of the operations would then be carried out as with a normal boat, using a diesel engine\n\nDiesel engine\n\nA diesel engine is an internal combustion engine that uses the heat of compression to initiate ignition to burn the fuel, which is injected into the combustion chamber...\n\nto charge batteries. However while a conventional design would use the diesel as the primary engine and the batteries for short periods of underwater power, in this case the boat would run almost all the time on batteries in a low-speed cruise, turning on the perhydrol during attacks. The diesel was now dedicated entirely to charging the batteries, which it needed only three hours to do.\n\nThe perhydrol design suffered from several design flaws which were not fixed before the end of the war. As an intermediate solution, the perhydrol propulsion system was dropped in favour of a conventional diesel\/electric solution, but retaining the streamlined hull-shape. The battery capacity was increased significantly along with fuel stores, and the boat was designed to operate underwater for long periods.\n\nElectric U boats\n\nType XXI U-boats, also known as \"Elektroboote\", were the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged, rather than as surface ships that could submerge as a means to escape detection or launch an attack.-Description:...\n\nGerman Type XXIII submarines were the first so-called elektroboats to become operational.

NATO, which I would think is the organisation under which combined exercises were instigated, was formed in late 1949. The Korean War started April 1950. They would, more than likely, have been aware of the impending conflict. The thing is, would they not have had more important things to do than plan and deploy fleets on exercises in those 6 or 7 months?\n\n2. Tensions in Berlin at the time meant that the US forces were already in a state of high alert. Would a concentration of NATO naval forces off the North of Scotland be seen as a provocative move by the Russians?\n\nI was inclined to think that one or other of the incidents in the second half of that decade might be more likely. Iran, Cyprus, Suez, or even Viet Nam where the French were beginning to come under pressure, may be suitable candidates.\n\nBritish and Commonwealth Forces would most likely also be involved in those exercises. So the emergency need not necessarily be an American one."}

{"text":"British Antarctic expedition (act. 1910\u20131913) by Herbert George Ponting, 1911\n\n, under the command of Captain Robert Falcon Scott RN, began disembarking from their ship Terra Nova at Cape Evans on 4 January 1911, with the dual aims of conquering the geographical south pole for the British empire, and conducting extensive scientific research. The shore party of thirty-three men, chosen from 8000 volunteers, bore the imprint of these twin aims. Scott was the last of a line of polar pioneers from the Royal Navy, which included James Cook, John Franklin, John Ross, James Clark Ross, Leopold McClintock, George Nares, and Albert Markham. Albert's cousin Clements Markham, president of the Royal Geographical Society, had propelled Scott into the public eye at the head of the Discovery Antarctic expedition (1901\u20134), which Clements had been determined would be led by a naval officer.\n\nThe Terra Nova had set sail from Cardiff on 15 June 1910. Its crew, divided between 'officers', 'scientific staff', and 'men', expressed a web of personal, professional, and institutional relationships, in which the Royal Navy and the University of Cambridge featured prominently. Five of the shore party's seven officers came from the Royal Navy. The Terra Nova's second-in-command was an ambitious young lieutenant, Edward (Teddy) Evans, who was persuaded by Clements Markham to abandon his own Antarctic plans and join forces with Scott. Evans was joined by the old Etonian Lieutenant Victor Campbell and two Royal Naval surgeons, (George) Murray Levick, educated at St Paul's School and St Bartholomew's Hospital, and Edward Atkinson, who trained at St Thomas's Hospital. Twelve of the shore party's 'men' were either serving or had served in the Royal Navy, including petty officers Thomas Crean, Edgar Evans, Thomas Soulsby Williamson (1877\u20131940), and chief stoker William Lashly who had been with Scott on the Discovery, and petty officers Frank Browning (b. 1882), Robert Forde (1877\u20131959), and Patrick Keohane (1879\u20131950), who had served under Teddy Evans on HMS Talbot. The prominent Royal Naval contingent was in contrast to the largely civilian crews of the Nimrod (1907\u20139) and Endurance (1914\u201317) Antarctic expeditions organized by Scott's colleague on the Discovery, the former merchant seaman Ernest Shackleton.\n\nScott had been stung by criticisms of the Discovery's scientific results, and so appointed seven professional scientists with academic qualifications, who derived an income from education or research. The staff were led by Scott's closest confidant, his old friend from the DiscoveryEdward Wilson. Educated at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and St George's Hospital, Wilson was a muscular Christian, who worshipped God by observing the wonders of his creation. A talented artist, he shared Scott's voracious and wide-ranging curiosity about the natural world. Wilson was joined by a biologist from Plymouth marine laboratory, Edward William Nelson (1883\u20131923), educated at Cambridge; the meteorologist George Simpson, educated at the universities of Manchester and G\u00f6ttingen, who was granted leave from the Indian Meteorological Office to join the expedition; and the geologist Raymond Priestley, who had studied at University College, Bristol. Priestley was recruited late, when the Terra Nova stopped in Sydney. Scott worked hard, although with limited success, to drum up financial support from the colonies. He highlighted the appointment of the Cambridge-educated Canadian physicist Charles Seymour Wright (1887\u20131975) and the geologists Frank Debenham and (Thomas) Griffith Taylor, both graduates of the University of Sydney, to emphasize the expedition's imperial character.\n\nThe scientists and naval seamen in the shore party were joined by an eclectic collection of specialists. Cecil Henry Meares (1877\u20131937) was one of the most intriguing, a seasoned global adventurer who journeyed to Siberia to select ponies and sledge-dogs for the expedition, and also brought back the Russian dog-driver Dmitry Gerof and the groom Anton Omelchenko. Meares had met a photographer of growing renown, Herbert Ponting, during the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u20135) and encouraged him to apply to the expedition. Ponting's images continue to shape our visualization of Antarctica.\n\nScott appointed two more officers: Lieutenant Henry Bowers of the Royal Indian Marine, who served as quartermaster, and the old Etonian Captain Lawrence Oates of the Inniskilling dragoons. Seeking a new challenge, Oates brought his cavalry officer's experience to the care of the expedition's ponies. Like Oates, the Wykehamist and the only Oxford graduate in the shore party, Apsley Cherry-Garrard, cousin of Scott's publisher Reginald Smith, offered \u00a31000 to join the expedition. Scott turned him down, but was impressed when the young landowner donated the money in spite of his rejection, and Cherry-Garrard signed up as assistant zoologist. The shore party was completed by a Norwegian ski expert, Tryggve Gran (1889\u20131980), recommended by the great explorer Fridtjof Nansen, and the mechanic Bernard Day (1884\u20131934), who worked on the motor sledges that Scott hoped would give him an edge in the race for the south pole. Only a few days after the shore party disembarked, the Terra Nova encountered a rival Norwegian expedition led by the polar veteran Roald Amundsen, confirming reports they had received in Australia.\n\nThe activities of the crew and their relatives spanned the globe in a striking expression of Britain's imperial reach. Scott's brother Archie, for example, had served as aide-de-camp to the governor of the Gold Coast in the 1890s; Oates's uncle Francis Oates was one of the first Europeans to see the Victoria Falls; and Wilson's uncle Charles William Wilson commanded the forward relief party that had reached Khartoum two days too late to save General Gordon from the mahdi in January 1885.\n\nScott believed Shackleton had broken his promise by establishing the Nimrod's base camp near the Discovery's old hut, and was galled when Shackleton was f\u00eated after marching within 97 miles of the south pole in 1909. But Scott's decisions first to take two Nimrod veterans, Day and Priestley, and, second, to appoint Debenham and Taylor, both taught by the Nimrod's geologist Professor T. W. E. David, who had fallen out with Scott before the Discovery expedition, demonstrated a commitment to scientific excellence over personal animosity.\n\nThe unique pressures of Antarctic life generated intense relationships. Both Wright and Taylor later married sisters of Raymond Priestley. The bond between Cherry-Garrard and the two muscular Christians, Bowers and Wilson, solidified during their famous winter journey to Cape Crozier in search of emperor penguin eggs. Wilson and Bowers were popular with all, but others aroused irritation. In passages cut from his published journal Scott criticized the 'dilletantish' Nelson and idle Tryggve Gran, although Gran later earned his respect. Both Scott and Cherry-Garrard were particularly disparaging about Teddy Evans.\n\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that Scott chose not to include Teddy Evans in the final polar party, selecting instead his friend Wilson, the powerful seaman Edgar Evans, the indefatigable Bowers, and Captain Oates to represent the army. Equipped with the latest technology, the expedition reaped a rich scientific harvest, but the attempt to conquer the south pole for the empire failed. Motor sledges proved of limited use, while too few dogs and ponies were available to save the British from the dreadful ordeal of man-hauling their sledges, the fateful legacy of Clements Markham's Antarctic obsession. The Norwegians, in contrast, had succeeded in bringing 110 dogs to the Antarctic. Scott reached the south pole on 17 January 1912, only to discover that Amundsen's party had arrived a month earlier. All five Britons perished on the return. A search party found the bodies of Scott, Bowers, and Wilson on 12 November 1912, together with the letters and journals that told their story. News of their fate was cabled to London in February 1913.\n\nThe search party had chosen to look for Scott rather than a northern party led by Campbell, which had been stranded in Victoria Land. The six men of that party constructed an underground igloo in which to shelter during the Antarctic winter, drawing a line down the middle to separate the officers, Campbell, Priestley, and Levick, from the men, George Abbott (d. 1926), Frank Browning, and Harry Dickason (1885\u20131943). After surviving six months in the igloo, they marched 230 miles to Cape Evans in early November 1912. The imposition of naval discipline during the expedition has been criticized, but routines familiar to the large Royal Naval contingent probably helped preserve sanity in appalling conditions.\n\nThe Edwardian spirit of duty and sacrifice that pervaded the expedition found tragic expression during the First World War, in which almost every member of the shore party served. Teddy Evans was criticized by Cherry-Garrard, Ponting, and others for taking centre-stage after the Terra Nova's return. But any stain on his reputation was removed in 1917 by his command of the destroyer HMS Broke, which, alongside only one other ship, successfully fought off six German vessels intent on bombarding Dover.\n\nScott's story resonated powerfully between the wars, guarded by his widow, Kathleen Scott, who married the politician Edward Hilton Young in 1922. Many of the shore party forged distinguished careers. Simpson, for example, became director of the London Meteorological Office, while Teddy Evans was promoted admiral. Although many of the crew shared Kathleen Scott's belief that Ponting had made a fortune from the Antarctic, his claim that he lost money on the expedition is supported by the record of his wealth at death, which amounted to only \u00a3815.\n\nThe expedition's most tangible legacy was its promotion of Antarctic science, particularly in Cambridge. Twenty-five volumes of findings had been published by 1925. And, largely thanks to Debenham's efforts, the remaining balance of the Scott memorial fund set up in 1913 was directed to establish a Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge in 1920, with a new memorial building opened in 1934. As director of the institute Debenham, in conjunction with Priestley, a fellow of Clare College and university administrator, and one of Shackleton's Endurance scientists, James Wordie, a fellow of St John's College, made Cambridge the centre of polar research in Britain. The culture of exploration that emerged in this period, and the tensions between those who served with Scott and Shackleton, await further investigation."}

{"text":"Arago: Waterway\n\nThe Smithsonian's Office of Exhibits Central created this model of the Buckeye State packet boat for the inaugural exhibits in 1993. Built in 1850, the Buckeye State traveled between Cincinnati, Ohio, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was a wooden hull side-wheel packet boat, 260 feet long, owned by the Pittsburgh and Cincinnati Packet Line.\n\nDuring the first half of the nineteenth century, steamboats such as the Buckeye State helped move the mail to areas not serviced by stagecoach lines or railway routes. In 1823 Congress declared all steamboat routes to be post roads and, therefore, subject to federal regulation and contracting.\n\nSteamboats that traveled along the Ohio River were subject to unpredictable weather, run aground during spring floods, or trapped by winter ice. Also known as 'packet boats', 'side-wheel packets', or simply 'packets' for short, these crafts were celebrated for their speed and ability to carry a large amount of cargo.\n\nSpeed was important for all aspects of transportation, including mail. Steamboat captains often vied for record speeds, the winner gaining fame as the best on his route. The Buckeye State set a record out of Cincinnati on its maiden voyage (May 1, 1850). It reached Pittsburgh in forty-three hours, beating the record of Telegraph No. 2, which had made the same trip in forty-four hours, forty-seven minutes three years earlier. Fortunately, the Buckeye State survived the race. Sometimes captains pushed their boats too hard, stoking boilers past their capacities, resulting in steam engine explosions that engulfed the boats in fire, destroying mail, cargo, and killing passengers and crew."}
{"text":"Bulkhead_(partition)\n\nBulkhead (partition)\n\nA bulkhead is an upright wall within the hull of a ship. Other kinds of partition elements within a ship are decks and deckheads.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe word bulki meant \"cargo\" in Old Norse. The Song DynastyChinese author Zhu Yu wrote of Chinese ships with watertight bulkhead compartments in his book Pingzhou Table Talks of 1119 AD. A Chinese trade ship dated to 1277 AD was found off the southern coast of China in 1973, and had 12 bulkhead compartment rooms in its hull.\n\nSometime in the 15th century sailors and builders in Europe realized that walls within a vessel would prevent cargo from shifting during passage. In shipbuilding, any vertical panel was called a \"head\". So walls installed abeam (side-to-side) in a vessel's hull were called \"bulkheads.\"\nNow, the term bulkhead applies to every vertical panel aboard a ship, except for the hull itself.\n\nPurpose\n\nBulkheads in a ship serve several purposes:\n\nincrease the structural rigidity of the vessel,\n\ndivide functional areas into rooms and\n\ncreate watertight compartments that can contain water in the case of a hull breach or other leak.\n\nRequirements of bulkheads\n\nFire-resistance\n\nOpenings in fire-resistance rated bulkheads and decks must be firestopped to restore the fire-resistance ratings that would otherwise be compromised, if the openings were left unsealed. The Authority Having Jurisdiction for such measures varies depending upon the flag of the ship. Merchant vessels are typically subject to the regulations and inspections of the Coast Guards of the flag country. Combat ships are subject to the regulations set out by the navy of the country that owns the ship.\n\nIn the case of firestops, cable jacketing is usually removed within the seal and firestop rubber modules are internally fitted with copper shields, which contact the cables' armour in order to ground the seal. There are also conductive fill materials in use for that purpose, which must be in direct contact with cable armour to ensure full grounding of the bulkheads and decks."}
{"text":"Field Gun Competitions - A Brief History\n\nThis article was first published in a Field Gunners Association Newsletter 2006\n\nThe Guns used in the Field Gun Competitions, are similar to the 12-Pounder guns used in the Boer War, and other Naval Brigade activities assisting the Army, in places such as Egypt, China and Ashanti.\n\nNaval brigades were detachments from ships consisting of seamen and Royal Marines (which were soldiers on board ships) who were landed ashore to undertake naval operations or to support the army in a wide variety of campaigns. During the period from 1850-1914, the Navy did not fight any ship-to-ship actions, and most British seamen who were on active service in operations did so as part of a Naval Brigade.\n\nThe Naval Brigades were professional organisations. Both officers and men received regular training in the techniques of land warfare at the gunnery school, HMS Excellent, at Portsmouth.\n\nThe origin of the Field Gun competitions is linked to episodes during the Boer War,\nin particular with the epic 119 day siege of Ladysmith, where the gallant defenders were helped enormously by the arrival, at the last minute of Captain the Hon Hedworth Lambton of the Naval Brigade with his 280 Blue-jackets, four 12-Pounders and two 4.7 inch guns.\n\nThe Boer Army Artillery was far superior to that of the British, and on 25th October 1899 the General Officer Commanding at Ladysmith Sir George White, the British Army Headquarters in Natal, signalled the Admiral Commanding the Cape Squadron in Simonstown to ask for assistance in the form of long range Naval Guns.\n\nAs a result, Captain Percy Scott of HMS TERRIBLE was tasked with producing plans for the mounting of two 4.7\" guns for use ashore. Less than 24 hours later at 6 p.m. on the 26th October, the mountings were built and the guns dispatched together with four 12-pounders in HMS POWERFUL to Durban. From there the Naval Brigade under Captain Lambton transferred the guns to the last train to get through to Ladysmith before it was besieged for 119 days.\n\nThe Naval Brigade consisted of 750 ratings and Royal Marines and fought with distinction in several parts of the country. The guns went into action on arrival and soon silenced the Boer guns. A further number of guns were landed and transported overland by the Naval Brigade to relieve Ladysmith. During this march the guns were in action many times and, on one occasion when the wheel of one of the carriages collapsed, a 12 pounder was carried by the Blue Jackets over two miles to come into action at the top of a hill.\n\nAfter the siege of Ladysmith was finally lifted on February 28th 1900 Queen Victoria sent a telegram: \"Pray express to the Naval Brigade my deep appreciation of the valuable services they have rendered with their guns \".\n\nIt was Scott, then a Lieutenant, who had helped Captain Fisher (later Admiral of the Fleet and First Sea Lord) establish a Gunnery School on Whale Island at Portsmouth in the 1880s. Later as Commander Scott he was instrumental in conceiving the idea of field gun competitions, the first as early as 1900.\n\nWhen the crew from HMS POWERFUL returned to this country they ran a 4.7\" gun through the arena at the Agricultural Hall at Islington in the 1900 Royal Military Tournament and were greeted with wild enthusiasm by the public attending. They ran the gun through the streets of London to Waterloo Station on their return to Portsmouth.\n\nThe Brickwoods Trophy Competition sponsored by Whitbread was instituted shortly after its 'Big Brother', the Inter-Command Competition was first performed at Olympia in 1907.\n\nOn 28th August 1907, the Royal Marines light Infantry, from Forton, won the first\n\"Brickwoods Trophy\" competition, and along with it this magnificent Trophy\n\nBoth competitions commemorate the feats performed by the Naval Brigades during the Boer War."}
{"text":"A cruise ship or cruise liner is a passenger ship used for pleasure voyages, where the voyage itself and the ship's amenities are part of the experience, as well as the different destinations along the way. Transportation is not the prime purpose, as cruise ships operate mostly on routes that return passengers to their originating port, so the ports of call are usually in a specified region of a continent. There are even \"cruises to nowhere\" or \"nowhere voyages\" where the ship makes 2-3 day round trips without any ports of call.\n\nBy contrast, dedicated transport oriented ocean liners do \"line voyages\" and typically transport passengers from one point to another, rather than on round trips. Traditionally, an ocean liner for the transoceanic trade will be built to a higher standard than a typical cruise ship, including high freeboard and stronger plating to withstand rough seas and adverse conditions encountered in the open ocean, such as the North Atlantic. Ocean liners also usually have larger capacities for\nfuel, victuals, and other stores for consumption on long voyages, compared to dedicated cruise ships.\nAlthough often luxurious, ocean liners had characteristics that made them unsuitable for cruising, such as high fuel consumption, deep draught that prevented them from entering shallow ports, enclosed weatherproof decks that were not appropriate for tropical weather, and cabins designed to maximize passenger numbers rather than comfort (such as a high proportion of windowless suites). The gradual evolution of passenger ship design from ocean liners to cruise ships has seen passenger cabins shifted from inside the hull to the superstructure with private verandas. The modern cruise ships, while sacrificing qualities of seaworthiness, have added amenities to cater to tourists, and recent vessels have been described as \"balcony-laden floating condominiums\".\n\nThe lines between ocean liners and cruise ships have blurred, particularly with respect to deployment, although the differences in construction remain. Larger cruise ships have also engaged in longer trips such as transocean voyages which may not lead back to the same port for months (longer round trips). Some former ocean liners operate as cruise ships, such as Marco Polo and Mona Lisa. This number is diminishing. The only dedicated transatlantic ocean liner in operation as a liner, as of February 2010, is the Queen Mary 2 of the Cunard fleet. She also has the amenities of contemporary cruise ships and sees significant service on cruises.\n\nCruising has become a major part of the tourism industry, accounting for U.S.$29.4 billion with over 19 million passengers carried worldwide in 2011. The industry's rapid growth has seen nine or more newly built ships catering to a North American clientele added every year since 2001, as well as others servicing\nEuropean clientele. Smaller markets, such as the Asia-Pacific region, are generally serviced by older ships. These are displaced by new ships in the high growth areas.\n\nThe world's largest cruise ships are Royal Caribbean International's Oasis of the Seas and its sister ship Allure of the Seas.\n\nOperators and cruise lines\n\nOperators of cruise ships are known as cruise lines. Cruise lines have a dual character; they are partly in the transportation business, and partly in the leisure entertainment business, a duality that carries down into the ships themselves, which have both a crew headed by the ship's captain, and a hospitality staff headed by the equivalent of a hotel manager.\n\nAmong cruise lines, some are direct descendants of the traditional passenger shipping lines, while others were founded from the 1960s on specifically for cruising. The business is extremely volatile; the ships are massive capital expenditures with very high operating costs, and a slight dip in bookings can easily put a company out of business. Cruise lines frequently sell, renovate, or simply rename their ships just to keep up with travel trends.\n\nA wave of failures and consolidation in the 1990s has led to many lines existing only as \"brands\" within larger corporations, much as a single automobile company produces several makes of cars. Brands exist partly because of repeat customer loyalty, and also to offer different levels of quality and service. For instance, Carnival Corporation owns both Carnival Cruise Lines, whose former image were vessels that had a reputation as \"party ships\" for younger travelers, but have become large, modern, and extremely elegant, yet still profitable, and Holland America Line, whose ships cultivate an image of classic elegance. In 2004, Carnival Corporation had merged Cunard's headquarters with that of Princess Cruises in Santa Clarita, California so that administrative, financial and technology services could be combined, ending Cunard's history where it had operated as a standalone company (subsidiary) regardless of parent ownership. However, Cunard did regain some independence in 2009 when its headquarters were moved to Carnival House in Southampton.\n\nSome cruise lines have specialties; for example, Saga Cruises only allows passengers over 50 years old aboard their ships, and Windstar Cruises only operates tall ships. Regent Seven Seas Cruises operates medium-sized vessels\u2014smaller than the \"megaships\" of Carnival and Royal Caribbean\u2014designed such that 90% of their suites are balconies. Several specialty lines offer \"expedition cruising\" or only operate small ships, visiting certain destinations such as the Arctic and\nAntarctica, or the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands.\n\nCurrently the five largest cruise line operators in the world are Carnival Corporation & plc, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., Star Cruises (which owns 50% of Norwegian Cruise Line, NCL in its own right is the third largest line), MSC Cruises, and Louis Cruise Lines. Louis Cruises has largerly grown its fleet through purchasing older second- or third-hand ships, while the other four operators have largely constructed their own vessels and combined own the majority of the \"megaships\".\n\nCrew\n\nCrew is usually hired on three to eleven month contracts which may then be renewed as mutually agreed, which is based upon service ratings from passengers as well as the cyclical nature of the cruise line operator. Most staff work 77 hour workweeks for 10 months continuously followed by 2 months of vacation.\n\nThere are no paid vacations or pensions for service, non-management crew, depending on the level of the position and the type of the contract. Non-service and management crew members get paid vacation, medical, retirement options, and can participate in the company's group insurance plan.\n\nThe direct salary is low for North American standards , though restaurant staff have considerable earning potential from passenger tips. Crew members do not have any expenses while on board as food and accommodation, and transportation for most employees, are included. This makes a cruise ship career financially attractive enough to compensate for lack of employment benefits.\n\nLiving arrangements vary by cruise line, but mostly by shipboard position. In general two employees share a cabin with a shower, commode and a desk with a television set, while senior officers are assigned single cabins. There are a set of facilities for the crew separate from that of passengers, such as mess rooms and bars, recreation rooms, prayer rooms\/mosques, and fitness center, with some larger ships even having a crew deck with a swimming pool and hot tubs. On some cruise lines such as Carnival Cruise Lines, certain client-facing staff (entertainers and shopkeepers) have the privilege of eating in the same buffet as passengers, but only on port days.\n\nFor the largest cruise operators, most \"hotel staff\" are hired from under-industrialized countries in Asia, Eastern Europe, the Caribbean, and Central America. While several cruise lines are headquartered in the\nUnited States, the ships are registered in countries such as Bahamas, Panama, and Liberia, a practice known as \"flags of convenience\" to take advantage of less-stringent labour regulations. Collective action is difficult due to staff being from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds. The exception to this are the cruise routes around\nHawaii, where operators are required to register their ships in the United States and the crew is unionized, so these cruises are typically much more expensive than Caribbean and Mediterranean.\n\nBusiness model\n\nThere are \"luxury cruise lines\" such as Regent Seven Seas Cruises and Crystal Cruises provide \"the most all-inclusive\" cruises. Base fare on Regent Seven Seas ships includes most\nalcoholic beverages onboard ship and most shore excursions in ports of call, as well as all gratuities that would normally be paid to hotel staff on the ship. Fare also includes one night's hotel stay before boarding and airfare to and from the cruise's origin and destination ports.\n\nMost cruise lines since the 2000s have priced the cruising experience, to some extent, a la carte, as passengers spending aboard generates significantly more from ticket sales. The passenger's ticket includes the stateroom accommodation, room service, unlimited meals in the main dining room and buffet, access to shows, and use of pool and gym facilities. However, there are extra charges for alcohol and\nsoft drinks, official cruise photos, Internet and wi-fi access, and specialty restaurants; it has been reported that the casino and photos have high profit margins. Cruise lines earn significantly from selling onshore excursions (keeping 50 percent or more of what passengers spend for these tours) offered by local contractors. In addition, cruise ships earn significant commissions for sales from onshore stores that are promoted on board as \"preferred\" (as much as 40 percent of gross sales). Facilitating this practice are modern cruise terminals with establishments of duty-free shops inside a perimeter accessible only by passengers and not locals.\n\nTravel to and from the port of departure are the passengers' responsibility, although purchasing a transfer pass from the cruise line for the trip between the airport and cruise terminal will guarantee that the ship will not leave until the passenger is aboard. Similarly, if the passenger books a shore excursion with the cruise line and the tour runs late, the ship is obligated to remain until the passenger returns.\n\nShip naming\n\nOlder cruise ships have had multiple owners. Since each cruise line has its own livery and often a naming theme (for instance, ships of the Holland America Line have names ending in \"-dam\", e.g. Statendam, and Royal Caribbean's ships' names all end with \"of the Seas\", e.g. Freedom of the Seas, ships of Cunard Line have the title of \"Queen\", e.g. RMS Queen Mary 2), it is usual for the transfer of ownership to entail a refitting and a name change. Some ships have had a dozen or more identities.\n\nCruise ships utilization\n\nDue to slower speed and reduced seaworthiness, as well as being largely introduced after several major wars, cruise ships have never been used as troop transport vessels. By contrast, ocean liners were often seen as the pride of their country and used to rival liners of other nations, and have been requisitioned during both World Wars to transport soldiers and serve as hospital ships.\n\nCruise ships and former liners often find employment in applications other than those for which they were built. A shortage of hotel accommodation for the 2004 Summer\nOlympics led to a plan to moor a number of cruise ships in Athens to provide tourist accommodation.\n\nOn September 1, 2005, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) contracted three Carnival Cruise Lines vessels (Carnival Fantasy, the former Carnival Holiday, and the Carnival Sensation to house Hurricane Katrina evacuees.\n\nIn 2010, in response to the shutdown of UK airspace due to the eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano, the newly completed Celebrity Eclipse was used to rescue 2000 British tourists stranded in\nSpain as \"an act of goodwill\" by the owners. The ship departed from Southampton for Bilbao on April 21, and returned on April 23.\n\nSafety regulations & Security\n\nAs most of the passengers on a cruise are affluent and have considerable ransom potential, not to mention a considerable amount of cash and\njewellery on board (casino and shops), there have been several high profile pirate attacks on cruise ships, such as on the Seabourn Spirit and MSC Melody.\n\nAs a result, cruise ships have implemented various security measures. While most merchant shipping firms have generally avoided arming crew or security guards for reasons of safety, liability and conformity with the laws of the countries where they dock, cruise ships have small arms (usually semi-automatic pistols) stored in a safe accessible only by the captain who distributes them to authorized personnel such as security or the master-at-arms. The ship's high-pressure fire hoses can be used to keep boarders at bay, and often the vessel itself can be maneuvered to ram\npirate craft. A recent technology to deter pirates has been the LRAD or sonic cannon which was used in the successful defense of Seabourn Spirit.\n\nPassengers entering the cruise ship are screened by metal detectors. Explosive detection machines used include X-ray machines and\nexplosives trace-detection portal machines (a.k.a. \"puffer machines\"), to prevent weapons and contraband on board. Security has been considerably tightened since September 11, 2001, such that these measures are similar to airport security.\n\nIn addition to security checkpoints, passengers are often given a ship-specific identification card, which must be shown in order to get on or off the ship. This prevents people boarding who are not entitled to do so, and also ensures the ship's crew are aware of who is on the ship.\n\nCCTV cameras are mounted frequently throughout the ship.\n\nStability\n\nThe design of cruise ships has changed dramatically during the past decades. One of the biggest changes has been moving the passenger cabins from inside the hull to the superstructure and adding individual balconies both due to customer demand and because, from a business standpoint, the cruise line can charge passengers much more than for inside staterooms. This has considerably increased the overall height of the ships, making them more susceptible to side wind and waves. As a result, there have been concerns about the stability of modern passenger ships especially in heavy weather because there is much more ship above the surface than beneath it \u2014 especially modern cruise ships may appear top-heavy to some.\n\nDespite the large superstructure, the center of gravity of modern cruise ships is relatively low. This is due to large open spaces and the extensive use of\naluminium, high-strength steel and other lightweight materials in the upper parts, and the fact that the heaviest components \u2014 engines, propellers, fuel tanks and such \u2014 are located in the lower parts of the ship. Thus, even though modern cruise ships may appear top-heavy, proper weight distribution ensures they are not. Furthermore, large cruise ships also tend to be very wide, which considerably increases their initial stability by increasing the metacentric height.\n\nAlthough most passenger ships utilize stabilizers to reduce rolling in heavy weather, they are only used for crew and passenger comfort and do not contribute to the overall intact stability of the vessel. The ships must fulfill all stability requirements even with the stabilizer fins retracted.\n\nFor the Oasis-class cruise ships, currently the largest passenger ships ever built, the designers created a wide hull to keep the ship stable without excessively increasing the ship's draft. About 30 feet (9 m) of the ship sits beneath the water, a small percentage of the ship's overall height. Although wide, shallow ships such as the Oasis of the Seas tend to be \"snappy\", meaning that they have a short rolling period and thus will snap back upright after a wave has passed, this uncomfortable effect is mitigated by the size of the vessel. The cruise ship's officers were pleased with the ship's stability and performance during the transatlantic crossing, when the vessel, in order to allow finishing work to go on, slowed and changed course in the face of winds \"almost up to hurricane force\" and seas in excess of 40 feet (12 m). Despite this, the Oasis-class vessels have so far operated out of the relatively calm waters of the\nCaribbean, while only ocean liners such as the RMS\nQueen Mary 2 have been deployed on transatlantic service.\n\nSafety record\n\nFrom 2005 to the Costa Concordia disaster in 2012, out of more than 100,000,000\npeople worldwide who had taken cruises, there had been 16 fatalities.\n\nInfections on cruise ships - Norovirus\n\nNorovirus is the most common cause of gastroenteritis in developed countries and is so widespread that only the common cold is reported more frequently. Symptoms usually last between 1 and 3 days and generally resolve without treatment or long term consequences. The incubation period of the virus averages about 24 hours.\n\nThe estimated likelihood of contracting gastroenteritis from any cause on an average 7-day cruise is less than 1%. In 2009, during which more than 13 million people took a cruise, there were nine reported norovirus outbreaks on cruise ships. Outbreak investigations by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have shown that transmission among cruise ship passengers is primarily person-to-person; potable water supplies have not been implicated. In 2009, ships undergoing unannounced inspections in U.S. ports received an average CDC Vessel Sanitation Program score of approximately 97 out of a total possible 100 points. The minimum passing inspection score is 85. Collaboration with the CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program and the development of Outbreak Prevention and Response Plans have helped to generally decrease the incidence of norovirus outbreaks on ships.\n\nLegionnaires' disease\n\nOther pathogens which can colonise pools and spas including those on cruise ships include Legionella, the bacteriium which causes Legionnaires' disease. Legionella, and in particular the most virulent strain, Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, can cause infections when inhaled as an aerosol or aspirated. Individuals who are immunocompromised and those with pre-existing chronic respiratory and cardiac disease are more susceptible. Legionnaires' has been infrequently associated with cruise ships. The Cruise industry Vessel Sanitation Program has specific public health requirements to control and prevent Legionella.\n\nEnvironmental impact - Cruise ship pollution\n\n\"Cruise ships generate a number of waste streams that can result in discharges to the marine environment, including sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, oily bilge water, ballast water, and solid waste. They also emit air pollutants to the air and water. These wastes, if not properly treated and disposed of, can be a significant source of pathogens, nutrients, and toxic substances with the potential to threaten human health and damage aquatic life. Cruise ships represent a small \u2014 although highly visible \u2014 portion of the entire international shipping industry, and the waste streams described here are not unique to cruise ships. Particular types of wastes, such as sewage, graywater, and solid waste, may be of greater concern for cruise ships relative to other seagoing vessels, because of the large numbers of passengers and crew that cruise ships carry and the large volumes of wastes that they produce. Because cruise ships tend to concentrate their activities in specific coastal areas and visit the same ports repeatedly (especially Florida,\nCalifornia, New\nYork, Galveston, Seattle, and the waters of Alaska), their cumulative impact on a local scale could be significant, as can impacts of individual large-volume releases (either accidental or intentional).\"\n\nCargo\nINSURANCE.

{"text":"Sticking Point\nThe builders used 60 gallons of epoxy to hold the sub together. Ben Sklar\n\nIn 1894, American inventor Simon Lake designed the Argonaut Jr., a wheeled vehicle that would drive along the seafloor, the only way to reliably navigate underwater at the time. The unusual concept has inspired sub aficionados ever since. Among its fans are Doug and Kay Jackson, married DIYers from Tulsa, Oklahoma, who in June built a watertight replica from lumber, lead and enough marine epoxy to overflow a bathtub.\n\nTags\n\nBecause no pictures of the Argonaut Jr.'s interior remain, making an exact replica would have been impossible. Instead, the Jacksons added a few modern touches while staying faithful to the basic design. Like its predecessor probably was, it is an ambient sub\u2014it keeps the air pressure inside the cabin equal to the water pressure outside. Doug designed the narrow, tall sub using CAD software. The curved part of the frame is mostly 1x4 beams, while the underside is steel. For the rest of the hull, the couple found that four layers of quarter-inch-thick plywood pressed together by epoxy was the best mix of strong and cheap. For the 40-inch-tall, 4.5-inch-thick wheels, they cut and sandwiched together three layers of lumber and added leftover treads from a local tire shop.\n\nThe initial test dive started poorly when the trailer carrying the sub broke loose and careened into the lake. But the Jacksons recovered, poured a celebratory beer on the hull, closed the hatch, and took the Argonaut Jr. 2010 for its first successful drive, 10 feet below the surface of the water.\n\nHow It Works\n\nTime: 8 Months Cost: $5,000\n\nDESCENT\nThe operators lower a pair of anchors to the seafloor and, from the sub's single cabin, open a series of valves linked to six ballast tanks. Water floods the tanks, making the vessel heavier. An electronic anchor-winch controller winds up the cable, further pulling the sub down. As Argonaut Jr. descends slowly, an automatic air-pressurization system retrofitted to the craft draws air into the cabin from scuba tanks, equalizing with the ambient water pressure.\n\nASCENT\nTo surface, the operators drop the anchors (stored outside) again. Once those hit the floor, the sub rises. The Jacksons let out more cable and open valves that release compressed air into the ballast tanks, gradually expelling the water and making the sub more buoyant. \"You open or close valves, and you go down or you go up,\" Kay explains. \"It's really simple.\"\n\nDRIVING\nThe Jacksons welded a trolling motor normally used for small fishing boats to the steel-pipe-based tiller. By turning the tiller's handle, they redirect the motor's propeller and turn the sub. They can also use a hand crank to drive the craft. The drivetrain consists of 30 feet of roller chain and matching sprockets, custom-cut from steel plates on their CNC machine. A dozen turns of the crank moves the sub about 10 feet.\n\nSAFETY\nThe Jacksons received help from sub experts on the Internet, many of whom urged them to install a drop-weight system for emergencies. They ended up cutting or casting 3,500 pounds of lead blocks that fit jigsaw-like into the exposed steel frame on the bottom. If they need to ascend immediately, they can turn a handle that releases all the blocks at once. With 3,500 pounds shed, the sub, weighing a scant 1.25 tons, rockets up to the surface. The sudden change in pressure could cause the sub to explode, though, so Doug says that in all but the direst circumstances, \"I'd swim out and leave the sub on the bottom.\"\n\nArgonaut, Jr.: Ben Sklar\n\nThe H2Whoa Credo:DIY Can Be Dangerous\nWe review all our projects before publishing them, but ultimately your safety is your responsibility. Always wear protective gear, take proper safety precautions, and follow all laws and regulations.\n\n6 Comments\n\nA nice craft and family project. From what I can tell from the photos, nice workmanship. I only have one suggestion, on the hand crank you need a few pieces of larger diameter pipe over the the crank rods to hold onto while you crank so you don't blister your hands as much.\n\nAs for exploding when the weights are dropped, I kind of have my doubts about that. You left the surface sealed with about 15-PSI and took it to the bottom. If you came up fast, you are still at 15-PSI, the only pressure difference is on the outside of the hull. If it were on the inside, you and the sub would be crushed.\n\nActually Phil the fear of the submarine exploding is well founded, since the pressure inside the hull is the same outside the hull at depth. Due to Boyle's law as the pressure increases, volume decreases; the ratio is about one Atm (15 psi ish) for every 33ft of depth at 1\/Atm volume. So if the sub at 1 atm (surface) dove 99ft (3 Atm)the air in the sub would take up 1\/3 the space at depth. however this sub matches the pressure outside so it won't crush so it has 3 Atm pressure at the full volume. If there is a rapid acsent to the surface the air in the submarine will expand to match the surrounding pressure and blow the submarine apart at depth. It's the same reason scuba divers have to exhale as they surface. Their lungs could overexpand causing serious injury or death.\n\nDanMechEng, very nice description, but I believe the pressure at 30 meters is 4 Atm. Surfacing from this depth, air should expand 4 times it's original volume (as opposed to 3). This is only a minor detail.\n\nwjrussell, Dan and you are both right, just different points of reference. Dan is referencing gauge pressure, you are right with respect to absolute pressure. Dan's is more correct for this instance, as the craft is not starting with a perfect vacuum inside on the surface, so a gauge reference (1 atm.=0 gauge)is more appropriate.\n\nAnd to the Jackson's my congratulation, you are every bit of whom T.R. was talking about:\nIt is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the\nstrong man stumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done them\nbetter. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena;\nwhose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives\nvaliantly, who errs and comes up short again and again; who knows the\ngreat enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy\ncause; who, at the best, knows in the end the triumph of high\nachievement; and who at the worst, at least fails while daring\ngreatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid\nsouls who know neither victory nor defeat. - Teddy Roosevelt\n\nDang OldCarGuy, that's a nice compliment. Makes me feel a lot better about all the stuff I do that does not work. :) Thanks. And it's really heart warming to see people discussing Boyle's law. Best of luck to each of you and your projects.\n\nHey Nicholson, didn't you read the disclaimer? Keep your bike helmet on and don't make any left hand turns. :)"}

{"text":"The mission of the U.S. Navy is to maintain, train, and equip combat-ready naval forces capable of winning wars, deterring aggression, and maintaining freedom of the seas. The Department of the Navy has three principal components: the Navy Department, consisting of executive offices mostly in Washington, D.C.; the operating forces, including the Marine Corps, the reserve components, and, in time of war, the U.S. Coast Guard (in peace, a component of the Department of Transportation); and the shore establishment.\n\nToday's Navy numbers approximately 380,500 active-duty men and women (53,767 officers, 322,450 enlisted, and 4,279 midshipmen); 153,882 Ready Reservists; and just over 184,000 civilian employees. In the active fleet on 17 December 2001, a day typical of most in the Navy's operational posture, were 318 ships and more than 4,000 operational aircraft; 32 percent of the fleet (101 ships) was underway from homeport on that same date, with 29 percent (91 ships) of them forward-deployed and supporting Operation Enduring Freedom or participating in routine exercises and operations. In the U.S. submarine force, 26 percent (14 submarines) were underway, with 11 percent (six submarines) on deployment.\n\nThe active fleet--fast approaching its smallest size since the Great Depression--continued to maintain a high operational tempo during a year marked by the terrorist attacks on 11 September against the World Trade Center in New York City, N.Y., and the Pentagon. These actions by Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist network resulted in both the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific Fleets immediately assuming an expanded role in defense of the U.S. homeland; combat operations started on 7 October against Afghanistan's Taliban government and the al Qaeda forces in that country.\n\nThe Navy-Marine Corps team's role in the opening days of the war on international terrorism, code-named Operation Enduring Freedom, demonstrated exceptional flexibility and combat reach. Expeditionary-warfare missions included sea and area control, strike warfare, humanitarian assistance, and force sustainment. According to Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Vern Clark, the war on international terrorism revealed a combat-credible Navy that is \"on-scene, on-call, and on-demand.\"\n\nToday's Navy also is a force in transition as its capabilities are transformed by the application of sophisticated information technologies and new warfare systems.\n\nA Revolutionary Start\n\nThe historical antecedents for today's naval missions and the Navy's organizational structure may be traced directly to the founding of the U.S. Navy on 13 October 1775 during the Revolutionary War.\n\nAs the Naval Historical Center aptly states in its monograph on the period, \"Beginning with early 1775 actions in coastal waters, followed by Commodore Esek Hopkins' 1776 amphibious assault to capture military stores at New Providence, Bahamas, and reaching a climax in 1781 when French fleet actions off the Virginia Capes led to victory at Yorktown, the war at sea was decisive in the nation's struggle for independence.\"\n\nThe Center's narrative goes on to explain how the small and fragmented Continental naval forces lacked the capabilities for major fleet engagements, but their contributions--usually in a supporting role--were crucial to failure or success ashore. Numerous British merchant ships were captured to provide vitally needed supplies for the hard-pressed Continental Army. Armed vessels transported Washington's troops and joined in the defense of major port cities. American naval officers carried the fight to sea against the British Navy--and beyond to England's shores.\n\nWith victory in hand and independence secured, the new republic had, by 1785, sold off the last ships of the Continental Navy. Navies were then, and are today, expensive to build and maintain. The past was prologue, however. The folly of such shortsighted strategic thinking was starkly revealed by the depredations of Mediterranean pirates and by other attacks on U.S. overseas commerce beginning in the 1780s; these were followed by confrontation at sea with France during the 1790s, which culminated in the so-called Quasi War with that country in 1798.\n\nThe Constitution of the United States, ratified in 1789, empowered Congress \"to provide and maintain a Navy.\" Congress eventually was moved to action (in 1794) following repeated attacks abroad on the Stars and Stripes. It authorized the procuring and manning of six frigates. Three ships--USS United States, USS Constellation, and USS Constitution--were launched in 1797.\n\nThe new United States Navy was born, and its primary mission of defending U.S. commerce overseas would persist until well into the 19th century. From 1794 until 1798, the Department of War administered U.S. naval affairs. In April 1798, however, facing imminent hostilities with France, Congress established the Department of the Navy in order to meet the need for an executive department responsible solely for, and staffed with people expert in, naval affairs. Benjamin Stoddert, who served as secretary of the Continental Board of War during the American Revolution, became the first secretary of the Navy.\n\nThe development of a suitable shore establishment to build ships and support the Navy's operating forces was another farsighted initiative during this formative stage in the Navy's history. Government shipyards were ordered built in six ports along the eastern seaboard. Stoddert set other management plans in motion, including some that led to needed improvements to the Navy's officer corps. The foundation for America's eventual dominance as a global sea power was set in place.\n\nThe Secretary of the Navy\n\nSecretary of the Navy (SECNAV) Gordon R. England was sworn in on 24 May 2001. He is the 72nd person to hold the post. He derives his principal duties and authority from the Navy's early beginning two centuries ago. SECNAV is responsible for and, under Title 10 of the United States Code, has the authority to conduct all of the affairs of the Department of the Navy, including: recruiting, organizing, supplying, equipping, training, mobilizing, and demobilizing. The secretary also oversees the construction, outfitting, and repair of naval ships, equipment, and facilities, and is responsible for the formulation and implementation of naval policies and programs that are consistent with the national security policies and objectives established by the president and the secretary of defense.\n\nThe Department of the Navy consists of two uniformed services: the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps. Echoing President Bush's vow that the war on terrorism will be the principal focus of his administration, England has said that the Department of the Navy will work within the Department of Defense and with other agencies to meet this challenge, no matter how long it takes. England also has outlined four key areas that he will focus on during his time in office: (1) people; (2) combat capability; (3) new technologies; and (4) business practices.\n\nWithin the Office of the Secretary, four assistant secretaries of the Navy have functional responsibilities for policy formulation and oversight related to the full spectrum of the tasks of organizing, building, outfitting, manning, and training the Navy and Marine Corps of today and tomorrow. The assistant secretary of the Navy (research, development, and acquisition), for example, is the Department's acquisition executive responsible for all research, development, and procurement of defense systems for the Navy and Marine Corps: aviation, ships, weapons, ground systems, and combat support.\n\nThe Department of the Navy's senior uniformed staffs, serving under the chief of naval operations and the commandant of the Marine Corps, assist by defining force-structure requirements in their roles as warfare-resource sponsors--guiding the direction of and priority for Navy and Marine Corps acquisition programs as part of the service's overall strategy- formulation, resource-allocation, and budgeting processes.\n\nProgram executive officers (PEOs), assisted by individual program managers, exercise day-to-day responsibility for the secretary of the Navy for research, development, and acquisition matters relating to the Department of the Navy's ship, aircraft, weapons, and systems acquisition programs. The PEOs have a dual reporting chain to Navy and Marine Corps senior civilian and uniformed leadership. In addition to their direct-reporting relationship to the secretary for the execution of acquisition matters, they report to the chief of naval operations (or, for Marine Corps acquisition programs, the commandant of the Marine Corps) through their cognizant system commands on matters related to the life-cycle support of deployed ships, aircraft, weapons, and systems.\n\nAdm. Vern Clark became the chief of naval operations (CNO) on 21 July 2000. He is the senior naval officer in the Department of the Navy and serves as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The CNO is responsible to the secretary of the Navy for the command, use of resources, and operating efficiency of the operating forces of the Navy and of the Navy shore activities assigned by the secretary.\n\nThe post of CNO was established by act of Congress in 1915 on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War I. Adm. William S. Benson was appointed as the first CNO. During World War II, Adm. Ernest J. King held the dual titles of CNO and commander in chief, U.S. Fleet, directing the worldwide operations of the Navy in coordination with the nation's other armed services and with U.S. allies.\n\nAccording to the official history of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), combat operations during World War II revealed the need for a formal joint-command structure, and the wartime JCS arrangement offered a workable model. The first legislative step was the passage of the National Security Act of 1947, which formally established the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It laid the foundation for the series of legislative and executive changes that produced today's U.S. defense organization.\n\nAs a member of the Joint Chiefs, the CNO is the principal naval advisor to the president and to the secretary of defense on the conduct of war, and the principal advisor and naval executive to the secretary of the Navy on the conduct of the activities of the Department of the Navy. The CNO's assistants include the vice chief of naval operations (VCNO), the deputy chiefs of naval operations (DCNOs), and a number of other ranking officers.\n\nThese officers and their staffs are assigned to what is called the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV). The CNO's responsibilities as a member of the JCS take precedence over all of his other assigned duties.\n\nEarly in his assignment, Clark reorganized OPNAV to improve the Navy's ability to define and achieve warfighting requirements and to establish stronger advocacy for fleet readiness at the Navy's highest policy levels. His staff realignments separated staff responsibilities for resources and requirements in an effort to generate more rigor in the Navy's budgeting process. In August 2001, Clark directed that the commander in chief of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet would serve concurrently as commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command, with responsibility for the overall coordination, establishment, and implementation of integrated requirements and policies for manning, equipping, and training both Atlantic and Pacific Fleet units during their interdeployment training cycles.\n\nSince he assumed office, Clark has placed special emphasis on improving the current readiness of deployed and nondeployed naval forces and continuing the acquisition of new long-range, highly accurate, and all-weather weapons systems. These efforts paid rich dividends during combat operations in Afghanistan during 2001. The Navy also continues to expand its ability to use networked information systems to share information instantaneously over broad geographic areas. This transformation to network-centric warfare centers on knowledge superiority and battlespace dominance.\n\nClark has set five top priorities to guide the Navy's future: (1) manpower; (2) current readiness; (3) future readiness, including the Navy's ongoing transformation; (4) quality of service for Sailors and their families; and (5) organizational and message alignment to ensure that the Navy's actions match what its leaders are saying.\n\nCommandant of the Marine Corps\n\nJust as the CNO \"wears two hats\"--as both a service chief and a member of the JCS--Gen. James L. Jones, the 32nd commandant of the Marine Corps, offers advice to the president, the secretary of defense, and the National Security Council as a member of the Joint Chiefs. Jones also serves as the senior officer in the Marine Corps with responsibilities to the secretary of the Navy for the leadership, management, and administration of the Corps, as well as the operating efficiency of Marine Corps forces and shore activities.\n\nThe commandant's position dates to November 1775, when the Second Continental Congress, meeting in Philadelphia, passed a resolution affirming that \"two Battalions of Marines be raised\" for service as landing forces with the Continental Navy. That resolution officially established the Continental Marines and marks the birth date of the Corps. The nation's first Marines distinguished themselves in a number of important operations, including the Corps' first amphibious raid--in the Bahamas in March 1776, under the command of Capt. (later Maj.) Samuel Nicholas. Nicholas, who was the first commissioned officer in the Continental Marines, remained the senior Marine officer throughout the American Revolution. He is considered to be the first Marine commandant.\n\nWhile serving as commandant, Jones has taken steps to ensure the Corps' operating forces are properly manned, equipped, and combat-ready. He emphasized to Congress that all Marines and their families deserve a decent quality of life. He led the Corps' ongoing evolution of its warfighting capability through the continuous development of new tactics, doctrine, and equipment. The Marine Corps is poised to benefit from the fruition of a comprehensive modernization program during the next six years, but Jones has stressed that the Corps' ability to capitalize on the opportunities before it is contingent upon an appropriate level of investment.\n\nNavy Operating Forces\n\nThe Navy's operating forces (\"the fleet\") are composed of ships and aircraft assigned to the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific Fleets, U.S. Naval Forces Europe, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, and the Military Sealift Command. Additional operating units fall under the command of the chief of naval reserve, the Naval Special Warfare Command, and Operational Test and Evaluation forces.\n\nThe Navy's primary operational commanders have a dual chain of command. Administratively, they report to the CNO and provide, train, and equip naval forces. Operationally, they provide naval forces and report to the appropriate regional unified commanders in chief (\"the CINCs\") for U.S. combatant commands. As units of the Navy enter the geographical area of responsibility (AOR) of a unified command, they are operationally assigned (or \"chopped\") to the appropriate numbered Navy fleet.\n\nAll Navy units also report to their appropriate type commanders (air, surface, or submarine) for administrative purposes.\n\nU.S. Atlantic Fleet\n\nThe U.S. Atlantic Fleet provides fully trained combat-ready forces to support U.S. and NATO commanders in regions of conflict throughout the world. From the Western Atlantic Ocean to the Persian Gulf, Atlantic Fleet units respond to National Command Authority tasking and are prepared to defeat any adversary on or from the sea. Recent conflicts involving Atlantic Fleet units include Operation Allied Force in the Adriatic Sea and Operation Desert Fox in the Persian Gulf.\n\nDuring 2001, Atlantic Fleet units assigned to the U.S. Fifth Fleet provided critical support to combat forces during Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\nThe Atlantic Fleet, currently led by Adm. Robert J. Natter, consists of more than 108,820 Sailors and Marines, 181 ships (including Military Sealift Command), and 1,226 aircraft. Also under Natter's jurisdiction are 37 major shore stations providing training, maintenance, and logistics support, as well as assistance to Navy and Marine Corps families.\n\nThe Atlantic Fleet's AOR covers a massive geographic expanse that includes the area encompassing the Atlantic Ocean from the North Pole to the South Pole, the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Pacific Ocean waters from Central and South America to the Galapagos Islands. The Norwegian, Greenland, and Barents Seas, and the waters around Africa extending to the Cape of Good Hope, also fall within the Atlantic Fleet's AOR.\n\nThe primary operational command in the Atlantic Fleet is the U.S. Second Fleet. It is responsible for operational tasking as well as for training carrier battle groups and amphibious ready groups for forward deployments overseas. Atlantic Fleet forces are supported by type commanders (TYCOMs) responsible for readiness support, logistics support, and administrative management. The type commanders include air, surface, submarine, and Marine forces for the Atlantic Fleet. All are headquartered in Norfolk, Va.\n\nWhile providing combat-ready forces to theater unified commanders in the world's hotspots is a primary responsibility, the Atlantic Fleet also joins NATO forces in supporting the Standing Naval Forces Atlantic, a permanent squadron of destroyers and frigates representing the alliance's forces in the Atlantic region. Additionally, Atlantic Fleet units participate in the annual UNITAS deployment to South America. This yearly deployment not only creates unique training opportunities with South American navies, but also spreads goodwill to the South American allies of the United States.\n\nThe Atlantic Fleet has more efficiently organized its shore-infrastructure management through three regional commanders in New London, Conn., Norfolk, Va., and Jacksonville, Fla.\n\nU.S. Naval Forces Europe\n\nThe commander in chief, U.S. Naval Forces Europe (CINCUSNAVEUR), Adm. Gregory G. Johnson, provides overall command and operational control of all U.S. naval forces assigned to the U.S. European Command (USEUCOM). From his headquarters in London, Ellis coordinates his forces with other U.S. and allied forces operating within the European Command's AOR to carry out the command's assigned missions.\n\nIn addition, as a naval component commander, CINCUSNAVEUR develops operational plans and policy and coordinates logistics, communications, legal, and administrative support among naval forces operating in the USEUCOM AOR--which encompasses Europe and its contiguous waters, the Mediterranean Sea, and the continent of Africa. Johnson also is \"double hatted\" as the commander in chief of NATO's southern region, headquartered in Naples, Italy.\n\nGiven the broad geographical focus on multiple regions of vital interest to the United States, NAVEUR forces often take center stage during international crises and contingencies. Navy and Marine Corps forward-deployed ships, aircraft, and ground units figured significantly in the NATO maritime-interdiction and \"no-fly\" enforcement operations in Bosnia, and the command's naval aviation forces continue to do so over northern Iraq.\n\nThe command's other missions include counterterrorist strikes, humanitarian assistance, and noncombatant-emergency evacuations of U.S. citizens and third-country foreign nationals from strife-torn nations in the region. American diplomatic objectives are advanced steadily by port calls aimed at furthering the U.S. engagement strategy throughout the command's AOR, including visits and exercises with the new democracies in the Baltic and Black Sea regions.\n\nCINCUSNAVEUR headquarters is adjacent to the American Embassy in an unobtrusive red-brick building in London at No. 20 Grosvenor Square. A plaque in the headquarters building commemorates Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower's periodic use of the facility during his command of allied forces in Europe during World War II.\n\nCINCUSNAVEUR's principal operating forces are composed of the ships and aircraft of the U.S. Sixth Fleet operating in the Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea, and adjacent areas. Divided into task forces, U.S. naval forces forward-deployed to the Sixth Fleet usually include an aircraft carrier battle group, an amphibious ready group, a Marine expeditionary unit, and various support ships, as well as land-based patrol aircraft and nuclear-powered submarines.\n\nU.S. Sixth Fleet participation in NATO operations and exercises is a key element of U.S. support to the alliance. Following the breakup of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact during the early 1990s, the fleet developed a systematic approach to forward-presence operations that matched Europe's changing security environment. Today, this \"Theater Naval Strategy of Forward Presence, Peacetime Engagement, and Power Projection\" includes exercises and operations promoting interoperability and mutual cooperation among Mediterranean and Black Sea littoral nations.\n\nUnchanged in this post-Cold War period is the fleet's commitment to NATO, combat readiness, and the capability to respond to crisis situations, including the war on international terrorism. In recent years, the Sixth Fleet participated in combat operations against the Former Republic of Yugoslavia during NATO's Operation Allied Force; conducted humanitarian and security missions in conjunction with NATO peacekeeping operations in Kosovo since 1999; and evacuated U.S. and other civilians caught in Liberia's civil war (Operation Assured Response) and in strife-torn Albania (Operation Silver Wake) in 1999.\n\nIn September 1995, U.S. naval forces operating in the Adriatic conducted sustained air operations and the first-ever launch of cruise missiles from the Mediterranean. These operations (Operation Deliberate Force) helped bring warring parties from Bosnia-Herzegovina to the peace table. An extensive series of bilateral and multilateral exercises, ranging in location from the Black Sea to the western Mediterranean, will typically round out Sixth Fleet operations.\n\nU.S. Pacific Fleet\n\nAdm. Thomas B. Fargo, commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, commands naval forces in a geographic AOR covering more than 50 percent of the earth's surface--just over 100 million square miles. Each day, Pacific Fleet ships are at sea in the Pacific, Indian, and Arctic Oceans, from the West Coast of the United States to the Arabian Gulf. The Pacific Fleet is the world's largest naval command, extending from the West Coast of the United States to the eastern shoreline of Africa, and from the North Pole to the South Pole--an area home to more than half the population of the world.\n\nThe Pacific Fleet, with its U.S. Third and U.S. Seventh Fleets, numbers 191 ships, 1,434 aircraft, and 225,587 Sailors, Marines, and Navy Department civilian employees. Together they keep the sea lanes open, deter aggression, ensure regional stability, and support humanitarian-relief activities--providing a stabilizing influence in a vast ocean area during periods of tension and conflict.\n\nThe Pacific Fleet's contribution to the Navy's heritage dates back to 1821 and the establishment that year of the Pacific Squadron, the first permanent U.S. naval presence in the region. This small force initially confined its activities to the waters off South America, but expanded its scope to include the Western Pacific in 1835, when the East India Squadron joined the force.\n\nFrom its headquarters at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, today's U.S. Pacific Fleet has increased operations with friendly and allied navies, thereby ensuring freedom of the seas for all nations. The Pacific Fleet's AOR also includes the Indian Ocean, where aircraft carrier battle groups and amphibious ready groups operate in support of U.S. national interests. U.S. Pacific Fleet Navy and Marine Corps assets are regularly assigned to the operational control of U.S. Naval Forces Central Command and the U.S. Fifth Fleet for deployments to the Persian Gulf and North Arabian Sea. There, these forces play a critical role in enforcing U.S. and U.N. policy for Iraq, including maritime interdiction and enforcement of \"no-fly\" operations. Pacific Fleet units were engaged in numerous reactionary combat strikes against Iraq during 1999 and 2000.\n\nPacific Fleet units operating with the U.S. Fifth Fleet also conducted critical combat operations during Operation Enduring Freedom and provided continued capabilities to the U.S. Seventh Fleet in the Western Pacific, bolstering U.S. forward presence throughout the region in peace, crisis, and war. Pacific Fleet ships, aircraft, and communication units provided critical support to the Australian-led U.N. peacekeeping effort in East Timor during 1999. Reciprocal port visits have proved to be an effective way to enhance military-to-military understanding and relations. The U.S. Pacific Command's commander in chief, Adm. Dennis C. Blair, describes the goal of these contacts as increased mutual understanding and openness.\n\nPeople are the key to the success of the Pacific Fleet. Every minute of each day, dedicated men and women are deployed and on watch protecting U.S. interests and promoting stability, peace, and prosperity throughout the region.\n\nU.S. Naval Forces Central Command\n\nVice Adm. Charles W. Moore Jr., commander, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command (COMUSNAVCENT), serves as both the naval component commander for the U.S. Central Command and as commander of the U.S. Fifth Fleet (COMFIFTHFLT). From his headquarters in Bahrain, Moore is responsible to the commander in chief, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), for the conduct of naval operations in the CENTCOM AOR and to the CNO for training and equipping his assigned U.S. Navy forces. In addition, COMUSNAVCENT is the Maritime Interception Force coordinator for the enforcement of U.N. sanctions against Iraq.\n\nNAVCENT's naval activities during 2001 were highlighted by intensive combat operations in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom. The United States assembled its largest armada in the region since the Gulf War 10 years ago.\n\nNAVCENT's AOR reaches from the Horn of Africa through the Arabian Gulf and into Central Asia, and includes 25 nations representing diverse political, economic, and cultural elements in an area encompassing 7.5 million square miles, four major bodies of water, and three strategic choke points (through which pass 70 percent of the world's oil production), making it one of the world's most important but potentially volatile regions.\n\nCOMUSNAVCENT seeks to promote peace and stability in the region by: (1) ensuring regional choke points remain open; (2) serving as a primary contingency force for CENTCOM to be able to respond to national and transnational threats; (3) supporting Operation Southern Watch's enforcement of the southern no-fly zone over Iraq; (4) conducting maritime- interception operations in support of U.N. resolutions; (5) engaging regional allies; and (6) protecting U.S. forces in the region.\n\nAs a numbered fleet commander, Moore exercises overall command and control of his assigned forces including carrier battle groups, an amphibious ready group with an embarked Marine Expeditionary Unit, surface combatants, submarines, maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft, and logistics ships. The U.S. Fifth Fleet maintains a highly visible presence in support of the overall U.S. National Security Strategy.\n\nThe U.S. Navy's continuous presence in this region of vital interest to the United States has lasted more than 50 years. Forward-deployed forces operate freely in international waters with the inherent capability to conduct, when necessary, operations to support U.S. national interests. Operation Enduring Freedom, the so-called \"Tanker War,\" Operations Desert Shield, Desert Storm, and Desert Fox, and counterterrorism strikes against Sudan and Afghanistan demonstrated the freedom of operation that naval forces enjoy while operating in the Central Command's AOR. The mobility, strike, and force-protection capability of NAVCENT's naval forces provide a \"full-spectrum\" force capable of simultaneously engaging U.S. regional partners, deterring aggression, and, if necessary, fighting and winning a major theater war.\n\nMilitary Sealift Command\n\nThe U.S. Navy's Military Sealift Command (MSC), commanded by Rear Adm. David L. Brewer III, provides ocean transportation of equipment, fuel, supplies, and ammunition to sustain U.S. military forces worldwide. The command's 125 civilian-crewed noncombatant ships operate in nearly every time zone of the world and are key to the U.S. military's success in projecting a powerful global presence \"Forward ... >From The Sea.\"\n\nSealift is MSC's primary mission. In wartime, more than 95 percent of the equipment and supplies needed by forward-deployed U.S. forces moves by sea. In addition, MSC provides combat-logistics support to the U.S. Navy's numbered fleets, special ocean-missions support to U.S. government agencies, and afloat prepositioning of U.S. military supplies and equipment in strategic areas overseas.\n\nMSC is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and has area commands in Norfolk, Va.; San Diego, Calif.; Naples, Italy; Yokohama, Japan; and Bahrain. Its work force consists of approximately 7,500 employees worldwide, the vast majority of whom are assigned to seagoing billets. MSC's work force is made up primarily of civil service personnel, but also includes military as well as contractor personnel. Some ships also have small military contingents assigned to carry out specialized military functions such as communications and supply operations.\n\nIn wartime, the number of contractor-employed mariners can expand to double the peacetime number, and more than 800 MSC reservists can be mobilized.\n\nMSC is one of three component commands reporting to the joint- service U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), which is headquartered at Scott Air Force Base, Ill. USTRANSCOM is under the command of a four-star general officer who is responsible for the coordination of all common-user DOD air, land, and sea transportation worldwide.\n\nThe men and women of MSC played a critical role during Operation Enduring Freedom in 2001. Regular underway replenishment enabled ships of the U.S. Fifth Fleet to remain at sea for months on end to conduct sustained combat operations.\n\nA number of other international crises throughout the last decade have underscored the critical role played by MSC in the execution of U.S. national strategy. During the Persian Gulf War, for example, more than 230 ships, both U.S. government-owned and chartered commercial vessels, transported more than 12 million tons of combat equipment and supplies--the largest part of the allied arsenal that defeated Iraqi aggression.\n\nIn the years following the Persian Gulf War, MSC has seen a proliferation of requests for its sea-transportation services--ranging from support of U.S. and allied peacekeeping forces in Bosnia and Kosovo to an array of other humanitarian and disaster-relief efforts. MSC's role in combat-logistics support to the U.S. Navy fleet also has grown. A sealift-expansion program that started in the late 1990s will add 19 new and converted ships to MSC's inventory by the end of 2002. MSC's impressive ocean-transportation re-sources will remain key elements in U.S. combat readiness in the 21st century.\n\nThe Shore Establishment\n\nThe shore establishment is the third major component of the Navy's organizational structure. The shore establishment's activities and commands report to the CNO. They support the fleet through such varied activities and functions as the repair of ships, aircraft, weapons, machinery, and electronics; communications; the recruitment, training, and education of naval personnel; legal services; intelligence, meteorological, and oceanographic support; the development of naval doctrine; storage and supply support for repair parts, fuel, and munitions; and medical and dental care for active-duty personnel, retirees, and their families.\n\nRecruiting and retaining the highest-quality Sailors, both enlisted and officer, remain the highest priorities for the Bureau of Naval Personnel (BUPERS). Vice Adm. Norbert R. Ryan Jr. leads the Bureau, serving as both chief of naval personnel and deputy CNO (manpower and personnel).\n\nThe BUPERS team--located in Washington, D.C., and Millington, Tenn. --oversees Navy recruiting, assignment policies and programs, and the enlisted advancement and officer promotion processes as well as personnel pay, bonus, and retention policies. BUPERS' principal goal is to provide well-prepared Sailors to the fleet, in the proper numbers, on time, and in the most cost-effective manner possible.\n\nSimilarly, the chief of naval education and training (CNET), Vice Adm. Alfred G. Harms Jr., is responsible to the CNO for the education and training of Navy and Marine Corps personnel, both officer and enlisted. CNET oversees a network of training and education programs throughout the United States and on ships at sea. One of the largest shore commands in the Navy, CNET is composed of approximately 22,000 military, civilian, and contract personnel stationed at 167 activities nationwide. CNET has a daily average of more than 48,000 military, civilian, and foreign students in training in more than 3,600 different courses at 30 installations on any given day.\n\nCNET also supervises and manages 57 Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) units at colleges and universities throughout the United States and 490 Naval Junior ROTC units at civilian high schools in 43 states, Washington, D.C., Guam, Italy, and Japan.\n\nAs a key contributor to naval readiness, CNET's training responsibilities include recruit training, specialized skills training, precommissioning training for officers, warfare-specialty training, and fleet individual and team training. CNET also trains students from foreign nations in various enlisted skills and provides officer flight training for a number of U.S. allies.\n\nNavy Medicine\n\nThe 34th surgeon general of the Navy Medical Corps, Vice Adm. Michael L. Cowan, leads a team focused on providing high-quality health care and customer service to more than 553,000 active-duty Navy and Marine Corps personnel and an additional 2.6 million retired and family members--at a little more than half the national per-capita average cost for medical care. Navy health-care professionals also provide medical support during contingency, humanitarian, and joint operations around the world--most recently during the Operation Enduring Freedom missions in Afghanistan.\n\nNavy medicine is focused on the following key goals: (1) service to the fleet--managing the health of Sailors and Marines and delivering effective casualty support to sustain high levels of readiness; (2) managing health, not illness--shifting from a mindset of providing care in response to a medical problem to one of focusing on the whole patient's wellness and managed health care; (3) effective implementation of the TRICARE program; (4) embracing best-business practices; and (5) enhancing data integrity to measure accomplishments and successes.\n\nThe central concept of providing health-care programs that protect U.S. fighting forces is called Force Health Protection (FHP). It is a focused and integrated approach to protect and sustain the service's most important resource--its service members. It is designed to improve existing health, proactively address medical concerns, and provide care for any illness or injury that does occur. FHP changes the focus of military medicine from one of casualty care alone to an emphasis on fitness and monitoring forces engaged in military operations. It thrusts preventive medicine to the forefront of ensuring readiness for deployment. It captures the culture shift that is taking place throughout Navy medicine--a shift from episodic responsive care to a fit, healthy lifestyle that results in a ready, capable individual.\n\nMedical care at U.S. Navy facilities continues to improve. In recent years, average objective accreditation scores for Navy hospitals were in the 90th percentile--significantly exceeding the average scores for civilian hospitals. Navy medicine continues to find innovative ways to provide convenient and cost-effective medical and dental care to service members. Pier side clinics, deployments of health-care practitioners with the operating forces, and new programs at recruit training activities all save valuable time and help to keep U.S. Sailors and Marines in good health.\n\nNavy medicine is applying new technology to deliver specialty consultation in remote areas and to improve the ability to provide quality health care to forward-deployed operating forces and at remote medical-treatment facilities. Navy medicine continues to search for new research breakthroughs, such as the scientific discoveries in DNA vaccines for malaria, that will result in healthier lives.\n\nThe Systems Commands\n\nThe Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), commanded by Vice Adm. George P. Nanos Jr., is the Navy's central activity for designing, engineering, integrating, building, and procuring U.S. naval ships, shipboard weapons, and combat systems. Its expertise in these areas historically stems from the Bureau of Construction, Equipment, and Repair and the Bureau of Ordnance and Hydrography, created in 1842, and the Bureau of Ships, which was established in 1940. NAVSEA's responsibilities also include the maintenance, repair, modernization, and conversion of in-service ships and their weapons and combat systems. Additionally, it provides technical, industrial, and logistics support for naval ships and ensures the proper design and development of the total ship, including contractor-furnished shipboard systems.\n\nNAVSEA prides itself on \"keeping America's Navy #1 in the world.\"\n\nOther important NAVSEA functions include introduction of ships to the fleet; the Navy's salvage-and-diving operations; explosive-ordnance safety and disposal; coordination of naval ship conversion and repair for both DOD and the MSC; and support of ship construction for the Maritime Administration.\n\nNAVSEA is the largest of the five Navy systems commands. Accounting for nearly one-fifth of the Navy's budget (approximately $20 billion), NAVSEA manages more than 130 acquisition programs, which are assigned to six affiliated Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and various headquarters elements. The nearly 50,000 NAVSEA team members serve the fleet in four shipyards, the undersea and surface warfare centers, nine supervisors at major shipbuilding locations, and NAVSEA headquarters, currently located at the Washington Navy Yard, in Washington, D.C.\n\nNAVSEA also administers more than 1,400 Foreign Military Sales transactions worth about $16.7 billion and involving 80 countries and four NATO organizations.\n\nThe Naval Aviation Systems Command (NAVAIR) team, led by Vice Adm. Joseph W. Dyer, partners with industry to develop, acquire, and support naval aeronautical and related technology systems for the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. NAVAIR is composed of six elements working as a fully coordinated team: the Naval Air Systems Command, the Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP), and four naval aviation PEOs. The latter are responsible for the acquisition and full life-cycle management of most of the aircraft and weapons used by the fleet.\n\nNAVAIR (headquarters, product centers, and naval aviation depots) oversees all weapons programs not managed by the PEOs and provides all of the functional support that the PEOs and their program management teams require--including acquisition management, contracting, research and engineering, test and evaluation, logistics, industrial support, corporate operations, and shore-station management.\n\nThe NAVICP is responsible for providing spare and repair parts throughout the life cycles of all naval weapons systems. Although it retains its core capabilities in-house, the NAVAIR team executes most of its work (nearly 80 percent) by contracting with private industry.\n\nApproximately 31,600 civilian and military personnel are assigned to NAVAIR, its four affiliated PEOs, and facilities at eight major sites throughout the United States. NAVAIR manages more than 148 acquisition programs and supports more than 4,000 active aircraft in the Navy and Marine Corps inventory.\n\nSPAWAR has additional responsibilities to provide management-information systems, infrastructure, and communications applications for Navy force-wide combat-support systems. These systems allow commanders to integrate tactical information with key combat support logistics data in both joint and coalition-warfare environments. SPAWAR also develops systems to ensure that the U.S. national-security, DOD, and Navy leadership receives accurate, reliable, secure, and timely information. High-bandwidth communications between afloat and ashore platforms in near real time is essential to success in combat.\n\nThe SPAWAR team also develops and fields high-capacity interoperable systems that are affordable, integrated, flexible, and seamless in the joint- and coalition-warfare environments. The SPAWAR mission also includes developing and acquiring undersea-surveillance systems, global weather and oceanographic-forecasting systems, and navigational systems.\n\nThe primary mission of the Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) is to provide U.S. naval forces with quality supplies and services--at the right place, the right time, and the right price. The command's vision for the 21st century is that a single request by the customer will activate a global network of sources and solutions that delivers best-value products and services--in short, One-Touch Supply.\n\nThe Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC), commanded by Rear Adm. Michael R. Johnson, manages the planning, design, and construction of facilities for U.S. Navy activities around the world. NAVFAC provides technical, engineering, and program-management support for public works, family housing, and public utilities for the Department of the Navy. It also acquires and disposes of the Department of the Navy's real estate, and is the program manager for Navy bachelor housing.\n\nNAVFAC provides technical, engineering, and program-management support to expedite the realignment and closure of naval bases. NAVFAC also manages all of the Navy Department's shoreside environmental projects and programs. Through its Engineering Field Divisions, Engineering Field Activities, and the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center, NAVFAC provides the technical expertise needed to support the Navy's environmental initiatives and to interface with numerous legislative and regulatory agencies. It also manages a natural-resource program to enhance the environmental qualities of its land, forests, and wildlife.\n\nNAVFAC's tasks are accomplished through the command's global field activities of Engineering Field Divisions, Engineering Field Activities, the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center, the Seabee Logistics Center, and the Navy Crane Center. NAVFAC's annual volume of business is in excess of $8 billion. The Naval Construction Battalion Center provides a structured approach to global management of Naval Construction Force assets and focuses on improving warfighting readiness. \"Seabees\" deployed to Afghanistan in 2001 to construct facilities for forward-deployed U.S. Marines during Operation Enduring Freedom. NAVFAC and its subordinate commands around the world employ about 16,000 civilian and military personnel. *\n\nCombatant Command Of U.S. Military Forces\n\nBy presidential directive, U.S. combatant commanders communicate to the secretary of defense and president through the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The term combatant command means a unified or specified command. Each is led by a designated commander in chief who exercises day-to-day operational command of U.S. forces in a defined area of responsibility (AOR).\n\nUnified combatant commands were first described by statute in the National Security Act of 1947. The U.S. unified commands have broad continuing missions and are composed of forces from two or more services. They are established and so designated by the president through the secretary of defense, with the advice and assistance of the JCS chairman.\n\nIn accordance with the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense (DOD) Reorganization Act of 1986, Congress clarified the command line for combatant commanders to preserve civilian control of the military. The Act states that the operational chain of command runs from the president to the secretary of defense to the combatant commanders. The Act permits the president to direct that communications to the nation's armed forces pass through the JCS chairman, and gives the secretary of defense wide latitude to assign oversight responsibilities to the chairman for the activities of the combatant commanders.\n\nThe Goldwater-Nichols Act requires that forces under the jurisdiction of the military departments be assigned to the combatant commands, with the exception of forces assigned to perform the missions of the military departments (e.g., to recruit, supply, equip, and maintain forces).\n\nForces within a CINC's geographic AOR fall under the unified command of the combatant commander except as otherwise directed by the secretary of defense. The unified command structure is flexible, and changes are made as required to accommodate evolving U.S. national-security needs. A classified document, the Unified Command Plan, establishes the combatant commands, identifies geographic areas of responsibility, assigns primary tasks, defines the authority of the commanders, establishes command relationships, and provides guidance on the exercise of combatant command.\n\nFive joint combatant commanders have operational responsibilities within the geographic areas designated by the Unified Command Plan: U.S. Joint Forces Command (established in October 1999 with the redesignation of the U.S. Atlantic Command), U.S. Central Command, U.S. European Command, U.S. Pacific Command, and U.S. Southern Command.\n\nThe CINCs of the remaining combatant commands have worldwide functional responsibilities not bounded by any single geographic area of operations; they are: U.S. Space Command, U.S. Special Operations Command, U.S. Strategic Command, and U.S. Transportation Command.\n\nNaval War College\n\nOn 6 October 1884, Secretary of the Navy William E. Chandler signed General Order 325, which began simply by stating: \"A college is hereby established for an advanced course of professional study for naval officers, to be known as the Naval War College.\" The order went on to assign Commodore Stephen B. Luce to duty as president of the College, which is located on Coaster's Harbor Island, Newport, R.I. Such were the humble beginnings of what is now the oldest continuing institution of its kind in the world.\n\nNow in its second century of service, the Naval War College continues to prepare its students not only for their next assignments, but also for the remainder of their careers. Under the leadership of the College's president, Rear Adm. Rodney P. Rempt, students are provided with professional military educations based on intellectual flexibility--which flows from a clear understanding of the fundamental principles that have governed national-security affairs in peace and in war throughout history.\n\nMcCarty Little Hall, the War College's first major addition to the campus since the early 1970s, will be the Navy's premier wargaming facility for years to come. As a strategic U.S. maritime-research center, it will house the front line of strategic research, decision support, and gaming as the Navy prepares its leaders for the future. The $19 million research center is a three-story structure encompassing approximately 103,000 square feet of floor space.\n\nAcademically, the War College's faculty is divided into three teaching departments--Strategy and Policy, National Security Decision Making, and Joint Military Operations--under a dean of academics, who also directs the interdepartmental electives program. The school's research activities are drawn together in the Center for Naval Warfare Studies. The student body is subdivided into four resident colleges and one nonresident college:\n\nCollege of Naval Warfare: Senior-level resident school attended by senior-grade officers from all five U.S. military services and civilians from a number of U.S. government agencies.\n\nCollege of Naval Command and Staff: Intermediate-level resident school attended by mid-grade officers from all five U.S. services and civilians from a number of U.S. government agencies.\n\nNaval Command College: Senior-level resident international school attended by senior-grade naval officers from up to 35 nations annually.\n\nNaval Staff College: Intermediate-level resident international school attended by mid-grade naval officers from some 25 nations in each of two classes per year.\n\nCollege of Continuing Education: An intermediate-level nonresident school intended to extend the Naval War College program to U.S. naval\/military officers and eligible DOD civilian employees who are unable to attend resident courses.\n\nThe Naval War College currently offers courses of study leading to a diploma from each of its five colleges. The College is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges to award a Master of Arts degree in national security and strategic studies. The Naval War College is the only senior-service college in the United States authorized and accredited to confer a graduate degree for a one-year course of instruction.\n\nIn addition, U.S. military officers graduating from the Colleges of Naval Warfare and Naval Command and Staff are considered to have completed the first phase of requirements for the Joint Professional Military Education Program, as set forth by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nAdditional information on the Naval War College may be obtained at its homepage: \n\nType Commands\n\nAll U.S. Navy ships of the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific Fleets are organized into categories by type. Aircraft carriers, aircraft squadrons, and air stations are under the administrative control of the appropriate Naval Air Force commander. Submarines fall under the respective Atlantic or Pacific Fleet's Submarine Force commander. All other ships fall under each fleet's Naval Surface Force commander. Marine Corps units assigned to each fleet also report administratively to their respective Fleet Marine Force commanders.\n\nThe U.S. Atlantic and Pacific Fleet type commands mirror one another in their administrative, training, and support functions. Normally, the type command controls a Navy ship during its primary and intermediate training cycles; the ship shifts to the operational control of a numbered fleet commander during deployments. As an example, the commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet (COMSUBPAC), is the principal advisor to CINCPACFLT for submarine matters. Ships assigned to SUBPAC include attack, ballistic-missile, and auxiliary submarines, as well as submarine tenders, floating submarine dry docks, deep submergence vehicles, and a number of submarine-rescue vehicles deployed throughout the Pacific AOR.\n\nWhen the chief of naval operations established the Fleet Forces Command (FFC) in 2001, lead type commanders were established within each warfare community. Commanders of Naval Surface Forces Pacific, Naval Air Forces Pacific, and Submarine Forces Atlantic have assumed added duties as \"Fleet TYCOMs,\" and are known as commander Naval Surface Forces (COMNAVSURFOR), commander Naval Air Forces (COMNAVAIRFOR), and commander Naval Submarine Forces (COMNAVSUBFOR).\n\nFleet TYCOMs lead their warfare communities and advise FFC of critical issues pertaining to force modernization needs, training initiatives, and the development of operational doctrine and concepts.\n\nU.S. Naval Academy\n\nThe U.S. Naval Academy, founded in 1845, is the undergraduate college of the Navy. Its beautiful and modern buildings and facilities along the Severn River in Annapolis, Md., are designed to meet the academic, athletic, and extracurricular needs of the future officer corps of the Navy. Approximately 1,200 men and women enter the Naval Academy each year. About three fourths of all midshipmen complete the academically demanding curriculum, and upon graduation are commissioned as officers in the Navy or Marine Corps. Vice Adm. John R. Ryan currently serves as the Academy's superintendent.\n\nDegrees and Majors: Midshipmen may major in any of 19 principal fields of study: eight in engineering, seven in science and mathematics, and four in the humanities, all leading to a Bachelor of Science degree. All midshipmen also must complete a core curriculum designed to give future naval officers a solid foundation in leadership and character development, naval science, and the humanities.\n\nCosts: Tuition, room, and board expenses are borne by the government. Graduates assume an obligation of five years of active service when they are commissioned. Midshipmen are paid a stipend of $600 per month to cover the cost of uniforms, books, equipment, and personal needs.\n\nAdmission Criteria: Candidates must be U.S. citizens, single (without children and not pregnant), and at least 17, and cannot have reached the age of 23 on 1 July of their year of admission to the Academy. They also must be officially nominated, meet the Academy's academic, medical, and physical requirements, and be found to be of good moral character.

{"text":"The history of shipping is a glorious and proud one. There is no doubt, for example, that the magnificent square riggers of the era of sail or the early 20th century's prestigious ocean liners could stir the hearts of all those that beheld them. But the ships of today are just as worthy of our admiration, for shipping today is in another truly golden age. Ships have never been so technically advanced, never been as sophisticated, never been more immense, never carried so much cargo, never been safer and never been so environmentally-friendly as they are today.\nSee More...\n\nTelecommunication\n\nInformation and communication technology issues are a global concern. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the UN agency based in Switzerland, is responsible for connecting the world. It has organized the shared global use of the radio spectrum; promoted international cooperation in assigning satellite orbits; worked to improve telecommunication infrastructure in the developing world; established the worldwide standards that foster seamless interconnection of a vast range of communications systems and addressed the global challenges of our times, such as mitigating climate change and strengthening cybersecurity the ITU has a role to play.\n\nA.P. Moeller-Maersk A\/S, owner of the world's largest container shipper, said cargo volumes may drop more than 10 percent this year and show no growth in 2010 as the industry suffers a \"completely unprecedented\" decline.

The market has expanded by more than 10 percent most years since containerization went global in the 1970s."}
{"text":"Until World War II, the Indian Ocean had been a British \"lake\". It was ringed by significant British and Commonwealth possessions and much of the strategic supplies needed in peace and war had to pass across it: Persian oil, Malayan rubber, Indian tea, Australian and New Zealand foodstuffs. Britain also utilised Australian and New Zealand manpower; hence, safe passage for British cargo ships was critical.[2]\n\nThis became reality when an overwhelming Japanese naval force operated in the eastern Indian Ocean, sinking an aircraft carrier, other warships and disrupting freight traffic along the Indian east coast. At this stage, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, General Sir Alan Brooke wrote:[4]\n\nWe were hanging by our eyelids! Australia and India were threatened by the Japanese, we had temporarily lost control of the Indian Ocean, the Germans were threatening Iran and our oil, Auchinleck was in precarious straits in the desert, and the submarine sinkings were heavy.\n\nUntil 1941, the main threat to British interests in the region was the presence of German commerce raiders (auxiliary cruisers) and submarines. The fleet had trade protection as its first priority and was required to escort convoys and eliminate the raiders. The Germans had converted merchant ships to act as commerce raiders and allocated supply ships to maintain them. The location and destruction of these German raiders consumed much British naval effort until the last raider - Michel - was sunk in October 1943.[5]\n\nThe Italian naval forces in East Africa were caught in a vice. To put to sea invited heavy British reaction, while to stay in ports threatened by British and Commonwealth forces became impossible. In 1941, during the East African Campaign, these ports were captured by the British.[7]\n\nBefore the fall of Singapore, the Eastern Fleet's naval base at Singapore (HMNB Singapore) was part of the British Far East Command. British Far East defence planning was based on two assumptions. The first assumption was that the United States would remain as an effective ally in the western Pacific Ocean, with a fleet based at Singapore, and that the Philippines would be available as a forward base for British warships.[8] Secondly, it was assumed that the technical capabilities and aggression of the Imperial Japanese Navy were overestimated. In these circumstances, with the Japanese fleet engaged by the United States Navy (USN), the Admiralty sent the four obsolescent Revenge class battleships to Singapore to provide defensive firepower and a British presence. The British assumptions were destroyed on 7 December 1941: the impact of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor denied substantial USN support to the British defence of the \"Malay barrier\" and made impossible the relief of American garrisons in the Philippines. Furthermore, Japanese capabilities exceeded expectations.[9]\n\nAfter the fall of France in June 1940, Japanese pressure on the Vichy authorities in French Indochina resulted in the granting of base and transit rights, albeit with significant restrictions. Despite this, in September 1940, the Japanese launched an invasion of French Indochina.[10] The bases thus acquired in Indochina allowed extended Japanese air coverage of the invasion forces bound for Malaya and for the Dutch East Indies. In these circumstances, the Prince of Wales and Repulse were vulnerable to concerted air attacks from the Japanese bases in Indochina and, without air cover, they were sunk in December 1941.[11]\n\nWhen Admiral Somerville inspected the base at Trincomalee, its deficiencies were clear to him. He found the port inadequate, vulnerable to a determined attack, and open to spying. An isolated island base with a safe, deep anchorage in a suitably strategic position was required. Addu Atoll met the requirements and it was secretly developed as a fleet anchorage.[13]\n\nThe Eastern Fleet was divided into two: Force A and Force B. Force A consisted of the modernised HMS Warspite and the two available fleet aircraft carriers.[14] Force B was based on the slow Revenge class battleships of the 3rd Battle Squadron, based at the fleet's new operational base at Kilindini near Mombasa in Kenya and relatively safe from the Japanese fleet. Neither individually nor together could the two Eastern Fleet forces challenge a determined Japanese naval assault.\n\nIn May 1942, the Eastern Fleet supported the invasion of Madagascar, Operation Ironclad. This was an operation aimed at thwarting any attempt by Japanese vessels to use naval bases on the Vichy French controlled territory. During the invasion, vessels of the Eastern Fleet were confronted by vessels of the French Navy and submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy.[16]\n\nAfter the departure of the main battle forces during February 1942, the Indian Ocean was left with mostly escort carriers and older battleships as the core of its naval forces. Allied advances in the Mediterranean and northern Europe during 1943 and 1944, however, released naval resources. As a result, more British aircraft carriers entered the area; plus the battlecruiser HMS Renown, battleships Howe, Queen Elizabeth, Valiant and supporting warships. Preparations were put in hand for a more aggressive stance in the Indian Ocean and for British naval participation in the Pacific theatre. Agreement had been reached, after objections from Admiral Ernest King, but new procedures would need to be learnt by naval crews and Fleet Air Arm (FAA) aircrew. To this end, Operation Diplomat, a training exercise, took place in late March, 1944. The objective was for the fleet to rendezvous with a group of tankers (escorted by HNLMS Tromp) and practice refuelling at sea procedures. They then rendezvoused with United States Navy Task Force 58.5, the USS Saratoga and three destroyers.[17]\n\nAdmiral King then requested that, during April, the Eastern Fleet should engage Japanese forces in their area and hold them there to reduce the opposition to an American seaborne assault on Hollandia (now Jayapura) and Aitape on the north coast of Netherlands New Guinea. An airborne attack by the Eastern Fleet (including Task Force 58.5) on Sabang, off Sumatra was executed (Operation Cockpit).[18] Surprise was achieved: military and oil installations were heavily damaged by the attacks, aggravating Japanese fuel shortages. The American involvement was extended to capitalise on the success with a second attack, this time on Surabaya, eastern Java, on 17 May (Operation Transom). The distances for this operation necessitated replenishment at sea. Again, the defenders were unprepared and significant damage was made to port, military and oil infrastructure. After this, on 18 May, Saratoga and her destroyers returned to the Pacific after what Admiral Somerville called \"a profitable and very happy association of Task Group 58.5 with the Eastern Fleet\".[17]\n\nThe Flag Officer Second-in-Command Far East Fleet, for most of the postwar period a Rear Admiral, was based afloat, and tasked with keeping the fleet 'up to the mark operationally,' while the fleet commander, a Vice Admiral, ran the fleet programme and major items of administration 'including all provision for docking and maintenance' from his base in Singapore.[22]\n\nThe Fleet was disbanded in 1971, and on 31 October 1971, the last day of the validity of the Anglo-Malayan Defence Agreement, the last Commander, Far East Fleet, Rear Admiral Anthony Troup, hauled down his flag.[23]"}
{"text":"On August 6th, 1848, the Royal Navy frigate HMS Daedalus was cruising near the Cape of Good Hope when the Officer of Watch spotted an object in the sea. He drew the attention of the Captain and several crew members on deck to it. It was a large sea snake, or sea serpent, that they estimated to be sixty feet long, 15 inches in diameter, and moved through the sea with it's head some four feet out of the water.\n\nStrangely enough it seemed to be able to move quickly through the water with neither vertical or horizontal undulation. The creature was dark brown, shading to yellow-white under the throat. On the back there seemed to be a seaweed-like mane. The Daedalus observed it for about twenty minutes.\n\nIn 1937 Alfred Peterson, a nurse aboard a British troopship in the China Sea, spotted what at first he thought was a big tree floating in the sea.

{"text":"Still, McIntosh was worried. The ship was without power or sails in a hurricane, and he had a feeling the crew was about to go overboard as well. While Myers prepped Svendsen on protocols for abandoning ship, McIntosh radioed the Sector Field Office, which would coordinate the rescue, then called the Elizabeth City base. Helicopter rescue crews were about to embark on one of the most perilous missions of their careers, and he wanted them to know just how serious the situation was. Then he and his team did the only thing they could: they circled overhead, trying to make sense of the feeling that they had somehow flown 200 years into the past.\n\nAs the drama of the Bounty's final hours unfolded on CNN and the Weather Channel, seamen and landlubbers alike were asking the same question: what was a square-rigged ship doing in the middle of a hurricane\u2014a storm that had been forecast for days? Sailors pointed fingers at the captain, Robin Walbridge, insisting that his poor judgment and bravado were to blame. It's true that Walbridge had tempted fate before. In each instance, some combination of skill and luck had returned the ship home safely.\n\nBut the full answer to why the Bounty sank was much more complex than a captain's rash decision. It was a story decades in the making, a veritable opera of near misses and fantastic schemes involving a dogged captain, a fiercely loyal crew, and an owner who was looking to sell. And in the ship's last act, an unlikely new character had emerged: a young woman with Down syndrome who, perhaps inconceivably, held the key to the Bounty's future.\n\nIN SOME WAYS, THE Bounty was lucky to have survived as long as it did. Built in 1960 for the Marlon Brando version of Mutiny on the Bounty, the ship was supposed to be burned for the film's final scene. Hollywood legend has it that Brando threatened to walk off the set if the vessel was destroyed, so MGM sent it on a worldwide tour to promote the film and then moored it in St. Petersburg, Florida, as a dockside attraction offering public tours.\n\nThus began a four-decade struggle to keep the Bounty afloat. Wooden ships are notoriously difficult to maintain, especially those docked in warm water. Planks loosen and warp; fasteners corrode. Topsides splinter in the sun and rain accelerates rot. Long, unshelled clams called teredo worms bore through hulls like termites. Even vessels lovingly hauled out of the water and repaired each year disintegrate in these conditions.\n\nBy the time the Bounty's current owner, Robert Hansen Jr., a sailor and the founder of the Long Island heating and air-conditioning company Islandaire, bought the ship in 2001, it had fallen into disrepair. The ship had been acquired by Ted Turner in 1986 as part of MGM's film library, used in the 1990 Charlton Heston TV movie Treasure Island, and then donated in the early '90s to the town of Fall River, Massachusetts, which planned to use the Bounty to take schoolkids and paying sailing enthusiasts out to sea. But the repairs necessary to obtain Coast Guard classification to carry passengers proved too costly, and the Fall River Chamber of Commerce put the Bounty up for sale for $1.6 million. Hansen bought the ship for an undisclosed sum, but less than the amount owed its creditors, according to reports at the time.\n\nHansen created the HMS Bounty Organization, a limited-liability company based at Islandaire's East Setauket, Long Island, headquarters, and hired Tracie Simonin, the company's staff accountant, as director. He also kept on Walbridge, who'd taken the helm in 1995 at age 46. Walbridge's widow, Claudia McCann, would later describe him as having two great loves, her and the Bounty; he described the ship as \"an extension of myself.\" A St. Petersburg native, he'd worked as a diesel mechanic, a pilot, and a truck driver but found his calling on tall ships like the USS Constitution and the Bill of Rights, where he developed a passion for training at-risk kids and children with disabilities to sail. Walbridge had already taken the Bounty through the Panama Canal and on at least two European voyages. He and Hansen hoped to sail it as far as Tahiti, the original Bounty's last port of call before the famous 1789 mutiny, when mate Fletcher Christian led a small group of sailors against commanding lieutenant William Bligh.\n\nThere was reason to believe they would be successful. The tall-ship renaissance, which began just after the U.S. bicentennial in 1976, had grown into a multimillion-dollar industry, with hundreds of ships in North American waters alone. Most of these operate under the Coast Guard classification of passenger vessel or sailing-school vessel. Whether 19th-century originals or modern replicas, they exist within a byzantine system of rules mandating everything from the number of licensed mariners on board to the placement of life preservers."}

Beginning Tuesday in New Orleans, and continuing through the summer in New York, Norfolk, Baltimore and Boston, tall ships and warships from around the world will parade through American ports.\n\n(Courtesy of Naval History and Heritage Command) - \"United States Frigate Constitution Chased By British Fleet\" was painted by J. Font Mahan in 1841 with oil on copper, as is part of the best of 1812 collection. The Navy is using the bicentennial of the war to reinforce the public's understanding of their division's mission unlike previous commemorations, the Navy wants to reap lasting benefits from the War of 1812 and plans to immerse the public in a flood of information and events, including educational outreach, Web sites, social media, online games, books and museum displays.\n\nPolling for the Navy by Gallup has shown that less than 9 percent of Americans understand its mission. Equally worrisome, the public ranks the Navy ahead of only the Coast Guard in its importance to national defense, and well behind the Army, Marines and Air Force.\n\nThe results have raised alarms within the Navy at a time when the military services face daunting budget cuts.\n\nAlthough it may seem odd to turn to the Age of Sail to prove the Navy's modern relevance, senior Navy officials argue that a war fought with a few wooden frigates under the flag of \"Free Trade and Sailors Rights\" directly relates to the mission of the Navy today, including keeping choke points such as the Strait of Hormuz open against threats from Iran and battling piracy off Somalia's coast.\n\n\"We're doing about the exact same things today that we were doing 200 years ago \u2014 protecting freedom of the seas,\" Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said after a recent bicentennial reception in Washington.\n\nThe Navy has long claimed the War of 1812 as its coming of age and one of its most glorious episodes, from the USS Constitution's smashing single-ship victories to Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry's defeat of a British fleet on Lake Erie.\n\nBy war's end, the fledgling Navy was left with a host of heroes and some of its most enduring slogans, among them \"Don't Give Up the Ship.\" Most importantly, perhaps, a grateful Congress authorized a steady stream of funding to build a permanent and powerful fleet.\n\nThis is a lesson the Navy would like to see emulated.\n\nThe Navy is battling what Mabus called the \"misperception\" that it has not been deeply involved in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the Army and the Marine Corps have borne the brunt of the fighting.\n\nOnly 11 percent of respondents in 2011 named the Navy as the military service most important for national defense, compared with 25 percent for the Army, 24 percent for the Marines and 17 percent for the Air Force. In 2002, before the start of the Iraq war, the Navy stood at 17 percent, roughly equal to the Army and Marines.\n\nThe Marine Corps, though a component of the Navy, is a separate branch of the military.

First reports indicate that a combination of factors may have caused the collision, notably a French sonar detection operator who had drunk over a half a bottle of pastis and an english helmsman whos immoderate comsumption of whisky caused him to misunderstand an order which said \"port two zero\" and not \"starboard two zero\".

{"text":"Containment Dome\n\nWithin days of discovering the leaks from the broken riser on the sea floor, BP began to consider use of a large containment dome. The idea was to place the dome, also known as a cofferdam, over the larger of the two leaks, with a pipe at the top channeling oil and gas to the Discoverer Enterprise, a ship on the surface. Following an MMS inspection of the Discoverer Enterprise, BP began to lower the 98-ton dome to the sea floor late in the evening of May 6.\n\nMAY 7 | Lowering a Containment Dome\n\nGraphic courtesy of The New York Times\n\nThe likelihood of collecting oil with the cofferdam was uncertain, chief among potential problems was the risk that methane gas escaping from the well would come into contact with cold sea water and form slushy hydrates, essentially clogging the cofferdam with hydrocarbon ice.\n\nThe effort did fail, for that reason. Because hydrocarbons are lighter than water, the containment dome became buoyant as it filled with oil and gas while BP tried to lower it. BP engineers told Lynch that they had \"lost the cofferdam\" as the dome, full of flammable material, floated up toward the ships on the ocean surface. Averting a potential disaster, the engineers were able to regain control of the dome and move it to safety on the sea floor. In the wake of the cofferdam's failure, one high-level government official recalled Andy Inglis, BP's Chief Executive of Exploration and Production, saying with disgust, \"If we had tried to make a hydrate collection contraption, we couldn't have done a better job.\""}

Brown. Scientist-explorers\non the Ron Brown were on a science mission--to better\nunderstand how and why Titanic was deteriorating. Their research\nwould have them studying colonies of bacteria that consumed iron from\nthe ship's steel forming rusticles that looked very much like rusty\nicicles, giving the appearance of a ship melting away.\n\nThey would also inspect ramp marks from previous submersible\nlandings to help determine how much of the ship's deterioration was\ncaused by nature, and how much by man. \"Titanic is a\ngreat test bed for analyzing the deterioration of steel-hulled shipwrecks,\" said\nNOAA LT. Jeremy Weirich, a marine archaeologist and a navigator on\nboard for the mission.\n\nThere was one additional mission that caused a \"buzz\" on\nthe Ron Brown and filled some of the ship's bunk\nspace with filmmakers and television producers. It was to capture live\nimages of Titanic for a special television presentation on\nNational Geographic Channel, a show in which Dr. Robert Ballard returned\nto Titanic for\nthe first time since he discovered the wreck in 1985 and visited it\na year later, to obtain images of the legendary ship.\n\nThe 2004 \"Return to Titanic\" mission was a\npartnership teaming NOAA with The National Geographic Society, Mystic\nAquarium Institute for Exploration, The Jason Foundation for Education,\na film crew from the National Geographic Channel, the Institute for\nArchaeological Oceanography of the Graduate School of Oceanography\nat the University of Rhode Island and scientists and archaeologists\nfrom industry and academia.\n\nThe live television show was planned for a Monday night\nduring the mission, and Ballard would be relying on a number of team\nmembers including Justin Manley, a Mitretek contract employee with\nNOAA's Office of Ocean Exploration. He was the mission navigator on\nthe shift assigned to position the Brown, and the Remotely-Operated\nVehicles (ROVs) Argus and Hercules, in the right\nplaces at the right time, to get the live shot necessary for the Monday\nnight show.\n\nA cross section of the long umbilical cord\nto the Argus tow sled that is in turn tethered to the ROV Hercules.\nThe three smaller wires are optical fibers that carried\ncommands to the ROV and data from it to the ship The fibers are\nwrapped with steel wire to protect them. The three larger wires\nare copper conductors that delivered electrical power for ROV\npropulsion, operation of ROV robotics and sensors, and the lights\nand cameras needed to obtain high-resolution still and video\nimages from the sea floor. It's all surrounded with armoring\nin the form of three layers of steel wire. (Image courtesy Rochester\nCorp.)\n\nThe plan was to lower ROV Argus on a fiber optic umbilical,\nmore than two miles deep to a position just above the ocean floor.\nFrom Argus, the ROV Hercules, or \"Herc,\" would range out\non a 90-foot tether that flexed each time Herc turned to investigate\na new target. Both robots had bright lights and high-definition cameras,\nbut Herc also had sophisticated tools and systems to search for, collect\nand retrieve specimens. No specimens would be collected from Titanic,\nas this was a \"look-but-don't touch\" mission, designed to\nobtain scientific data and high quality still and video images of the\nship.\n\nIt's normally a four-hour process to position the Ron\nBrown and lower the ROVs slowly while the Ron Brown moved\ntoward the wreck. If the ROV landed 500 meters from the wreck, the Ron\nBrown would again move ahead, but for every 100 meters the ship\nmoved, it would be a half hour for before the ROVs advanced that\ndistance far below. Once positioned, the ROV's would feed a stream\nof images and other data to scientists.\n\nOn Sunday night, the ROV control team practiced everything\nthey would do for Monday night's live shot. Things went well and the\nteam obtained video of Titanic as \"back-up\" images\nthat could be used in the unlikely event of problems with Monday night's\nlive shot. At the same time, Hercules's cameras captured images of\ndiverse life in the deep sea. NOAA scientist Catalina Martinez observed\nthe symbiotic pairing of an anemone, hitch-hiking a ride on the back\nof an orange crab. The anemone gets mobility and a better position\nto capture food particles from the water column, she explained, while\nthe crab benefits from added protection in terms of camouflage and\nthe anemone's stinging tentacles. \"It was at once beautiful and\nsobering to see marine life on and around Titanic, itself\na deep-sea grave for more than 1,500 souls,\" she said.\n\nInstitute for Exploration (IFE) and NOAA\nengineers in the control van on the deck of the NOAA ship Ronald\nH.

(Image courtesy of Bert Fox \/National Geographic)\n\nJust before 4 a.m. Monday morning, Manley arrived at\nROV control van to stand his assigned watch. That's about when the\nscreen went black. Hercules was no longer sending pictures from the\ndeep. Worse, the ROV was no longer responding to commands. Images taken\nby Argus' cameras showed Hercules still attached,\nbut lifeless. After a long and slow recovery, Hercules was\nlifted on deck later that morning and the problem was identified as\na worn section of the cable from Argus where it connected with Hercules.\n\n\"We had a problem with the inch-thick ROV cable\n- a wire with a fiber optic cable inside it where a huge volume of\nelectricity that passes through it,\" said CAPT. Craig McLean,\nwho was then director of NOAA's Office of Ocean Exploration. \"The\ntether had been pushed back and forth during underwater operations\nso much that the cable weakened and shorted out.\"\n\nThe ROV repair team was one that had been assembled by\nBallard's Institute for Exploration or IFE, and they were the best\nin the business. Their team included electrical engineer Dave Wright,\nand his reputation for fixing anything. Wright and his skilled crew\nwent to work. When they asked for help, the marine engineers of the Ron\nBrown's crew, normally assigned to operate the ship's engines\nand machinery, were up to the task. Ron Brown's engineers\nfound a hose to arrest the tether's flexibility at its weak point and\nas they blended into the ROV team, the Institute for Exploration guys\nsaw what skills they had to offer and said, 'don't leave.'\n\nThe fix didn't look pretty -- sequential layers of hydraulic\ntubing to apply both strength and flexibility. It was a very basic\nfix applied to space age fiber optic system, but it a test showed the\nsignal was good--it worked.\n\nBy mid afternoon, just after the team lowered Hercules into\nthe ocean, the signal from the ROV to the control van failed again.\nThe crew quickly brought Hercules back onto the ship's deck,\nand when the ROV was powered-up again, there were \"arcs and sparks\nand some smoke\" according to a crewmember. The decision was made\nto replace Hercules's entire tether.\n\nWith Monday night's live shot scheduled for 9:45 p.m.,\nManley reported to the ROV control van for his afternoon watch at 4\np.m. The navigator works closely with the bridge crew to maintain the\nship's position, which, to a large extent, determines the position\nof the ROVs. The navigator must also work closely with the ROV pilots\nas they control the rate of ascent or descent of the vehicles and the\nposition of the ROVs in the water column or on the seafloor.\n\nWhile the repair team continued to labor over Hercules on\nthe after deck, Manley studied data logs of the mission thus far. As\nthe clock ate up precious time, the final calculations would have to\nbe spot on if there was any chance to put the ROVs on target in time\nfor the live shot. Everyone knew they had back-up video from the day\nbefore, but the National Geographic Channel had promoted a live shot,\nand the entire team on the Ron Brown was working as one to\nmake it happen.\n\nThere was no instrument to measure currents across a\nrange of depths and Manley knew that an understanding of currents,\nor as he called it. \"the weather down there,\" was key to\nany chance of success. Other navigators joined him to review the data\nlogs. Because the ROVs surveyed the bow of the Titanic the\nday before, the navigators had data to project and estimate both where\nto launch the ROVs, and then the direction and distance the Ron\nBrown should sail to swing the ROVs into position.\n\nManley marked the two positions on the chart and the Ron\nBrown steamed toward ROV launch station. After the ROVs were\nin the water, Hercules sent back pictures of white bubbles\nnear the surface. It was a good beginning, but it was a long way\ndown, and everything, especially Manley's marks on the chart, had\nto be just right if Hercules was going to bring live images\nto a waiting audience.\n\nThe ROVs were lowered as fast as the system would allow.\nNormally, a winch kept tension on the umbilical but this time the winch\nwas almost freewheeling, sending the ROVs deeper, and deeper, racing\nagainst time. No one knew for sure if they would find their target,\nif the currents were indeed moving as the team calculated, or if the\ntether fix would hold.\n\nThe Institute for Exploration's ROV Hercules,\n0perating on a tether of about 90 feet from an ROV tow sled,\ninvestigates boxes on the stern of RMS Titanic more\nthan two and a half miles deep during the NOAA's 2004\nexpedition to the wreck site.

The ROVs were\nstill streaming toward their position on the bottom, and the live shot\nwas just 40 minutes away. When the Ron Brown reached its station,\nthe ROVs, remarkably, swung into their target spot, 30 minutes ahead\nof the scheduled live shot. Even more remarkably, the scanning sonar\non Hercules, which has a range of only 300 feet, showed that\nthe ROV was just 170 feet from the bow of Titanic, in perfect\nposition for the planned live shot that would begin with a view up\nand over the bow of the famed ship.\n\nWhen the team realized they were exactly on target, they\nremained quiet, focused on the job. There was no release of stress\n- no, \"Yeah, we did it! There was nothing like that, because the\nlive shot still loomed ahead of them, and it only took short-term memory\nto know that things can go wrong, and quickly.\n\nAnd then it was there - time for the live shot. An image\nof Titanic's bow anchor slowly emerged. Jim Newman, IFE's\nchief engineer and the man who designed and built the ROV systems,\ncontrolled Argus. Though he modestly calls himself a \"marginal\" pilot,\nhe was selected to pilot Argus during the live program as\nhe is clearly the most comfortable at the controls. Indeed, all the\nROVs, Argus and Hercules (and Little Hercules),\nare his \"babies.\"\n\nIFE pilot Todd Gregory is usually in the pilot's seat\nfor all the 'Hollywood shots' acquired during Ballard expeditions,\nand he sat there now, powering Hercules' s thrusters to move\nthe ROV and its cameras up Titanic's anchor chain and over\nthe bow railing, then up and along the fallen mast toward the ship's\nbridge. The live shot cut out for a bit as cameras picked up Ballard\ndescribing what he saw. Then, back to the live shot, as Hercules came\nto the port side of the wheelhouse.\n\nThe live shot began with Titanic emerging into\nfocus, and now it ended, drifting back from the ship, first with a\nboat davit dissolving from view and then the wreck of Titanic filling\nthe screen before slowly fading, then disappearing.\n\nThose in the ROV control van watched the screen go black\nas the National Geographic Channel special ended. They had done it.\nLater, there were \"high fives\" all around as the entire team\ncelebrated, and in one of the ship's labs, Ballard shared what they\nall felt when asked Manley, \"Doesn't it feel good to be good?\"\n\nThe shot was 12,500 feet deep and seen around the world.\nIn a book following the mission, Ballard wrote, \"Herc and Argus reached\nthe ocean bottom in two and a half hours, their fastest descent yet.\nEven more miraculously, Justin navigated them so they arrived less\nthan 170 feet from the bow.\"\n\nIt was a great team effort and Manley is quick to share\ncredit. \"Some likened putting the ROVs on target to being in a\nhelicopter 30 stories high, lowering a yoyo on 30 stories of string,\nand putting the yoyo in a bucket, while the wind is blowing. \"A\nsuperb team of professionals made this happen,\" said Manley. \"I\nwas proud to be part of it.\"\n\nNOAA's Office\nof Ocean Exploration was created\nto investigate the oceans for the purpose of discovery and the\nadvancement of knowledge.

Ships of the convoy are visible on the horizon. Roper is wearing Measure 12 (Modified) camouflage.\n\nGerman U-Boats had been creating havoc on the east coast of the USA where they preyed on unescorted merchant vessels in regular shipping lanes. Gradually the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard were introducing a range of deterrent measures including convoys. Just after midnight on the night of the 13th\/14th April off the coast of North Carolina the destroyer USS Roper picked up a fast moving surface vessel on its radar, first thinking it was a small Coast Guard craft. As they closed in the enemy appeared and was dealt with ruthlessly:\n\nWhen the distance had been reduced to 300 yards the vessel cut sharply to starboard. At this instant, using the 24\u2033 searchlight, she was finally identified as a large submarine. A camouflage preponderantly light in color was noted. The submarine continued to turn to starboard inside the turning circle of this ship. The searchlight was held on the submarine, and fire was opened first with the machine gun battery and then with the 3\u2033 battery.\n\nThe machine guns, particularly #1, cut down the submarine personnel rushing to man their gun. A direct hit in the conning tower near the water line was made by #5 \u2013 3\u2033 gun as the submarine commenced to sink. Orders were given to fire a torpedo at the submarine, but she disappeared before it was fired. The submarine apparently was scuttled inasmuch as she settled slowly and went down stern first. About forty of her crew were on deck and soon sighted in the water.\n\nA barrage of eleven depth charges was laid by use of racks, Y-guns, and K-guns, based on an eye estimate of the submarine's location plus an excellent sound contact. The bearing of the submarine remained almost constant and the speed was negligible. Wreckage could not be detected because of the darkness. On two occasions this ship passed near the survivors, but the fact that German submarines frequently work in pairs made the conduct of any rescue work before daylight far too dangerous to risk.\n\nSearch in the general area was continued until daybreak. At that time the PBY plane commanded by Lieutenant C.V. Horrigan, U.S.N.R., cooperated in an intensive sight search. Suspicious oil slicks and bits of debris were investigated. The plane dropped one charge and this ship dropped two.\n\nAt 0706, by means of smoke floats dropped from two planes which appeared on the scene, the attention of this ship was called to bodies in the water. At 0717 this vessel placed the first of two lifeboats in the water in charge of an officer, and commenced recovering bodies and floating articles.\n\nAt 0727 an airship was observed approaching. She was asked to circle the ship as a protection against submarines while the boats were in the water. This she did. Communication by flashing light was made without difficulty, and on one occasion the airship idled her motors and communicated by megaphone. A maximum of seven planes of various types appeared on the scene at one time. Near the end of the recovery operation a British trawler stood over and was asked to watch for submarines.\n\nFrom the Action Report submitted by the Executive Officer of the USS Roper, the full original is available on U Boat Archive. Somewhat controversially there were no survivors from the U-Boat and 29 bodies were recovered later. The reasons for continuing with the depth charging with men in the water were made clear in the report. Commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Hamilton W. Howe received the Navy Cross for the engagement"}

As a youngster he had his own Mirror dinghy, ten feet long. When he was competing in sailing events around Wales, his parents had to strap his boat to the top of their car to transport him to wherever the regattas were.\n\nOne early inspiration for Richard was the yachtsman Francis Chicester, who sailed solo around the world in 1966-7 in his 40-foot yacht Gipsy Moth. Richard's imagination was sparked, and many years later he would himself circumnavigate the globe - although he did it in charge of a crew, and in a 60-foot boat!\n\nRichard has three times skippered yachts in the world's toughest yacht race, the round-the-world challenge going westward, regarded by sailors as the wrong way. Each race was very eventful : in 1992-3 Richard was captain of the yacht British Steel II which lost its mast halfway across the Southern Ocean, but still managed to make it to Hobart, and eventually to finish the race. On Richard's third attempt in 2000 he captained a brand new catamaran, the Team Philips, made out of carbon fibre and worth \u00a32.5 million. Unfortunately, seven hundred miles out into the Atlantic the ship broke up, and Richard and the crew had to be rescued by a passing vessel.\n\nAlthough Richard's love of the sea has not diminished, his feet are now more firmly planted in his beloved Pwllheli, where he teaches vocational courses in seamanship."}

{"text":"Take the ocean further\n\nSouth Sinai, Egypt\n\nDescription\n\nThe 19th century steam-driven sailing ship Carina was on its way to Calcutta with general cargo that included Belgian glassware. Coming from Suez it caught fire south of Sha'ab Ali and ran for shallower waters to the northwest corner of a reef that is located north of Shag Rock. The Carina is lying in shallow water and wreckage is spread over a large area. The bow and stern sections are intact and lie between 6 \u2013 14 m. Some of the cargo is still visible: fragments of painted glass and drinking vessels. The wreckage has widespread coral growth and marine life. More of the cargo must be hidden beneath the well grown hard corals. Due to the location large swell and strong currents are common and the wreck is dived infrequently."}
{"text":"Canadian pioneer of regular transatlantic steam navigation. The son of a United Empire Loyalist, he became a leading businessman of Nova Scotia and engaged in banking, lumbering, shipping, and shipbuilding enterprises. His fleet at one time numbered some 40 vessels. He was interested in the development of steam navigation and owned shares in the Royal William, the first Canadian steamer to cross the Atlantic (1833) from Canada to England. When the British government invited bids (1838) for carrying mail to and from Liverpool, Halifax, and Boston, Cunard went (1839) to England and presented to the admiralty such carefully considered plans for a line of steamships that he received the contract. In association with others, he formed the British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, which in 1840 placed four ships in operation, establishing the first regular steamship service between the continents. This was the beginning of the noted Cunard Line."}
{"text":"List of U.S. military vessels named after women\n\nMany vessels named after women have seen military service, often serving with distinction. Most of these were named in civilian service and then subsequently commissioned into the United States Navy.\n\nFew ships have been named for women by the military. Ships often are named after people who served in the Navy or who served in the government. Women have only recently been in such prominent positions, and therefore few have been so honored by the Navy.\n\nEarly ships\n\nGunboat Lady Washington was commissioned in 1776 and the first American armed ship named for a woman. She was a row galley, a small wooden river gunboat, built in 1776 by New York State to defend Hudson River, named in honor of Martha Washington. She remained active, under General Washington's command, through June 1777.\n\nSternwheel river steamer Bloomer launched in 1856. Apparently former name retained, she was named for feministAmelia Bloomer. Bloomer was captured from Confederates in 1862; served in USN 1863-65.\n\nHarbor tug Sacagawea (YT-241) , 1942. First instance of a Martime Commission 's assignment of woman's name to naval vessel. She was named for Sacagawea, a Shoshonewoman. The name was assigned to tug acquired by Maritime Commission for but ended up being retained by Maritime Commission and was not commissioned in the Navy.\n\nNote that even though the name Shenandoah is a American Indian word meaning \"Daughter of the Stars\", the navy airshipShenandoah, as well as other ships of the name are named for the river Shenandoah in Virginia.\n\nOther Navy ships with a woman's name\n\nMany of these ships served in one or both of World War I, World War II, and some also during the intra-war years. The names often came from a previous owner and all were commissioned in the Navy. Some vessels may have been named by the Navy, although it has not been determined which, if any, the Navy specifically named.\n(incomplete"}
{"text":"In the 1950s there were relatively few yachts on the Maine coast. Those that were here were all wooden like the lobster boat in the foreground. Lobstering was, as is now, a very important livelihood. Photograph by Carol Thayer Berry.\n\nOriginally named Buddy & Sylvia, the 33-foot lobster boat Genevieve had a long life, working from 1950 to the late-1990s. Originally, it had no shelter other than a piece of canvas over hoops to keep the engine dry. Later, a deckhouse was added, complete with Beals Island-style diamond ports.\n\nIn 1925, this was the largest sardine factory on the Atlantic Coast, owned by L.D. Clark & Son. And Eastport was the \"Home of the American Sardine,\" as that is where sardines were first canned in the United States, beginning in 1875. By this time the plants numbered 10. This factory was 250 feet long, employed 500 men and women, and packed 4,000 cases of 100 cans each daily when there were herring.\n\nA weir is constructed each season by pounding in vertical piles, then crossing the piles with long straight sticks, then filling in vertical branches. When fish swim to the weir leader (the straight part that comes out from shore), they are diverted into the pound, where they swim around in circles. The seine net is set inside the weir to catch the herring.\n\nWeir fishing was practiced by Maine's Natives, and was especially popular further east where big tides made putting a \"Fence in the Water\" relatively easy.\n\nIn the 1940s there was a herring weir in Rockport Harbor, here worked by Harlan Hurd. After a seine net is set and pursed inside the weir, the fish are dipped from the seine into a herring carrier, a sizable power boat that carried herring to a cannery and usually were cannery-owned. The late 1940s saw the height of the canning industry with the largest amounts ever packed. Just after this photo was taken herring carriers started to use fish pumps which could pump herring out of a weir or seine and into the hold of the carrier, saving hours of work."}

{"text":"At the outbreak of World War II, the British navy under First Lord of the Admiralty Winston L. S. Churchill and First Sea Lord Sir Dudley P. R. Pound numbered about 10,000 active officers and 80,000 men. British forces in Atlantic home waters stood at 7 battleships ( Nelson, Rodney, Royal Oak, Royal Sovereign, Ramillies, Resolution, and Revenge); 2 battle cruisers ( Hood and Repulse); 3 aircraft carriers ( Ark Royal, Courageous, and Hermes); 18 cruisers, 35 destroyers, 7 fleet minesweepers, and 16 submarines. The home waters were divided into four naval commands: Portsmouth (under Commander in Chief Admiral Sir Williams James), the Nore (Admiral Sir Henry J. Studholme-Brownrigg), the Western Approaches (Admiral Sir M. Dunbar-Nasmith), and Rosyth (Vice Admiral C. G. Ramsey). Britain also had other obligations requiring the Royal Navy to maintain significant forces in Mediterranean and Asian waters.\n\nTo bolster its forces in the Atlantic, especially in the escort of merchant shipping, the Royal Navy enjoyed the cooperation of the Royal Canadian Navy, which began the war with only 21 ships but ended the conflict with 300\u2013400 vessels and 31,000 officers. In September 1939, the Royal Canadian Navy numbered 1 heavy cruiser, 2 light cruisers, 11 destroyers, 4 submarines, 4 minesweepers, and 1 auxiliary schooner.\n\nThe outbreak of war in September 1939 caught the German navy in transition. Chancellor Adolf Hitler had told German navy commander Grand Admiral Erich Raeder that war would not occur before 1943 or 1945, so in the Z Plan, Raeder had been building a balanced fleet to include aircraft carriers. He hoped that in the future, the fleet might challenge Britain for naval mastery. In September 1939, the German navy consisted of the 2 battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau (powerful battleships Bismarck and Tirpitz were under construction); 3 pocket battleships ( Admiral Scheer, Admiral Graf Spee, and Deutschland, soon renamed L\u00fctzow); 1 heavy cruiser ( Admiral Hipper, with 4 additional heavy cruisers under construction); 6 light cruisers, 34 destroyers and torpedo boats, and 56 submarines. Admiral Herman Boehm commanded Naval Group West (North Sea operations), and Admiral Conrad Albrecht had charge of Naval Group East (Baltic operations). Rear Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz commanded Germany's submarines.\n\nD\u00f6nitz had wanted 300 U-boats to begin the war, but at the start of hostilities, Germany had only 56 submarines in commission, of which 46 were ready for action. Of these, only 26 were suitable for Atlantic operations. This meant that the German navy would be able to have on station at any one time only 8 or 9 submarines.\n\nIn 1939, the French navy, led by Admiral Jean L. F. Darlan, was the fourth largest and most modern in the world. France possessed 5 older battleships (powerful new battleships Jean Bart and Richelieu were in the final stages of construction), 1 aircraft carrier, 2 modern battle cruisers ( Strasbourg and Dunkerque), 19 cruisers, 64 destroyers, and 77 submarines. In September 1939, much of this naval strength was deployed in the Mediterranean, West Indies, and Indochina.\n\nPoland had only a small navy in September 1939. It consisted of 4 destroyers, 5 submarines, and some smaller units. Italy, neutral until 1940, had an impressive navy of 6 battleships (only 2 of which were ready for service in September 1939), 7 heavy cruisers, 12 light cruisers, 90 destroyers, and 97 submarines.\n\nIn September 1939, the U.S. Navy may have been the world's most powerful. It maintained 15 battleships, 5 fleet carriers, 1 light carrier, 37 cruisers, 149 destroyers, and 71 submarines. Although officially neutral when the war in Europe began, the United States lent unofficial support to the Allies. Admiral Harold R. Stark was chief of naval operations (CNO). The United States divided its ships between the Atlantic and the Pacific, and it was the latter\u2014and specifically the threat posed by Japan\u2014which on the outbreak of war in Europe was receiving the most attention. In September 1939, U.S. forces in the Atlantic, commanded by Rear Admiral Alfred W. Johnson, consisted of 3 old battleships ( New York, Arkansas, Texas; battleship Wyoming was a training ship), the aircraft carrier Ranger, 8 cruisers, 43 destroyers, and 21 submarines. The United States had significant naval building programs under way that were centered on fast battleships and Essex-class aircraft carriers. In addition, Washington ordered 110 decommissioned World War I\u2013vintage destroyers refurbished for service.\n\nAdmiral Johnson developed an offshore neutrality patrol zone out to 300 miles from the U.S. coastline. Maintained by destroyers, Coast Guard vessels, and aircraft, it protected British and American merchant vessels from German raiders. This policy would lead to an undeclared war in the Atlantic."}

She told me that she was surprised at\nhow far some of the oysters had been moved:\n\n\"I have never seen a scour line that high on the beach. The\noysters are alive, but I can tell they have been thrown around a\nlittle bit.\"\n\nFrankly, I have never heard of this kind of damage from any\nship, and I don't blame readers for being skeptical. But there\nseems to be no question that the oysters were washed up on the\nbeach, that the Navy ship was in the vicinity about that time, and\nthat a ship of this size is capable of producing a huge wake. It's\ncalled circumstantial evidence, at least until I find someone who\nactually saw something happening.\n\nSeveral years ago, residents living along Rich Passage between\nSouth Kitsap and Bainbridge Island complained that the wake of\nhigh-speed passenger-only ferries were washing away the gravel and\nundercutting their concrete and rock bulkheads. Washington State\nFerries was ultimately forced to pull the ferries out of service.\nLocal officials are still hoping they can find a ferry that can\nmake it from Bremerton to Seattle in about half an hour without\ncreating wake damage.\n\nI've also heard complaints from shoreline property owners about\nwakes from huge freighters. Such comments have come up during\ndiscussions about revised shoreline regulations that could become\npart of Kitsap County's Shorelines Master Program. Some folks who\nlive on the east side of the Kitsap Peninsula say wakes from these\nmassive cargo ships cause more damage to habitat than anything a\nshoreline owner might do.\n\nIf true, it may be time to address the wake issue, beginning\nwith studies of actual damage caused when the ships come through.\nDo we need government intervention? I can't say, but rules to\ncontrol wakes could be problematic, because the movement of ships\nis mostly controlled by the federal government.\n\nLast week, I reported that the Purse Seine Vessel Owners\nAssociation has come forward with $158,000 a year to maintain the\noperation of the McKernan Hatchery near Shelton.\n\nThe hatchery, which produces 40 percent of the chum salmon in\nHood Canal, was scheduled to close July 1 unless a private entity\nstepped up to run it. Three groups offered proposals, and the\narrangement will allow state hatchery workers to keep doing their\nregular jobs. See my story in\nFriday's Kitsap Sun for details.\n\nTwo questions came up in comments at the bottom of the story:\nWhy doesn't the state rear coho, chinook or other more valuable\nfish at McKernan? And why does the state continue to allow these\nkinds of production hatcheries to continue, considering impacts on\nwild salmon? (more\u2026)\n\nSince we don't really have Pacific smelt on the Kitsap\nPeninsula, where I do my local reporting, I decided against writing\nany more about it.\n\nBut today I'm getting the feeling that more than a few people in\nthe Puget Sound region are confused about the potential impacts of\nthis listing. They want to know whether they can still catch some\nsmelt in Hood Canal, along Port Orchard's Ross Point and in other\nfavorite spawning areas for our local surf smelt \u2014 not the listed\nPacific smelt.\n\nLet me direct you back to a\nWater Ways entry I posted one year ago today, after NOAA\nproposed the listing. In that blog entry, I admitted my own initial\nconfusion between the two kinds of \"smelt.\"\n\nIf you would like a little more information about yesterday's\nannouncement, I direct you to\nAssociated Press reporter Jeff Barnard's story.\n\nWashington state's salmon managers provided so much interesting\ninformation on Tuesday that I could not fit it all into my story in\nyesterday's Kitsap Sun.\n\nPat Pattillo, salmon policy coordinator for the Washington\nDepartment of Fish and Wildlife, deserves recognition for his\npatience with me and the numerous sport and commercial fishers who\nask him questions. He and WDFW Director Phil Anderson are two of\nthe most mild-mannered guys you will ever know, and yet they manage\nto work through tough salmon negotiations year after year.\n\nLet me recount some of the issues expected to come up over the\nnext few weeks, with a focus on things not covered in my story. (more\u2026)\n\nThe McKernan Hatchery on Weaver Creek, a tributary of the\nSkokomish River, is considered an important operation by commercial\nchum salmon fishers and by steelhead anglers, who benefit from the\nfish produced there.\n\nIt is not one of the Hood Canal hatcheries we've often talked\nabout that are focused on rebuilding wild salmon runs. Still, the\nhatchery is being operated to minimize impacts on wild salmon, as\noutlined in the\nHatchery and Genetic Management Plan (PDF 188 kb).\n\nBecause of state budget cutbacks, McKernan was one of the\nsalmon- and trout-rearing facilities placed on the chopping block\nearlier this year by the Legislature. See the story I wrote for\ntoday's Kitsap Sun.\n\nState Rep. Fred Finn, D-Olympia, and other legislators believe\nthat private organizations should be given the opportunity to\noperate the hatchery. Perhaps revenues from the sale of eggs and\nsalmon returning to the hatchery could help to keep the operation\ngoing, he said in a news\nrelease.\n\nGov. Chris Gregoire yesterday announced a reorganization of the\nstate's natural resource agencies. While consolidation of entire\nagencies was taken off the table, plans are moving forward to\nconsolidate the regions and possibly regional offices of multiple\nagencies. See my story in\ntoday's Kitsap Sun.\n\nWe'll talk more about the new Natural Resources Cabinet and\nother elements of the reorganization in the future. For now, take a\nlook at the regional boundaries for our three major resource\nagencies:\n\nDepartment of Ecology: Kitsap County is in the\nNorthwest\nRegion, along with King, Snohomish, Skagit, Whatcom, Island and\nSan Juan counties. The regional office is located in Bellevue.\n\nDepartment of Fish and Wildlife: Kitsap County\nis in Region 6,\nalong with Pierce, Thurston, Mason, Jefferson, Clallam, Grays\nHarbor and Pacific counties. The regional headquarters is in\nMontesano, on the way to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nDepartment of Natural Resources: Kitsap County\nis in the South\nPuget Sound Region, along with King, Pierce and Mason counties\nand portions of Snohomish and Lewis counties. The headquarters is\nin Enumclaw, northwest of Mount Rainier.\n\nIt won't be as easy as one might think to fight tradition and\ncreate a new uniform set of regions for all three agencies. But\ntimes have changed, and these particular regions may not work as\nwell as when they were originally set up. I'm fairly certain that\nagency heads will start with agreed principles for setting the\nboundaries, considering population, travel time, ecological\nfunctions and other things.\n\nI like the idea of creating regional headquarters in the same\nplace for all agencies, so that various staffs could work in\nconcert. Because of the cost of construction, the agencies might\nnot be housed in the same buildings at first, but putting regional\nstaffers in the same town or city would be a good startThe latest episode in the battle for a boat launch at Lake\nTahuyeh focuses on four fishing groups who were under the\nimpression that a state boat launch for kayaks and canoes was a\ndone deal \u2014 then the plans were canceled.\n\nLake Tahuyeh property owned by the\nWashington Department of Fish and Wildlife\n\nThe groups feel betrayed because an official with the Washington\nDepartment of Fish and Wildlife withdrew the application for a\npermit after saying that nothing would happen until November, when\na lawsuit was scheduled for trial. See my story in\nThursday's Kitsap Sun.\n\nThis story has had many twists and turns since 2004. Officials\nwith the Tahuyeh Lake Community Club also have grievances against\nFish and Wildlife officials, who they believed had agreed to\nabandon plans for a boat launch and sell the lakefront\nproperty.\n\nNow, it appears a lawsuit filed by the community club may go to\ncourt. The issue: whether the state has the legal right to open the\nlake to the public, by way of owning a parcel of waterfront\nproperty.\n\nComments posted to my latest story generally support the\ncommunity club's position of keeping the public off the lake. This\nseems to be a turn, since supporters of the boat launch were well\nrepresented in previous stories.\n\nI'll keep the informal poll open a few more days to see if\nanyone wants to add their opinions on this issue. See the right\ncolumn and vote if you have not already done so.\n\nIt will be interesting to see whether state employees and\noutside observers settle on more, fewer or the same number of\nnatural resource agencies than we now have in Washington state. As\nI describe in a story in\ntoday's Kitsap Sun, just about everything is on the table for\nreview.\n\nWhen I first moved here in the 1970s, we had a Department of\nFisheries along with a Department of Wildlife. Enforcement officers\nwere assigned to one agency or the other, but they often rendered\nassistance to their fellow officers downstream or out in the\nwoods.\n\nAt some point in the past, I believe the state operated with a\nsingle Department of Fish and Game. Then after trying two agencies\nfor a number of years, they merged into one again: the Department\nof Fish and Wildlife.\n\nThis time, we could see a greater shakeup, as Gov. Chris\nGregoire has called for a review of all natural resource agencies.\nThat means we would add into the discussion these departments:\nEcology, Natural Resources, and Parks and Recreation.\n\nDoes it make sense to consolidate agencies for a greater sharing\nof limited resources or stay with a greater number of agencies to\nhone the mission of the organization. Does one way result in fewer\nmanagers, or do you just trade top-level directors for middle\nmanagers?\n\nWould it be better to have law enforcement officers focused on\nspecific duties, or should they all be cross-trained to do the same\nthing? Should State Patrol officers learn about trees, deer and\nfish and help out with poachers in the woods \u2014 or is this going too\nfar?\n\nI don't know the answers, but I really am interested in the\noutcome. The analysis has begun within documents filed on a new\nNatural Resources Reform Web page linked from the Governor's\nWeb site. It's clear there's much work yet to be done.\n\nAs for the number of scientists who need to stand in a stream\n(see\nWater Ways, Sept. 3), I guess some people are promoting the\nnotion that one person could collect stream data for all three.\nFolks at the Puget Sound Partnership have talked about\nstandardizing water-quality data, for example, but this issue is\nmore complex than that.\n\nOne thing that caught my attention is the number of programs\nrelated to natural resources outside of Fish and Wildlife, Ecology,\nNatural Resources, and Parks. These programs may be brought into\none of the agencies resulting from the reorganization. Here are\nsome of those programs and where they currently reside:\n\nI'd like to offer my personal congratulations to Phil Anderson,\nwho was appointed yesterday as the permanent director of the\nWashington Department of Fish and Wildlife.\n\nPhil Anderson\n\nPhil has been acting as interim director since Jeff Koenings\nleft the job in December.\n\nI've known Phil since about 1992, when I began covering the\nannual meetings of the Pacific Fishery Management Council, which\nestablishes fishing seasons for the Pacific Northwest.\n\nPhil had been running a commercial charterboat business out of\nWestport and was very knowledgeable about harvest levels and the\nneed to protect salmon. I believe he was chairman of the PFMC when\nI first met him.\n\nIn 1994, he took a job with WDFW and led the annual negotiations\nthat establish allocations between tribal and nontribal fishers, as\nwell as among various non-Indian fishing groups.\n\nI recall numerous times when he stood in front of tough fishing\ngroups and skeptical tribal representatives and explained calmly\nhow answers would come if people followed the science and kept\nworking together.\n\nPhil has always been willing to explain complex management\nissues to me, and I'm grateful for that.\n\nEven when he finds himself under fire \u2014 as he did recently in\ndealing with the proposed Lake Tahuyeh boat launch and human waste\non the Skokomish River \u2014 Anderson does not shy away from tough\nquestions and takes responsibility for departmental actions. It's a\npleasure to interview leaders like that.\n\nSo I wish him well in his new job, which seems to be one of the\nhottest seats in state government. Pleasing all the fish and\nwildlife interests and the Legislature is impossible, almost by\ndefinition, but Phil has a rare quality of juggling many concerns\nat once and trying to come up with fair solutions."}
{"text":"Several weeks out from Buenos Airies the Endurance struck the pack ice. The job then became to navigate though the ice. The Endurance had to find leeds ( clear passages of water amongst the pack ice ), that she had to steer down. The path then became a very indirect route to Antarctica.\n\nOnce the Endurance was finally crushed and sank, Shackleton and the crew had no choice but to camp on the ice. All the available supplies had to be taken off the ship and camp made on the ice. Initially Shackleton had the idea to haul the boats to land, though after such slow progress was achieved, this was abandoned and the first camp Ocean camp was established. Later on Patience camp was established several miles away on the ice. Shackleton and his crew were there for 6 months on several different places before the ice became too thin for them and they had to take to the boats.\n\nMid Winter\n\nThis photo taken very much at in the middle of winter is probable the most iconic image from the expedition. Frank Hurley had to take 20 flash images using flash powder to illuminate the ship.\n\nShackleton after 3 attempts was finally able to rescue his men from elephant island. They all returned to valpariso to a heros welcome. Shackleton facing all the ordeals that he did with all the decisions he made, did not loose one life."}

{"text":"Ferry: Map\n\nWikipedia article:\n\nMap showing all locations mentioned on Wikipedia article:\n\nA ferry (or ferryboat) is a form\nof transportation, usually a boat, but\nsometimes a ship, used to carry (or\nferry) primarily passengers, and sometimes vehicles and\ncargo as well, across a body of water. Most ferries operate on\nregular, frequent, return services. A passenger ferry with many stops, such as\nin Venice, is\nsometimes called a water bus or water taxi.\n\nFerries form a part of the public\ntransport systems of many waterside cities and islands,\nallowing direct transit between points at a capital cost much lower than bridges or tunnels.\nHowever,\nship connections of much larger distances (such as over long\ndistances in water bodies like the Mediterranean Sea) may also be called ferry services, especially if\nthey carry vehicles.\n\nHistory\n\nIn ancient times\n\nSpeculation that a pair of oxen propelled a ship having a water\nwheel can be found in 4th century\nRoman literature \"Anonymus De Rebus Bellicis\". Though\nimpractical, there is no reason why it could not work and such a\nferry, modified by using horses, was used in Lake Champlain in 19th\ncentury America. See \"When Horses Walked on Water:\nHorse-Powered Ferries in Nineteenth-Century America\"\n(Smithsonian Institution Press; Kevin Crisman, co-authored with\nArthur Cohn, Executive Director of the Lake Champlain Maritime\nMuseum).\n\nVehicle-carrying ferry services between\nmainland Cape\nCod and the islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket are operated by the\nThe Woods Hole, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship\nAuthority, which sails year-round between Woods Hole and Vineyard\nHaven as well as Hyannis and Nantucket.Seasonal service is also operated from Woods\nHole to Oak\nBluffs from Memorial Day to Labor Day. As there are\nno bridges or tunnels connecting the islands to the mainland, The\nSteamship Authority ferries in addition to being the only method\nfor transporting private cars to or from the islands, also serves\nas the only link by which heavy freight and supplies such as food\nand gasoline can be trucked to the islands. Additionally,\nHy-Line Cruises operates high speed\ncatamaran service from Hyannis to both islands, as well as\ntraditional ferries, and several smaller operations run seasonal\npassenger only service primarily geared towards tourist day-trippers from other mainland ports,\nincluding New\nBedford, (New Bedford Fast Ferry) Falmouth, (Island Queen ferry and Falmouth Ferry) and\nHarwich (Freedom Cruise Line).\n\nHydrofoil\n\nHydrofoils have the advantage of higher cruising\nspeeds, succeeding hovercraft on some\nEnglish Channel routes where the ferries now compete against the\nEurotunnel and Eurostar trains that use the\nChannel\nTunnel.Passenger-only hydrofoils also proved a\npractical, fast and relatively economical solution in the Canary\nIslands but were recently replaced by faster catamaran \"high speed\" ferries that can carry\ncars. Their replacement by the larger craft is seen by\ncritics as a retrograde step given that the new vessels use much\nmore fuel and foster the inappropriate use of cars in islands\nalready suffering from the impact of mass tourism.\n\nHovercraft\n\nHovercraft were developed in the 1960s\nand 1970s to carry cars. The largest was the massive SR.N4 which carried cars in its centre section with\nramps at the bow and stern between England and France. The\nhovercraft was superseded by catamarans which are nearly as fast\nand are less affected by sea and weather conditions. Only one service now\nremains, a foot passenger service between Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight run by Hovertravel.\n\nCatamaran\n\nCatamarans are normally associated with\nhigh-speed ferry services. Stena Line\noperates the largest catamarans in the world, the Stena HSS class, between the United\nKingdom and Ireland. These waterjet-powered vessels, displacing\n19,638 tonnes, are larger than most catamarans and can accommodate\n375 passenger cars and 1,500 passengers. Other examples of these\nsuper-sizer catamarans are found in the Brittany Ferries fleet with the Normandie\nExpress and the Normandie Vitesse.\n\nRo-ro\n\nRoll-on\/roll-off ferries (RORO) are\nlarge, conventional ferries named for the ease by which vehicles\ncan board and leave.\n\nCruiseferry\n\nFast RoPax Ferry\n\nFast RoPax ferries are\nconventional ferries with a large garage intake and a relatively\nlarge passenger capacity, with conventional diesel propulsion and\npropellers that sail over . Pioneering this class of ferries was\nAttica Group, when it introduced\nSuperfast I between Greece and Italy in 1995 through its subsidiary\ncompany Superfast Ferries.\n\nTurntable ferry\n\nTurntable ferry at Isle of Skye,\nScotland,United Kingdom.\n\nThis type of ferry allows vehicles to load from the \"side\". The\nvehicle platform can be turned. When loading, the platform is\nturned sideways to allow sideways loading of vehicles. Then the\nplatform is turned back, in line with the vessel, and the journey\nacross water is made.\n\nPontoon ferry\n\nPontoon ferries carry vehicles across\nrivers and lakes and are widely used in less-developed countries\nwith large rivers where the cost of bridge construction is\nprohibitive. One or more vehicles are carried on a pontoon with\nramps at either end for vehicles to drive\non and off. Cable ferries (next section) are usually pontoon\nferries, but pontoon ferries on larger rivers are motorised and\nable to be steered independently like a boat.\n\nFoot ferry\n\nFoot ferries are small craft used to ferry foot passengers, and\noften also cyclists, over rivers. These are either self-propelled\ncraft or cable ferries. Such ferries are for example to be found on\nthe lower River\nScheldt in Belgium.\n\nCable ferry\n\nVery short distances may be crossed by a cable or chain ferry, which is usually a pontoon\nferry (see above), where the ferry is propelled along and steered\nby cables connected to each shore. Sometimes the cable ferry is\nhuman powered by someone on the boat. Reaction ferries are cable ferries that use\nthe perpendicular force of the current as a source of power.\nExamples\nof a current propelled ferry are the four Rhine ferries in Basel,\nSwitzerland . Cable ferries may be used in fast-flowing\nrivers across short distances. Cable ferries are referred to in\nAustralia and New Zealand as \"punts\".\n\nAir ferries\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, travel on an \"air\nferry\" was possible\u2014aeroplanes, often ex-military, specially\nequipped to take a small number of cars in addition to \"foot\"\npassengers. These operated various routes including between the\nUnited Kingdom and Continental\nEurope. Companies operating such services included Corsair.\n\nThe term is also applied to any \"ferrying\" by air, and is commonly\nused when referring to airborne military operations.\n\nDocking\n\nFerry boats often dock at specialized facilities designed to\nposition the boat for loading and unloading, called a ferry slip. If the ferry transports road vehicles\nor railway carriages there will usually be an adjustable ramp called an apron that\nis part of the slip. In other cases, the apron ramp will be a part of the ferry itself,\nacting as a wave guard when elevated and lowered to meet a fixed ramp at the terminus \u2014 a road segment that\nextends partially underwater.\n\nThe ferry shown right is ferry MV Magogoni used in Tanzania. It was not possible to build suitable\ndocking facilities and that problem is solved by making the ferry\nextra manoeuvrable. Four identical engine modules with Schottel\npump-jets are used for main propulsion.\nWith her steering propellers rotating round vertical shafts she can\nbe put on any place of the ramp, regardless of stream.\n\nThe\noldest ferry service in continuous operation is the Rocky Hill -\nGlastonbury Ferry, running between the towns of Rocky\nHill and Glastonbury, Connecticut. Established in 1655, the ferry has run\ncontinuously since, only ceasing operation every winter when the\nriver freezes over. The oldest continuously running salt water\nferry service may be the Halifax\/Dartmouth ferry, running between\nthe cities of Halifax and Dartmouth, Nova\nScotia, which has run year-round since 1752, and is\ncurrently run by the region's transit authority, Metro\nTransit.\n\nAnother\ncontender for oldest ferry is the Mersey Ferries service from Liverpool to Birkenhead, England. There is evidence that there has been a\nferry service over the river for over 800 years. Liverpool's city\ncharter in 1207 specifies rights of passage across the river\npayable by a toll.\n\nTwo of\nthe world's largest ferry systems are located in the Strait of\nGeorgia, in the Canadian province of British\nColumbia, and Puget\nSound, in the U.S. state of Washington.BC Ferries in\nBritish Columbia operates 36 vessels, visiting 47 ports of call,\nwhile Washington State\nFerries owns 28 vessels, travelling to 20 ports of call around\nPuget Sound. The Sydney Ferries\nCorporation in Sydney, Australia operates 31 passenger ferries in Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), carrying 18 million passengers\nannually. It operates catamarans and other types of ferries\non these routes, with the most famous likely being the Circular\nQuay-Manly route. Between 1938 and 1974 this route operated the\nSouth Steyne, billed at the time as the largest and fastest ferry\nof its type. Sydney Ferries became an independent corporation owned\nby the government in 2004.\n\nMetrolink\nQueensland operates 21 passenger ferries on behalf of Brisbane City Council, 12 being single-hulled ferries and 9\nCityCats (catamarans), along the Brisbane\nRiver from the University of Queensland through the city to Brett's Wharf.\n\nWorld's Fastest Diesel Ferry\n\nAustal's 65 metre Auto Express catamaran ferry\n\"Shinas\", built for the Sultanate of Oman, has achieved a record service speed of during sea\ntrials, making it the fastest diesel-powered vehicle-passenger ferry\ncurrently in commercial service. The vessel's confirmed\nservice speed of exceeds contract requirements by one knot, with\nthe vessel also reaching a peak speed of 55.9 knots (103.5 km\/h).\n\"Shinas\"\nis the first of two identical vessels being built for the Sultanate\nof Oman at Austal's facilities in Henderson, Australia.\n\nEach\nvessel will carry 208 passengers and 56 cars along a route between\nShinas and Oman's rugged Musandam Peninsular. The vessel has the capability to\nassist in search and rescue operations due to its helicopter\nlanding facility, which is suitable for a medium class helicopter.\nBoth vessels are powered by four MTU 20 cylinder 1163 series diesel\nengines each producing 6,500 kW and driving Rolls-Royce \/ Kamewa\nwaterjets. The vessels meet Det Norske Veritas survey requirements\nand conform to the HSC code.\n\nThe full length vehicle deck allows space for 56 cars or 54 truck\nlane metres plus 40 cars with a deck clear height of over three\nmetres. The vehicle deck aft can withstand axle loads of 9 tonnes\n(single wheel) or 12 tonne (dual wheel). The remainder of the main\ndeck caters for maximum axle loads of 3 tonnes (single wheel).\nLightweight structural fire protection, zoned sprinkler systems and\nhydrants ensure optimal fire safety during vehicle transport. As an\nadded safety measure, the vessel has a medical transfer station\naccessible off the vehicle deck, offering a high level of medical\nequipment for patient transport. The vessel's high operating speed\nis made possible by four MTU 20 cylinder 1163 series diesel\nengines, each producing 6,500 kW and driving Rolls-Royce \/\nKamewa waterjets.\n\nSustainability\n\nThe contributions of ferry travel to climate change have received\nless scrutiny than land and air transport, and vary considerably\naccording to factors like speed and the number of passengers\ncarried. Average carbon dioxide emissions by ferries per\npassenger-kilometre seem to be 0.12 kg. However, 18-knot\nferries between Finland and Sweden produce 0.221 kg of CO2,\nwith total emissions equalling a C02 equivalent of 0.223 kg,\nwhile 24\u201327-knot ferries between Finland and Estonia produce\n0.396 kg of C02 with total emissions equalling a C02\nequivalent of 0.4 kg.\n\nWith the\nprice of oil at high levels, and with\nincreasing pressure from consumers for measures to tackle global warming, a number of innovations for\nenergy and the environment were put forward at the Interferry\nconference in Stockholm. According to the company Solar Sailor, hybrid marine power and solar\nwing technology are suitable for use with ferries, private yachts and even tankers."}
{"text":"The Bismarck was laid down in 1936 and launched in 1939. It displaced 52,600 tons, mounted eight 15-inch (38-centimetre) guns, and had a speed of 30 knots. In May 1941 the battleship, which was commanded by Admiral G\u00fcnther L\u00fctjens, was sighted off Bergen, Norway, by a British reconnaissance aircraft. Practically the entire British Home Fleet was immediately sent into action to intercept it. Two cruisers made contact off the coast of Iceland, and the battleship Prince of Wales and battle cruiser Hood soon engaged it. After destroying the Hood with a shell that exploded in the magazine, the Bismarck escaped into the open sea and soon began heading for Brest in German-occupied France. Sighted by aircraft 30 hours later (May 26), it was hit by a torpedo that crippled its steering gear, and the ship was bombarded throughout the night by battleships. On the morning of May 27 the King George V and the Rodney, in an hour-long attack, incapacitated the Bismarck, and an hour and a half later it sank after being hit by three torpedoes from the cruiser Dorsetshire. Of the some 2,300 crew aboard the Bismarck, only about 110 survived.\n\nIn 1989 an expedition led by American oceanographer Robert Ballard located the wreck of the Bismarck.

Over five thousand spectators came to the launching to listen to speeches, listen to the band music, participate in a banquet and have a \"gala.\"Note the large logs used to roll the ship to the river. The ship was about 400 tons and was driven by a double propeller. The ship sailed from Salem Willows to Beverly and Marblehead. The ship was spectacularly destroyed in 1892 off of Shirley Point when the ship sank due to an engine fire. Through the efforts of John E. Cassidy, $20,000 was appropriated by the Legislature for the deepening of the Charles River channel which opened up navigation on the river. John E.

{"text":"Diving Operations\n\nPosted Fri, 05\/02\/2008 - 12:50\n\nThe diving survey was split in two units of 15 days with a six day break in between and took place between 4 July and 8 August 2005. Again MV Flatholm of Coastline Surveys was used as support vessel. The project staff consisted of five archaeologists and three crew aboard MV Flatholm. The archaeological team consisted of four divers and an archaeological recorder. Diving roles were rotated within the team. Two divers were appointed as diving supervisors.\n\nAll dives were conducted using surface supplied diving equipment with Kirby Morgan 28 band masks.\n\nThe diving panel, communication box and video recording equipment were set up in the survey container next to the recording computers and the SCOUT system. The air supply consisted of five 300bar J-bottles secured to the outside of the survey container. After each dive the cylinders were recharged using an onboard diesel HP compressor.\n\nOn the starboard side of the vessel a gate was cut into the rail to provide safe access to the water via a diving ladder. The umbilicals were stowed on the open working deck.\n\nThe dive team generally consisted of diving supervisor and recording system operator in the survey container, standby diver and tender on deck and one diver in the water. On some of the shallower sites the standby diver was used in-water alongside the main diver to aid with recording or to obtain digital video and stills footage of the main diver.\n\nEvery dive was recorded on miniDV tape using a colourwatch digital video system with hat mounted camera. A Canon Powershot G2 in Ikelite housing with Ikelite DS 125 substrobe was used to take digital still photographs. A .56 Sea and Sea wide-angle lens allowed the photography of larger objects from close distances.\n\nIn addition to the diver recording system based on acoustic tracking, conventional recording methods, such as offset drawing, were used on the dived wreck sites.\n\nDepending on the desired level of recording, underwater photography, videography, sketches and drawings were used. Trilateration and offset measurements were acquired with folding rules or tape measures.\n\nYou can see how the methods worked by looking at the Bottle Wreck. This wreck was recorded using traditional marine archaeologcial methods. A 32m by 10m grid was established around the visible remains of shipwreck and cargo. The pipe cargo mound and individual artefacts were then drawn in relation to the grid using offset and trilateration methods. To link the site grid to real world co-ordinates accurate fix points were taken for each of the grid corner points with the USBL system. To speed up the drawing and recording process, measurements were obtained by the diver, but the drawing was carried out by the supervisor on the surface. This was done using the live video link provided by the colourwatch system"}

{"text":"The world is filled with amazing coincidences, from lottery winners who seem to always be lucky to countless stories of people who succeed at impossible tasks despite all odds. However, there are some coincidences that go past the average \"breaking the laws of probability,\" ending straight into the twilight zone. Here are some of the most mysterious and unexplainable coincidences ever recorded.\n\n1.\n\nFutility, or the Wreck of the Titan\n\nMorgan Robertson wrote a story about an \"unsinkable\" ocean liner named Titan fourteen years before the Titanic actually met with its unfortunate end. The ship in the book was supposedly unsinkable and the same sizes as the actual Titanic. However where the story becomes weird is the little details mentioned in the book:\n\nfor example, just like the real Titanic, Titan sinks after hitting an iceberg at around midnight in April. Both in the book and in reality the ship meets its end 400 miles from Newfoundland while traveling at around 24 knots.\n\nWhile it could be argued that if there was an iceberg in the Atlantic it would most likely be near Newfoundland, the speed of the titanic was definitely unusual, as it was travelling faster than normal in order to reach the U.S. earlier than scheduled.\n\nAnother interesting coincidence is that both ships were hit in the starboard and both the Titan and the real Titanic had too few life boats. Robertson mentions four life boats more in his story than the Titanic actually had. That's a pretty lucky guess if you ask us.\n\n2.\n\nThe Sandwich that Caused the First World War\n\nThe First World War had many reasons behind it; however the official reason that started hostilities was the assassination of Frantz Ferdinand by Gavrilo Princip. What is really interesting about the story is the way the assassination happened. Gavrilo was a member of the Black Hand which was a Slavic independence organization who had killing Ferdinand as their goal. Their plan was relatively simple: just throw a grenade at Ferdinand while he was passing by as part of a parade.\n\nHowever, something had gone wrong and the grenade exploded a few seconds too late, destroying the car behind Ferdinand. Normally this would have been the end of the story and the First World War would have needed another reason to start. Unfortunately Ferdinand decided to go to the local hospital to see what happened to the people in the car behind him.\n\nFor some reason the driver of the car had no idea how to navigate the city of Sarajevo and he stopped right next to a coffee house where Gavrilo Princip was eating a sandwich. Gavrilo recognized Ferdinand and shot him, thus causing one of the bloodiest wars in all of human history, all because of a sandwich.\n\n3.\n\nJames Dean and his cursed car\n\nJames Dean, the famous American rebel, inspired hundreds of people remaining in our collective memory as the perpetual bad boy. What is really interesting and very creepy about him is the story of his death. In December of 1955 James crashed his Porsche Spyder into another car. Despite the fact that James had a passenger who flew through the windshield no one else was hurt in the accident, except Dean who died. Interesting enough the actor had made a car safety public service announcement just days earlier, warning people not to drive too fast during the holiday season.\n\nHowever, where the story becomes really creepy is what happened to Dean's car. After it was towed away from the crash site it broke a mechanic's legs as a chain slipped. The motor was placed in another Porsche Spyder which also crashed killing the driver. The tires were bought by a New York man who apparently had an accident while driving with them. Even a driver that had the transmission from Dean's car installed in his racing car was killed as something failed and he lost control of the automobile.\n\nThe shell of the James Dean car was placed on display in Sacramento where it broke free from the chains holding it and broke a teenager's hip. After this it was transported to Oregon, but the truck delivering it crashed into a store and the shell was supposedly stolen.\n\nAccording to another story the shell was displayed again and broke into pieces for no apparent reason.\n\nThe sandwich is completely irrelevant. It played absolutely no more part in Ferdinand's assassination\u2014or Gavrilo's pulling of the trigger\u2014than the tires on the car, or the time of day, or the washcloth hanging up in a bathroom in Zurich. Now, if Ferdinand had said \"I'm craving a sandwich, please pull over at that deli over there\", and Gavrilo had been eating the exact same type at that exact same restaurant, then the sandwich would have been a candidate for coincidence.\n\nNomadicView\n\nI recall hearing a story about a man who transferred from one university to another and upon arriving there, was surprised that everybody seemed to know him. They called him by a different name, but they all were familiar with him. He spend a couple of days living this weird situation until he was startled to learn that there was another man who looked exactly like him in the campus. He later learned that he had been adopted and this was his twin brother. Of course a story like this always makes it into the local news in the last five minutes reserved for quirky items. The pair soon learned that many of the events in their lives were paralleled. Events and names of girlfriends, that sort of thing. Now here comes the kicker. As a result of the broadcast, another man stepped forward. It was a THIRD brother- they had been triplets and he himself had been planning to transfer to that same university. This is the story as far as I recall. It happened in the 70s or 80s. Frankly I wouldn't have believed it but there were many photographs of the three of them reunited.\n\nD Shearwood\n\nJames Dean died in September, 1955 not December\n\nThat1Guy\n\nI enjoyed the emphasis on #4.

{"text":"Tag Archives: spanish american war\n\nIn 1898 Spain was a weak and declining power with overseas territories which were seething with resentment to Spanish rule and ripe for the pickings of any power that wanted to challenge Spain. The United States was beginning its ascendency to becoming a world power and the Spanish colony of Cuba, which had many American economic interests and the possession of which could allow the United States to dominate the Caribbean was considered by many American political and economic leaders to be ripe for the picking. It was just a short distance from the United States, had a restive population whose cause was being promoted and exploited by the Yellow journalists of the Hearst media empire.\n\nIn response to the alleged dangers faced by American citizens in Havana, President McKinley sent the USS Maine to Cuba to safeguard American interests and citizens. The deployment was part of a larger world wide deployment of US Navy forces in the Caribbean, Europe and Asia. On February 15th the Maine blew up and sank. The American press declared it to be an act of terrorism perpetrated by Spanish agents in Havana. A US Navy investigation concluded that such was the case, while Spanish investigators concluded Maine's loss was due to a magazine explosion. The truth of the matter was that the Maine blew up and the cause is inconclusive with experts, including a commission led by Admiral Hyman Rickover in 1974 determining that the cause could have been an internal ammunition magazine explosion, while others do not rule out the possibility of a Spanish mine.\n\nRegardless of the actual cause tensions rapidly escalated and on April 23rd Spain declared war on the United States. On the 25th Congress declared war on Spain. In the Pacific the US Navy Asiatic Squadron under the command of Commodore George Dewey set sail from Honk Kong to Manila, where a poorly equipped squadron of mostly obsolete ships under the command of Admiral Patricio Montojo awaited them.\n\nThe US Navy forces were modern and well equipped compared to the Spanish. Composed of 4 relatively modern protected cruisers and 2 gunboats led by the Protected Cruiser USS Olympia. Dewey's force was well trained and its ships superior to anything in the Spanish squadron. The Spanish ships, undermanned and some of which had much of their armament shipped ashore to supplement shore batteries were composed of 4 unprotected cruisers, two small protected cruisers and two gunboats. A number of smaller and even less capable ships were in the area but took no part in the action.\n\nDewey's squadron sailed into Manila Bay on the evening of the 30th of April, surprising Montojo who believed that the approaches to the bay were too treacherous to navigate at night for mariners unfamiliar with them. Arriving in Manila Bay in the early morning hours and ineffectively opposed by shore batteries at El Fraile and Cavite and at 0541 Dewey ordered the Captain of the Olympia to open fire using the famous line \"You may fire when ready Gridley.\"\n\nWithin two and a half hours the Spanish force was destroyed. Dewey lost one man dead and 9 men wounded though some Spanish sources report that Dewey might have lost 13 killed and 30 wounded. The Spanish force lost all of its engaged forces with 77 men killed and 271 wounded. Dewey's force would destroy the Spanish shore batteries and land Marines taking possession of the Cavite Naval Yard on May 7th.\n\nThe action was the first major naval action conducted by the United States overseas in the steam age and helped secure the United States a place in the early 20th Century colonization of Asia by European powers and Japan. As a result of Dewey's victory other Spanish possessions in the Pacific like Guam would be occupied by the United States. It would also through the American occupation of the Philippines necessitate a campaign against the recently liberated Filipino population who had looked to the United States as liberators, and eventually to the Philippines becoming a major campaign in the Pacific war between Japan and the United States.\n\nThe wreck of the Spanish Flagship the Cruiser Regina Cristina\n\nDestroying the Montojo's Spanish squadron was easy compared to the American counter-insurgency campaign against the Filipinos and the later conflict with the Japanese in the Second World War. However, Dewey's defeat of Montojo's squadron would help establish the United States as a world power and help ensure that the United States Navy would become one of the world's preeminent Naval forces within a decade of the battle. Spain never fully recovered from the battle or the war and declined in influence. eventually succumbing to a violent civil war in the 1930s.\n\nAs a so common the initial battle or battles of a war can seem easy compared to the later tasks of occupying and ruling a conquered territory or the unexpected consequences that follow. As such it should serve as a warning for those that see easy conquests and do not calculate what might happen after the initial battle is won tide 9 also requiredThere is news concerning the Flagship of Admiral Dewey during the Battle of Manila Bay in 1898. The one a kind ship and the only surviving steel warship of her era has been moored in Philadelphia since 1957 when she was taken over by the Cruiser Olympia Association in 1957 and restored to her 1898 configuration. Since 1957 she has been a museum ship in Philadelphia and in 1996 the Cruiser Olympia Association merged with the Independence Seaport Museum due to the major costs of upkeep. Since then she has been moored at Penn's Landing where she has been open for tours. During the Fall of 2010 the museum announced plans to close the ship due to the poor material condition of the ship which has not been in drydock or had a major overhaul since 1957 as well as the high operating costs. However the Olympia has been kept open for tours and the museum plans on keeping her open through March 2011.\n\nThe museum and a new group dedicated to saving the ship, the Friends of the Cruiser Olympia has announced that they cannot raise the funding for the repairs needed to maintain the ship in Philadelphia. The Independence Seaport Museum Chief Executive Officer John Gazzola said the museum cannot raise the at minimum amount of $10 million needed to dredge the marina where she is moored, dry dock the ship and repair Olympia's hull and deck. A bid request has been issued for organizations that might want to obtain and preserve the ship. A group from Vallejo California the Navy Yard Association which is made up of former workers from Mare Island Naval Shipyard has announced their intention to bid on the ship when the auction takes place in February. In order to raise money the group plans on trying to align itself with non-profit groups since they are not.\n\nThe Christening of the USS Olympia at San Francisco's Union Iron Works\n\nThe Olympia was built at San Francisco's Union Iron Works in 1892 and if the group is successful this could return the ship to the place that she left for her assignment in the Far East in 1895. This is a unique ship and she needs to be preserved. Despite her status as a National Historic Landmark she has been allowed to deteriorate to the point that major repairs are necessary. If a bidder cannot be found and the ship is unable to be restored it is possible that she could be scrapped or sunk as a reef foremostI am a historian and for that matter to be more specific a military historian. I have had a very busy week in \"real life\" but I saw a couple of articles last week about the cruiser USS Olympia. It seems that this warship, a symbol of American industry and power at the end of the 19th and turn of the 20th Century is in danger of being scrapped or disposed of as an artificial reef of Cape May New Jersey if a benefactor is not found to help pay the more than 5 million dollars needed to keep this national and international maritime treasure afloat. The 5 million is just the immediate cost, it is estimated that it may take up to 19.5 million dollars to dry-dock her and make the extensive repairs to her hull. Olympia is not the first historic US Navy ship to be threatened by the ravages of time, the Frigate USS Constitution,\n\nThe Olympia was one of the first steel and steam warships of the United States Navy and is the oldest steel warship in the United States Navy still afloat. She was a transitional ship as the Navy entered the modern age and her design was revolutionary for her time. Displacing 5870 tons and with a length of 344 feet she was She was powered by reciprocating steam engines and capable of 20 knots. She had twin revolving turrets which housed her main battery of four 8 inch guns and mounted a secondary battery of ten 5 inch guns which protruded from her superstructure on the main deck. She also retained sails as part of her design and was the first US Navy ship with a refrigeration plant and ice making machines.\n\nShe was the Flagship of Admiral Dewey at the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish American War and her last mission was to bring the body of the \"Unknown Soldier\" back from France following the First World War. The launched on November 5th 1892 and commissioned on 5 February 1895 Olympia was decommissioned for the final time in on December 9th 1922. She would continue her US Navy career in an inactive status after being reclassified as a miscellaneous auxiliary. She remained as a Navy asset until she was acquired by the Cruiser Olympia Association on 11 SEP 1957 and was classified as a National Historic Landmark on 29 January 1964 and transferred to the Independence Seaport Museum in January 1995.\n\nOlympia is in dire need of dry-docking and major repairs to her hull. Despite Federal Government regulations and sound maritime practices which stipulate that museum ships should be dry-docked and repaired at the minimum of every 20 years the Olympia has not been dry-docked or repaired since 1957. She has numerous patches and her caretakers keep constant watch on her to ensure that no leak develops that could sink her. Additionally water now leaks through her decks into her hull causing further problems with rust and hull deterioration.\n\nThe Olympia is a National Historic Landmark listed on the National Register of Historic Places (1964), a National Historic Engineering Landmark (1977), and National Historic Maritime Landmark (1988) and was awarded \"Official Project\" status of Save America's Treasures program (1999).\n\nShe will be closed as an attraction on the Philadelphia waterfront on November 22nd as the caretakers and the Navy determines her fate. Ultimately the Navy will have the final say in Olympia's fate; even so efforts need to be made to enlist private and corporate sponsors to help save this treasure. As of the present time these efforts have been unsuccessful.\n\nNaval Historian and author of a book on Olympia Lawrence Burr commented: \"It's an absolute national disgrace. It's an appalling situation. She is a national symbol, and she marks critical points in time both in America's development as a country and the Navy's emergence as a global power.\"\n\nThe \"Friends of the Cruiser Olympia\"  as well as former Secretary of the Navy John Lehman and former US Representative Curt Weldon are leading the charge to see Olympia restored and reopened.\n\nOlympia is not the first US Navy historic ship to be in such dire need. The first was the USS Constitution which was going to be broken up in 1830 until the public inspired by Oliver Wendell Homes' poem elicited the money needed to repair that ship which was again threatened in the 1920s and was saved by a private-public endeavor urged by the Secretary of the Navy Curtis D. Wilbur which included a drive where children contributed thousands of dollars of pennies to the restoration effort and where prints of \"Old Ironsides\" were sold for .50 each. Certainly it will take a creative effort to save Olympia and preserve her for history and those Americans that come after us.\n\nI go to Baltimore to see an Orioles game on October 1st and may take a short trip to Philadelphia to visit the Olympia and if I do I will do an update with my own photos.\n\nLead aircraft ready to take off of IJN Carrier Akagi to attack Pearl Harbor beginning a 6 month chain of Japanese victories in the Pacific\n\nThe outcome of the Pacific war was directly related to the ability of the Americans to adjust strategy to the realities of the Pacific war, a unity of effort directed by the National Command Authority and superior industrial, technological and logistical capabilities. The Japanese after initial success did little to adapt and were hamstrung by inter-service rivalries and inadequate industrial capacity and limited natural resources.\n\nUS Destroyer USS Pope being blasted out of the water by Japanese Cruisers at the Battle of Java Sea\n\nThe Japanese and the Americans each had war plans in place for the Pacific campaign. The American plans, Plan Orange had been developed since the early part of the 20th Century after the Spanish-American War and Russo-Japanese War. Predicated on holding the Philippines until relief could arrive Orange assumed that the US Pacific Fleet would sail across the Pacific and fight the Japanese Navy in a manner written about by Alfred Thayer Mahan; see Weigley in The American Way of War and Ronald Spector in \"Eagle Against the Sun: The American War Against Japan.\"\n\nIJN Carrier Hiryu heavily damaged and abandoned at Midway. Hiryu, Akagi, Kaga and Soryu the creme of the Japanese carrier fleet were lost at Midway, the Japanese found it hard to replace them or their decimated air crews\n\nThe Japanese were conflicted. The Navy desired a campaign that would destroy the American Navy and expand the Empire to the East and to Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean. The Army was fixated on the China strategy having been embroiled on the Asian continent since the early 1930s. John Toland discusses this in good detail in his book \"Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936-1945\" In addition other Japanese Army leaders had designs on Siberia and fought a brief campaign against the Soviets which ended in a defeat.\n\nJapanese destroyer shown sinking after being torpedoed by a US submarine\n\nWhen the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor as well as the Philippines and Southeast Asia defeating American and Allied forces in detail, crippling the American Navy and dooming the Philippines the Americans were able to adjust strategy to first a defensive one supplemented by raids against the Japanese perimeter by carrier forces and the beginnings of a nascent submarine campaign against Japanese merchant shipping. The Americans were able to parry the Japanese thrust at the Coral Sea and inflict a major defeat on the Japanese Carrier Forces at Midway prior to launching the first limited offensive by the Navy and the Marines at Guadalcanal.\n\nAircraft like the F6F Hellcat drove Japanese aircraft such as the A6M2 Zero from the skies in the Pacific\n\nThe Japanese remained mired in their conflicting strategies with the Navy primarily fighting the Pacific campaign aided by limited Army and Army Air Forces on the islands Japan had occupied or fortified while the bulk of the Army was engaged in China, Southeast Asia or sitting on the Manchurian-Soviet border.\n\nHeavily fortified Japanese islands were either bypassed or taken in bloody assaults, here a 8\u2033 gun on Tarawa\n\nOnce the Americans shifted to the offensive a campaign of island hopping coordinated between the Southwest Pacific Area under General MacArthur and the Central Pacific Area under Admiral Nimitz focused on gaining control of islands which contained airbases and anchorages capable of sustaining the American advance while bypassing islands not necessary for this along with their Army garrisons. Both American advances in the South Pacific and Central Pacific focused on retaking the Philippines and cutting the Japanese lines of communication and supply with Southeast Asia. From late 1942 on the Japanese strategy was focused on individual areas of danger versus a overall coordinated defensive effort.\n\nJapanese war industries were woefully ill equipped to match US war production. Here a factory producing Oscar fighter planes\n\nThe Japanese were hamstrung from the beginning of the war by limited natural resources, especially oil and oil refining capacities, limited industrial capacity, especially in the realm of the manufacture of steel and machining tools. All of these were supplied in large part by their opponents and were cut off once the war began.\n\nThe Carrier Taiho was the equivalent of the Essex Class but the Japanese could only produce one unit\n\nMichael Barnhart in his book Japan Prepares for Total War\" has an excellent account of the limitations of Japanese economic, industrial and natural resource capacities, as well as the continual struggle by the Army and the Navy for priority in access to them and the inability of Japanese planners, both civilian and military to resolve this conflict. The Americans had a different situation; although American industrial capacity was enormous it had to be split between to Theaters of Operations and support the needs of American Allies, Britain, the Soviet Union, Canada and China.\n\nAn Armada of US Essex Class Carriers in 1944 the Japanese could not keep pace with US Naval production\n\nDespite this the Americans in a relatively short time were able to amass forces equal to or great than the Japanese who were unable to replace losses in ships, aircraft or the highly trained personnel needed to man them. At the beginning of the war Japanese Air and Naval forces in the Pacific outmatched everything the Allies could offer, however once they began to experience significant losses at Midway and during the Guadalcanal Campaign their air and naval capabilities diminished to the point that they had to conserve ships and aircraft hoping to be able to gain local advantage in critical defensive areas.\n\nThe US Amphibious warfare capacity was a key factor in the ability of the United States to take the war to Japan\n\nNew American ships and aircraft introduced during the war were superior to Japanese designs, many of which had reached their apex by 1942. American advantages in radar, communications equipment added to American advantages throughout the war. Japanese ground forces in the Pacific were dependant on the Navy and merchant marine for supply and reinforcements. As the American submarine campaign became better organized this became more difficult as the American submarines copying German Wolf pack tactics decimated the Japanese merchant Marine. I particularly like Samuel Elliott Morrison's account of this in \"The Two Ocean War\" and \"The History of US Navy Operations in World War II\" which has a volume devoted to this subject.\n\nUS Navy Submarines cut off Japan from its vital natural resources in Southeast Asia. A Sub Squadron above and USS Barb below\n\nJapanese forces would always fight determined battles but they often expended great amounts of manpower in senseless Banzai charges rather than make the Americans force them out of well prepared positions. Where the Japanese maintained excellent defense such as at Tarawa and Iwo Jima they made the Americans pay greatly for their gains. American Marines were apart from the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions were the best infantry in the US Military and their skill at amphibious operations and integrated air-ground and naval warfare increased as the war went on. The Americans were well equipped with modern weapons while the Japanese operated antiquated tanks and often substandard artillery.\n\nJapanese leadership at the strategic and political level was inept throughout the war. They failed to coordinate any strategy with the Germans and failed to enunciate any sort of Grand Strategy. On the operational and tactical levels the Japanese forces, especially the surface navy performed well, however as the American numeric and technologic advantage increased the Navy became less effective. After the death of Admiral Yamamoto in 1943 Japanese Naval Leadership became far less effective. The Americans as mentioned before were able to devise a Grand Strategy which not only dealt with Japan but also Germany and coordinated the efforts of forces, war production, planning and logistics to advance their war aims. At the operational and tactical level American forces, especially the Navy and Marines and later the Army Air Forces and Army became more skilled and than their Japanese counterparts with the possible exception of General Simon Bol\u00edvar Buckner at Okinawa. See Spector and Thomas Costello \"The Pacific War.\" In the air the Americans continued to increase their combat capabilities at the tactical and strategic level and used massed fire bombing raids to devastate the Japanese homeland. The Japanese in contrast due to inexperienced pilots and fewer competitive aircraft were forced into suicide or Kamikaze missions as the war neared Japan.\n\nB-29 Super-fortresses leveled Japanese cities and even excellent fighters like the Mitsubishi J2M Raiden could not stop them\n\nThe outcome of the Pacific war was directly related to the ability of the Americans to adjust strategy to the realities of the Pacific war as well as the unity of effort which enabled the American superiority in industrial, technological and logistical capabilities to overwhelm the Japanese. The Japanese after initial success did little to adapt and were hamstrung by inter-service rivalries and inadequate industrial capacity and limited natural resources, fell behind in technology and were unable to replace losses among the ships, men and aircraft that they needed to fight an effective war. Japanese leaders at many levels failed to adapt strategy, tactics or methods to match the reality of the war and the places that they did do so were done by local commanders and never instituted throughout the Japanese military."}

{"text":"There was actually a fair bit of surface warfare in Europe. Mostly it was clashes between Britain and Italy in the Med as far as heavy weights were concerned. But there was a goodly amount of destroyer on destroyer action, destroyer on torpedo boat action, and mine laying out the ass all in the north.\n\nKind of a shame, the Italians actually had a fine and capable navy for the time, but poor planning and even poorer officers\/bureaucracy saw a lot of them crippled at port or defeated in avoidable situations.\n\nI also think that the Germans attempted, at least early in the war, to operate under the doctrine of Decisive Fleet Engagement. Instead of focusing on the development of aircraft carriers, the evolution of large battleships and their applications in combat were the focus on most developed navies between 1898 and the late 1930s. The Japanese were particularly fond of extremely large naval weapons platforms and developed the doctrine of decisive fleet engagement as a result. The general idea is use the full force of your surface fleet in a single hammerblow against opposing forces. They liked the idea of using their enormous battle wagons to completely decimate enemy navies in single engagements. It was effective to a degree, the reason the Soviets have a difficult time fielding significant naval forces in the first half of the 20th century can be directly tied to their devastating loss at the Straights of Tsushima in 1905. The Japanese managed to maneuver the entire Soviet fleet into the narrow straights and proceeded to wipe the majority of it away. I believe that this idea served prominently to influence the battleship heavy German High Seas Fleet of WWI, and contributed to the lack of air craft carriers later. After the intentional scuttle in 1919 at Skapa Flow and the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, naval innovation and development almost completely stagnated until the mid 1930s. The restrictions between wars allowed other navies to advance, but not the German's own. Hence, Hitler's rearmamanet program did not have an incredible amount of room for research and develop on such a scale as would be needed to develop an aircraft carrier. Instead, it was far simpler, and much faster to improve on existing models (whether battleship, destroyer, U-boat, etc) resulting in the U-boat packs and surface combat of the North Atlantic theater.\n\nThat tactical doctrine actually predates Tsushima. Mahan advocated it in 1890 with his book The Influence of Sea Power Upon History: 1660-1783 All the major powers were strongly influenced by it. Kaiser Wilhelm II is rumored to have slept with a copy on his nightstand. Tsushima was the logical consequence of his ideas in an ideal form, not the progenitor."}
{"text":"Wreck Diving Brings IBMer Face to Face With Lost History\n\nAbout 130 feet beneath the waves rests U-853, the last German U-boat sunk as World War II ended. It's off the East Coast of the U.S. about seven miles from Block Island, R.I., and not far from another wreck, the SS Black Point, a commercial collier the U-853 torpedoed a day earlier, May 5, 1945, at the Battle of Judith Point.\n\nJohn Eells has seen both wrecks. A certified technical diver, he's a member of IBM's z\/OS* technical marketing and strategy team in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. In his spare time, he wreck dives mostly in the North Atlantic along the coasts of New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and New Jersey.\n\nFirst certified to scuba dive in 1972 at the age of 15, Eells took a long hiatus from diving until about eight years ago. \"Then my youngest son\u2014he was about 15 at the time\u2014came down from the attic one day with my old gear and said, 'What's all this stuff?' \" The teen was eager to learn and earned his recreational diving certification soon after.\n\nThe father and son's first wreck dive was the Raleigh, a steamer that sank in 1911 in Lake Erie near Port Colborne, Ontario. It remains the oldest wreck Eells has explored\u2014and the shallowest, at about 25-30 feet under water. \"I just got hooked,\" he recalls. \"People had walked the deck of this ship. To see and touch it firsthand was remarkable.\" To dive much deeper wrecks, Eells and his son underwent further training and earned a variety of technical diving certifications.\n\nU-boats, however, hold a particular interest for Eells. He wants to dive the U-869 wreck, which was sunk off the coast of New Jersey and rests at a depth of about 240 feet. Previously believed to have been sunk near Gibraltar, the wreck of the U-869 was initially nicknamed U-Who because its identity was in question. Then in 1997, wreck diver John Chatterton discovered an artifact that verified its true identity. The events were documented in several books, including the \"The Last Dive\" in 2000, and \"Shadow Divers\" in 2004.\n\n\"It's definitely on my bucket list,\" Eells notes. It would be among the deepest wrecks he's attempted. \"My certification limit is 330 feet,\" he says.\n\nTo go that deep, divers often use applications to help calculate decompression time, how much gas they will need, and when to change the mix of oxygen, nitrogen and helium they breathe. At certain depths, the percentage of oxygen in air becomes toxic, Eells explains, which is one reason divers must adjust the gas mixes during a dive. Also, they often need to make decompression stops as they ascend to avoid decompression sickness, which can be fatal.\n\nIn addition to specialized equipment and careful preparation before a dive, you must plan for contingencies, Eells says. \"Also, in technical diving, you have to get comfortable with the idea that many important things are not truly absolute, and that you must often rely on approximations. It takes a certain mindset.\"\n\nSo why do it?\n\n\"Just curiosity,\" Eells says. \"It's like when people ask, 'Why climb Mount Everest?' It was there.\"\n\nIBM Systems Magazine is a trademark of International Business Machines Corporation.

{"text":"Fletchers Slip History\n\nFletcher's Slip\n\nFletcher's Slip was an important asset to the people of South Australia. It was the site of the first slipway, enabling full repairs and maintenance of the local ships and ships visiting the colony. As a British outpost that was completely reliant on sea transport for communication, trade and travel, a functioning slipway was very important for the colony's development.\n\nPreviously shipping at the port requiring repair had to go to one of the other colonies, or ships needing to be cleaned were pulled-up and leant over on the shore - an activity termed careening.\n\nWe wish to bring the City of Adelaide back to Port Adelaide and establish her alongside other Adelaide maritime treasures such as the ketch Falie and 1883 tug-lighter Nelcebee. To learn more about our past 2007 planning click here.\n\nHenry Cruickshank Fletcher (1820-1912)\n\nHenry Cruickshank Fletcher (1820-1912) was born Henry Cruickshank Flett at Strathness on the Orkney Islands in Scotland. Henry completed an apprenticeship as a shipwright while still in Scotland. In 1849, H C Fletcher arrived in Port Adelaide on the Camilla with his wife Robina, son John and daughter Robina.\n\nThe patent slip was brought to Kangaroo Island in 1837 by the South Australia Company, and was left at Kingscote until 1845, when it was shipped across to Port Adelaide, but again remained unassembled. Fletcher acquired and installed the slip. He leased a two acre piece of land from the South Australia Company at \u00a310 per year for twenty-one years. The site was on the northern (Birkenhead) side of the Port River opposite the wharves at which many of the ships visiting the Port would unload.\n\nThe installation of the original slip and construction of the surrounding buildings began in September 1849 on reclaimed land built-up using the silt from the dredging of the river bottom. A thrifty Scotsman, Fletcher used ships ballast in the construction of the buildings, slip walls and slip floors. The slip was completed and functioning by 1851. Its winch was powered by an eight-man windlass and reducing gears.\n\nThe first boat to be launched from the slip after repairs was the Panama. The slip was very successful and H C Fletcher had a flourishing business. Soon he was able to stop using the man-powered winch and installed a steam-powered winch instead. The first support building on the site was a wrights and blacksmiths shed. This was followed with an engine house to which an extra storey was later added to serve as a storeroom and mould loft.\n\nAfter a few years the tramway developed some faults, and the size of the vessels which could be taken up had to be reduced to below 1,000 tons. Increasing business and the fact that his slip was not able to work to full capacity led Fletcher in 1862 to purchase a patent Dunnikier Slip from the Dunnikier Foundry of Kirkcaldy, Scotland. It was designed to be able to take 2,000 tons. but trouble with the installation meant this was not available until 1867, when the first ship drawn up on this slip was the Edinburgh of 1,500 tons. The new slip extended 360 feet into the Port River along the river bottom, approximately to the middle of the Gawler Reach.\n\nH C Fletcher was only willing to undertake the building of a larger slip because he was able to gain the necessary extra land from the South Australia Company. In the speeches at the opening of the Dunnikier Slip a great deal was made of the fact that such important maritime infrastructure had been completed by an individual without recourse to the government purse.\n\nFletcher's business continued to expand repairing sailing ships and iron steamers. The composite ship Torrens was one of the more notable vessels repaired at Fletcher's Shipyard. It had reportedly collided with an iceberg and its bow was severely damaged.\n\nAlthough initially Fletcher was in the ship repair business, he later expanded into shipbuilding as well. In the early 1860s, Fletcher had constructed two stern wheel paddle-steamers for the River Murray trade. Settler and Lady Daly were not successful on the Murray because of their length which made negotiating the many twists of the river difficult.\n\nAt least part of the success of Fletcher's Slip came from the fact that the Adelaide Steamship Company used it to repair and maintain its ships, although there were other slips at the port. It was only when some of the company's boats became too big for either the original slip or the Dunnikier Slip that they began to send them to the other colonies for maintenance and repair, yet they continued to use Fletcher's Slip for all of the boats which it would take.\n\nFletcher became a prominent member of the Port Adelaide community; he was consulted about the bridge across the Port River and was a member of the Port Adelaide Institute Committee. He became a very wealthy man, and was able to buy partnerships for his sons John and William in the Etna Iron Works. He also bought his son Henry Cruickshank jnr a farm at Clarendon called 'Prior's Court'. His fourth son Tom was employed as the secretary at Fletcher's Slip. After living in a house at Fletcher's Slip with his family, he bought a grand house called 'The Brocas' at Woodville in 1873.\n\nFletcher almost built a Graving Dock (a dry dock) as well. To resolve legal arguments with the Marine Board, which wanted to build its own, a parliamentary Act was passed in 1886 to allow its construction, and give Fletcher ownership of a small piece of the river bottom fronting his property. The Graving Dock was never completed due to a number of problems. Seepage from the striking of an underground spring was a major hurdle, and costs to seal this seepage and complete the Graving Dock would have been high. To make matters worse this problem was encountered just after the 1890 shipping strike and during the 1890's depression. Both of these impacted on the business of Fletcher's Slip, and Fletcher was forced to sell his son's farm.\n\nThe Graving Dock was completed almost to the point of installing the end gates, when Fletcher abandoned the plan about 1896. It had to be stopped or he risked losing Fletcher's Slip which had cost so much to develop and was the basis of his business. The site became a popular swimming spot, and was used as the venue for several swimming competitions. Later it was modified and used by Glanville Dockyards as a dock.\n\nFletcher retired to his house 'The Brocas' at Woodville, and died there in 1912 at the age of 91. His son William Fletcher took over the running of Fletcher's Slip.\n\nIn 1917, Fletcher's Slip was acquired by the Harbours Board, and three years later was leased to the Adelaide Steamship Company, who replaced the steam winch with an electric one in the 1950's. In 1957 their subsidiary company Adelaide Ship Construction Ltd was established on the site. After this company closed down in 1973, use of the site lapsed. The mechanics of the slip no longer exist, but the slip-way is still in existence, and until recently was the property of the late Jaan Lindsaar. The site is now the property of the Land Management Coporation and is heritage listed with the Port Adelaide Enfield Council.\n\nThe City of Adelaide and Fletcher's Slip\n\nIn general, the City of Adelaide survived very well with the dangers of wind, waves and rocky shores, but there were two disconcerting major mishaps in her years of sailing the oceans.\n\nIn August 1874, within a few hours of completing her voyage from London to Port Adelaide, she was beating up St Vincent's Gulf at night in a very heavy storm with Captain Llewellyn Bowen at the helm fighting the elements. Despite all the crew's efforts, she was driven aground on the soft sand at Kirkcaldy Beach near Grange.\n\nNext day those on board were transferred to a steamer by small boats and taken ashore. The cargo was unloaded onto barges, and the ship was enlightened by removing some of the masts and yards. She was successfully towed off on the next high tide a week later, and taken into a Port Adelaide wharf. Later in September, the City of Adelaide was moved onto Fletcher's Slip where the damage was assessed by the Harbour Master, and she underwent minor repairs.\n\nThe loss of her rudder in heavy weather south of Kangaroo Island in November 1877, eight days out of Port Augusta en route for London, was the second of the more dramatic events. The ship was in great danger and saved only by the superb seamanship of Captain Edward Alston, who was able to bring the City of Adelaide around by trailing chains overboard and, after a perilous voyage through Backstairs Passage, limp into Port Adelaide for repair on Fletcher's Slip.\n\nNo single piece of wood large enough for the main piece could be found for the replacement, so it was made from two pieces of grey ironbark, scarphed together, and fitted with brass fittings. Captain E.D. Alston subsequently took the ship back to England via the Cape Horn without mishap. Like the ship, the rudder still survives, and represents a major accomplishment for the shipwrights of Adelaide at the time.\n\nThe Rudder\n\nThe Rudder of the City of Adelaide lying near the clipper at the slipway in Irvine Scotland, 2003. Photographer Peter Roberts\n\nIn 2005, Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries (DPI&F) scientists helped British archeologists to confirm that the surviving City of Adelaide rudder, much damaged by time and seawater, was the one built in Adelaide in 1877. The scientists were able to confirm that the rudder was scarphed and made from Australian grey ironbark proving it to be the 1877 rudder."}

{"text":"Commander Robert Falcon Scott RN was selected to lead the expedition. Scott, the son of a Devonshire brewer with naval connections, had entered naval training school at just 13. He progressed first to midshipman and then lieutenant and served in both the Caribbean and the Pacific. On 5 June 1899, Scott, who had been serving as a torpedo lieutenant on the Majestic, met Sir Clements Markham in a London street. Markham was returning from a Royal Geographical Society Council meeting at which the impending Antarctic expedition had been discussed and Scott immediately volunteered to command the expedition. Markham, who was familiar with Scott's background, already had him at the head of a list of potential candidates for the position of expedition leader.\n\nMarkham proposed the building of a new ship and, on 21 March 1901, a 52.4 metre purpose-built vessel constructed by Dundee Shipbuilders Company Limited,was launched on the River Tay by Lady Markham and named Discovery.\n\nReflecting its large budget, the expedition was planned on a grand scale with such equipment as two army balloons for reconnaissance, a windmill to generate electric power and a number of dogs. The Discovery sailed from London on 31 July 1901 with a great fanfare from passing craft and a full salute from the training ship Worcester.\n\nThe ship then moored at Cowes for the yacht-racing week where King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra came on board. According to Dr Edward Wilson:\n\nWe were busy the whole morning, till nigh on 11.30 when the King and Queen came on board, clearing up, tidying and putting our smartest bits of apparatus and our prettiest solutions in prominent positions. Microscopes were set out, water bottles, thermometers, everything else arranged and tidied up \u2026\n\nThe King shook hands with us all round as he came on board, and again when he left. The Queen also. The King gave the Victorian Order of the First Class to Captain Scott before leaving, having with great difficulty fished it out of his tail-coat pocket, which was a long way round on the wrong side of his stout figure. He gave us a few words of royal encouragement, was shown off the ship and then left.\n\nThe Discovery made her departure from Cowes the next day, 6 August 1901.

{"text":"On December 26, 1852Hercules departed on her way to Hong Kong to take up duties as a hospital ship. The gold rushes had put a premium on passenger ships to Australia, so she took 756 Scots civilian passengers to South Australia and Victoria for the Emigration Commissioners. Many of these were emigrating under duress from the trustees of the Boreraig, Suishnish and North Uist estates of Lord Macdonald. The voyage proved disastrous, beginning almost immediately with a horrific storm. The ship sought refuge at Rothesay. Soon after their second departure in early January 1853, outbreaks of smallpox and typhus were discovered, necessitating a three-month quarantine at Queenstown, County Cork. 56 people died, 17 orphaned children were returned home and many others were assigned to a dozen other ships, families being broken up in the process. The ship finally arrived in Adelaide in July 1853.\n\nHercules was a Colossus-class battleship built by Palmers, launched on May 10, 1910, and commissioned on July 31, 1911 at Portsmouth. She was a 20,000-ton dreadnought, mounting 10 12-inch guns and capable of 21 knots. She was the flagship for the 2nd Division Home Fleet and from July 1912 to March 1913 she was the flagship of the 2nd Battle Squadron. On March 22, 1913 she collided with a steamer. In August 1914 she joined the Grand Fleet and fought with the 6th Division at the Battle of Jutland. It was HMS Hercules which brought the Allied Armistice Commission to Kiel on December 3, 1918. In February 1919 she was placed in the reserve fleet, and was scrapped at Kiel in 1922"}
{"text":"To maintain his control on the Baltic sea, the king of Sweden Gustave II Adolf gives in 1625, the order to build four warships, of which the \"WASA\". Construction was entrusted to the Dutch naval architect Hendrik Hybertzoon, which made the exact reproduction of a ship built in Holland for the Duke of Guise. Launching probably took place in 1627 and it was towed near the royal palace to receive its armament and its ballast there. On Sunday August 10, 1628, towards 5 p.m., it took the departure for its inaugural voyage, with on its board a supposed crew of 133 sailors and 300 soldiers. The king was at war in Poland at that moment ! A sudden gust of wind laid down the vessel which for lack of ballast and too many weight in the tops, could not be rectified while water was engulfed by the ports of the low battery remained opened and it sank by 35 meters low. For certain historians, badly established sails also contributed to the disaster. In 1664, one arrived using a rudimentary diving bell, to recover 53 of the 64 bronze guns in the wreck. In the decades which followed, all the attempts to bring the wreck afloat failed, and the \"WASA\" was forgotten a little... It is only in 1956 that Mr. Anders FRANZEN found the wreck emerging of the bottom to a 32 meters depth. It is in 1959, when the divers of the Swedish Navy will have completed their difficult work of digging a tunnel under the wreck, that company NEPTUN will release the boat and will move it, in eighteen stages, towards low water, outside Kastelholmen, in the wearing of Stockholm. April 24, 1961, the \"WASA\" is elevated at the level of water, it is emptied of its mud and is towed on its own keel to the basin of Beckholm where it is placed on a provisional concrete pontoon. With the following autumn, it is towed towards its base and is placed in a new cradle especially built for him. The work of rescue is completed, those of conservation can start. February 16, 1962, the building site opens its doors to the public. At the summer 1963, the rescue of the parts of construction and dispersed sculptures start. In 1964, the building site of restoration becomes a unit of Swedish STATENS SJ\u00d6HISTORISKA MUSEUM. In 1967 underwater research is completed after having recorded about 3,500 elements found during these investigations. In 1968, a pontoon rebuilt for the \"WASA\" gives sufficient space to continue the restoration and in April an exposure is open on the building site, showing the majority of the sculptures and the way in which the restoration is carried out. The restoration still currently continues and the publications of the museum make it possible to realize very realistic scale models of a 17th century great vessel.\n\nanother great project and thanks for the history interesting that it sank before it was even in use you would think a ship builder would know to put the proper amount of ballast in a ship before he loaded"}
{"text":"Lightvessel\n\nA lightvessel, or lightship, is a conventional ship which acts as a lighthouse. It has no means of propulsion and is permanently anchored. It is used in waters that are too deep for a lighthouse, and instead of marking coastlines, usually marks marine traffic routes. It is superior to a buoy because its navigational aids are more visible.\n\nLightvessels also usually carry data recorders used in oceanography for research purposes, such as wave recorders.\n\nIn England and Wales, Trinity House is in charge of all lightvessels. All are now unmanned, but had nine crew in the past. There are 11 lightvessels and 2 smaller lightfloats. The first lightvessel was converted to solar power in 1995, and all except the '20 class' have been solarised. The '20 class' represents a slightly larger type of vessel that derives its power from diesel electric generators and has not been solarised due to navigational requirements. Where a main light with a visible range in excess of 20 miles (37 km) is required a '20 class' vessel is used, as the main light from a Trinity House solar lightvessel has a maximum range of 19 nautical miles (35 km). There are currently hull numbers 19, 22, 23 and 25 (the 20 class), 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 17 (solar lightvessels) and LF2 and LF3 (solar lightfloats). Solar lightvessels 93 and 95 have recently been decommissioned and scrapped.\n\nThe official use of lightships in the United States ended March 29, 1985, when the U.S. Coast Guard decomissioned its last such ship, the Nantucket I. Many lightships were replaced with offshore light platforms (called \"Texas Towers\") or large navigational buoys - all of which are cheaper to operate, build and maintain than lightships.\n\n\"Lightvessel\" in other languages: German Feuerschiff, Danish Fyrskib, Swedish Fyrskepp"}

In time, they picked up enough knowledge to become competent seafarers in their turn. By the 18th and 19th centuries training had become more formalised and many seafarers ? especially those wanting to become officers ? spent some time at training establishments on shore.

{"text":"Today HM Coastguard is a world leader in maritime search and rescue. Looking back 200 years, the goods, which now travel by road, were carried by hundreds of small ships. Year in year out dozens of ships and hundreds of lives were lost within sight of the coast. Public shock and dismay at the tragedies drove forward the creation of national life saving organisations. Though its beginnings lie in those decades HM Coastguard originated not to meet the dangers of the seas but to combat a pernicious threat to the country's economy and security - smuggling.\n\nAs soon as Medieval taxes were charged on imports and exports, people began smuggling, shipping goods unseen by Customs officers. In the eighteenth century, Custom duties were imposed on luxuries like silk and lace, tea, tobacco and brandy. At each port, staff from the Customs House searched cargoes and collected dues. At sea, Customs Revenue Cruisers watched for vessels illegally offloading cargo. From 1698 Riding officers patrolled the coast to catch smugglers as they beached cargoes and carried them inland.\n\nThe 1743 estimate that half the tea drunk in Britain was illegally imported shows that smuggling was highly profitable. This well organised 'free trade' employed and supplied many people, from paupers to peers. Smugglers have often been romanticised but the reality was brutal. Local people lived in fear, with violent reprisals on informers and the murder of conscientious Revenue officers, while corruption enabled captured smugglers to evade harsh penalties.\n\nServing Many Masters\n\nCreated to end smuggling, as a disciplined coastal force the Preventive Water Guard quickly acquired extra duties. In the 1820s officers were instructed to take responsibility at shipwrecks to safeguard cargoes and vessels from looters. In addition boatmen were to train with life saving equipment, supplied by the Board of Ordnance.\n\nIn 1816 the Preventive Water Guard had been withdrawn from part of Kent in favour of shore based naval crews. The Admiralty favoured this Coast Blockade as a reserve of trained seamen, and later extended it from the Isle of Sheppey to Seaford, Sussex.\n\nIn 1821 a Committee of Enquiry examined every aspect of the Customs service. It recognised the Preventive Water Guard as a major force against smuggling and recommended that it be again controlled by the Board of Customs along with the Riding officers and Revenue cruisers. On 15 January 1822 the Treasury accepted the proposal noting that the new force would be called the Coast Guard. The words Coastguard were linked in the twentieth century.\n\nWhen, in 1831, it was decided that the Board of Customs Coastguard should replace the Coast Blockade on the whole coast the Admiralty made its own proposal. It won the right to appoint Coastguard officers and to select boatmen from paid off naval crews, so setting the scene for the Coastguard as a naval reserve and recruiting agency.\n\nWithin a decade Coastguard vigilance was praised for greatly reducing smuggling, though lower taxes helped end illegal trade. The Admiralty was already re-styling the Coastguard with naval style uniform and drill, and training on large guns for coast defence. The Coastguard continued to take charge at wrecks and to save lives. The Board of Trade issued life saving apparatus to Coastguard stations, thus fulfilling its responsibility for safety at sea imposed by the 1854 Merchant Shipping Act.\n\nThe role of naval reserve and coast defence force was sealed when the Coast Guard Act (1856) passed control from the Board of Customs to the Admiralty. Though still available for revenue protection, Coastguards trained to supplement naval crews. By 1900 advancing technology in ships and arms had outmoded this style of naval reserve and the Admiralty proposed reducing the Coastguard. This was opposed by the public, the Board of Customs and the Board of Trade who championed the need for life saving and revenue protection.\n\nAn enquiry in 1921 found that the Coastguard had become the eyes and ears of many organisations with coastal interests. For the Admiralty they provided visual signalling and telegraphy, reported fleet movements, rendered mines safe, undertook recruitment, and reported changes in navigation marks to the Hydrographer. For the Board of Customs and Excise they searched vessels, supervised discharge of cargoes, collected dues from coastal vessels, kept shipping statistics, and patrolled the coast. For the Board of Trade they assisted ships in distress, acted as Receiver of Wreck, and operated life saving apparatus. In addition Coastguards: assisted the Post Office and Lloyds with telegraphy and wireless; provided the Fishery Department with statistics; enforced quarantine regulations for Agricultural Departments; made meteorological reports to the Air Ministry; passed distress calls to the RNLI; and reported faulty navigation aids to Trinity House.\n\nDedicated\n\nIn 1923 the Coastguard, placed under the Board of Trade, was dedicated to life saving, salvage from wreck and administration of the foreshore. The new force was sanctioned by the Coastguard Act (1925). The early Coastguard had been caught between the demands of different government departments, but change could now focus on the needs of seafarers, especially the scope for new technology to improve both safety and rescues.\n\nThe 1920s Coastguard kept a visual watch. Stations overlooking major shipping lanes and hazards, maintained constant watch day and night and were able to summon auxiliaries to intermediate stations should visibility decrease or bad weather set in. An enquiry in 1931 correctly predicted that increased use of radio would eliminate the need for visual watches; this initiated a controlled reduction in Coastguard stations, lookouts and personnel, which continues in this century.\n\nIn the 1930s effective watch and communication reduced the number of shoreline casualties. Coastguards warned vessels approaching danger in time to take evasive action or alerted lifeboats, now with engines, which could quickly assist vessels still offshore. This preventive role has evolved with specific modern tasks. Since 1967 shipping between Margate and Beachy Head has been separated into northeast and southwest bound lanes. Using computer enhanced radar; Coastguards monitor this Channel traffic, warning vessels which contravene the special rules. Following the \"Torrey Canyon\" (1969) oil spill, Coastguards were tasked as the early warning system for pollution control. In the 1970s the Coastguard support vessel \"Miranda\" began to accompany British fishing fleets into northern seas. After the \"Braer\" incident (1994) Emergency Towing Vessels were added to Coastguard resources for assisting disabled vessels. Coastguards provide liaison and training to enhance search and rescue awareness for the merchant marine and oil\/gas industry.\n\nPleasure boating became popular in the 1960s and, today, from the 12,000 plus incidents handled annually by the Coastguard, most result from the ever growing list of coastal pursuits, from hang-gliding to wreck diving. The scope of Coastguard co-ordination has extended as new facilities have been created to match modern rescue situations. The RNLI and independent groups introduced Inshore Rescue Boats. From 1964, Coastguard rough terrain vehicles have increased mobility and provided mobile communication bases. In 1971 Coastguards improved their access to rivers and remote coastal areas with patrol boats. Military helicopters were first used for rapid rescue from the late 1940s. Coastguard helicopters supplemented military cover in the 1980s when minimum response times were set. Fixed wing, military aircraft can also be tasked for long-range searches.\n\nRescue Partners\n\nThe RNLI's gold medal for gallantry was awarded first in 1824 to Charles Fremantle of the Lymington Coastguard for swimming with a line to rescue crew from the 'Carl Jean' ashore near Christchurch. Like fishermen and seamen around the coast, Fremantle seized whatever was available to save the lives of fellow seafarers.\n\nMany people proposed ingenious equipment to save lives from shipwrecks. Captain Manby experimented firing mortars to carry a line to a ship, achieving his first rescue in 1808 from the 'Elizabeth' 150 yards off the beach. The following year he brought the crew of the 'Nancy' ashore using a 'cot' slung beneath the line.\n\nThe Board of Ordnance and then Parliament endorsed Manby's invention, and the Preventive Water Guard were supplied and drilled with his Life Saving Apparatus (LSA). Apart from rockets replacing mortars, Coastguard LSA supplied by the Board of Trade altered little until the twentieth century brought electrically ignited rockets and lines of man-made fibre.\n\nOn 24 November 1864 Coastguards began a rescue from the 'Stanley', aground on rocks beneath Tynemouth. In the dark they were unable to supervise helpers from the large crowd and the LSA jammed. While runners fetched the nearest replacement, onlookers helplessly witnessed the steamer break up drowning 26 crew and passengers. Within a fortnight the Mayor hosted a public meeting which formed the Tynemouth Volunteer Life Brigade to provide trained assistance with LSA. In 1866 the Board of Trade's regulations for Coastguard using LSA urged them to establish new volunteer companies\n\nBy 1913, 404 companies existed, and records for 1856-1909 show 17,446 lives saved from shipwrecks by LSA and shorelines. In 1923 the Board of Trade introduced an annual award for the Best Wreck Service. However, improvements in ships and lifeboats meant fewer casualties along the shoreline and the number of LSA rescues was decreasing. Following the enquiry in 1931 the Board of Trade formed the Coast Life Saving Corps, for LSA (watching and intelligence work) and this absorbed many of the old companies. In 1966 the 7,000-strong Corps became the Coastguard Auxiliary Service which used LSA until it was withdrawn in 1988.\n\nProfessional Coastguards have increasingly been concentrated in a small number of high-tech Maritime co-ordination centres dealing with thousands of emergencies. It is the Auxiliaries of the Coastguard Rescue Teams who are often first on scene feeding back information. In the 1990s their membership of 3,200 volunteers was reorganised. Initial Response Teams were designed for rapid call out to assess situations, while Back Up Response Teams formed mobile search and rescue units, trained and equipped to work on cliffs and in mud, and with rough terrain vehicles and boats for reaching inaccessible cliff and river sites. Issued with specialist equipment and trained by Coastguard officers the volunteers in these Coastguard Rescue Teams carry the tradition of local life saving into a third century.\n\nWar Service\n\nFrom 1831 the Admiralty had fostered the Coastguard as a naval reserve. However, there were criticisms of the 2,300 Coastguards who joined naval ships in 1854 to combat Russia in the Crimea. While character and discipline were praised many were thought too old and out of touch with modern warships. The Admiralty responded by gaining control of the Coastguard and imposing training, with sea time, suitable for a naval reserve.\n\nWithin hours of Britain declaring war on Germany, in 1914, Coastguards travelled by train to crew naval ships, enabling them to put immediately to sea. Unfortunately their ships were obsolete. On 20 September 1914 a single German submarine sank the cruisers 'Cressy', 'Aboukir' and 'Hogue' off the Thames. The 1,400 drowned included many Coastguards. Torpedoes sunk 'Hawke' in October and 'Formidable' in January increasing Coastguard deaths.\n\nAshore Coastguard stations were seriously undermanned and men were sent home to re-establish an adequate coast watch against enemy landings. Here their existing skills in signalling, telegraphy and wireless were deployed relaying messages between the Admiralty and naval ships and monitoring merchant ships. At Port Signal Stations they identified all vessels entering and leaving harbour and controlled defensive booms. Individual Coastguards were trained to render beached mines safe, each taking responsibility for some twenty miles of coast.\n\nAfter 1918, peacetime needs for a coastal force were debated. The Admiralty was advised to form a Naval Signalling Section while the Board of Trade reorganised the Coastguard for coast watching and life saving. The Coastguard Service Act (1925) still allowed the Admiralty control of the Coastguard in time of national need. In the 1930s the departments worked together to prepare the Coastguard as a War Watching Organisation. When war came 4,500 Auxiliary Coastguards were recruited on National Service to strengthen stations coastwide. Intelligence and signalling were again key tasks. In May 1940, fearing invasion, the Admiralty assumed control and armed the Coastguard.\n\nLife saving was hampered by beach defences but in 1940 the LSA Brigades met one of their greatest challenges. The destroyer's 'Ashanti' and 'Fame' ran aground on the rocky Durham coast. Life Saving Apparatus carried the local firemen aboard the burning 'Fame', ferried ammunition in danger of exploding ashore, and overnight landed 104 men from the two ships.\n\nIn the south Coastguards gained a new rescue task. Lookouts used cross-bearings to direct the air\/sea rescue service launches searching for airmen who had ditched in the Channel.\n\nD-Day brought safety from invasion and a reduction in the Auxiliary Coastguard numbers. In 1945 the service was placed under the Ministry of War Transport, eventually returning to the Marine Division of the Board of Trade in 1959.\n\nRescue Afloat\n\nCoastguards saved life not only with Life Saving Apparatus (LSA) but also by braving the seas in their own boats and as lifeboat crews. The story of their heroism has yet to be told.\n\nFishermen and pilots had always launched their boats to take crew from ships grounded on sandbanks and rocks. Liverpool was probably the first port to provide a 'lifeboat' for such rescues. Many inventors had demonstrated prototype 'unsinkable' boats, but a competition in 1790 led Henry Greathead to build the lifeboat 'Original' for South Shields, and then to supply boats of the same design to over twenty ports and harbours. The life saving effort was strongest where local organisations funded the boats and supported their volunteer crews. Not until 1824 was there a National Institution for Preservation of Life from Shipwreck to promote life saving coastwide. Success still depended heavily on local effort until, from the 1850s, improved organisation and fundraising enabled the renamed Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) to establish many new stations and gradually to take responsibility for previously independent lifeboats.\n\nCoastguards feature in every element of the history of lifeboats. Records of RNLI bravery awards show them undertaking daring rescues in their own galleys or gigs which often demonstrated the need for a lifeboat station. Local commanders petitioned for new stations and advised on the best locations, spearheaded fundraising and became secretaries to local organisations. Coastguards frequently crewed and coxed both independent and RNLI lifeboats, particularly on unpopulated coasts.\n\nWhen, in 1852, the RNLI's first standard design lifeboat was put through trials she was crewed by Coastguards. A year earlier the Coastguard commanders at Yarmouth, Harwich and Thames had tested Lamb & White lifeboats for work by the Revenue Cruisers. In the 1860s the Admiralty ordered worn out gigs and galleys to be replaced by these lifeboats. In the following decades Coastguards used their lifeboats for rescues. As late as 1897, when the RNLI operated nationwide, the Coastguard lifeboat gig joined seven other lifeboats for a fundraising day organised at Bridlington by the local Divisional Officer of Coastguards.\n\nYet life saving was not the primary objective of the Admiralty Coastguard and official enquiries concluded that a coastwide lifeboat service could best be achieved by the charitably funded RNLI. After 1923, when the Coastguard was specifically dedicated to life saving, rather than duplicate the role of others it began developing expertise and communications to co-ordinate every resource available for search and rescue in UK waters. Coastguards now supply lifeboat stations with rapid and appropriate call outs, and with accurate information and communications throughout rescue incidents.\n\nCommunications\n\nWhile radio communication was being developed in the 1890s, merchant and naval ships still depended on visual signalling. Coastguards were expected to read\/send 18 words per minute with semaphore flags and 10 with a flashing lamp, the new acetylene fuel extended visibility to 12 miles. By the First World War telephone lines linked coastal stations and Coastguards were operating wireless with ranges from 100 to 1,000 miles.\n\nFrom 1923 the Board of Trade saw improving communications as a key task. The old station to station telephone line was replaced with the Post Office system. The telephone now immediately informed Divisional officers of events, including the need to set bad weather watches at intermediate stations, and was used to alert the RNLI.\n\nIn 1951 it was recommended that visual watching should target vessels under 500 tonnes as larger ships should have radio and could be monitored by a listening watch. By the mid 1960s many Coastguard stations used VHF radio for direct communication with lifeboats, inshore rescue boats and Coastguard vehicles. Within a decade the whole Coastguard communication system of MF and VHF radio, telex and telephone was reviewed, and by 1974 stations were able to maintain a listening watch on VHF covering nearly all UK waters. Responsible sailors around the UK inform the Coastguard of the details of their voyages, radioing in on departure and arrival.\n\nThe Coastguard became a '999' service in the 1960s enabling the public to raise the alarm as it does for other emergency services. With the advent of the mobile telephone, Coastguards can now be quickly alerted to emergencies even when radios are not available.\n\nSatellite technology has revolutionised radio communication and navigation. Vessels can determine their position on the globe within metres.\n\nBy international agreement all merchant ships over 300 tonnes carry communications which link directly to the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS). These transmit automated urgency or distress signals as digitally encoded bursts, which assist clarity, and are received by computers in Coastguard Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centres (MRCC). The signals relay the vessel identity, location and nature of the alarm. As a result of GMDSS Falmouth MRCC has supported communications for search and rescue as far off as the South Atlantic. All vessels can also carry Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRB) whose signal quickly reaches the Coastguard and so triggers an emergency response.\n\nThe Coastguard co-ordination centres are being fitted with Integrated Coastguard Communication System (ICCS) which has replaced analogue communications with digital technology.\n\nThe ICCS enables MRCCs to share the workload during major incidents or to release staff for other duties. In line with improved communications since the 1930s this new technology has reduced the number of stations manned by full time Coastguards.\n\nIn 1999 the Coastguard replaced British Telecom in providing Maritime Safety Information. Four-hourly meteorological and navigational warnings are broadcast using VHF and MF with a coverage out to 150 miles. The Coastguard also links vessels at sea with medical authorities so that advice can be received directly from a doctor.\n\n21st Century Search & Rescue\n\nEfficiency drives in the 1990s made Her Majesty's Coastguard a government executive agency, then in 1998 the Marine Safety Agency and the Coastguard Agency were joined to become the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA).\n\nThe MCA exists to promote high standards of safety at sea, to minimise loss of life amongst seafarers and coastal users, to protect the environment by minimising pollution from ships and to respond to maritime emergencies 24 hours a day. This means the MCA must maintain an adequate civil maritime search and rescue co-ordination service through HM Coastguard. This clear definition of the role of HM Coastguard within the MCA has enabled the MCA to focus on introducing the best available technology, which means that the UK Coastguard is a world model for search and rescue co-ordination.\n\nWhether you are a sailboarder too exhausted to reach the shore or a walker that slips from the scenic cliff path, cruising on a luxury superliner that looses rudder control or crew aboard a container ship battered by freak waves, fallen sick on a racing yacht or trapped on a burning oil rig, HM Coastguard can ensure that the most able rescuers are sent to your aid. Computerised data gives them access to all the resources and by touching a visual display screen they can summon lifeboats, helicopters, towing vessels or cliff rescuers. It is no matter that you are a hundred miles along the coast from their watchroom or far over the horizon. Satellite communications enable Coastguards to hear the distress calls of seafarers and coastal users who less than a hundred years ago would have hoped in vain that their feeble flares or cries might be seen or heard. Rescue was not quick; if a Coastguard spotted a vessel ashore he often had to send messengers on foot to alert the lifeboat or LSA crew.\n\nIt is no surprise that HM Coastguard is leading initiatives for a National Search and Rescue Framework. For the first time this will cover incidents arising at sea, on land or in the air, by promoting partnership between all forms of emergency service through the most advanced communications.\n\nHM Coastguard no longer thinks only of rescue. Despite handling thousands of incidents every year, improved efficiency has freed officers to take part in safety campaigns. Each year these target the most common causes of accidents at sea, and their message is carried to recreational clubs and into schools.\n\nYou can learn more about the work of the modern HM Coastguard by calling the MCA or by arranging to visit a local Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre."}

{"text":"I'd like to know which Country had the better Subs, the United States or Germany?\n\nFrom what I have gathered the US Fleet Boats were faster both submerged and surfaced, but the German Boats could dive deeper.\nWhat is the maximum documented diving depth of a US and German boat respectively? I know that Kptl. Heinrich Lehmann Willenbrock took U-96 to 220 meters to evade a group of destroyers.... would this have been possible with a US sub?\n\nBut what were the other main advantages and differenences between the US and German submarines?\n\nU.S submarines are better in endurance, speed, life conditions (like the ice cream machine )and a lot of space for the crew. All torpedoes are stored inside of the sub, and 6 tubes in the bow and 4 in the stern, this means a lot more of firepower.\n\nAnd finally the biggest difference: the superior technology in Radar and radio, it means detect the targets and planes in the distance and know if is aproaching or not, and plot intercept courses in the dark without visual sight.\n\nGeman subs are superior in dive depths and optics. but very limited in ASW tech\n(finally decisive in the war)\n\n__________________\nBut this ship can't sink!...\n\nShe is made of iron, sir. I assure you, she can. and she will. It is a mathematical certainty.\n\nBoth the fleet boats and the u-boats were childs of their time, with their technical differences and their main operational theaters. We all know this. At the time they were used, they were the best their country could make. So both types was good, but only good in the setting they were made to perform in. I agree with Hartmann's excellent statement, it summons it up in details.\n\nYou only can compare a long range Type IXD\/2 with a fleet sub, mainly with a Balao (Both the german and american launched in 1943), because the Type VIIC was a much smaller, short range boat designed to operate in packs and closer to the home base. The US boats had to be bigger because they had to go farther -all away across the Pacific- and could not go back quickly to their home bases to refit. They carried therefore a larger load of torpedoes, much more diesel, storage for food and had better living conditions for their crews.\n\nThen again we know that when we play radar is more a magnet to attract the attention of hunter killer groups. Thus radar was nice but imho also very dangerous.\n\nfirepower. several convoys got hammered by U-boats. They just took out 1 or 2 ships per day. So 2 torps\/ ship was enough mostly. In my book no of tubes isn't that important, it's the number of eels one can carry.\n\nBasically the theater of operations where so different, as where the conditions (winning vs loosing the war). It's impossible to compare both types of subs. Then again I know on which type i wanna be.\n\nAmerica had the better subs for certain things. Though if given a choice between going on a U-Boat or going on a fleet boat in war conditions... I think I would have to pick a fleet boat. Going on a U-Boat would be tantamount to suicide. Not that it wasn't dangerous for the Americans... but god... their losses can't compare to 3 out of 4 submariners dying.\n\nAlso one advantage a IXD has over a Balao that Hitman missed is underwater endurance. IXD2's can stay under longer than a Balao can. At least if SH4 and the U-Boat mission expansion are anything to go on...\n\n__________________ I SURVIVED THE FIRST EVER SUBSIM WEREWOLF HUNT - and... I actually won the game for the humans too!\n\nU-Boats of WW2 had very little change from those of WW1 and thats why they failed. There was no real big effort to modernize them until it was to late. The XXI shows what they could have done but a lack of thinking and budget sealed the U-Boat fate.\n\nNo you are right... however, the XXI's were built using slave labour practically, and were thrown together as fast as possible. Underwater the XXI could run rings around any other submarine in the world. In terms of design it truly was state of the art.\n\n__________________ I SURVIVED THE FIRST EVER SUBSIM WEREWOLF HUNT - and... I actually won the game for the humans too!\n\nDictatorships of course have their share of highly paid and prestigious engineers and designers, but what they also have to make do with is a labor force consisting of people who've been coerced into putting those ideas into practice - and this includes the so-called \"free\" workers, too, because those hapless cogs of the Machine usually cannot (or do not dare to) go and say \"no\" to their bosses \/ Politruks \/ Gauleiters regardless of what the buggers throw at them! So as a result what you get is a coercive work culture negatively affecting pretty much everyone, \"free\" or not - and comparably substandard production, too, in the long run.\n\nNowhere was this as evident as in the former Soviet Union, but I'm pretty sure this would've happened to the Nazies as well had their Reich lived any longer. A totalitarian state due to its very nature usually succeeds in getting rid of is its brain power (and thus its innovators), and this of course cannot but wreck its technological process in the long run. That the Third Reich succeeded in producing technology like the XXI does not disprove this at all BTW, because as stated already their particular form of society (fortunately) didn't live long enough to really suffer from this...\n\nBoth types were designed for totally different missions. They both had advantages and disadvantages but they are not comparable. My personal opinion is that the US Boats due to the operation theater were closer to the modern idea of the submarine (long range and endurance) but in terms of performance they were not so far off the German designs. Nevertheless as others said before me you just cannot compare them."}
{"text":"Between 1949 and 1958 a total of 236 submarines of this type were commissioned into the Soviet navy . The vessels were initially designed as coastal patrol submarines. These patrol variants are known in the west as Whiskey I, II, III, IV, and V; and were called project 613 in the Soviet Union. In the 1950s and 1960s some patrol vessels were converted to guided missile submarines. These boats had the capability to fire one to four SS-N-3 Shaddock cruise missiles. In 1956, the first prototype was ready. It was a regular Whiskey class submarine which was fitted with a launch tube after the sail that contained a single SS-N-3 anti-shipping missile. This vessel was known in the west as Whiskey Single Cylinder. Between 1958 and 1960, six additional whiskey class submarines were converted to carry guided missiles. These boats had two missile tubes behind the sail, and were known in the west as Whiskey Twin Cylinder (Soviet designation:Project 644). Between 1960 and 1963, six boats received an extended sail that could contain four Shaddock missiles. These were called Whiskey Long Bin in the West and Project 665 in the Soviet Union. All guided missile variants of the Whiskey class had to surface in order to fire their missiles. The boats of the single and twin cylinder class also had to raise their missile tubes, which were normally positioned horizontally.\n\nWhen the boats became obsolete, some were converted to radar picket boats (which were called Whiskey Canvas Bag). Two vessels were converted to submarines for 'fishery research' and 'oceanographic research' purposes. In the Soviet navy, the patrol variants of this class were replaced by Romeo class submarines. The guided missile variants were replaced by Juliet class submarines.\n\nThe Soviet Union has exported patrol submarines of the Whiskey class to:\n\nCuba and Syria ordered used Whiskey class submarines for use as battery charging hulks. The guided missile and radar picket boats were never exported.\n\nIncidents involving Whiskey class submarines\n\nOn or about 15 December1952, the Soviet Whiskey class submarine S-117 was lost due to unknown causes in the Sea of Japan. The boat was possibly involved in a collision with a surface ship, or struck a mine.\n\nOn 27 January1961, the Soviet Whiskey class submarine S-80 was lost due to accidental flooding while the boat was submerged. The valve that should have prevented water from entering the snorkel did not work properly.\n\nOn October 271981, the Soviet Whiskey class submarine U-137 ran aground in Swedish territorial waters near a naval base.

{"text":"MODEL SEAFARER\n\nJohn Estes worked for months to produce a model of the USS Constitution \u2014 the only remaining commissioned U.S. sailing ship. (Photo by T.L. Petersen).\n\nStory and photos by T.L. Petersen\n\nUnion \u2013 John Estes has crossed the Pacific Ocean seven times by ship.\n\nBut now his ships will never see the ocean, or for that matter, water of any type.\n\nSitting at his kitchen table in his small second-floor Union apartment, Estes works for hours crafting scale-model wooden ships. He's been doing it for years, starting when he lived in Arizona. He laughs, trying to remember how many early efforts have been left behind as he's moved and travelled.\n\nThe ships themselves transport the observer to worlds far away and times far distant.\n\nThere's a Mediterranean fishing trawler with a curved prow, complete with stacks of wooden crates piled on deck. A model of the Bounty rides invisible waves nearby. A Mississippi steamboat \u2014 no sails \u2014 rests above the living room window.\n\nAnd on the table is the pride of John Estes' collection, his most involved and largest model yet \u2014 the USS Constitution. \"Old Ironsides,'' originally built in 1797 and still an ocean-going American sailing vessel, sits anchored in Boston Harbor.\n\nThere is a significant difference between the real ship and the model, though. Color. The real ship is painted white and black with green gunwales. Estes doesn't plan to paint his model, choosing instead to use light and dark woods to indicate colors.\n\nEstes' Constitution is nearly complete. It is only missing the yards and yards of black thread rigging, and the sails, which he needs to cut, hem and add the tiny rigging holes to should he decide to add the sails to the model. He might not, in order to keep the rigging visible.\n\nEstes, at home healing from having his carotid artery cleared and reopened, says he started building model ships in about the 1980s. He believes his career as a carpenter and draftsman helps him to read the instructions, craft the tiny individual pieces and follow the complex graphic directions.\n\nAnd complex it is. For the Constitution, only the basic internal hull shape was provided. Estes had to shape and form the planks of the ship, the deck and each of the multiple masts himself \u2014 a miniaturized ship-building crew of one to do the work that required thousands of man-hours for the original, along with the skilled craftsmen and the hundreds of slaves who actually built the mighty sailing ship.\n\n\"The Constitution was a 53-gun frigate,\" Estes explains, pointing out the small gun ports he had to build to replicate the original ship.\n\nBetween details of how a model ship is built, he has stories from the original frigate. The original, for example, provided a huge market for southern hemp growers, since every one of the tons of rope rigging and rope it carried was made of hemp. That included the rope that was used once to pull the frigate away from pursuing attackers.\n\nAll the attackers were trapped in windless doldrums, but the crew of the Constitution rowed ahead of the ship, dropped anchors and winched the ship forward \u2014 time and time again, opening the distance between the American crew and the enemy.\n\nEstes finds building the wooden models a test of his skills and an absorbing challenge \u2014 one that takes him far from the details and troubles of daily life. He's concerned about his children. He's worried about medical bills and threats from the courts to take his savings. So with little else he's capable of doing as he recovers, he works on the model, carefully checking his work on the rigging against the blueprint that hangs on his dining area wall.\n\nThere is a picture of the finished Constitution on the lid of the materials box, but this isn't the same as a jigsaw puzzle. No clues provided, just a picture of the goal \u2014 if all the details fall together. A magnifying glass makes the work possible, since medical problems have limited Estes' vision to one eye most of the time.\n\n\"I'm about 90 percent done,\" he says. \"I'm down to the rigging details now.\"\n\nAlmost done \u2014 but not, he hopes, with model ship building.\n\nHe'd like to recreate a Revolutionary-era privateer, like the ones Thomas Jefferson and others purchased to give the young America something to send against the British as the foundation of an American navy. And maybe a Mississippi paddle-wheeler.\n\nEstes grew up in a split family between Kentucky and Arkansas. He left Texas at 17 and joined the Navy. After the Navy, he's lived in different parts of the country and been a volunteer with the Red Cross and with Habitat for Humanity. Before health problems got severe, he was in the National Guard.\n\nNow he builds his ships. An old prayer seems to hang over the ships themselves, and maybe describes John Estes' life now, although he doesn't mention it."}

Pirate sloops normally carried 60 to 80 crewmen and 0 to 16 cannons on one deck on the sides. The British Royal Navy sloops had a comparable crew and artillery but merchant ships had much smaller crews."}

A Japanese submarine torpedoed the heavy cruiser about three weeks later.\n(National Bureau of Ships Collection)\n\nTrumpet player Donald F. Mack graduated from Wilson High School in 1943, joined the Navy and became a bugler first class on the USS Indianapolis.\n\nOn July 30, 1945, four days after secretly delivering key parts of a new weapon \u2014 the atomic bomb \u2014 to the Pacific island of Tinian, the heavy cruiser was crossing the Philippine Sea without an escort. Mack was 19.\n\nNow 84 and living in the Poconos, he remembers what happened that night and in the following days. He told his story in a video interview with the Lehigh Valley Veterans History Project Roundtable.\n\nI had just gone on watch for the midnight-to-4 shift on the flying bridge. Ten minutes after midnight, the first torpedo hit. It took off about 80 feet of the bow. The second torpedo hit amidships.\n\nCapt. McVay came running out of the charthouse saying, \"What the hell's going on?\"\n\nThe ship was listing pretty good to starboard. I went down the flying bridge, the signal bridge, the second deck, first deck. On the bottom of the ship were two metal planes, like wings, to keep the ship from rolling over, and the one on the port side was up out of the water pretty well. I went down and off that into the water.\n\nThere were a number of life rafts. But when they gave us our paint job [after a kamikaze attack earlier in the year], they painted all the knockout pins fast on the life rafts, and they couldn't be knocked out. Only three rafts got off the ship.\n\nWe sank in 12 minutes, which didn't give much time to get your gear together to abandon ship.\n\nOur entire complement was 1,196. Approximately 900 got off the ship. The only ones who were dressed were those who were on watch. All the rest were in their skivvies. I was lucky to have my dungarees and a shirt on.\n\nThe first thing we did was swim as far as we could, as fast as we could, to get away from the suction of the ship as it went down. I remember the fantail was in the air and the screws were still going around.\n\nWith the currents in the ocean, we were spread out for about 20 miles. The group I was in, there were about 60 of us. One of the fellas was a friend of mine who still lives in Florida, Victor Buckett, a yeoman first class.\n\nIt was freezing cold at night and boiling hot in the daytime. We were in the water for five days.\n\nAll that time, the sharks were swimming between our legs.\n\nIf you were injured, you were in trouble, because sharks go after blood. I was fortunate not to have any serious injuries.\n\nThe only buoyancy we had were kapok life jackets, and we had straps on those that we put through our crotch and snapped to the fella next to us so you couldn't break away.\n\nBut some of the guys had hallucinations of the ship being under the surface of the water, and of swimming down and getting a drink of fresh water out of the fresh-water valves.\n\nThey didn't last too much longer, because in a day or two, after ingesting the salt water, they were gone. And when they died, you just unsnapped their life jackets and let them go.\n\nI can remember some of the guys saying, \"We just saw an island on the crest of that wave over there. Let's all go swim over to the island and get something to eat at the mess hall.\"\n\nComments (1)\n\nGod Bless you Mr. Mack. Thank you for sharing your story. I have heard the same story from my now deceased father-in-law Justus (Jesse) Mirth who was also on the USS Indianapolis. I'm sorry he isn't around to have read this article or participate in the memorial event. Your story validates his service. Sadly, he never received proper recognition from the military.

{"text":"Speed at which ship sinks can affect passenger behavior, study finds\n\nMar 02, 2010 By Thomas H. Maugh II\n\nWhether it is \"Women and children first\" or \"Every man for himself\" in a shipwreck may depend on how long it takes the ship to sink, researchers said Monday.\n\nWhen the Lusitania was torpedoed by a German U-boat in 1915, it sank in 18 minutes and the bulk of survivors were young men and women who responded immediately to their powerful survival instincts.\n\nBut when the Titanic struck an iceberg in 1912, it took three hours to go down, allowing time for more civilized instincts to take control -- and the bulk of the survivors were women, children and people with young children.\n\nEconomist Benno Torgler of the Queensland University of Technology in Australia and his colleagues studied the two sinkings in order to explore the economic theory that people generally behave in a rational and selfish manner. The two tragedies provided a \"natural experiment\" for testing the idea, because the passengers on the two ships were quite similar in terms of gender and wealth.\n\nThe primary difference was how long it took the ships to sink.\n\nReporting in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, the researchers found that, on the Titanic, children had a 14.8 percent higher probability of surviving, a person accompanying a child had a 19.6 percent high probability and women had more than a 50 percent higher probability.\n\nOn the Lusitania, in contrast, fit young men and women were the most likely to make it into the lifeboats.\n\nSocial class was also important. On the Titanic, first-class passengers were about 44 percent more likely to survive, while on the Lusitania, passengers from steerage were more likely to emerge safely.\n\nThe authors considered other possible complicating factors, but concluded that the most likely reason for the differences was the amount of time passengers had to effect escape.\n\nThey suggested that when people have little time to react, gut instincts may rule. When more time is available, social influences play a bigger role.\n\nEd Kamuda, president of the Titanic Historical Society in Indian Orchard, Mass., agreed with their conclusion. \"The Lusitania sank so quickly, and half of the lifeboats couldn't even be used,\" he said. \"The younger crowd would be able to make it into the boats, could jump into them as they swung away from the ship. The Titanic was pretty well on an even keel, and they had all sorts of time.\"\n\nBut psychologists noted that many factors other than following social norms could come into play in a disaster, including an evolutionary imperative to save the species, attachments that are formed between individuals during the event and the leadership of authority figures.\n\nThe extent of altruism and how it occurs \"is a very controversial issue,\" said Anthony R. Mawson, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. \"I surmise that the dominant response was affiliation\/attachment behavior.\"\n\nIn a rapid event, such as the Lusitania sinking, attachments would have been to people the passengers already knew. But when a disaster is spread out over hours, as was the case with the Titanic, \"people who had previously been complete strangers become the equivalent of loved ones,\" Mawson said.\n\nPsychologist Daniel Kruger of the University of Michigan thinks that the answer lies less in social norms and more in our evolutionary heritage. Human beings have a deep instinct to preserve our kind, he said, and that means \"people are more likely to save those who have higher reproductive value, namely the young and women in child-bearing years.\"\n\nKruger also stressed the importance of leadership during an emergency, noting that the Titanic's captain appeared to exert greater control than the Lusitania's.\n\nHe compared the sinkings to the recent ditching of American Airlines Flight 1549 into the Hudson River. In that case, Capt. Chesley Sullenberger was firmly in control and his edict that women and children should exit first was followed, even though the plane was in imminent danger of sinking.\n\n\"People might be in a state of panic, but if they are reassured there is a system in place, they might be more likely to go along with contingency plans,\" Kruger said.\n\nThe researchers' theory may fit well for the Titanic and Lusitania but not for other shipwrecks.\n\nKamuda pointed to two other disasters, the 1873 sinking of the Atlantic on rocks off the coast of Halifax, and the 1914 sinking of the Empress of Ireland in the St. Lawrence River after it was hit by another ship. Both events took about an hour. But not a single woman and only one child survived the Atlantic disaster, while the majority of survivors from the Empress were women.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nIn places where young women outnumber young men, research shows the hemlines rise but the marriage rates don't because the young men feel less pressure to settle down as more women compete for their affectionsMale and female shopping styles are in our genes---and we can look to evolution for the reason.

These goods were transported in thousands of merchant ships, which were vulnerable to attack by German submarines (U-boats). As there were not enough warships to protect thousands of individual merchant ships, they were grouped into convoys with naval escorts, making them hard to find and difficult to attack.\n\nMerchant shipping was placed under Admiralty control on 26 August 1939, and the first convoy sailed on 2 September. Four days later, the first regular series of convoys began. Convoy FS1 \u2013 standing for Forth-Southbound \u2013 was tasked with protecting the coal supply routes along Britain's east coast.\n\nFollowing the launch of Convoy FS1, on 7 September Atlantic convoys were launched from both the Thames, coded OA, and the Mersey, OB. Once outside the U-boat danger area near the British coast, the convoys dispersed, as the smaller escorts were defenceless against the German surface raiders operating far out in the Atlantic. Homeward-bound merchant ships carrying war supplies, however, were convoyed all the way \u2013 most notably along the route from Halifax, Nova Scotia (coded HX) \u2013 and were often protected by heavy warships.\n\nAfter the fall of France in June 1940, German U-boats moved to new French bases, increasing their range. As a result, convoys were extended across the Atlantic. This marked the beginning of a dangerous phase of the war, dubbed the Battle of the Atlantic by Winston Churchill. As the fighting progressed, new convoys became necessary, including routes to Malta and Russia (the 'Arctic Convoys'). In total, 450 convoy series were run over the course of the war.\n\nRelated Tags\n\nDetails\n\nAn Atlantic convoy in 1940\n\nC 2647\n\nAn Atlantic convoy in 1940.

{"text":"A shipyard is a facility for shipbuilding, repair, maintenance, and shipbreaking. Some shipyards also manufacture offshore oil and gas drilling platforms. Shipyards are dangerous construction zones with many worker hazards. Shipbuilding and ship repair activities include painting, surface preparation, tank cleaning, and all aspects of marine construction. Routine ship engine maintenance requires handling engine fluids such as oil, antifreeze, and hydraulic fluids. A ship may be repaired or maintained while afloat or may be hauled into a dry dock area out of the water. Before repairs, a ship's ballast and bilge tanks may be emptied of dirty water into the surrounding waters. New ships are built in dry docks.\n\nBecause shipyards are located on the water, pollution created by shipyard activities can fall into the water directly or be carried in by runoff. Shipbuilding and ship repair use toxic chemicals including chromium, copper, nickel, and lead.\n\nWhen large ships are cleaned, a process called dry-abrasive blasting is used to remove contaminants and prepare the surfaces. Ship surfaces are treated with antifoulant materials to clean barnacles and other organisms from the hull, and coated to preserve their steel. Cleaning and coating activities use chemicals that include heavy metals, solvents, copper, and hazardous or flammable materials. They release lead, particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, zinc, and other air pollutants.\n\nShipbreaking is the breaking down or dismantling of a ship for scrapping or disposal at the end of its useful life. It can be extremely hazardous work and is often done in countries with little environmental oversight or worker protection. Shipbreaking can involve removing hazardous materials, such as preservatives, paints, fuel and cargo residues, and insulating materials, including asbestos.\n\nThis description is based on the information found in the Web links listed with this topic."}

A moment's humanity had turned Dannie Buckley female.\n\nHe was an ambitious and enterprising young man who wanted to go to America to\nmake some money, as he told Senator William Alden Smith at the US inquiry. 'I came in the Titanic because she was a new steamer.'\n\nBut his good luck lasted for only another six years. Daniel Buckley was killed in 1918, a month before the end of the First World War, while helping to evacuate American Expeditionary Force wounded from the front line on the French\/Belgian border.\n\nBuckley was born on 28 September 1890 and baptised the same day in the Church of\nthe Immaculate Conception in Boherbue, County Cork. His proud parents were Daniel Snr and Abigail Sullivan. The family moved to neighbouring Kingwilliamstown in 1905, where Daniel Snr became the town baker.\n\nBy 1912, Buckley and a number of young friends had decided on emigration to the United States, where opportunities would be better for a jobbing labourer like himself. The night before the party left for Queenstown to embark, there was an American wake in the town with strong drink, set-dancing and a singsong send-off. Buckley had penned a ballad to 'Sweet Kingwilliamstown', a tuneful tribute that endures in the area, but chose that night to sing an optimistic valediction: 'When the Fields are White with Daisies, I'll Return'.\n\nAboard the White Star vessel, Buckley and three friends found a Third-Class compartment near the bow.

As I might not have much time when I get to New York, I mean to give you an account of the terrible shipwreck we had.\n\nAt 11 p.m. on the 14th, our ship Titanic struck an iceberg and sank to the deep at 2.20\na.m. on the 15th. The present estimation is 1,500 lost, 710 saved. Thank God some of us are amongst the saved.\n\n2 Comments\n\nI agree with leahforce but I don't think the whole story is being told. There was also one know Jewish couple in third class which brings up the question of whether they were all Irish. Also the Irish in the movie were depicted as poorly dressed, but apparently that was not the case. I saw on American TV the story of one beautiful young Irish girl who was well dressed enough to attend a dance on the first class deck where she apparently made quite an impression on the men. When the Titanic hit, a member of the band went immediately to her third class suite to warn her and he and other men at the dance saved her life, although she insisted on going back for her hat. The picures from the town in Mayo which lost so many young people also showed then to be very well dressed. From my in-laws experience and pictures, in the 1900's the people leaving Ireland left in new stylish clothes bought for the journey. Anyone knowing the Irish of that generation would know they were fussy about their appearance and remained so. I would like to see a more accurate presentation of the Irish. Leahforce is right, all avenues of escape were closed to them, a complete genocide.\n\nReport abuse\n\nleahforce | Apr 15, 2012, 02:04 PM EDT\n\nDisappointed that Irish Central has not mentioned the 1514 - mostly Irish, who were murdered on the Titanic.

Constantly adapting to German alterations to the Enigma system, the Allied codebreakers understood, after painstaking efforts, the basic principles of operating the Enigma. Understanding German operating procedures was key to solving the Enigma system.\n\nEncoding a message in naval Enigma required an extremely intricate series of steps. First, the machine must be configured to an elaborate series of predetermined settings listed in various codebooks. Using the codebooks, German signalsmen adjusted the \"outer settings\" of the Enigma by plugging wires into various ports on the plug-wire board in front of the typewriter keyboard. Before encrypting a message, an officer would check a list of daily settings to select the correct Enigma rotors. Aboard U-boats, the second watch officer (II W.O.) was responsible for adjusting the Enigma rotors to the proper daily configuration, establishing the \"inner settings\" of the machine. Each individual rotor featured internal circuitry connected to twenty-six electrical contacts representing alphabetical characters. Before typing a message, the signalsman would consult another codebook list to set the rotors to a predetermined daily starting position. For example, one daily configuration might be \"T - A - M - W.\" By typing a letter on the keyboard, the rotors would turn. Thus, the electrical contacts on the rotors would produce an entirely different letter for each letter typed\u2014even if the operator repeatedly typed the same letter.\n\nWith the \"outer\" and \"inner\" settings properly configured, U-boat signalsmen used codebooks to condense the length of the message text that was to be sent.\n\nFor example, in a message that reads:\n\nMy position is - EH - 56 - 61 - Am going along with supply boat - May - Have provisions for one week\n\nWith the message properly condensed, the U-boat signalsman typed the text of a message on the Enigma keyboard to create an enciphered message. The alphabetical characters passed through the Enigma plug-wire array, turning the rotors to produce the enciphered characters on an illuminated panel. U-boat signalsmen then used standard Morse code to transmit the encrypted message in relative security to radio stations aboard other vessels or ashore.

{"text":"War in Europe had raged since the century had begun, as Napoleon Bonaparte turned the passions of the French Revolution toward the complete domination of continental Europe. The War of the Third Coalition aligned Austria, Portugal, Russia, and Britain against Napoleon and a wash of client states across Germany and Italy. Things weren't going well: French and Bavarian forces effectively captured an entire Austrian army during the Ulm Campaign and a final battle on October 13th. On the ocean, a different battle was aligning as the Austrians surrendered, as the navies of France, Spain, and Britain maneuvered their way off the south-west coast of Spain, just west of Cape Trafalgar.\n\nWhen Admiral Lord Nelson sent the flag signal to begin the attack at 11:45 am on this day in 1805, he sent his 27 ships into an unorthodox approach to his enemy's 33 ships. Standard procedure was to line up facing one another in two rows and try to blow the hell out of one another (infantry would fight similarly until the machine gun changed things in WWI). Ships also needed to keep in sight lines to communicate and coordinate with one another. Nelson's plan was to slice directly into the enemy line and divide it in two, then engage one side in close-up ship-to-ship combat, with his ships operating independently. By 1:30, the engagement was all but over, the Franco-Spanish fleet losing 22 ships without a single British loss\u2026except may men, including the Admiral, who took a bullet through his spine. Less than two months later, Napoleon would go on to win the Battle of Austerlitz and force peace with his enemies. But Nelson had destroyed the Emperor's naval threat.\n\nIndividuals have been challenging the Conventional Wisdom for a long time."}

{"text":"CHAPTER 6: The Royal Navy, Ruler of the Seas\n\nA Power Force In Defence (2 pages)\n\nSeldom Seen Guardians\n\nBritish North America was defended not only by soldiers guarding forts. Alone, they would not have been able to fend off American ambitions, which were contained in large measure because of the superiority of the Royal Navy. In fact the seamen and ships of the British navy played a defensive role of the first magnitude throughout the first half of the nineteenth century, even though most Canadians rarely or never saw them anywhere but at the main ports. At most, fishermen and other people living along the coasts would occasionally see frigates cruising offshore and sometimes be treated to the impressive spectacle of a large ship of the line majestically hovering on the horizon. This discretion no doubt explains why the role of seamen is sometimes neglected in Canada's military heritage.\n\nAs long as the Royal Navy ruled the seas, a major naval attack against any part of the British North American colonies was unlikely. Any adversary would indeed be subject to naval raids by the British! In North America the only serious potential enemy was the United States, and the War of 1812 had shown the extent to which the Royal Navy could, through its deadly incursions and its coastal blockade, upset the commercial and military life of that country. In peacetime the British Admiralty always kept in reserve some plan of retaliation against a major city such as Boston in the event of any attempted invasion of one of its colonies by the United States. During periods of tension between the American republic and Great Britain, such prospects were always on the minds of American diplomats, and no doubt encouraged them always to find solutions."}
{"text":"The RMS Titanic (Royal Mail Steamer Titanic) was a British transatlantic liner owned by the White Star Line. Its construction started in Belfast 1909 and was completed in 1911. Its home port was located in Liverpool, United-Kingdom.\nThe Titanic was the most luxurious and the biggest liner that was ever built at the time of its launching.\n\nDuring its maiden voyage from Southampton to New-York, the liner hit an iceberg on its starboard side on April 14th, 1912 at 11.40 pm and sank on April 15th 1912 at 2.20 am, offshore Newfoundland. Around 1,500 people died in the accident, it is one of the greatest maritime catastrophes in peace time and a record at the time.\nThe disaster appeared as a sock to the international community. Indeed, the sinking was an evidence that men and their technological feats could not compete with forces of nature. It also made light of technical deficiencies at the time: modern analyses show that the steel used to build the hull but even more so the steel used for the rivets except for the central hull, was too fragile. Indeed, it seems that it was made up of too much sulfur and not enough manganese.\n\nThe other element explaining the sinking of the liner is the offhand and carefree attitude of those who chose the route and the speed. Their behavior was based on the fact their were overconfident in the liner, thought to be unsinkable.\nAll these factors and elements contributed in the sinking of the Titanic."}

Special program to show attendees how sailors at the time of the War of 1812 had to rely on the stars to navigate the open waters. For directions and more information, please visit \n\nTypes of Tall ships\n\nThe term tall ship is a generic term used to describe large sailing ships, most often representing historical vessels or replicas. The term may have had limited use throughout history; an experienced sailor likely would have referred to a ship by the design of its rig. The term \"tall ship\" probably took on a more wide spread use following the publication of John Masefield's poem Sea Fever in 1902.\n\nTall ships come in many shapes and sizes. The size of the craft and its type are often determined by its mission and where it will sail. The first distinction between tall ships is the difference between a square-rigged vessel and a fore and aft rigged vessel.\n\nSquare riggers have vertical masts that are crossed by yards, large wooden or steel beams that run perpendicular to the length of the ship's hull. Sails spread below each of these yards. Large square rigged vessel may have yards on one or more of its masts, and spread many acres of sails. They may also have some sails that run fore and aft, along the length of the ship. Fore and aft rigged tall ships have sails that ONLY run along the length of the ship, from the bow (front) towards the stern (back). Some of these sails may be attached to a gaff or a boom, a wooden or steel beam similar to a yard, but running on a fore and aft axis with the ship's hull.\n\nSquare rigged ships have an advantage when using the trade winds, which blow in circular patterns across the earth's surface and can power a sailing ship across vast expanses of ocean. Fore and aft rigged ships can generally sail at an angle closer to the wind and were often used for coastal trade. These are not hard and fast rules, and many hybrids, like the American designed Baltimore clipper (a square topsail schooner), were built to take advantage of both types of sails.\n\nItalian Full-rigged ship AMERIGO VESPUCCI\n\nFull Rigged Ships are vessels with three or more masts which cross yards and square sails on every mast. There are many examples of full rigged ships with three and four masts, but only two full rigged ships with five masts have ever been built \u2013 the PRUSSEN, launched in 1902 for the German F. Laeisz shipping company and the modern cruise ship ROYAL CLIPPER.\n\nGerman Barque GORCH FOCH 11\n\nBarques (Barks) are sailing craft having three or more masts, with yards and square sails on all masts, except the aft (rear) mast. Historically, these were the most common of the large sailing ships. They were capable of very good speed, but needed fewer crew than full rigged ships and were considered better sailing vessels. The United States Coast Guard's training vessel EAGLE and the GORCH FOCH from Germany are both barques.\n\nBarquentine ESMERALDA, from Chile\n\nBarquentines have three or more masts. The forward mast is the only one with yards and square sails. GAZELLA OF PHILADELPIA (US) and ESMERALDA (CHILE) are both examples of barquentines.\n\nBrig USS NIAGARA under full sail off South Bass Island, Ohio on Lake Erie. Picture by Lance Woodworth and licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic\n\nBrigs are sailing craft with only two masts. Each of these masts is rigged with yards and square sails. NIAGARA, from Erie, PA is an example of a War of 1812 era Brig.\n\nBrigantines have two masts. The forward mast has yards and square sails, while the rear mast has only fore and aft sails. SOREN LARSEN, home ported in Auckland, New Zealand is a good example of a brigantine.\n\nSchooners are sailing vessels with two or more masts. Some schooners have both fore and aft as well as square sails. A good example of this is the PRIDE OF BALTIMORE II, a replica of American ships used during the War of 1812 for carrying cargo and a privateer. These types of schooners are known as square topsail schooners. Schooners having fore and aft sails that attach to a metal or wooden spar (beam) that is hoisted up the masts are known as gaff rigged schooners. Norfolk's own schooner VIRGINIA is a good example of this type. Staysail schooners have fore and aft sails only, but they lack most of the large spars found on other schooners. They are similar to modern yachts, with sails running up down tracks in the masts and wire rigging supporting the masts.\n\nSloops have only one mast. Like schooners, they may have a square sail, making them a square topsail sloop. They may or may not have a spar to which their mainsail attaches. Most small modern sailboats are bermuda sloops, having only one mast and sails that are fore and aft rigged, without a yard or gaff that hoists into the rigging with the sail attached.\n\nClasses of Tall Ships\n\nToday, Sail Training International has divided tall ships into four classes. This helps put similar ships together for races and festivals and distinguishes between traditional sailing vessels and modern designs. Traditionally rigged sailing vessels recreate historical ships, with more complicated sail plans, requiring larger crews and much more muscle. They lack many of the labor saving wenches and mechanical systems found on modern recreational yachts, cruise ships and racing boats.\n\nClass A vessels include all square rigged vessels and all other vessels over 131 feet in overall hull length.\n\nClass B vessels are traditionally rigged and less than 131 feet in overall length and a waterline length of at least 30 feet.\n\nClass C includes all modern rigged vessels with an overall hull length of less than 131 feet and a waterline length of at least 30 feet. They cannot carry spinnaker style sails.\n\nClass D vessels are modern rigged, with an overall length of less than 131 feet and a waterline length of at least 30 feet, but carrying spinnaker style sails."}

In the pre-war years he commanded the U-37 for more than a year having taken the boat on a 28-day patrol in Sept 1939 - no successes.\n\nSchuch then became an adviser to German Navy High Command until July 1941 when he took command of the successful U-38 on 15 July. He took the boat out on 2 patrols sinking the small Panaman merchant Longtaker on 18 Aug 1941. This was the last ship U-38 sank before being retired as a school boat.

{"text":"December 13, 1939: Following the Battle of the River Plate the German Panzerschiff Admiral Graf Spee headed for port in Montevideo, Uruguay. In the battle with the British cruisers HMS Exeter, HMS Ajax and HMNZS Achilles, the Graf Spee had received almost twenty hits from the British ships killing thirty six of the crew. The British losses were greater. The Exeter lost sixty one crewmen and was effectively out of action because of the heavy damage she received. The Ajax, also severely damaged, had two turrets knocked out and seven crewmen killed. The Achilles fared the best with only minor damage and the loss of four crewmen.\n\nThe captain of the Admiral Graf Spee, Hans Langsdorff, was under orders not to engage British warships but, Admiral Henry Harwood had trapped him off the coast and he had no option but to stand and fight. Of course Langsdorff had no idea of how badly the British ships were damaged when he made for port.\n\nUnder International law the Graf Spee could only remain at a neutral port for seventy two hours. Ships of belligerent nations could make necessary repairs but had to leave in the allotted time. Uruguay while neutral was a pro British country even though there was a large German population living there. The British allowed word to get out that a large battle fleet was en route to the mouth of the River Plate to greet the Graf Spee upon her departure. This was of course a lie, no large British warships were close enough to to reach the River Plate in time. However this did not matter.\n\nMessages had been flying back and forth between the German Ambassador in Montevideo and Berlin. Hitler informed Raeder that the Graf Spee must not under any circumstances be allowed to be interned in Montevideo. Raeder sent Langsdorff a message that in effect told him to fight his way out or scuttle the ship, it was his choice. After consulting the officers of the Graf Spee, Langsdorff made his decision. On the evening of the 16th they began to prepare the ship for scuttling.\n\nVital and secret equipment on the ship was destroyed and charges were set all around the ship. The majority of the crew were transferred to the tanker Tacoma while other items, including the ship's bell and battle ensign, were taken ashore to be returned to Germany.\n\nWhile a quarter of a million people gathered on shore to watch what they were sure would be a great battle the Admiral Graf Spee weighed anchor. The ship began her departure at about 18:30 hours and headed for the open sea followed by the Tacoma. Just outside the breakwater the Tacoma stopped and transferred the crew to two waiting tugs from Argentina. Shortly after this action the Uruguayan Navy escorted the Tacoma back to\nMontevideo where she would spend the rest of the war interned.\n\nThe Admiral Graf Spee now outside the three mile limit dropped anchor. She sat there for about half an hour during which time the battle ensign's that were raised before she departed Montevideo were taken down and Langsdorff and the remaining crew members boarded the captains launch and moved away from the ship. The Admiral Graf Spee exploded sending the aft turret into the air and clear of the ship, severing the stern and wrecking the superstructure. The ship burning from stem to stern sank into the shallow waters off Montevideo. Langsdorff's final entry in the ship's log \"Graf Spee put out of service on December 17, 1939 at 20:00 hours\"\n\nLangsdorff and the crew were taken to Buenos Aries, Argentina but were interned as POW's. Brutally attacked in the press as a coward for not fighting or going down with his ship, Langsdorff knew his career as a German Naval Officer was over. Even though he and his crew had captured and sunk nine ships (without the loss of a single life on either side) before her tragic demise. On December 18 he met for one last time with the crew. He explained to them that he lacked no courage and chose to scuttle the ship to save the lives of hundreds of sailors who would have been killed for no reason in a battle they could not have won.\n\nAfter midnight Langsdorff dismissed himself and returned to his room. Alone and disheartened he lit a cigar and had a glass of scotch. On December 20, 1939, the third commander of the Admiral Graf Spee, Kapit\u00e4n zur See Hans Langsdorff shot himself in the head. His funeral was attended by his crew and local officials. The captain of the SS Ashlea, a British ship, was also there on behalf of the British sailors who had once been held captive aboard the Graf Spee. This was a tremendous show of respect for an honorable adversary."}

{"text":"In June, almost at the same time, the Admirals commanding the French and British fleets in the Mediterranean despatched each two frigates to ascertain one another's movements. The British pair were the Dido, 28, Captain George Henry Towry, and Lowestoft, 32, Captain Robert Gambier Middleton; the French, the Minerve, 40, Captain Delorme, and Artemise, 36, Captain Decasse. The enemies sighted each other to the north of Minorca on June 24th, early in the morning. The French retired, and meanwhile cleared for action. Having first drawn far ahead, they turned and stood to meet the Dido and Lowestoft. The Minerve was in advance, and engaged the Dido at 8.30 A.M. The Minerve attempted to run down her opponent, but, owing to the Dido porting her helm, only struck an oblique blow, and entangled her bowsprit in her enemy's rigging. The French endeavoured to board, but were beaten off, and in the heavy swell the Minerve 's bowsprit snapped and went overboard carrying with it the Dido's mizen-mast. The Minerve passed along the Dido's larboard side, carrying away sails and rigging, but, as soon as she was clear, was attacked by the Lowestoft, and had her foremast, main and mizentop-mast shot away. The Artemise, instead of helping her consort, only fired a broadside at each of the British ships, and retreated, pursued by the Lowestoft. Left to themselves, the Minerve and Dido repaired damage and cleared their decks. At 10.30 the Lowestoft was recalled by signal. At 11.30 she placed herself on the Minerve s quarter and opened a heavy fire, whilst the Dido made sail to renew the attack. At 11.45 the Minerve hailed to say that she surrendered. The action reflects great credit upon the senior British officer, Captain Towry, who had so boldly engaged a far superior force."}

Unfortunately, this beautiful jewel of a liner's life was very brief but will always be remembered as an elegant experience while it lasted.\n\nThe fast way to cross.\n\nIn August 1936 the Union Steam Ship Company took delivery of its new trans-Tasman liner, Awatea. In September the ship began a new express service between Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe Awatea (meaning Eye of the Dawn) was one of the most famous and beautiful ships under the Union flag and the only way to cross the Tasman Sea.

A year later she would be sunk while serving as a troop transport.\n\nShe was built to the company's design by Vickers-Armstrong at Barrow-in-Furness and was a handsome vessel with a high standard of accommodation. Her length was 527 ft, with a beam of 74 ft, and a gross tonnage of 13,482.\n\nThe Awatea's first class public rooms rivaled many liners operating from New York to Europe.\n\nHer speed, comfort, and ability to keep going with the minimum of time in port, together with the publicity sense of her master, Captain A. H. Davey, made her a popular and well-known ship. In the summer of 1937 she made 11 Tasman crossings in 41 days and in the same year she brought the times for the Auckland-Sydney and Sydney-Wellington passages to less than 56 hours.

In recognition of this, she was presented a stainless steel greyhound that was mounted on the foremast of the ship. Captain Davey was the Master most associated with Awatea and on his retirement in 1941, he took (or was presented with it) the greyhound with him and had it mounted on his home in Auckland.\n\nAt the outbreak of war she was undergoing her annual survey and was fitted with a 4 in. gun aft. She continued to cross the Tasman until July 1940 after which she made several trips to Vancouver and, in addition, was used for transporting troops and refugees. In September 1941 she was requisitioned by the British Government for use as a troop transport and did three voyages. Then she was fitted out to take part in Operation Torch, the Allied landings in North Africa. She carried the 6th Commando group to off Algiers where she dropped them early on 8 November 1942. Eventually the Awatea anchored off Bougie, but as she was leaving German bombers attacked her and despite good anti-aircraft fire she was hit several times and sank during the night. The master, Captain G. B. Morgan, was awarded the D.S.O. and several of the crew were decorated for the ship's part in the operation.\n\nThe Awatea's wheelhouse and bridge.\n\nDuring her six years of life the Awatea steamed 576,132 miles, slightly more than half in peacetime, including 225 Tasman crossings.

{"text":"Archive for Wreck\n\nWhen we first learn to dive, we quickly come to recognise that our sport gives us the opportunity to visit sites and places that few others are privileged to see. As technical divers we have trained to take our abilities and experiences even further \u2013 technical divers are at the forefront of exploring the dive sites and deep ship wrecks of the world. In many cases, we are amongst the first visitors to discover these locations.\n\nWith this privilege comes responsibility, however.\n\nThe discoveries of lost wrecks are often highlighted in magazines \u2013 both diving and non-diving related publications are quick to report new finds. Often the sites we visit are not just exciting wrecks, but also the scene of a past human tragedy or one of archaeological significance. Where divers see an extraordinary wreck, others may see the final resting place of a relative or information relating to our heritage.\n\nThere are many examples of how technical diving can greatly assist both archaeologists and the families of those who have suffered losses through weather, accident and war. Teams of technical divers have been instrumental in identifying ship wrecks around the world, and commemorative wreaths have been placed on sites at the request of families. These are proactive and worthy contributions made by technical divers that benefit many parties. We must be conscious, however, that our actions and our sport can be misunderstood and, in some cases, abused. Several years ago a newspaper in the UK ran a series of stories accusing divers of plundering shipwrecks \u2013 there were calls for gas mixtures such as helium to be banned in order to prevent divers accessing deeper wrecks. Fortunately common sense prevailed, but we should take heed of the furore caused, and consider the steps we can take as technical divers to avoid such negative publicity.\n\nShipwrecks are threatened by many forms of damage \u2013 we should not allow scuba diving to be one of those threats. Removing artefacts from shipwrecks without proper authority is unnecessary and should not be condoned. If you have discovered a wreck and need to identify it, removal of objects should only be a last resort and after discussion with local authorities \u2013 once an item is taken, the archaeological value is greatly diminished and, in many cases, the object itself is likely to quickly disintegrate. Instead consider the value of photographic and video evidence, and seek the assistance of archaeologists and researchers in identifying your find without removing parts of the wreck. You should always be sure to consider any local regulations relating to the wrecks you visit.\n\nWe have all visited shallow water wrecks that have been stripped bare of their artefacts and character. As we visit new wrecks and sites for the first time, let's be sure that these mistakes are not repeated, and instead work to preserve them in situ for other divers, archaeologists and future generations.\n\nFor those based in the UK, further information on wreck diving and the removal of artefacts can be found here."}

{"text":"She served the Okanagan for over 50 years and is now one of the last surviving steam tugboats (not in service) in British Columbia (along with the SS Master in Vancouver). The SS Naramata, one of the hardest day-to-day workers of her time, now sits on the shores of Okanagan Lake in Penticton with the S.S. Sicamous Restoration Society, who over the last several years have been slowly restoring this beauty of a ship. This vessel is an exceptional piece of BC's maritime history.\n\nThe Ontario shipbuilder, Western Dry Dock and Ship Building Corp., prefabricated the steel hull, engines and the boiler. Once the pieces were completed they were then shipped, by rail, to the Okanagan of British Columbia and the owners, the Canadian Pacific Railway.\n\nOnce her parts arrived at Okanagan Landing, at the CPR rail station, she was completed. The Naramata was launched on the lake in April of 1914 where she remained the most modern tug until 1947. She served the communities surrounding Okanagan Lake until 1967 when she was decommissioned.\n\nThe SS Naramata was, in her time, one of the largest tugs working in BC. She measured just fewer than 30 metres long and had a breadth measurement of just over 6 metres and had an approximate weight of 74 tons. The engines provided up to 150 hp with an average towing speed of approximately 11 km per hour. Though she had a capacity to hold up to 20 passengers, the Naramata was almost solely used in the CPR's barge service, as she remained one of the most reliable vessels in service.\n\nOne of the main jobs the Naramata was involved in was moving a barge loaded with the local fruits from the many packing houses along the lake to the railway at Okanagan Landing. Speed and quality of service were an important factor that the Naramata never failed at. She consistently did her job by pushing two barges tied to her bow forming a v shape. With this positioning the Naramata effectively moved the barges across the water.\n\nThe work of the tugboat is easily considered very unspectacular, but in truth it is an essential worker in BC waters. At the time of her service, the SS Naramata was a definite asset to the communities of the Okanagan. She provided the vital connection between the orchard communities of the BC Interior and the rest of the province with her help in moving the local produce to the railway lines. This link proved invaluable until more modern vehicles were introduced and agriculture industries changed the ways of the industry.\n\nShe most recently found her home with the SS Sicamous Restoration Society and in 1991 was towed to sit beside the SS Sicamous, a famous steamship that travelled across the Okanagan Lake as well. She was cleaned and sat waiting for restoration. In 1993 she was she was dry-docked and had her hull reinforced as years of wear from sulphur and coal made her very thin. In the spring of 2003, her unstable deck railing was repaired and summer 2003 saw her open to the public for viewing."}

{"text":"navigation, science of directing a craft by determining its position, course, and distance traveled. Navigation is concerned with finding the way to the desired destination, avoiding collisions, conserving fuel, and meeting schedules.\n\nNavigation is derived from the Latin navis (\"ship\") and agere (\"to drive\"). Early mariners who embarked on voyages of exploration gradually developed systematic methods of observing and recording their position, the distances and directions they traveled, the currents of wind and water, and the hazards and havens they encountered. The facts accumulated in their journals made it possible for them to find their way home and for them or their successors to repeat and extend their exploits. Each successful landfall became a signpost along a route that could be retraced and integrated into a growing body of reliable information.\n\nFor these pathfinders, the danger of running into another vessel was negligible, but, as traffic expanded along established routes, collision avoidance became a concern. Emphasis shifted from finding the way to maintaining safe distances between craft moving in various directions at different speeds. Larger ships are easier to see but require more time to change speed or direction. When many ships are in a small area, an evasive action taken to avoid a collision may endanger other ships. This problem has been alleviated near busy seaports by confining incoming and outgoing ships to separate lanes, which are clearly marked and divided by the greatest practical distance. Airplanes travel so fast that, even though two pilots may see one another in time to initiate evasive action, their maneuvers may be nullified if either one incorrectly predicts the other's move. Ground-based air traffic controllers are charged with the responsibility for assigning aircraft to selected paths that minimize the likelihood of collision. Civil air navigation is profoundly influenced by the requirements of following the instructions of these controllers.\n\nThe advent of steam-powered ships during the first half of the 19th century added the problem of minimizing fuel consumption to the navigator's duties. In particular, beyond a certain safety factor, carrying excess fuel needlessly reduces cargo capacity.\n\nAdherence to a predetermined schedule, a matter of vital importance in space navigation in connection with fuel consumption, has become important in sea and air navigation for a different reason. Today each voyage or flight is a single link in a coordinated network of transport that carries people and goods from any starting place to any chosen destination. The efficient operation of the whole system depends upon assurance that each journey will begin and end at the specified times.\n\nModern navigation, in short, has to do with a globally integrated transportation system in which each voyage from start to finish is concerned with four basic objectives: staying on course, avoiding collisions, minimizing fuel consumption, and conforming to an established timetable.\n\nDevelopment of marine navigation\n\nThe earliest navigators probably learned to steer their ships between distant ports by familiarizing themselves with the sequences of intervening landmarks. This everyday visual approach to navigation is called piloting. Keeping these reference points in view required that they stay quite close to shore, but they made the transition to ocean voyages well out of sight of land thousands of years ago in various parts of the world. Regular trade was carried on between the island of Crete and Egypt, a distance of approximately 300 miles (500 km), more than 25 centuries before the Christian era. A passage in the Odyssey describes such a voyage from Crete: running before a north wind, sailing ships reached the mouth of the Nile in five days. Longer and longer routes became established by later sailors. By 600 bc the Phoenicians were routinely importing tin from Cornwall in the British Isles. Well before the 10th century ad, Irish seafarers successively reached the Shetland Islands, the Faeroe Islands, and Iceland, crossing 200 to 300 miles (300 to 500 km) of the North Atlantic at each stage. The Vikings repeated those passages and ventured even farther, settling Greenland and visiting North America. By about ad 400, Polynesian navigators had reached Hawaii from the Marquesas Islands, 2,300 miles (3,700 km) across the open Pacific.\n\nDirection finding\n\nThe details of how these voyagers found their way are not known, but the use of the Sun and stars as guides is mentioned in many sources, including the works of Homer and Herodotus, the Bible, and the Norse sagas.\n\nEast and west are traditionally synonymous with the directions of sunrise and sunset; north and south are determined by the directions of shadows cast by the noonday Sun. By night the stars rise in the east and set in the west, and in the Northern Hemisphere their apparent rotation around the Pole Star due to the Earth's rotation has long been a fact of the navigator's life.\n\nFor many centuries practical navigators oriented themselves by relying just as strongly on meteorological clues (the directions from which steady winds blew) as on astronomical ones (the positions and apparent motions of the Sun and stars). The Mediterranean sailor could confidently distinguish the cold north wind from the warm south wind. Names were assigned to eight principal winds, and the directions of these winds became the eight equally spaced points of the wind rose (rosa ventorum) of the Classical mariner. The wind rose may have been devised by the Etruscans, whose power reached its peak around the 6th century bc; it certainly antedates the octagonal Tower of the Winds built in Athens by Andronicus of Cyrrhus about 100 bc. From Roman times through the Middle Ages, an alternative 12-point wind rose was used by some navigators, but it was discarded in the 15th century when the Portuguese, at the opening of the great age of discovery, subdivided the eight points of the ancients and introduced a 16-point"}
{"text":"From: Dictionary of American Fighting Ships, Vol. A, 1991, Navy\nDepartment, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, Naval History\nDivision, Washington, D.C.\nADVANCE (two ships in this file)\nBrig:\nt. 144;\nl. 88';\nb. 21' 9\";\ndph. 8' 5\";\ncpl. 17\nThe first ADVANCE-a brigantine built in 1847 in New Kent County, Va.-was\nloaned to the Navy on 7 May 1850 by Mr. Henry Grinnell to participate in\nthe search for Sir John Franklin's arctic expedition which had been\nstranded in the frozen north since 1847. After last-minute\npreparations, the ship, under command of Lt. Edwin J. De Haven and in\ncompany with RESCUE, put to sea from New York on 23 May 1850. Storms\nbattered the two ships on the initial leg of the voyage and separated\nthem. However, both safely reached Disko Island, located off the west\ncoast of Greenland where Davis Strait gives way to Baffin Bay. ADVANCE\narrived on 24 June, and RESCUE pulled into port three days later. On\nthe 29th, the two ships headed into Baffin Bay, bound for Lancaster\nSound located north of Baffin Island and south of Devon Island. Off\nHaroe Island on 1 July, ADVANCE encountered pack ice. A week later, she\nand her consort were caught in the pack just north of Upernavik. For the\nnext three weeks, the two ships fought their way through the ice. On the\n29th, they cleared the pack and continued their voyage across Melville\nBay to Lancaster Sound. The two ships entered the sound on 19 August\nand, that same day, encountered two British vessels engaged in the same\nmission as the Americans.\nThat evening, a storm blew up and separated ADVANCE and RESCUE. The next\nday dawned \"thick and foggy,\" but the wind had abated. ADVANCE began\nsearching for her companion. By 25 August, she was off Cape Riley on\nDevon Island where she put ashore a landing party to search for clues to\nthe whereabouts of the Franklin expedition. While the searchers ashore\nwere discovering the former campsite of some unidentified party, ADVANCE\nwas run aground by a strong current. The British ship PRINCE ALBERT\noffered assistance, but RESCUE showed up at about the same time.\nMoreover, ADVANCE lightened her load and succeeded in hauling off by her\nown efforts.\nOn 26 August, the two ships attempted the passage of Wellington Channel\nto search the area north of Cape Spencer. Soon however, they found the\nway north blocked by a solid mass of pack ice and prudently returned\nsouth to the vicinity of Point Innes. There, the Americans again\nencountered the British, along with positive evidence of the Franklin\nparty having camped nearby. Heartened by that find and by a favorable\nchange in weather conditions, they headed back toward Wellington\nChannel. At Beechy Island, all the search vessels gathered in a cove\n(now called Union Bay) to plan a coordinated search. While the leading\nofficers were so engaged, a party sent ashore discovered three graves\nand \"other unmistakable evidences of the missing expedition (Franklin's)\nhaving passed its first winter here.\" At that point she and RESCUE\nentered Wellington Channel to pursue the search, but the pack ice\nquickly closed in upon the two ships. Though they tried to escape the\nclutches of the pack, abysmal weather foiled their attempts, and RESCUE\nsuffered a damaged rudder. By mid-September, they were caught fast in\nthe floating\nFor the duration of the winter, ADVANCE and RESCUE were at the mercy of\nthe drifting floe. For what remained of September and most of October,\nthey drifted in Wellington Channel, discovering the northern peninsula\nof Devon Island which they named Grinnell in honor of the expedition's\nbenefactor. During November, changing winds carried them back and forth\npast Beechy Island. In December, the floe made the transit of Lancaster\nSound and, on 14 January 1851, they reentered Baffin Bay. Their\nimprisonment, however, did not end until early June. They had passed\nDavis Strait in May, and the floe began to break up near the end of the\nfirst week in June. RESCUE-repaired-cleared the pack on 7 June 1851.\nADVANCE followed the next day.\nThe expedition replenished at Disko Bay and sought to renew the search.\nHowever, the ice proved heavier than in the previous year; and prudence\ndictated that the mission be abandoned for the time being. Therefore,\nthe two ships headed back to the United States. ADVANCE arrived in New\nYork on 30 September 1851, and RESCUE reached that port on 7 October.\nBoth ships were returned to Mr. Grinnell, and he immediately began\noutfitting ADVANCE for another Arctic expedition.\nPreparations for the second Franklin rescue expedition took about 20\nmonths. ADVANCE finally departed New York on 30 May 1853, Passed\nAssistant Surgeon Elisha Kent Kane in command. The expedition stopped at\nUpernavik, Greenland, to purchase supplies and, most importantly, sled\ndogs for searches ashore and on the solidly frozen floes. Continuing\nnorth, ADVANCE passed the length of Baffin Bay reaching Smith Sound-the\nnorthern terminus of Baffin Bay-by 7 August. Near the end of August, she\nreached her northernmost point-about 78-43 north latitude-in Kane Basin,\nnamed for the ship's commanding officer, Passed Assistant Surgeon Kane.\nAt that point, Kane decided to pass the winter among a group of islets\nnear the Greenland coast rather than to return south to some safer\nharbor. By 10 September, ADVANCE was imprisoned in the ice. The interior\nof the ship underwent extensive preparations for wintering farther north\nthan any previous expedition. When that was complete, the crew began\nexpeditions across the frozen wastes both on the Greenland shore and the\nfrozen pack. Kane and his officers also established a scientific station\nto observe climatic conditions and to make astronomical calculations.\nTheir expeditions on foot, however, were hampered by the loss of almost\nall their sled dogs to disease. In the absence of animal transport, the\nmen themselves carried out the searches and explorations on foot,\nserving as beasts of burden to manhandle caches of supplies to points\nwhich would allow for more distant searches in the future.\nOn one such expedition in late March 1854, four of the party suffered so\nseverely from frostbite that they had to be left behind under the care\nof a fifth man while the remaining members of the party-too physically\nexhausted to do more than drag their own persons across the frozen\nwastes-headed back to the brig for help. The leader of that group, upon\nreturning to the brig, volunteered to return with the rescue party as a\nguide. However, his own ordeal caused him to fall victim of a temporary\nmental disorder and prevented him from rendering any real help. It was\nonly good luck-first in finding the advanced party's trail and then in\nsighting a canvas tent at the site of the disabled men's \"encampment\"-\nand their own Herculean efforts that allowed the rescue party to\ncomplete their mission. Even that success however, was marred by the\nfact that two of the rescued men later succumbed to their infirmities.\nFatigue and illness of all associated with the rescue expedition\nprevented Kane from undertaking further searches until the end of April.\nDuring that interlude, Eskimos arrived in the area, and Kane bartered\nwith them for additional sled dogs. The four animals he thus obtained\nallowed him to fit out a single seven-dog team which greatly extended\nthe range of their searches. In his own words, The value of these\nanimals for Arctic ice-travel (sic) can hardly be over-estimated (sic).\"\nThrough the ensuing summer search parties ranged the far northern coasts\nof Greenland and the eastern coast of Ellesmere Island searching for\nevidence of Sir John Franklin's party and making notes on geography and\nclimate.\nADVANCE's crewmen passed the second winter in a state of near\nhibernation. The difficulties of the previous year had sapped their\nstrength, and their provisions were too scant to restore it. Scurvy-that\ndread disease of the sea-riddled their ranks to the point that Kane and\none other man \". . . only remained to attend upon the sick, and carry on\nthe daily work of the ship, if that name could still appropriately\ndesignate the burrow which we inhabited.\" The sun returned late in\nFebruary 1855, and wild game followed it in March. Reasonably adequate\nfood and the sunlight slowly brought the men back some semblance of full\nstrength. At that point, Kane decided to abandon the ship-still frozen\nsolidly in the floe-and make it across the ice to the Danish settlements\nof southern Greenland. Shortages of fuel and food, as well as the\nweakened condition of the crew, made that decision inescapable.\nPreparations for the journey were multifaceted and complicated. Those\ncapable of work prepared two 25-foot whaleboats and a 13-foot dinghy by\nmounting them on iron-shod wooden runners and then loading them with\nprovisions. Meanwhile, Kane took the dog sled and team out to an\nabandoned Eskimo hut located some 35 miles from the brig. There, he\nestablished an advanced depot to store provisions for the actual\njourney. During April and the first half of May, he made several trips\ncarrying supplies to his makeshift way station. On 15 May 1855, he began\ntransporting the incapacitated members of the crew to the way station.\nTwo days later, the main group began its torturous trek across the ice\nhummocks with the three boat-sleds. The main party, without the\nassistance of dogs, managed a snail's pace of only some three and one-\nhalf miles a day. While the main group inched its way, Kane continued\nhis more rapid trips-facilitated by the dogs-both back to the brig and\nto an Eskimo camp located about 75 miles south of the ship. In this\nmanner, he moved the sick to the way station, brought additional\nsupplies from the ship, and returned from the Eskimo camp with fresh\ngame. He last visited the ship on 8 June 1855 and, by the middle of that\nmonth, all the sick gradually joined the main party then nearing\nLittleton Island. The mode of travel again was Kane's dog sled. During\nthe journey south toward Cape Alexander, the party suffered numerous\nbreaks through the ice as the spring thaw arrived. At least one man,\nActing Carpenter Ohlsen, died from exposure resulting from such an\nincident.\nBy 18 June, the entire party reached open water at the edge of the floe\nnear Cape Alexander. The journey had netted them only 81 miles in 31\ndays, but the numerous cutbacks and detours necessitated by the ice\nhummocks, resulted in an actual trek of over 300 miles. From that point,\nthey took to the boats. During the next phase of the journey, they\nalternated between runs across open water under sail and marches across\nfrozen ice hummocks when necessary. By 21 July 1855, the men reached\nCape York, the point at which they would begin the transit to Upernavik.\nThere, they erected a rock monument in which they left information\nregarding their planned movements, a list of provisions on hand, and a\nbrief summary of the expedition's findings. That project completed, Kane\nand his crew started out across Melville Bay. On 6 August, Kane led his\nexhausted party into Upernavik. They took passage from Upernavik in the\nDanish brig MARIANNE to Disko Island where they were met by the relief\nexpedition made up of Arctic and Release under the command of Lt.\nHartstene. The two relief ships brought the survivors into New York on\n11 October 1855. Presumably, the pack ice eventually crushed and sank\nthe abandoned ADVANCE.\nSwStr:\nt. 880;\nl. 230';\nb. 26';\ndr. 12' (aft);\ndph. 15';\ns. 12 k. a. 1 20-pdr., 4 24-pdrs. how.\nThe second ADVANCE-a schooner-rigged, sidewheel steamer built at\nGreenock, Scotland, by Caird & Co. was launched on 3 July 1862 as the\nClyde packet LORD CLYDE-was jointly purchased by the state of North\nCarolina and the firm of Lord Power & Co. to serve as a blockade runner\nduring the Civil War. She was renamed AD VANCE in honor of the Governor\nof North Carolina, Zebulon B. Vance. After more than 20 highly\nsuccessful voyages and 40 close calls with Union ships standing blockade\nwatches, AD VANCE was captured by Santiago de Cuba on 10 September 1864\nwhen she attempted to put to sea from Wilmington, N.C. Condemned by the\nNew York prize court, AD VANCE was purchased by the Navy that same\nmonth, renamed ADVANCE and commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 28\nOctober 1864 Lt. Comdr. John H. Upshur in command.\nADVANCE departed New York on 30 October, arrived off Wilmington, N.C.,\non 14 November; and joined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. In\naddition to her reversed role-catching blockade runners as opposed to\nbeing one-she participated in the two expeditions against Fort Fisher,\nlocated on Confederate (Federal) Point at the mouth of the Cape Fear\nRiver. The first-abortive-attempt was carried out between 24 and 26\nDecember 1864 after a bizarre attempt to flatten some of the defenses by\nrunning what amounted to a fire-ship stocked with some 30 tons of\ngunpowder aground at a point some 250 to 300 yards north of the fort.\nNeedless to say, that unique shore bombardment proved to be a huge flash\nin the pan causing little or no damage. When the fleet moved in on the\n24th, ADVANCE was in the 1st Reserve Division which appears to have\nconstituted a second line of bombarding ships behind the ironclads. She\nfired only her large rifle and stopped that when she had to go to the\nassistance of the stricken OSCEOLA and tow her to a safe anchorage. The\nfollowing day, Christmas 1864, she and five or six other warships moved\noff to draw fire from Half Moon Battery as preparation for the Army's\nlandings. Though an 8-inch gun in the Confederate battery drove off\nother vessels in the division as well as some Army transports, ADVANCE\nclaimed credit for silencing that gun with her heavy rifle. The Army\nlanded late Christmas Day. Firing continued through the day and\nintermittently that night-fire that degenerated into covering fire to\nprotect the bogged-down Federals instead of a bombardment preparatory to\nthe by-then canceled assault. ADVANCE retired from Cape Fear on the 26th\nand the remnants of General Butler's Army force embarked on the 27th.\nAfter a visit to Norfolk for supplies between 31 December 1864 and 11\nJanuary 1865, ADVANCE returned to her blockade station off the Cape Fear\nRiver mouth on 13 January-Friday the 13th, to be exact, an ominous day\nfor the Southerners defending Fort Fisher. Before dawn that day, the\nFederal fleet unleashed a terrific bombardment on the fort. Not long\nthereafter around 0800, about 8,000 Union troops began landing on the\npeninsula north of the fortifications. The following day, the fleet\nresumed its bombardment while the Army began landing its own supporting\nartillery. ADVANCE, in one of the reserve divisions, helped support the\nlanding of the Army guns and supplies while the bulk of the fleet\ncontinued to batter the Fort Fisher defenses. The main attack commenced\non 15 January 1865. The Army aided by sailors and marines from the\nfleet, stormed the Southern positions. Heavily outnumbered and\noutgunned. the Confederates fought with the tenacity and ferocity of\ndesperation-more often than not at close quarters with bayonets and\nrifle butts. They fought the entire day and into the evening but to no\navail. The last fortifications, Battery Buchanan and the Mound, gave up\nat about 2200 that evening. The Navy had closed the eastern portion of\nthe Confederacy's last avenue of contact with the outside world.\nADVANCE resumed duty on the blockade. With the last deep-draft\nConfederate port closed, few runners tried to make the run. Those that\ndid were of very shallow draft and of even more limited cargo capacity\nthan that characteristic of their deep-draft predecessors. That fact\nmade blockade running a highly unprofitable venture considering the\ndanger involved. As a consequence ADVANCE participated in no captures.\nInstead, she served as a dispatch and supply ship for the remainder of\nher tour of duty with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. On 11\nFebruary, she put into Norfolk for a month of repairs before embarking\npassengers and sailing for New York on 13 March. She reached that port\nthe following day and entered the New York Navy Yard. On 16 March 1865,\nADVANCE was detached from the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and was\nplaced out of commission at New York. She remained inactive for about\nthree months during which time hostilities ended in most essentials. On\n22 April, almost a fortnight after General Robert E. Lee surrendered the\nArmy of Northern Virginia, ADVANCE was renamed FROLIC (q.v.). On 12 June\n1865, she was recommissioned under her new name, Lt. Comdr. John H.\nUpshur again in command.\nOn 24 June 1865, FROLIC departed the east coast to join the newly formed\nEuropean Squadron and arrived at Flushing in the Netherlands on 17 July.\nOver the next four years, she made ceremonial visits to ports in Europe\nincluding many on the Mediterranean littoral. Those events reached a\nparticularly high frequency during 1867 and 1868 when David Glasgow\nFarragut commanded the squadron. On 22 March 1869, the ship departed\nLisbon, Portugal, to return to the United States. She arrived in New\nYork on 30 April and was placed out of commission there on 8 May 1869.\nRecommissioned on 24 September 1869, FROLIC patrolled the fishing\ngrounds off Nova Scotia between April and October 1870. She arrived at\nWashington D.C., on 26 October 1870 and was decommissioned there on 11\nNovember for repairs. On 18 January 1872, she was recommissioned at\nWashington, Lt. Comdr. G. C. Remey in command. On 19 February, FROLIC\ndeparted Washington, D.C., to relieve TALLAPOOSA on patrol off the New\nEngland coast. She concluded that assignment in May and returned to\nWashington on the 24th. Between 12 and 16 June 1872, she made the\npassage between Washington and New York. At the latter port, she became\nstation ship and, on the 29th, broke the flag of Vice Admiral Stephen C.\nRowan. She served alternately as station ship at New York and on patrols\nat sea until 30 April 1874 at which time she was decommissioned at\nPhiladelphia for repairs. Recommissioned on 18 August 1875, FROLIC\ndeparted Philadelphia for duty on the South Atlantic Station a week\nlater. She cruised the coasts of Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil for a\nlittle over two years. She returned to Washington, D.C., on 20 October\n1877 and was decommissioned there for the last time on 31 October 1877.\nFROLIC remained at Washington, in ordinary, until sold to Mr. J. P.\nAgnew, of Alexandria, Va., on 1 October 1883."}
{"text":"September 4, 2012\n\nUntitled, photo by bvriesem\n\"We have met the enemy and they are ours: Two Ships, two brigs, one schooner and one sloop.\"\n~United States Commodore Oliver Perry\n\nThe sloop was Friends Good Will, captured by the British briefly. The story of the Friends Good Will begins:\n\nOliver Williams was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts, a village near Boston, in 1774. Undoubtedly, he grew up aware of, and hearing stories about, the birth of his young nation.\n\nOliver Williams later saw opportunity in the vast Northwest Territory. He opened a dry goods store in Detroit, Michigan Territory, in 1808. The inventory for his store, like nearly all finished goods, came from the east. He made two trips each year, overland. The trips were slow and the resources he expended were never anything more than a continuing drain against whatever profits early businesses in the cash starved frontier would permit.\n\nIn 1810, Oliver Williams took a chance. The gamble was not particularly unusual for men of his nature. Men did not conduct business on the frontier without an entrepreneurial instinct. He decided to build a ship. The vessel would use the only \"highway\" available \u2013 Lake Erie; Buffalo to Detroit, non-stop, direct. His inventory would arrive faster, and in greater quantity, and while the vessel was a substantial capital outlay, she would sail for years and could earn money by shipping goods the length of each shipping season. Other vessels plying the Lakes were finding cargoes and the steady stream of settlers assured volumes of cargo and demand for the ship would only grow with each coming season.\n\nOliver Williams built his ship at the River Rouge, on the banks of the Detroit River. A private shipyard was laid out adjacent to the Federal yard, where the army transport snow Adams, the only government vessel on the upper Lakes, was built years before. Other ships sailed past while this new vessel took shape, the schooners Salina and Ellen and the sloop Contractor. The sight of each of them only encouraged Oliver Williams. His idea had merit; his gamble would pay.\n\nThe new ship slid down the ways, in early 1811. He christened her Friends Good Will. While no one knows for certain the origin of the name, a coincidence seems too obvious to ignore. The name may well have been in honor of an earlier Friends Good Will, which transported the first wave of Irish immigrants from Larne to Boston in 1717. It is likely Oliver Williams knew her story and borrowed her name. His vessel, he likely hoped, would also bring waves of settlers to a new land of opportunity \u00ad the Michigan Territory."}

When I used to float around on a LHD they had capsules you tossed over the side and they inflated into a lifeboat on their own.

It was generally assumed by the time you abandon a warship, the boat would be angled to the point you couldn't lower boats anyways.\n\nI have no idea if cruiser ships have to carry this kind of capsule or not, but it seems odd they don't.

{"text":"Footnotes\n\nThe Battle of Cape Santa Maria took place off the southern Portuguese coast, in which a British squadron under the command of Commodore Graham Moore attacked a Spanish squadron commanded by Brigadier Don Jos\u00e9 de Bustamante y Guerra, without declaration of war between the Britain and Spain. Under the terms of a secret convention Spain had to pay 72 million francs annually to France, until it declared war on Britain. The British had learned of the treaty, and knew it was likely that Spain would declare war soon. Bustamante set sail from Montevideo on 9 August 1804 with four frigates loaded with gold and silver, as well as other valuable cargo. On 22 September Vice Admiral Lord Collingwood ordered Captain Graham Moore, commanding the 44-gun frigate HMS Indefatigable, to intercept and detain the Spanish ships, peacefully, if possible. At dawn on 5 October, the Spanish frigates were sighted off the coast of Portugal. At 7 a.m. they sighted the four British frigates. Bustamante ordered his ships into line of battle, and within an hour the British came up in line, to windward of the Spaniards. Commodore Moore, sent Lieutenant Ascott to the Spanish flagship Medea, to explain his orders. Bustamante naturally refused to surrender, and impatient of delays, at 10 a.m. Commodore Moore ordered a shot be fired ahead over the bow of Medea. Almost immediately a general exchange of fire broke out. Within ten minutes the magazine of the Mercedes exploded destroying the ship (the moment depicted in this painting), and killing all but 40 of her 240 crew. Within half an hour the Santa Clara and the Medea had surrendered, and the Fama broke away trying to flee, the H.M.S. Medusa quickly followed. However, Moore ordered the faster H.M.S. Lively to pursue, capturing the Fama a few hours later. Spain declared war on Great Britain on 14 December 1804, only to suffer a catastrophic defeat less than a year later at the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805."}

It is the official website of the Sea Research Society.\u2122 The Society was chartered in 1972 as a non-profit organization for educational and research purposes. The president of Sea Research Society is Dr. E. Lee Spence.\n\nThe Society has carried out over 20 major expeditions. Some of them are listed below. A number of them, such as that to the Civil War steamer Georgiana, took place over a period of years.\n\nHunley Expedition\nThe Civil War submarine H.L. Hunley was the first submarine in the history of the world to sink an enemy ship. The Hunley succeeded in sinking the USS Housatonic, but never returned from her historic mission. The wreck was discovered by the underwater archaeologist E. Lee Spence in 1970. Spence believed that the wreck needed to be preserved for posterity. Underwater Archaeologist George Fischer of the U.S. National Park Service suggested that the best way to do that was to create a not-for-profit research foundation to do the actual raising. The Sea Research Society was chartered in 1972 as part of the efforts to secure permission to raise the Hunley. The idea was that the Society would raise the Hunley and would then donate it to the State of South Carolina. The Society was never able to obtain permission to salvage the wrecked sub, but Dr. Spence returned to the site numerous times to more closely pinpoint and its location. In 1976, the Hunley was nominated by the National Park Service for placement on the National Register of Historic Places on the basis of the Sea Research society's reports of its discovery by Dr. Spence. In 1978, the wreck was officially placed on the National Register and in 1980 Dr. Spence filed a formal claim to ownership of the wreck with the Federal district Court in Charleston. In May of 1995 the Hunley was dug up and video taped by a joint expedition of NUMA and SCIAA (South Carolina Institute of Archaeology & Anthropology), which was directed by Dr. Mark Newell of SCIAA and partially funded by novelist Clive Cussler. That September, at the official request of the South Carolina Hunley Commission, Dr. Spence donated his rights to the wreck to the State.

The passenger list on that maiden voyage included some of the world's wealthiest people at the time and immigrants to the United States and Canada from Great Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia and other parts of the world.\n\nOne of the facts that has come out about the Titanic sinking in recent years is there was one family of African descent traveling on the ill-fated liner, the Laroches\n\n25 year old Haitian native Joseph Laroche, his pregnant French wife Juliette, and daughters Simonne and Louise,\nwere onboard and in the process of moving from their former home in Paris to Haiti to escape the racial discrimination he'd encountered in France while trying to find a job as an engineer. Laroche's uncle Cincinnatus Leconte was president of Haiti at the time and arranged a job for him as a math teacher.\n\nLaroche's mother had booked first class passage on the liner LaFrance for them but after the Laroche's heard about the Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Transatlantiqueline's policy of children not being allowed to dine with their parents, they exchanged the tickets for second class passage aboard the Titanic.\n\nJuliette, Simonne and Louise managed to be placed on a lifeboat by Joseph and were picked up later by the RMS Carpathia Joseph did not survive and his body was never recovered Juliette Laroche returned to France with her daughters and later gave birth to a son. Louise died in 1998 as one of the last eight survivors of the disaster.\n\nThe disaster involving the 'unsinkable' ship which was the largest built in the world at the time led to improvements in maritime safety. The Titanic remains on the seabed of the North Atlantic gradually disintegrating in 12,415 feet (3794 m) of water.\n\nSince the discovery of the wreck site, thousands of artifacts from arguably the most famous ship in the world have been recovered, have been displayed in museums around the world and the ship still holds the world's collective attention a century later"}
{"text":"Container Dominoes\n\nJohna's recent post about Keith Tantlinger, the inventor of the Twistlock, the device that has made modern container shipping possible, reminded me of the question that I always have when I see a loaded container ship in the harbor. How securely do all those containers, stacked so high on top of each other, remain stacked when the ship rolls and pitches in heavy weather? (Indeed, how stable is the ship itself when loaded so high, although that's a different question.) Perhaps suggested by another of Johna's posts, the image of falling dominoes comes to mind, or perhaps a house of cards\u2026\n\nWell, now there's an answer.\n\nThe Twistlock locking corners that anchor each container to the container below, and to the container above, hold up surprisingly well. In this photo of the Rena, the container ship that grounded a week ago on Astrolabe Reef off the northern coast of New Zealand, entire stacks of containers so anchored lean at a 45-degree angle without collapsing\u2026\n\nBut, inevitably, some containers are falling into the sea and washing up on local beaches. Here, \"local residents come to look at a washed up container with its cargo of packets of partly-cooked hamburgers littering the beach\u2026\" (Usually, locals do more than just look\u2026) Unfortunately, not just hamburgers, but large amounts of oil are now also washing up on the beach, and there is no end in sight.\n\nThe Atlantic has a series of 32 stunning photos of this, New Zealand's worst environmental disaster. Take a look!\n\n3 Responses to Container Dominoes\n\nI was just wondering this very thing about container ships, as I watched one stacked high go by in the distance out at Brighton Beach last weekend. Now I know they're impressively stable. Thanks for the post and the link\u2013the photos are fascinating.\n\nThey are impressively stable. But some do end up in the ocean each year. How many?\n\n\"At any given time, between 5 million and 6 million boxes are in transit. The TT Club calculates that the total number lost over the side is probably less than 2,000 per year. This means that less than 0.005% of the containers shipped each year end afloat in the ocean\u2026\"\n\nOther estimates are up to 10,000 containers lost per year, and these numbers are a few years old. Still, percentage-wise, very few are lost.\n\nNevertheless, thousands are lost each year. Although statistically the chances of loss are small, if you are a company, and your container is lost, the consequences can be severe.\n\nAnd what happens to the lost containers, and to their contents, is fascinating.\n\nOn the sea floor, the lost containers can become artificial reefs, habitats for marine life. (On the other hand, they can also release toxic chemicals.)\n\nThe most famous story is that of the thousands of Friendly Floatees, plastic bath toys that were released from a container lost in the North Pacific Ocean in 1992, whose drift around the world every since has helped trace ocean currents and understand other aspects of the oceans. This has mostly been the work of oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer (see his newsletter and book, and the recent book, Moby-Duck, about him and the whole \"plastic duck\" story)."}
{"text":"When, in the summer of 1942, a convoy designated PQ17 left Iceland with thirty-six merchant ships and arrived in Murmansk with only eleven ships afloat, the convoy losses were deemed unacceptable and the convoy system was suspended. When the Russians were informed of this, Stalin wrote an insulting letter to Prime Minister Churchill implying cowardice because of the PQ17 affair and the lack of good faith by failing to create a second front in 1942. Both Churchill and Roosevelt, apparently, felt a gesture should be made to placate Stalin. Accordingly, a new convoy designated PQ18 was decided upon. But, could it get through?\n\nThis convoy would consist of, you guessed it, the Emmons and Rodman plus the cruiser Tuscaloosa along with three Royal Navy destroyers. No merchant ships would be included. The contribution of the Emmons would be 35 tons of mixed stores mostly canned meats and vegetables. Every available space in the magazines was filled with four-inch projectiles. The Tuscaloosa would carry mostly munitions, medical supplies and personnel for a proposed hospital unit. On all ships, every unoccupied space, above and below decks, was utilized to carry provisions.\n\nThe Germans had submarines, air patrols and battle cruisers waiting and watching for PQ18 along much of the 1500 mile route. When the convoy got close to its destination, it had to pass as close as 50 miles to German-occupied Finland. Most of the trip was above the Arctic Circle so the crew became \"blue noses.\" This Arctic Circle honor is much like the \"shellback\" honor received when crossing the equator. No initiations are given for this honor since being constantly tossed about and nearly frozen, is considered initiation enough.\n\nThe weather during most of the voyage was marked with overcast skies, mist, rain and fog. There was nearly always a stiff wind which sometimes reached gale strength. The water temperature was within a degree or two of freezing. Luckily, it was summer. The foul weather largely contributed to the success of the mission as the convoy was only spotted once but since the Germans were looking for merchant ships, it didn't occur to them that they actually had spotted PQ18. The convoy made it over and back without incident."}
{"text":"Thursday, 15 April 2010\n\nWhat causes ship wrecks?\n\nHi all.\n\nAfter our tour of the Heritage Center yesterday we had a lot of questions. As you know I am fascinated by maritime history. So today, we set out to learn more from the sanctuary staff about the history of the ships in Thunder Bay.\n\n\"An etching of the sidewheel steamer New Orleans as it looked in the 1840's.\"\n\nLast night we learned that there were a lot of ships that sank in Thunder Bay. Today Sam and I wanted to find out why. We learned that storms, heavy fog, unmarked shoals (that's a fancy word for shallow water) and fires all caused shipwrecks. Sometimes mistakes made by the crew caused wrecks too. Many boats in Thunder Bay ran into each other just like cars do today! I guess the lakes must have been very busy for that to happen!\n\n\"The side of the New Orleans as it lies today in 10 feet of water\"\n\nThe earliest shipwreck discovered in Thunder Bay happened in 1849. This ship was a side-wheel steamboat called the New Orleans. Her job was to carry passengers up and down Lake Huron. One day the boat got lost in a thick fog near Thunder Bay Island. Because the captain couldn't see, the New Orleans got stuck in shallow water. Everyone on board was rescued by fisherman. Today people like to take boats and visit the wreck of the New Orleans. Here is a photo of what the shipwreck looks like. Boaters can easily find it because the sanctuary marks its location with a buoy.\n\nAnother shipwreck in Thunder Bay is the steamer Pewabic. Her story is a real mystery! In August, 1863, the Pewabic was headed south from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. She was carrying passengers and copper. The weather was perfect! As she was about to pass another ship, the Meteor, she suddenly turned. Right in front of the other ship! The Meteor didn't have time to react and crashed into the side of the Pewabic causing her to sink very quickly. To this day no one knows why the Pewabic turned.\n\nThis photomosaic shows what the Pewabic looks like today. A photomosaic is a large picture put together from many other pictures like a puzzle.\n\nThe New Orleans and the Pewabic are ships that sank a long time ago. I wanted to know if there were any ships that sank not so long ago! Sure enough, Steve had one - the Norrdmeer.\n\nThis was a ship that traveled all the way from Germany across the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes. Her job was to bring steel to the United States. Just North of Thunder Bay Island she hit a shoal and sank in shallow water. Steve showed Sam and I some pictures of the Nordmeer long after she sank. Both of us were surprised to see a chunk of the boat sticking up out of the water! We were even more surprised to find out that the chunk stayed like that for over 40 years!\n\n\"The last remnant of the hull above the surface of the water last year, no longer there today.\"\n\n\"The Nordmeer sits just below the surface of Lake Huron.\"\n\nWow, these stories show just how important the oceans, rivers and lakes are for trtasporta nd ferrying goods. You might be surprised to know that many things are still transported in this way today.

{"text":"Related Videos\n\nJones Act\n\nThe Jones Act is part of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, and addresses the rights of seamen injured on the job at sea. The Jones Act was designed primarily to offer relief to seamen, who were at a high risk of injury or death at sea. It only applies to seamen who meet eligibility criteria as laid down by the Act. Before the Merchant Marine Act was passed, a seaman's life was dramatically different from that we see today. Seamen were subject to ill treatment by their employers or masters, abused, and forced to work in filthy and unsafe work conditions. These workers had no recourse to justice in the event of an injury. Before the Jones Act came along, injuries were considered part of a seaman's life. Being injured, falling sick, or dying at sea were considered occupational hazards. Injured seamen could not hope to hold their employers accountable for negligent conditions contributing to the injury.\n\nAttitudes towards seamen began to undergo a slow change towards the turn of the last century. In 1912, the Titanic sank, and with it, the world was introduced to the high risks of a seaman's job, and the negligible protection they enjoyed under the law.\n\nSince the Jones Act was passed by Congress, it has undergone several changes in the form of judicial rulings that have challenged the definitions of key concepts of the Act. The definition of a seaman, as laid down by the Act, has expanded to include more and more numbers of workers. The Act is also sufficiently vague on certain important questions of seamen status or vessel status, so that maritime lawyers are constantly challenged by new cases which call a person or vessel's status into question.\n\nAlthough the Jones Act provides for compensation for injured seamen, it is vastly different from the Workers' Compensation Act, or even other maritime laws like the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act. Workers' Compensation payouts are available to injured workers as a matter of right, irrespective of whether the employer was negligent, and without the burden on the worker to prove employer negligence. The Jones Act however, requires that an injured seaman prove employer negligence in order to be eligible for benefits. The negligence does not have to be major, or even substantial. Even minor negligence on the part of an employer resulting in a seaman's injuries, can place the seaman eligible to file a Jones act claim.\n\nThe Jones Act offers injured workers access to substantial payouts that are far greater than the kind available under Worker's Compensation. That's why it's very important that you consult only with an experienced Jones Act lawyer who has experience handling injury claims under the Act.\n\nThe Jones Act lawyers at Schechter McElwee Shaffer and Harris, LLP have decades of experience representing seamen who have been injured on a vessel, and are eligible for benefits under the Jones Act.

{"text":"Lessons from the search for the USS Grunion\n\nSeventy years ago, on July 31, 1942, the submarine USS Grunion, along with her entire crew, disappeared without a trace in the icy waters of the wind-swept Bering Sea off the Aleutian Islands. Commander Mannert \"Jim\" Abele and the 69 men serving with him in the war against Imperial Japan had simply vanished.\n\nAnd if not for the dogged determination of Jim Abele's family \u2014 and the extraordinary collaboration of people across the United States and around the world \u2014 we might still know no more about this World War II tragedy. But Jim's wife Kay, raising three sons alone, never gave up her determination to unlock the mystery of her husband's fate, and when those sons became successful men \u2014 John, age five when he last saw his father, cofounded medical giant Boston Scientific; Bruce, twelve when the Grunionset out for the last time, became an engineer and inventor; and Brad, nine when his father left, was the owner of a management-recruiting firm \u2014 the three brothers embarked upon a quixotic quest to find the Grunionherself at the bottom of the Bering Sea.\n\nNaval authorities were unable or unwilling to reveal much beyond the fact that the Grunion was \"presumed missing or lost in action.\" Brad Abele compiled years of research about the Grunion and his father in a personal manuscript entitled Jim, but the first actionable clue came from Japan in March 2002. A scholar named Yutaka Iwasaki had posted a Japanese freighter captain's detailed account of a battle with an American submarine off Kiska Island on July 31, 1942 \u2014 and the Grunion had been the only American sub in the area on that date.\n\nThe Abele brothers continued to hunt for any information that might lead them closer to their father's sub. Robert Ballard, the world-famous explorer who found the Titanic and the Bismarck, and whose chance meeting with John Abele re-energized the search, advised the Abeles about mounting a longshot sonar search, but Ballard was committed to a different expedition in summer 2006, the first practicable window for a search in the brutal Bering Sea. So the Abeles put together a search team not aboard a sleek research vessel but on the Aquila, the rugged \"crabber\" skippered by savvy, adventurous Alaskan fishing-boat captain Kyle Garcia. And as the Aquila and sonar expert Art Wright and his team were in preparations to meet at Dutch Harbor to begin the search, Yutaka uncovered a long-lost Imperial Japanese Navy battle chart that actually provided the coordinates of the Grunion's last engagement. Captain Seiichi Aiura's chart was nothing less than a Rosetta stone for the Abeles \u2014 the clue no one had even imagined existed. It narrowed 200 square miles in the rough Bering waters to a target zone of only four square miles.\n\nThe team acquired sonar hits revealing what looked like a sub on the sea bottom \u2014 though many experts dismissed them as images of a sunken surface ship or even a dead whale. So the Abeles eventually decided to mount a second expedition, in August 2007, this time with a Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) to take video footage of the object \u2014 though with no guarantee that the Bering Sea's giant waves and sudden 100-mile-an-hour \"williwaw\" winds would cooperate. This time, John Abele would be aboard the Aquila.\n\nLate on the night of August 22, 2007, with a storm front looming, the ROV Max Rover's beacons knifed through the dark depths to reveal the ghostly contours of a submarine. The Grunionhad been sighted for the first time in 65 years."}

The boat's heavy wood construction also gave it an advantage in travelling through rocks or ice; it was much more immune to tears and punctures. That advantage became a disadvantage, though, when portagingwas necessary. The boat was far too heavy to carry, and it was necessary instead to cut a path through the brush, layrollers, and laboriously drag the boat overland. Regardless of the circumstances, crewing a York boat was an arduous task, and those who chose this life faced \"unending toil broken only by the terror of storms,\" according to explorer Sir John Franklin.\n\nThe York boat had a length of about 14 metres (46 ft) and the largest could carry over six (13,000 lb) of cargo. It had a pointed bow, a flat bottom, and a stern angled upward at 45 degrees, making beaching and launching easier. The boat was propelled both by oars and by a canvas sail, and steered with the use of a long steering pole\n\nSteering pole\n\nA steering pole is a light spar extending from the bow of a straight deck ship which aids the wheelsman in steering.Ancient literature indicates that steering poles have long been part of boat construction, and are referred to in ancient texts such as the Epic of Gilgamesh....\n\n, or a rudder when under sail.

After the NWC took over the PFC the practice of using bateaux was quickly adopted, birch bark canoes having proved too dangerous on the rivers of the Pacific Northwest.

{"text":"RMS Windsor Castle was the largest passenger\/cargo mailship operated by the Union-Castle Line on its 'Cape Mail' service to South African ports. Built in 1959, the new vessel was notable for the high standard, if conservative, design of her public rooms in a \"traditional\" first class and \"contemporary\" tourist class configuration, which by clever arrangement, afforded both classes public rooms and deckspace facing forward. The spacious passenger lounges and dining rooms were designed by eminent British architects. Windsor Castle was air-conditioned throughout the passenger and crew areas. Facilities included a fully equipped hospital, two outdoor swimming pools, a health spa and a theatre\/cinema. A large amount of dry and refrigerated cargo space, cargo wine tanks and a specie (bullion) room, were also fitted.\n\nConcept and construction\n\nThe steam-turbine engined, Windsor Castle was the second in a series of three similar but not identical ships planned by Union-Castle in the 1950s as replacements for the company's oldest ships Arundel Castle, Carnarvon Castle and Winchester Castle. Windsor Castle was preceded by Pendennis Castle (delivered in 1958) and followed by Transvaal Castle (delivered in 1961).\n\nIn January 1956, Union-Castle had been taken over by Cayzer, Irvine & Co Ltd's 'British & Commonwealth Shipping' later British & Commonwealth Holdings (B&C), owners of the Clan Line and a number of other lines which, like Union-Castle, also retained their individual company names. By the time the B&C takeover of Union-Castle was finalised, the keel of Pendennis Castle had already been laid at Union-Castle's usually contracted builders Harland and Wolff - in November 1955. New owners B&C required substantial improvements to the plans for that ship, including lengthening the hull some 16 feet to enable fin stabilisers to be fitted. Industrial disputes at Harland and Wolff delayed the construction of Pendennis Castle, culminating in the vessel being launched without ceremony on Christmas Eve 1957, 14 days after her naming and blessing. Windsor Castle thus became the first passenger\/cargo\/mail vessel for the South African service, ordered from inception by B&C.\n\nThe last flagship of the Union-Castle Line was built by Cammell Laird Shipbuilders at Birkenhead, Merseyside and launched on 23 June 1959 by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. Windsor Castle - the only Union-Castle ship ordered from Cammell Laird - was also briefly the largest liner built in England, until surpassed by the 41,910 gross tons Orient Line's SS Oriana launched on 3 November 1959.\n\nService history\n\n\"Cape Mail\" service 1960\u20131977\n\nAfter sea-trials and a brief delivery sailing with Union-Castle office staff acting as passengers, Windsor Castle's commercial maiden voyage was from Southampton to Durban on 18 August 1960 arriving 131\u20442 days later. Joining a long established pattern followed by the company's ships engaged in the Cape mail service, the vessel sailed regularly to South Africa, via Madeira (occasionally), to Las Palmas, then Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, East London and finally Durban, returning to Southampton by the same route.\n\nBy the mid-1970s the operation of Windsor Castle and her Union-Castle\/Safmarine mailship consorts had become unprofitable due to a combination of factors namely: the introduction of the 'Jumbo Jet' which moved large numbers quickly and economically; further from the fading attraction for new settlers of the increasingly politically isolated South Africa of the time; also challenging the labour-intensive conventional cargo facilities in the mailships were the hugely successful new container ships which enabled cargoes to be moved faster and more efficiently. Simultaneous with these factors, by tradition, B&C passenger vessels employed mostly British officers and crews (with some South African officers in the two Safmarine ships S.A. Vaal and S.A. Oranje), under terms which could not be sustained in a failing market. Finally, the serious mid-1970s hike in the cost of heavy furnace oil was the death knell for the combined B&C managed passenger fleet and for many other fuel-hungry steamers of the period. Windsor Castle sailed on her last voyage for Union-Castle on 12 August 1977. She finally departed Cape Town at 16:00 hours on 6 September 1977, returning to Southampton on 19 September 1977.\n\nThe Latsis years 1977\u20132004\n\nThe vessel was promptly sold to Yiannis Latsis the Greek finance and shipping magnate, charity patron and benefactor, and renamed Margarita L, in honour of his daughter. The ship left Southampton for the last time on 3 October 1977, with her former Union-Castle 'vermillion' funnel paint replaced by that of Latsis 'buff' yellow and under the flag of convenience of Panama. After a refit in PiraeusMargarita L was despatched to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for use as an office, leisure centre and static accommodation facility for one of Latsis's companies, Petrola International SA. A special jetty was built for Margarita L, equipped with car parks, swimming pools and other sports facilities for the contracted workers. The vessel remained at her berth until 1983 when she proceeded to Bahrain for dry-docking and overhaul, returning directly to Jeddah. In June 1991, Margarita L was sent back to Piraeus under her own steam, to be laid up. The vessel subsequently became private accommodation for Mr Latsis and his family off Eleusis, Greece. Margarita L was reportedly first offered for sale in 1998, although it was not until after the death (at 92) of the patriarchal Yiannis Latsis in 2003, that the owners finally confirmed the now 43 year-old ship to be available.\n\nReactivation for disposal 2005\n\nIn the absence of any other substantive offers, Latsis Lines sold Margarita L in December 2004 to an undisclosed party, with the view to disposing of the vessel to Indian scrap merchants. After some months were spent reactivating long idle main engines, the vessel sailed to India for the breakers on 14 April 2005 \u2013 under the shortened name Rita \u2013 despite a number of determined attempts to save her. The ship's last voyage under steam was from Piraeus, Greece to Alang, India, via Port Said, the Suez Canal and Aden. Having arrived off Alang, Rita was turned back to United Arab Emirates waters, while the interim owners apparently awaited an improvement in the value of scrap steel. Later, both the ship and her attendant tug suffered engine failures, however, the tug was repaired and successfully completed the tow back to Alang.\n\nWhile the larger part of the ship's career was spent either in static duties or lay-up, she had a notably long existence; outlasting her 1960\u201361 built British liner contemporaries Canberra (by almost 8 years), Empress of Canada (by almost 2 years) and Oriana (by a few months).\n\nBetween 2001 and 2004, all three other remaining former Union-Castle ships had gone to the breakers: SS Amerikanis (built 1952 as Kenya Castle), was scrapped in 2001, Big Red Boat III (built 1961 as Transvaal Castle), in 2003\u201304 and the veteran Princesa Victoria (built 1936 as Dunnottar Castle) also went in 2004. \"The Windsor\" \u2013 as she was once affectionately known by many passengers and crew \u2013 was the last Castle \u2013ship to go. All four were dismantled on the shores of Alang.\n\nAs Windsor Castle, she made a total of 124 round voyages, carried around 270,000 passengers and steamed over 1.6 million nautical miles. She never missed a scheduled sailing.[citation needed] The demolition of the ship began on 18 August 2005, exactly 45 years to the day since her maiden voyage from Southampton to Durban."}

{"text":"Historical Note\n\nCongress established the Washington-Alaska Military Cable and\nTelegraph System (WAMCATS) in May 1900, as a branch of the United States Army\nSignal Corps. The system became operational in June of 1903. WAMCATS was\nheadquartered in Seattle and charged with linking Army garrisons scattered\nacross the Alaska territory. In order to maintain communications with the\nnorth, the Army Quartermaster Corps commissioned several army transport vessels\ninto service as deep-sea cable-laying ships. One of the first of these\ncableships, the Burnside, laid 291 nautical miles\n(nm) of submarine cable between Sitka, Alaska, and Juneau, Alaska, and 640 nm\nof cable between Sitka, Alaska, and Valdez, Alaska, in 1903. In 1904, the\nBurnside laid 1070 nm of cable between Sitka,\nAlaska, and Seattle to supplement an earlier cable laid in 1900.\n\nThe Burnside, a prize of the\nSpanish-American War, had the capacity to store only 300 nautical miles of\ncable in her tanks. Thus, in 1923, a larger steamship, the\nDellwood, was converted at the Todd shipyard in\nSeattle into a cableship for the Army. Originally built as a transport at\nOakland, California, in 1920, the ship was fitted with cable machinery from the\nJohnson & Phillips company in London, giving it three times the capacity of\nthe Burnside. In January 1924, United States\ncableship (USAT) Dellwood, weighing 3,923 tons,\nmeasuring 320.7 feet in length with a 46 foot beam and 24.5 foot draft, and\npowered by an 1,800 horsepower triple-expansion engine, sailed from the Puget\nSound bound for England. There, the Dellwood\nloaded 1,000 miles of cable which would be used for a new communications cable\nstretching from Seattle to Seward, Alaska. In that same year, the\nDellwood completed laying 1894 nm of cable linking\nSeattle to Ketchikan, Alaska to Seward, Alaska.\n\nIn addition to her greater capacity, the Dellwood was considered a \"high-grade\nlaboratory.\" Sonar was being developed during this period and the\nDellwood was the first cableship to be equipped\nwith a sonic depth sounder which allowed the crew to determine oceanic depths\nwhile running at full speed rather than having to drop a lead line. With this\nnew technology, the Dellwood was able to avoid\nunderwater mountains and chasms, thus greatly reducing the mileage of cable\nrequired to connect two points. Later, the ship was equipped with a newer depth\nsounder, the \"Fathometer,\" a novel device which displayed depth\non a clock-like dial while the ship ran at full speed.\n\nBesides duties installing and maintaining Alaskan cables, the\nDellwood also laid cable in the Philippines.\nAround 1930, the ship left Seattle and traveled, via the Panama Canal, to\nEngland to take on cable sufficient for installation in the Philippines which\nwas then under United States adminstration. On the way, the\nDellwood made stops in Algiers, the Suez Canal,\nIndia, Singapore, and finally Manila. Having completed the Philippine cable,\nthe Dellwood sailed home to Seattle, thus\ncircumnavigating the world.\n\nBy 1930, WAMCATS was handling commercial traffic in addition to\ngovernment communications. When the main Alaska cable broke in May of 1930, the\nDellwood was dispatched to repair it. However,\nradio transmitters had begun replacing cables and land lines. As a result, the\nDellwood was sold in 1932 to P. E. Harris &\nCo. of Seattle, a salmon packing firm, for $20,000. She was refurbished, at a\ncost of $100,000, at the Todd Dry Docks and put into service in the Alaska\ncannery trade under the command of Captain Andrew J. Borkland. In 1934, the\nship was sold to the Alaska Steamship Company.\n\nFor the remainder of the 1930s, the Signal Corps did not own any\ncableships and the submarine cable portion of the WAMCATS (renamed the Alaska\nCommunications System in May 1936) slowly deteriorated. Following the attack on\nPearl Harbor, the Corps repurchased the Dellwood\nand fitted her out for cable repair work, dispatching her in May 1943 to lay\ncable between Spruce Island and Miller Point. Unfortunately, the\nDellwood struck a pinnacle rock near Alexai Point\nwhile laying cable between Dutch Harbor and outlying Aleutian stations on July\n19, 1943. She sank, without loss of life, in Massacre Bay, Attu Island, Alaska.\n\nScope and Content\n\nPhotographs of the United States cableship Dellwood engaged in cable repair and cable laying\nactivities during one of its early cable laying runs from its home port in\nSeattle, Washington to Trocadero Bay, Alaska in May 1924.

{"text":"TITANIC SURVIVORS\n\nAt 11.40pm on 14 April, 1912, the famously 'unsinkable' ocean liner, Titanic, struck an iceberg. Two hours and 40 minutes later she sank deep into the freezing Atlantic waters. Less than a third of the people on board survived.\n\nOver the years, the BBC has heard from some of the men and women who lived through that 'night to remember'. Their memories, and internal BBC documents about the controversies that followed, are now gathered together to tell the true story of the disaster.\n\nCommander Lightoller was the second mate on board the RMS Titanic, and the most senior officer to survive the disaster.\n\nLightoller was decorated for gallantry as a naval officer in the First World War and later, in retirement, further distinguished himself in the Second World War by providing and sailing one of the \"little ships\" during the perilous Dunkirk evacuation.\n\nIn this film 'The Titanic Disaster' Lightoller gives his version of events on the fateful night in April 1912. He lays great weight on the fact that a warning message about the amount of ice in the area was never delivered to the bridge, seeming to imply that if this news had been received, the accident could have been avoided.\n\nThe memories of Eva Hart\n\nThe sinking of theTitanic\n\nThis terrible tragedy occurred on April 15, 1912, and resulted in the deaths of 1,517 people. This shipwreck also turned out to be one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history. Why? Well, it was party due to the shiping regulations of the time as the ship carried lifeboats for only 1,178 people. Even so, a disproportionate number of men died due to the \"women and children first\" protocol that was enforced by the ship's crew. This procedure meant that many of the life boats ended up only being half filled. This was a tragedy in itself as since the sea was calm, it would have been safe to fill all boats to capacity and thereby rescue an additional 500 persons! Furthermore, only a few passangers were picked up from the water after the sinking out of fear of the boats being overfilled or capsizing.\n\nHowever, incredible photographic evidence from Father Frank Browne has helped to bring this disaster to life and so the world is able to learn the story of the Titanic from his personal perspective.\n\nA student of theology who later was to be ordained a Roman Catholic priest, Father Browne had been sent a ticket for the first leg of the maiden voyage of the Titanic, which went from Southampton to Cherbourg, France, to Queenstown, Ireland.\n\nDuring this leg of the voyage, an American millionaire offered to pay for Father Browne's passage for the rest of the trip to New York! Luckily for him, upon being apprised of this offer, Browne's Jesuit superior cabled Queenstown saying - succinctly, \"Get off that ship -- Provincial.\"\n\nBrowne's great collection of photographic negatives of the Titanic - and other subjects - lay forgotten for 25 years after his death. In 1986, the Rev. E.E. O'Donnell, another Jesuit, accidentally discovered it in a large metal trunk. He brought the negatives to the attention of the features editor of the London Sunday Times who called them:\n\n\"the photographic equivalent to the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls.\"\n\nLuckily for Father Frank Browne, he didn't get to experience the horrors of what happened next!\n\nThe sinking of the Titanic - minute by minute.\n\nAt 11.40 pm (ship's time), lookout Frederick Fleet spotted an iceberg immediately ahead of Titanic and alerted the bridge. First Officer William Murdoch ordered the ship to be steered around the obstacle and the engines to be put in reverse, but it was too late. The starboard side of Titanic struck the iceberg, creating a series of holes below the waterline. Unbelieveably, five of the ship's watertight compartments were breached, and it soon became clear that the ship was doomed. Why? Because she could not survive more than four compartments being flooded. The Titanic began to sink - bow-first, with water spilling from compartment to compartment as her angle in the water became steeper.\n\nThose aboard Titanic were poorly-prepared for such a terrible emergency. There was only enough space in the lifeboats for a third of her maximum number of passengers and crew, and worse still, the crew had not been trained adequately in carrying out an evacuation. Furthermore, the officers did not know how many they could safely put aboard the lifeboats and launched many of them barely half-full. As the nightmare progressed, third-class passengers were largely left to fend for themselves, causing many of them to become trapped below decks as the ship filled with water. A \"women and children first\" protocol was put in place and generally followed for the loading of the lifeboats and most of the male passengers and crew were left aboard.\n\nTwo hours and forty minutes after Titanic struck the iceberg, her rate of sinking suddenly increased as her forward deck dipped underwater and the sea poured in through open hatches and grates. As her unsupported stern rose out of the water the propellers became exposed. After this, the ship split apart between the third and fourth funnels due to the immense strain on the keel.\n\nThe severed bow section headed for the sea bed, while the stern remained afloat for a few minutes longer, rising to a nearly vertical angle with hundreds of people still clinging to it\n\nAt 2.20 am, the stern sank, pitching the remaining passengers and crew into lethally cold water with a temperature of only 28 \u00b0F (\u22122 \u00b0C). Almost all of those in the water died of hypothermia or cardiac arrest within minutes. Increadibly, only 13 of them were helped into the lifeboats though these had room for almost 500 more occupants.\n\nDistress signals were sent by wireless, rockets and lamp, but none of the ships that responded were near enough to reach her before she sank.\n\nA nearby ship, the Californian, which was the last to have been in contact with her before the collision, saw her flares but failed to assist.\n\nAround 4 am, RMS Carpathia arrived on the scene in response to Titanic's earlier distress calls. 710 people survived the disaster and were conveyed by Carpathia to New York, Titanic's original destination.\n\nAnother 1,517 people were lost, either drowning inside the sinking ship or freezing to death on the surface (kept from drowning by their lifebelts).\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nCarpathia took three days to reach New York after leaving the scene of the disaster. It should have been much sooner but the journey was slowed by pack ice, fog, thunderstorms and rough seas. However, the Carpathia was able to pass news to the outside world by wireless about what had happened. Unfortunately the initial reports were confused, leading the American press to mistakenly report on the 15th April that Titanic was being towed to port by the SS Virginian.\n\nLater that day, confirmation arrived that Titanic had been lost and that most of her passengers and crew had died. This terrible news attracted crowds of people to the White Star Line's offices in London, New York, Southampton, Liverpool and Belfast.\n\nIt hit hardest in Southampton, whose people suffered the greatest losses from the sinking. According to the Hampshire Chronicle on 20 April 1912, almost 1,000 local families were directly affected. Furthermore, almost every street in the Chapel district of the town lost more than one resident and over 500 households lost a member.\n\nThe British Army's newspaper, The War Cry, reported that:\n\n'...none but a heart of stone would be unmoved in the presence of such anguish. Night and day that crowd of pale, anxious faces had been waiting patiently for the news that did not come. Nearly every one in the crowd had lost a relative...'\n\nIt was not until 17 April that the first incomplete lists of survivors came through, delayed by poor communications.\n\nThe Carpathia docked at 9.30 pm on 18 April at New York's Pier 54, and was greeted by some 40,000 people waiting at the quayside in heavy rain. Many of Titanic's surviving passengers did not hang around in New York but immediately headed onwards to relatives' homes.\n\nSome of the wealthier survivors chartered private trains to take them home, and the Pennsylvania Railroad laid on a special train free of charge to take survivors to Philadelphia.\n\nTitanic's 214 surviving crew members were taken to the Red Star Line's steamer SS Lapland, where they were accommodated in passenger cabins. Carpathia was then hurriedly restocked with food and provisions before resuming her journey to Fiume, Austria-Hungary. Her crew were given a bonus of a month's wages by Cunard as a reward for their actions, and some of Titanic's passengers joined together to give them an additional bonus of nearly \u00a3900 (\u00a366,038 today), which was divided between the crew members.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic was one of the most dramatic events of the twentieth century. In a mere four hours after striking an iceberg, the largest passenger ship so far built sank while on its maiden voyage, and claimed the lives of over 1,500 persons. Many of those lost were from the upper crust of British and American society.\n\nThe sinking of the Titanic, which had been popularly regarded as unsinkable, put doubt in the belief that modern man had dominance and control over nature, a mistaken belief that had grown out of the Industrial Revolution and the Progressive Era."}

{"text":"Percy Walker Nelles\n\nNelles, Percy Walker\nPercy Walker Nelles, naval officer (b at Brantford, Ont, 7 Jan 1892; d at Victoria, 13 June 1951). Percy Nelles, the son of Charles Nelles, an officer in the Royal Canadian Dragoons, was the founding recruit of the Canadian Navy and became chief of the naval staff.\n\nAt age 16, Percy Nelles wanted a military career but did not intend to follow his father into the army and chose the navy instead. Charles Nelles applied to the minister of Marine and Fisheries for a cadet placement for his son in the proposed Canadian naval service. Sir Charles Kingsmill had just arrived to militarize the Fisheries Protection Service, and announced that the FPS would accept cadets. However, he informed the minister that it would accept only two cadets. Kingsmill had already accepted a youth named F.A. Campbell, so Nelles was actually the second cadet entered for service in the soon-to-be Canadian Navy. But Campbell withdrew, making Nelles the entire class of 1908.\n\nThe ROYAL CANADIAN NAVY was formally established on 4 May 1910. On 26 June, Percy Nelles and the cadets of the classes of 1909-10 were appointed to HMCS Niobe as midshipmen, although they had to wait until October for the ship to arrive in Halifax. When both the cruiser and the navy itself (metaphorically) ran aground in 1911, Nelles and his classmates were sent overseas to complete their training. Percy Nelles continued training, and served aboard several ships, until serving as a staff officer at Naval Service Headquarters (NSHQ) from 1917-23. He attained the rank of lieutenant-commander in 1922. After leaving Ottawa in 1923, Nelles spent a decade alternating between British and Canadian posts, and sea and shore assignments.\n\nFollowing the Royal Navy's staff officer technical course in late 1929, Percy Nelles landed the best sea-going job of his career when he was appointed executive officer of the Bermuda-based cruiser HMS Dragon on 18 Mar 1930. That summer, Dragon set off on a South American tour and was making her way along the Pacific coast when her captain, L.H.B. Bevan, died suddenly. As the executive officer, Nelles immediately assumed temporary command. However, the Admiralty did not consider abandoning the cruise. Nelles was appointed acting captain and continued Dragon's three-month program.\n\nIn 1931 Nelles took command of the new destroyer HMCS Saguenay, the first warship built specifically for Canada. He also assumed the position of senior officer, Canadian Destroyer Flotilla, and spent a year at sea before being assigned commander-in-charge of HMCS Stadacona, at the navy's East Coast base, in June 1932.\n\nAs chief of the naval staff 1934-44, Percy Nelles was instrumental in the navy's survival of the Depression and the architect of its phenomenal wartime growth. An able, if colourless, administrator, Nelles was sent to London in January 1944 as liaison officer following a bitter break with naval minister A.L. MACDONALD over the handling of naval expansion. He retired in January 1945.\n\nAuthor\nMARC MILNER\n\nLinks to Other Sites Canadian Naval Centennial\nA great source for information about celebrating the Canadian Naval Centennial.

{"text":"Earlier this year, it was reported that Cardiff Marine, another Liberian-registered shipping company, was found guilty of illegally dumping waste at sea. The vessel was found to have a 'bypass hose', commonly referred to as a magic pipe, that allowed the ship to siphon off oily waste into the sea rather than store it onboard and pay for disposal at a port reception facility.\n\nIn the case of Epps Shipping who were sentenced last week, the US Coast Guard found the vessel's Oil Water Separator and other pollution prevention equipment were inoperable. The crew simply used the emergency bilge discharge system to dump oily waste directly overboard, without processing it through the ship's pollution prevention equipment, as required by law. No discharges were recorded in the Oil Record Book \u2013 a mandatory requirement after any discharge at sea.\n\nBoth cases this year highlight the disturbing measures that some rogue ship operators take rather than invest in proper maintenance of equipment or to avoid payment for discharging waste at a Port Reception Facility.\n\nThe extent of international ship waste dumping is unknown, yet it is considered relatively risk free as efforts to enforce international legislation are weak and in many countries, inspections of vessels are inadequate, both in substance and in number. It has also been estimated that out of 8 million items of waste dumped at sea each day, 5 million are thought to emanate from the shipping sector.\n\nIn Europe, deterrents to ship waste dumping are weak and very few prosecutions have been made in this context; calling into question the ability of European inspections to unearth malpractise."}

He added that he himself saw the musicians lay down their instruments.\"\n\nHowever, the author Tim Maltin himself is wary of relying on their comments, saying: \"There is evidence that Hartley once said if he was on a sinking ship he would play Nearer, My God to Thee.\n\n\"It could have been that they put their instruments down to get their life jackets because they knew they were doomed, then returned to playing hymns \u2013 it's a strong possibility.\"\n\nHowever, the band's music left a deep impression on many survivors.\n\nThe Countess of Rothes told how, when dining out about a year after the sinking, she experienced the feeling of cold and intense horror she associated with the Titanic.

{"text":"Causes\n\nEquipment failure\n\nFailure or leaking of the hull is a serious problem that can lead to the loss of buoyancy and the sinking of the vessel. Even the hulls of large modern ships have cracked in heavy storms. Leaks between the hull planks of wooden vessels was a particular problem.\n\nFailure of the means of propulsion, such as engines, sails or rigging, can lead to the loss of a ship. A common problem is that the ship is unable to avoid natural hazards like rocks, shallow water or storms.\n\nInstability\n\nInstability is caused by the centre of mass or other forces acting on the ship rising above the centre of buoyancy resulting in the ship tipping on its side or capsizing.\n\nThis can lead to a sinking if the openings on the upper side of the side are not watertight at the time of the capsize. To remain buoyant, the hull of a vessel must prevent water entering the large air spaces of the vessel. Clearly for the ship to float, the submerged parts of the null will be watertight, but the upper parts of the hull must have openings to allow the crew to work and to load and unload cargo.\n\nNavigation errors\n\nMany shipwrecks have occurred when the crew of the ship have allowed the ship to collide with rocks, other ships or even icebergs. Often navigation was made more difficult by poor weather. Also, many losses happened before modern navigation aids such as GPS, radar and sonar were available. Until the twentieth century, the most sophisticated navigational techniques available were dead reckoning and the magnetic compass. These techniques lead to great scope for error and inaccuracy.\n\nBad weather\n\nPoor weather can cause several problems:\n\nwind\n\nlow visibility\n\ncold\n\nWind causes waves which result in other difficulties. Waves make navigation difficult and dangerous near shallow water. Also, waves create buoyancy stresses on the structure of a hull. The weight of breaking waves on the fabric of the ship force the crew to reduce speed or even travel in the same direction as the waves to prevent damage. Also, wind stresses the rigging of sailing ships.\n\nThe force of the wind pushes ships in the direction of the wind. Vessels with large windage suffer most. Although powered ships are able to resist the force of the wind, sailing vessels have few defences against strong wind. When strong winds are imminent, sailing vessels typically have several choices:\n\nConstruction materials\n\nExposed wooden components decay quickly. Often the only wooden parts of wooden ships that remain after a century are those that were buried in silt or sand soon after the sinking. An example of this is the Mary Rose.\n\nSteel and iron, depending on its thickness, may retain the ship's structure for decades. As corrosion takes place, sometimes helped by tides and weather, the structure collapses. Thick ferrous objects like cannons, steamboilers or the pressure vessel of a submarine often survive well underwater in spite of corrosion.\n\nPropellers, condensers, hinges and port holes were often made from non-ferrous metals such as brass and phospor-bronze , which do not corrode easily in water.\n\nLoss, salvage and demolition\n\nAn important factor in the condition of the wreck is the level of destruction at the time of the loss or shortly afterwards due to the nature of the loss, salvage or later demolition.\n\nExamples of severe destruction at the time of loss are:\n\nbeing blown onto a beach, reef or rocks during a storm\n\ncollision with another ship\n\ndestruction in warfare\n\nAfter the loss the owners of the ship may attempt to recover valuable parts of the ship or it cargo. This can cause damage.\n\nShip wrecks in shallow water near busy shipping lanes are often demolished to reduce the danger to other vessels.\n\nDepth, tide and weather\n\nWrecks are slowly broken up by exposure to breaking waves, the weather and the tides"}

When rescue ships arrived later that morning, they were stunned to find themselves surrounded by ice. According to the captain of the Carpathia, the ship that was first on the scene, more than 20 large bergs (some estimated at over 100 feet tall) were observed.\n\nIn the century since the sinking, photos have surfaced of some of the suspected icebergs that Titanic may have collided with. What makes this photo different is that it was captured two days before the sinking - and actually matches up with another iceberg found in the disaster area.\n\nThe rare original 9.75 x 8 photo of the \"blueberg,\" photographed by Captain W. F. Wood of the S. S. Etonian on April 12, 1912, is being placed on the auction block by RR Auctions. The company expects the shot to go for between $8,000 and $10,000.\n\nAccording to the listing, there's reason to believe this iceberg might be the culprit, based on drawings by surviving members of Titanic's crew - as well as another photo taken from another angle from the German ship Prinz Adalbert on the morning of the sinking. Seaman Joseph Scarrott, who spied the berg once the ship had passed it, said it resembled in shape \"the Rock of Gibraltar\" with its highest point to the right.\n\n\"The fact that the particular iceberg in the Etonian image offered here is known to have been photographed at a position arguably two to three days' iceberg travel time to Titanic's foundering position, and that it substantially matches both the sketches drawn by Titanic's crewmen and the photo taken after the ship went down, allows noted Titanic experts to establish this photograph as capturing the iceberg everyone has been talking about for the past century,\" the listing says.\n\nThe auction will end on Dec. 16.\n\nHere is the link to the auction item listing: \n\nRelated Stories\n\nA century on from the sinking of the Titanic, Physics World science writer Richard Corfield takes a look at the cascade of events that led to the demise of the 'unsinkable' ship, taking into account the ma ...\n\nOn the centenary anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic, a King's expert says people's knowledge of the notorious liner is based on cultural anecdotes rather than historical and scientific fact.\n...\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- The sinking of the ocean liner Titanic 100 years ago is perhaps the most famous--and most studied--disaster of the 20th century.

A series of ships were torpedoed before U-100 was detected on ASDIC and subject to depth charge attack by HMS Walker and HMS Vanoc. Then in the early hours of the morning HMS Vanoc spotted U-100 on the surface and rammed her. Her commander Joachim Schepke was crushed against the periscope mast.\n\nU-99 was commanded by Otto Kretschmer with a long list of sinkings to his name, among them the attack on convoy SC7 and the torpedoing of HMS Forfar. U-99 had used up all her torpedoes and was about to leave for her home port, creeping away on the surface. She spotted a destroyer, crash dived and then came within HMS Walker's ASDIC. Naval Intelligence was able to compile the following sequence of events from interviews with the survivors:\n\nAs \"U 99\u2033 was leaving the scene the Chief Quartermaster sighted a destroyer and gave the alarm. \"U 99\u2033 crash dived. At about 0330 H.M.S. \"Walker,\" in approximate position 61\u00b0 16\u2032 N., 12\u00b0 56\u2032 W., was circling H.M.S. \"Vanoc\" to give her A\/S protection while the latter picked up survivors from \"U 100,\" which she had rammed at about 0318.\n\nAt 0337 \"Walker\" obtained contact quite close to where \"Vanoc\" was stopped' this was thought to be non-sub at first, but as the asdic operator insisted that contact was firm and the echo rapidly improved, the Captain decided to attack.\n\nThe crew of \"U 99\u2033 heard the destroyer passing overhead, and then came the explosions of six depth charges, thought by the Germans to have exploded beneath the U-Boat which was then at depth of 120 metres (393.7 ft.).\n\n\"U 99\u2033 then went to about 140 metres (459 ft.), or deeper, and water entered the boat; according to the Captain she sank to about 185 metres (607 ft.) or more; but she suddenly started to rise quickly and surfaced; the conning tower hatch was thrown open and the Captain climbed out.\n\nIt was then about 0350. The German Captain's intention was to try and get away on the surface but the Quartermaster reported that the steering gear was out of action; the electric motors were also out of action. The First Lieutenant connected the hand steering gear. But everything, including the fuel tanks, had been smashed. The crew had put on their lifebelts and hurried out of the U-Boat.\n\nAt 0352 \"Walker\" sighted \"U 99\u2033 on the surface. \"Vanoc\" and \"Walker\" opened fire on \"U 99\u2033 at 0354, but ceased firing two minutes later. At this juncture yet another U-Boat was reported astern by reliable witnesses in \"Walker.\" The Captain of \"U 99\u2033 called out to his men that their U-Boat was sinking. The First Lieutenant and the Engineering Officer, estimating that their ship would remain afloat for another ten or fifteen minutes, started to open valves to make certain of sinking \"U 99.\"\n\nAs the First Lieutenant went forward, he suddenly heard splashing in the Control Room, and saw a stream of water coming in through the conning tower hatch. He therefore climbed out at once, and found the whole crew gathered together on the bridge.\n\nAs the U-Boat did not seem to be sinking fast enough, and it was feared that the British might try to board her, the Engineer Officer again went below to open wide the galley hatch which had previously been only partly opened. He never got out again, and the crew heard him shouting as the U-Boat sank.\n\nThe Captain said that a W\/T message was sent in clear, just before \"U 99\u2033 sank; but he did not know whether it was transmitted on full strength or not, or whether it had been received at his base. The signal read: \"Depth charges \u2013 captured \u2013 Heil Hitler \u2013 Kretschmer.\"\n\nKretschmer expressed the opinion that \"Walker\" had not located their U-boat by any detector gear, but had sighted \"U 99\u2033 on the surface and had dropped depth charges which were effective more by luck than anything else. Five officers and 35 men were picked up by H.M.S. \"Walker.\" One officer and two ratings were drowned.\n\nThe loss of U-47, U-99 and U-100, during March was a substantial blow against the U-Boat arm. Their three highly experienced and successful U-Boat commanders, Prien, Kretschmer and Schepke could not be replaced. But the Battle of the Atlantic had a long time still to run.\n\nThe crew of U-99 celebrate return from a successful patrol in the summer of 1940"}
{"text":"Battleships in the Gareloch\n\nby\nBrian Salmon\n\u2014\nlast modified\nAug 28, 2010 07:05 PM\n\nAfter World War II, battleships were laid up in the Gareloch in a state of preservation, a process known as 'cocooning'.\n\nHMS Anson\n\nThe inlet waterway known as the Gareloch located in the Rosneath Peninsula in Scotland was home for three British battleships of the KGV class. They were the HMS Anson, HMS KGV, and the HMS Duke of York. The decision to place these battleships there came about in July of 1949. The battleship era had come to an end and the Admiralty decided that the cost of keeping these beamoths operating and manned was to great so they were laid up in the Gareloch in a state of preservation.\n\nHMS King George V\n\nThe first to arrive there was the HMS Anson in November of 1949 followed by the HMS KGV in June of 1950. The HMS Duke of York arrived there in November of 1951, being towed from Birkenhead. All three lay moored bow and stern in the Gareloch until 1957. HMS Howe spent these years being separated from her sisters, being mothballed at Devonport. In the event of a national emergency and with the Cold War in full swing they could have been reactivated in short order. The need never arose.\n\nCocooning\n\nHMS Duke of York\n\nMothballing, officially described as concooning, was a new method of preserving warships, and was first applied to the HMS King George V. The process involved sealing a ship's armarment inside cocoons constructed of a timber and webbing material, covered with fish netting, sprayed with a lacquer and coated with a latex of plastic, a dessicant being placed inside to absorb moisture. To preserve the underwater section of the hull, dehumidification units were fitted in all the internal compartments. The main and auxiliary machinery and the boilers, together with the electrical and radio equipment, were packed and sealed.\n\nFor six years these battleships lay empty and motionless. Finally in April of 1957 the axe was lowered, when all four ships were approved for scrap. HMS Anson was the first to be towed from her mooring in the Gareloch on December 17th 1957 to arrive at the shipbreakers. The HMS King George V was towed from the Gareloch on January 20th 1958 and sold to Arnott Young and Co, Dalmuir for breaking up. Duke of York was moved out of the Gareloch on February 18th 1958 and sold for scrap to Shipbreaking Industries Ltd. of Faslane, only a short distance from were she was moored for the last 6 years."}

The growth in the design was in part answer to the question that always dogged U.S. Navy designs, that being the ranges required by the Pacific Ocean. They were also to carry no less than five 5\" guns, and ten centerline torpedoes allowing them to meet any foreign design on equal terms. In the design they also were much less top heavy than the previous classes allowing them to take on additional equipment and weapons without major redesign. They had the fortune of catching American production at the right moment becoming \"the\" destroyer design and only Fletcher-class derivatives the Sumner and Gearing classes would follow it. The first design inputs were in the fall of 1939 from questionnaires distributed around design bureaus and the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. The design parameters were in the form of the armaments desired of the next destroyer. As such the questions of how many guns, torpedoes, and depth charges were seen as desirable and further asked at what point would the design grow large enough to become a torpedo target instead of a torpedo delivery system. The answer that came back was that five 5\" dual purpose guns, twelve torpedoes, and twenty eight depth charges would be ideal, while the idea of returning to the 1500 ton designs of the past was seen as undesirable.

{"text":"Category Archives: October\n\nOctober 29, 2012\n\nBy Mary Jo Gibson\n\nThe Raft of the Medusa\n\nI am always on the lookout for new paintings that tell an incredible story, and the Raft of Medusa by Theodore Gericault (1791-1824) proved to be a treasure trove of history, tortured lives, and brutal, life changing events. A simple picture on Pinterest brought this immense canvas into my line of sight, reading about the painting in Lynn Nicholas' The Rape of Europa' did not even begin to hint at the complexity of the story of the Medusa.\n\nGericault drew his inspiration from a current event of the times, the wreck of the Meduse \u2013 a French Royal Navy frigate that set sail in 1816 to colonize Senegal. The ship ran aground off the coast of what is now Mauritania, on a sand bar that reaches far into the ocean along the coast of the Sahara; a place known for raids by Moorish pirates, who sold their hostages into slavery in Turkey.\n\nThe crew and passengers of the Meduse numbered 400, 160 of which were crew, but there was only space for 250 in the lifeboats. The remaining 145 men and one woman were piled onto a hastily constructed raft that partially submerged once it was loaded. The captain and the crew of the lifeboats intended to tow the raft, but after only a few hours, it was released to drift in the ocean. For sustenance, these doomed souls had only a bag of biscuits (consumed on the first day), two casks of water (lost overboard during fighting the second day), and a few casks of wine.\n\nThis raft carried the survivors to the frontiers of the human experience. Crazed, parched and starved, they slaughtered mutineers, ate their dead companions and killed the weakest.\n\nAfter 13 days, the raft was rescued by the Argus. Only 15 men remained alive. The event became an international scandal due to the newly restored French monarchy being held culpable. Here is the Wiki link to more about the aftermath, trials and government corruption.\n\nTheodore Gericault, 1791-1824\n\nEnter stage left, Theodore Gericault, an inspired painter, whose obsession with the story of the Meduse changed the course of his existence. With his personal life in turmoil after breaking-off an affair with his aunt; Gericault shaved his head and lived a disciplined monastic existence at his studio in the Faubourgh du Roule, from November 1818 to July 1819; the orderly studio artist worked by a methodical fashion in complete silence, finding that even the sound of a mouse was sufficient to break his concentration.\n\nGericault undertook extensive research and produced many preparatory sketches. He interviewed two survivors, Henri Savigny and Alexandre Correard; another of the survivors, Lavillette, helped him construct an accurately detailed scale model of the raft which was reproduced on the finished canvas.\n\nEarlier travels had exposed Gericault to the victims of insanity and plague; but his efforts to be historically accurate and realistic with the Meduse led to an obsession with the stiffness of corpses. He went to morgues and hospitals where he could view first-hand the color and the texture of flesh in the dying and the dead.\n\nThe painting's conception proved slow and difficult for Gericault, and he struggled to select a single pictorially effective moment to best capture the inherent drama of the event. He considered the scenes of mutiny against the officers from the second day on the raft, the cannibalism that occurred after only a few days, and the rescue. An early study for the Raft, in watercolor, now in the Louvre, is much more explicit, depicting a figure gnawing on the arm of a headless corpse\n\nThe pallid bodies are given cruel emphasis in a Caravaggio style, one group writhes in the elation of hope, while others are unaware of the passing ship; the latter include two figures of despair and solitude; one mourning his son, the other bewailing his own fate. Eugene Delacroix, friend and artistic peer, modeled for two figures.\n\nEugene Delacroix\n\nThe paintings first appearance was at the Paris Salon of 1819, sponsored by the new monarchy of Louis XVIII. Passionate praise and condemnation in equal measure poured forth, and the reputation Gericault sought was established. At the end of the exhibition he received a gold medal but the judges refrained from giving the work the greater prestige of being selected for the Louvre's national collection. Instead the artist was awarded a commission on the subject of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, which he clandestinely offered to Delacroix, and then signed the finished painting as his own. Gericault retreated to the countryside where he collapsed from exhaustion, and his magnum opus, having found no buyer, was rolled up and stored in a friend's studio. The Raft of the Meduse was acquired by the Louvre soon after the artist's death at the age of 32.\n\nThe painting remains one of the greatest witnesses of human indifference to the suffering of others.\n\nRemoving the Raft of the Medusa from the Louvre\n\nThe Raft may have been consigned to dominate a gallery at the Louvre, but another turbulent time approached; where cultural identity was being erased in conquered countries as the Nazi forces overtook Europe; the scale of what was occurring in this photograph caught my attention while perusing the history section of Pinterest. The immense undertaking at the Louvre to save the cultural heritage of France mirrored the urgency of the ship wrecked survivors to save themselves from certain enslavement, no matter the cost.\n\nIn the autumn of 1939, scenery trucks from the Comedie Francaise were brought in to move the biggest paintings. Although several had been rolled, the Raft was too fragile. The trucks left the Louvre at six in the evening, just as the cover of darkness was falling. The careful planning had gone to meticulous lengths to include measuring all the bridges between Paris and Chambord, but the trolley lines of the town of Versailles had been overlooked, and the Raft became hopelessly ensnared in the crackling wires. Magdeleine Hours, sent off in total darkness to wake her colleagues at the Palace of Versailles, vividly described the terrifying task of finding the doorbell, somewhere on the vast entrance.\n\nIn the end, the Raft and some of its companions were left in the Orangerie. Chief curator Rene Huyghe rescued them some weeks later, accompanied by a team of post office employees who carried long insulated poles to raise any threatening wires. The Raft of Medusa eventually reached the Chateau Chambord where it remained until after the end of the Second World War.\n\nI love the inspiration that comes from art, the motivation to seek explanations and stories drives me into the research. The experience of Theodore Gericault's 'The Raft of the Medusa' was a reward I will not soon forget. Until next time,\n\nBy Mary Jo Gibson\n\nOctober 26, 2012\n\nImagine receiving this priceless, courtship box, dated 1300-1350, carved with scenes from romances and literature of the day. Each panel represents the courtly ideals of love and heroism; on the lid knights joust as ladies watch from the balcony; on the left, knights lay siege to the Castle of Love, the subject of an allegorical battle. The remaining scenes on the casket are drawn from the stories about Aristotle and Phyllis, Tristan and Iseult; tales of the heroic and gallant, the deeds of Gwain, Galahad and Lancelot.\n\nThe origins are medieval French, the box made of ivory and bone with iron mounts. The mounts were added when the box was in the Spitzer collection. The box was originally mounted in silver, but the pieces were dismounted while in the Douce collection, 1836, and remounted with iron in the Spitzer collection in 1890. Photographs show the casket once stood on four bronze feet shaped like lions which were added to the casket sometime after 1913, when it belonged to Henri Daguerre. The provenance of this antiquity begins in 1780 when it was recorded in drawings while in the collection of Reverend John Bowle (b. 1725, d. 1788), Wiltshire. One can only begin to imagine the mementos placed in this casket over time, or the love that inspired such a gift.\n\nMeeting on the Turret Stairs\n\nFrederick William Burton 1816-1900\n\nImages of courtly love have influenced artists for centuries, the stories never cease to inspire. The theme of this painting comes from a medieval Danish balled which describes how Helelil fell in love with Hildebrand, Prince of Engelland, one of her twelve personal guards. Her father ordered his seven sons to kill him.\n\nThey stood at the door with spear and shield;\n\n'Up Lord Hildebrand! Out and yield!'\n\nHe kissed me then mine eyes above:\n\n'Say never my name, thou darling love'\n\nOut of the door Lord Hildebrand sprang,\n\nAround his head the sword he swang.\n\nHildebrand kills her father and six brothers before Hellelil intercedes to save the youngest. Hildebrand dies of his wounds and Hellelil herself dies shortly afterwards.\n\nBurton did not choose a violent episode and instead freely interpreted the story, placing their farewell on the turret stairs and leaving the reason for it to the imagination. His invention of a chaste kiss on the woman's outstretched arm and the lack of eye contact adds to the poignancy of the painting.\n\nThe Skull Watch of Mary Queen of Scots\n\nThis Memento-Mori watch presented by Mary Queen of Scots to her attendant Mary Seaton, is from the 16th century. The forehead of the skull is engraved with a figure of death between a palace and a cottage, and a quotation in Latin, 'pale death visits with impartial foot the cottages of the poor and castles of the rich'. (Horace)\n\n.\n\nTudor Death's Head Ring\n\nAn exceptionally rare Tudor Memento Mori ring, circa1550-1600. Such rings were a timely reminder of the importance of spiritual preparation for death. One is listed in Henry VIII's inventory: \"A ring of golde with a deathes hedde.\"\n\nI will close the lid on this Cabinet of Curiosities with this image of the Tower of London, the famous ravens overlooking the wall, as if perusing the incoming prisoners being ferried to the fateful gate on the Thames.\n\nEnjoy the Halloween festivities, and look for my next post about The Raft of Medusa on Museum Monday."}
{"text":"The latest in native Californian Stan Honey's numbingly long list of accomplishments is what earned him the 2010 Rolex Yachtsman of the Year Award: navigating the 105-foot trimaran Groupama 3 to a 48 day, seven hour record-setting non-stop circumnavigation and winning the Troph\u00e9e Jules Verne in the process. Before that, ho hum, he merely won the Volvo Ocean Race (as navigator aboard ABN AMRO in 2005-06); knocked off a slew of Transpacific, 24-hour, and Transatlantic records (including PlayStation's breakthrough 4-day, 17-hour run in 2001); and called the navigation shots in 22 Transpacs (winning 11 of them while setting the course record three times), among many, many other notable offshore deeds and victories.\n\nProfessionally, after earning undergraduate and graduate engineering degrees from Yale (where he sailed competitively with Steve Benjamin, Peter Isler, and Dave Perry) and Stanford, respectively, he spent some time as vice-president of technology for Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and started a couple of companies: Etack, which pioneered in-vehicle map displays before GPS came online, and Sportvision, which introduced TV sports junkies to the now ubiquitous yellow first-down markers in football games and virtual strike zones in baseball telecasts, among other innovations.\n\nJust for good measure, he's married to another pretty excellent sailor, Sally Lindsey Honey, who's won a pair of Rolex prizes herself.\n\nSo who's the best sailor in the Honey family? Sally, by far (laughing). I might have an edge navigating, but she's definitely the better sailor. She points out that I'm never catching up to her (as far as Rolex awards).\n\nYou've circled the planet as the lone American on basically an all-Kiwi boat (in the Volvo) and an all-French boat (Groupama 3). All things being equal, which would you choose if you were picking crew for a round-the-world race? I think it would be based on the kind of boat it was. If it was a multihull, you'd go with the French guys. As far as big offshore multihull sailing, there's nobody better: the seamanship, the preparation, all of it. On a Volvo 70, you'd want the Kiwis. The V70 is just\u2026pain. And endurance to pain. It's just brutal. And there's nobody better at that than the Kiwis. You know, grunt up, mate. And off you go. Sometimes, there'd be this heinous sail change, it's only going to pay off for fifteen minutes, but you do it. You always sail the boat absolutely optimum, and you never go bow down for a change. The French can't sail (the big multis) that way, you'd wreck the boat. They have to know when to back off and hide and when to let 'er rip.\n\nAs a navigator, the dynamics onboard (the different boats) are interesting. Every French sailor is a navigator, because they all come up through shorthanded sailing. They all know how to navigate and are interested in it. So on Groupama, there was a reasonable amount of time when someone was looking over my shoulder and asking questions, and I actually enjoyed that part. On a Kiwi boat, the rules are you don't hang around the nav station.\n\nHow's your French? Not very good is the short answer. I tried. I took courses. But once I was onboard with the crew, I couldn't follow it at all, unless it was a one-to-one situation. They'd all talk at the same time. Though, by the end of the trip, I was able to tell whether they were talking about boats or women"}

{"text":"Faith on the Decks of the Titanic\n\nIn every large tragedy New Yorkers' religious faith has been a key element in the city's perseverance and recovery....\n\n...\n\nAs we come to the 100th Anniversary of the sinking of the RMS Titanic on April 15, 1912, we thought that it would be useful to remind ourselves of the role that religious faith has had during the catastrophe and, in the aftermath, of its impact on New York City's moral culture. We have excerpted British poet and songwriter Steve Turner's The Band That Played On The extraordinary story of the 8 musicians who went down with the Titanic. Turner has made frequent appearances at art gatherings here in the city. In addition to the Titanic book, Turner has written an extraordinarily good book on Johnny Cash.\n\nOn the evening of April 18th in the New York Evening World Carlos F. Hurd wrote the first article with eyewitness accounts of the sinking of Titanic: \"The ship's string band gathered in the saloon, near the end, and played 'Nearer, My God, to Thee.\"\n\n[Band leader Wallace Hartley] apparently believed that music could be more powerful than physical force in bringing order to chaos. John Carr, the Celtic bandsman, had played on ships with Hartley, and in April 1912 told The New York Times: \"I don't suppose he waited to be sent for, but after finding how dangerous the situation was he probably called his men together and began playing. I know that he often said that music was a bigger weapon for stopping disorder than anything on earth. He knew the value of the weapon he had, and I think he proved his point.\"\n\nAll the band members had been raised as churchgoers\u2014Bricoux, Krins, and Clarke as Catholics, Hume as a Congregationalist, Woodward and Hartley as Methodists, Brailey and Taylor as Anglicans. Harley and Taylor had sung in choirs, and Hume played his violin in church."}

{"text":"The ship\nparticipated in several actions during the First World War, including the raid on Scarborough,\nHartlepool and Whitby, as well as operations against Russian\nforces in the Baltic\nSea.After 1916, Roon was used as a\ntraining and barracks ship in Kiel until the\nend of the war. The ship was struck from the naval register\nin 1920 and scrapped thereafter.\n\nService history\n\nRoon was laid down in August 1902 at the Kiel dockyard, and launched in June\n1903, during which the inspector general Alfred von Waldersee was made patron of\nthe ship. The ship was completed in April 1906, at a cost of\n15,345,000 Mark. In 1908,\nRoon was serving as the flagship for Rear Admiral\nJacobsen, in the Second Group of the Scouting Division of the\nHigh Seas Fleet, along with her\nsistership Yorck. After being\nreplaced as the flagship of the Scouting Group on 30 September by\nthe new battlecruiserMoltke, Roon was\ndecommissioned in 1911; however, she was recommissioned three years\nlater at the outbreak of World War I. At\nthe start of hostilities, Roon was serving as the flagship of the III Scouting Group. On 3 November, 1914,\nshe participated in the operation to bombard Yarmouth.\n\nBombardment of Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby\n\nA month later, on 15\u201316 December, she participated in the bombardment of\nScarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby. Along with the armored\ncruiser , Roon was assigned to the van of the High Seas Fleet, which was providing\ndistant cover to Rear Admiral Franz von\nHipper's battlecruisers while they were conducting the\nbombardment. During the operation, Roon and her attached\ndestroyers encountered the British\nscreening forces; at 06:16, Roon came in contact with and\n, but no gunfire was exchanged and the ships turned away. Following\nreports of British destroyers from Roon as well as from ,\nAdmiral von Ingenohl ordered\nthe High Seas Fleet to turn to port and head for Germany. At this\npoint, Roon and her destroyers became the rearguard for\nthe High Seas Fleet.\n\nAt 06:59, Roon, by this time joined by the light cruisers\nand Hamburg, encountered Commander Jones' destroyers. Jones shadowed\nRoon until 07:40, at which point Stuttgart and\nHamburg were detached to sink their pursuers. At 08:02,\nRoon signaled the two light cruisers and ordered them to\nabandon the pursuit and retreat along with the rest of the High\nSeas Fleet. At 07:55, Beatty received word of\nRoon s location, and in an attempt to intercept the German\ncruisers, detached to hunt the German ships down, while his other\nthree battlecruisers followed from a distance. By 09:00, Beatty had\nbecome aware that the German battlecruisers were shelling\nHartlepool, so he decided to break off the pursuit of Roon\nand turn towards the German battlecruisers. Roon, along\nwith Hamburg, Stuttgart, and the accompanying\ndestroyers, remained in their rearguard position for the High Seas\nFleet during the withdrawal to the safety of German ports.\n\nOperations in the Baltic\n\nAdmiral Reinhard Scheer decided that\nbecause Roon and the other armored cruisers of the III\nScouting Group were slow and lacked thick enough armor, they were\nunsuitable for service in the North Sea. Therefore, after April\n1915, she operated in the Baltic Sea, participating in several bombardment\nmissions. On 11 May, the British submarine spotted\nRoon and several other ships en route to Libau, which had been recently captured by the German\narmy. E9 fired five torpedoes at the German flotilla; two\npassed closely astern of Roon while the other three missed\ntheir targets as well.\n\nRussian cruiser Admiral\nMakarov\n\nOn 2 July\n1915, Roon participated in a battle with Russian cruisers off the\nshores of Gotland, Sweden. 'The\nlight cruiser Augsburg and three destroyers were escorting\nthe minelaying cruiser when they were attacked by four Russian\ncruisers\u2014the armored cruisers Bayan, Admiral\nMakarov, and light cruisers Bogatyr and\nOleg.

There were several Russian destroyers\nanchored off Zerel; the German cruisers caught them by surprise and\ndamaged one of them.\n\nLater service\n\nOn 16 February 1916, Roon was mistakenly reported as\nhaving been captured by a British cruiser in the North Atlantic.\nThe ship\nwas also mistakenly reported to have taken part in the Battle of\nJutland as the flagship of the screening force for the main\nbody of the High Seas Fleet. This mistake appeared in\nhistorical works published shortly after the First World War, but\nlater works have corrected it.\n\nIn November 1916, Roon was disarmed and converted into a\ntraining and accommodation ship. Stationed at Kiel, she served in\nthis capacity until 1918. Plans to convert Roon into a\nseaplane tender did not come to fruition, primarily because the\nGerman Navy relied on zeppelins for aerial\nreconnaissance, not seaplanes.

{"text":"The 90-footRUDE is the smallest ship in NOAA's fleet.\nBut it packs a wallop when it comes to national press. Under\nthe direction of then Commander (now\nCaptain) Sam DeBow, the RUDE located the wreckage\nof TWA Flight 800 in July 1996. Almost exactly three years later,\nunder the command of Lieutenant Commander James Verlaque, the\nRUDE found John F. Kennedy Jr.'s downed aircraft\noff the Massachusetts coast.\n\nLast year, the little ship helped make sure that the largest-ever\nassembly of U.S. and foreign ships could safely transit New\nYork Harbor. RUDE surveyed the harbor and approaches\nto it, ensuring that National\nOcean Service chart makers could update critical navigation\ncharts in record time.\n\nRUDE then represented NOAA during the International\nNaval Review, an inspection by the President of U.S. naval might.\nTogether with OpSail 2000, this event attracted historic\nnumbers of naval vessels and tall ships. And much to local surprise,\nRUDE found six sunken vessels during its survey.\n\nBut\nit's the day-to-day work of RUDE that makes it\nsuch an essential part of NOAA's\nfleet. Named for Captain\nGilbert T. Rude, inventor of the RUDE Star\nFinder for locating celestial bodies, the ship surveys the Eastern\nseaboard to find submerged wrecks, rocks and other underwater\nnavigation hazards. Once collected, this information is used\nby NOAA chart makers to create the nautical tools so essential\nto safe navigation. Huge oil tankers, cargo ships, Navy and\nCoast Guard vessels, and small recreational boats all depend\non these charts to move safely along America's coastal waterways.\n\nRUDE's technology has come a long way from the\nlead lines once used by surveyors to determine the water's depth\nat a single point. Today RUDE uses side\nscan sonar\nin which a small torpedo-shaped \"towfish\" is towed by the ship.\nThis towfish sends out sound energy and analyzes the return\nsignal which bounces off of the seafloor or a submerged object.\n\nIn\na side scan, the transmitted energy forms into the shape of\na fan that sweeps the seafloor from under the towfish to either\nside, usually a distance of about 330 feet. The strength of\nthe return echo is continuously recorded, creating a \"picture\"\nof the ocean bottom where protruding objects create a dark image.\nShadows from these objects create light areas.\n\nStill\nessential is depth information. This data comes from RUDE's\nmulti-beam sonar, which also provides fan-shaped coverage of\nthe seafloor. But not in the form of images. Rather than continuously\nrecording the strength of the return echo, the multi-beam system\nmeasures and records how long it takes an acoustic signal to\ntravel from a transmitter to the seafloor or submerged object\nand back to the receiver. And this system is mounted on the\nship's hull, not towed.\n\nJust days after Lieutenant Commander Andrew Beaver of the NOAA\nCorps took command of the RUDE on March 9, a reporter\nwent aboard to observe surveys being conducted along Maryland's\nChesapeake Bay. Quoting the new commander, the reporter called\nRUDE small but mighty, and always willing to go the\nextra mile."}

{"text":"Leonard Warren Murray was born at Granton, Nova Scotia on 22 June 1896. His father Simon Dickson Murray (1859\u20131936) was a direct descendant of the Scottish immigrants who travelled to Pictou County on the Hector in 1773, and his mother was Jane Falconer (1868\u20131968). Simon was mid-level manager in various enterprises in Pictou Landing,[1] and Leonard grew up close to the water. At 14 years of age, Murray left Pictou Academy to join the first intake of 21 recruits into the Royal Naval College of Canada in Halifax, which had just been created by the Naval Service Act of 4 May 1910.[2]\n\nMidshipmen at the Royal Naval College, Murray second from left\n\n\"The first winter at the naval college was absolute hell, we had no uniforms, we arrived in what we stood up in and had to send home for further clothing. A case of measles broke out very shortly and we were quarantined, and the only time we got out of the college was when we went to the skating rink to play hockey; and that was a great relief.\" - Admiral Murray.[3]\n\nImmediately after graduating in January 1913,[4] he served as a Midshipman on the Royal Navy vessel HMS Berwick[5] on duty protecting British interests in the Mexican Revolution, and then aboard HMS Essex. At the outbreak of World War I he was assigned to the protected cruiserHMCS Niobe, the largest ship in the Canadian navy during World War I. Four of his classmates were sent to the Royal Navy cruiser HMS Good Hope and were killed off the coast of South America on 1 November 1914 at the Battle of Coronel \u2013 thereby becoming the first Canadian-service casualties of World War I.[6] Murray served briefly as Flotilla Gunnery Officer on HMCS Margaret and then in February 1916 was promoted to Sub-Lieutenant while aboard HMCS Rainbow. He spent the last two years of World War I as Assistant Navigating Officer on HMS Leviathan from January 1917 as Lieutenant, where he set up troop convoys across the Atlantic to outwit German U-boats \u2013 invaluable experience for the Battle of the Atlantic more than 20 years later. Murray ended the war in the North Sea aboard HMS Agincourt, and witnessed the surrender of the German fleet at Scapa Flow.[3]\n\nAfter World War I, Murray served briefly on HMS Ithuriel,[7] and then on the newly-commissioned HMS Calcutta under the distinguished British Captain Percy Noble, from whom Murray learned the basic skills of command, and who eighteen years later served opposite Murray on the receiving end of the convoys as Commander-in-Chief, Western Approaches Command. Following a short tour aboard HMS Crescent, Murray was assigned to HMS Aurora as Navigation Officer, until Aurora was paid off in 1921 due to naval budget cuts. Leonard married Jean Chaplin Scott in Westmount, Quebec on 10 October 1921, and with the Royal Canadian Navy depleted of ships on which he could serve, at this point he considered a civilian career, in 1924 qualifying as master of a foreign-going vessel. Deciding to remain with the armed forces, Murray joined many of his colleagues and spent the inter-war years alternating between shore assignments as a training officer with the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve, and serving aboard Royal Navy vessels, which in Murray's case included HMS Revenge (during a tour in 1923 in Turkey where he befriended Lord Louis Mountbatten),[8] and HMS Queen Elizabeth. Understandably, this provided Murray and his peers, including Percy W. Nelles, with a distinct anglophile and, in matters military, Royal Navy bias.[9][10] In January 1925, Murray was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and spent two years at the Canadian Navy's main training base at HMCS Stadacona. In 1927, Murray returned to the UK where he did a tour aboard HMS Tiger and then spent 1928 studying at the Royal Naval Staff College at Greenwich. During a simulation exercise at the College, Murray broke new ground by planning large convoys - convoys that were regarded at the time as \"almost suicidal\",[11] but which had become normal by the time of the Battle of the Atlantic. Upon return to Canada in January 1929, Murray was promoted to Commander and became the senior naval officer at CFB Esquimalt. In notes for a lecture to RMC Kingston in 1932, his continuing interest in the offensive merit of convoys over patrols is evident:\n\n\"The institution of a system of convoy requires a reorientation of the protective forces. Instead of patrolling the focal areas [where vessels congregate near ports or narrow passages], the group of ships forming the convoy is escorted by an armed escort capable of dealing with any possible scale of attack. This may mean that an increase in the protective force is necessary, but ... the protective force is more definite and concrete than in the patrolling method. In the convoy method ... it is not possible for an enemy to attack without laying herself open to attack and possible destruction\" - Admiral Murray.[12]\n\nAs Commander and Executive Officer, the gunnery training vessel Iron Duke was the largest vessel Murray commanded during his career.\n\nFrom June 1932, Murray was assigned for a year as Naval Staff Officer to National Defence Headquarters in Ottawa, before setting back to sea for two years, leading the small fleet of East Coast destroyers from the bridge of his first operational command, HMCS Saguenay.[13] At this point, in mid-1934, Murray was appointed to a new position of Senior Naval Officer, Halifax, a position that combined the Commander of the East Coast with the Command of the Naval Dockyard in Halifax. In June 1936 Murray was sent back to the UK to work in the Admiralty Operations Division, and in December 1936 he started his final tour with the Royal Navy serving as Executive Officer aboard the former battleship HMS Iron Duke, where he participated in the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review.[14] In August 1938, in the middle of a final year at the Imperial Defence College, Murray was promoted to Captain, and so it was that, on the eve of World War II when the Royal Navy was mobilized, Murray returned to Ottawa as a Captain, and Director Naval Operations and Training.[5]\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II, he was appointed Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff. From this HQs position Murray played a key role in the build-up of the Navy to its eventual wartime strength of approximately 332 vessels, including crossing Canada to recruit retired Royal Navy officers back into the Canadian Navy, and advocating for the \"small-ship anti-submarine\" investment strategy that was eventually so successful. In March 1940 he made a secret visit to the UK to negotiate the construction of destroyers in the UK for the Canadian Navy,[5] and subsequently was a founding member of the Permanent Joint Board on Defence. It was while he was working for the PJBD that he renewed his friendship with Commander James \"Chummy\" Prentice, who was shortly thereafter assigned the position of Senior Officer, Canadian Corvettes under Murray. Both men would work closely together until the spring of 1944.[15] In October 1940, he went back to sea briefly as Captain of HMCS Assiniboine and Commodore Commanding Halifax Force, effectively in command of the five Canadian warships that were dispatched to the UK in January 1941 to serve convoy duty. Back ashore in the UK, Murray was given the unusual title of Commodore Commanding Canadian Ships, and liaised closely with the Admiralty in the planning of an Atlantic strategy, including the resolution of jurisdictional matters relating to the Dominion of Newfoundland.\n\nOn return to Canada he was promoted to full Commodore on 31 May 1941, and on 13 June 1941 he was put in charge of the Newfoundland Escort Force (NEF) based out of St John's. This was the most important operational mandate given to a Canadian navy officer until that point,[16] in full command of 6 Canadian destroyers, 7 British destroyers, and 21 corvettes, and with responsibility for convoy escort from New York out as far as the transfer point to UK escorts south of Iceland. In recognition of this increased role, Murray was subsequently appointed Rear Admiral on 2 December 1941.[5]\n\n\"Conditions were terrible that winter. Groups worked on a 35 day cycle which entailed 29 days away from St John's, 27 days away from fresh bread, 25 days away from fresh meat, added to which at the northern end of their beat there was no sunlight to speak of in the winter. We had to revert to the old rations of Nelson's time, barreled salt beef with lime juice or tomato juice to scare away scurvy\" - Admiral Murray.[17]\n\nWhile based in Newfoundland, Admiral Murray hosted a visit from the Free French Admiral Muselier. Acting on orders from the Admiralty, Murray gave Muselier temporary command of three French corvettes and a submarine that were assigned to Murray's fleet, for passage to Halifax. On return from Halifax, Muselier took the vessels to Vichy-controlled St Pierre and Miquelon, and on 24 December 1941 raised the Free French flag to claim the islands for General Charles de Gaulle, thereby creating a diplomatic incident between France, Canada and the USA. Murray was later asked to account for his role in this adventure - but steadfastly claimed (as did Muselier) that he had no part in it.[18] Nevertheless, in 1946 Murray was awarded the Legion d'Honneur by the Government of France, for \"eminent services rendered to the cause of Free France at the time of the rallying of the inhabitants of St Pierre and Miquelon\".[19]\n\nThe NEF was reorganized in February 1942 as the Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF). On 9 September 1942, Murray was appointed to Commanding Officer Atlantic Coast, with his Headquarters in Halifax, and effective command over 322 armed ships. As a direct result of the Atlantic Convoy Conference of 1\u201312 March 1943, where it was agreed that the US Navy would concentrate on the South Atlantic leaving Canada and the UK to cover the North Atlantic,[20] on 1 April 1943 Murray was made Commander-in-Chief Canadian Northwest Atlantic. Still headquartered in Halifax, thereafter he commanded all Allied air and naval forces involved in convoy protection between Canada and the coast of Ireland until the end of the war with Germany in 1945.[5]\n\nAtlantic Convoy 1942\n\nIn order to encourage the captains of the merchant ships of all countries which carry the lifeblood of the U.K., I made it a point to attend the briefing conference of all captains and chief engineers before their departure. During the winter of '42-'43, when sinkings were at their worst, I could see when I told them of the measures by escort and air cover that were being taken for their protection and safety; I could see that they knew very well and that they knew I knew in spite of my brave words, that anything up to 25 per cent of them would probably not arrive in the U.K. in their own ships, and that probably half of that number would not arrive in the U.K. at all. But there was never a waver in their resolve - Admiral Murray.[21]\n\nAs the Allies gained the upper hand in the Battle of the Atlantic throughout 1943 and 1944, attacks on convoys diminished and the amount of escort cover was reduced, but the hard work of planning and organizing convoys never ceased. By May 1944, British participation in convoy escorts was withdrawn entirely,[25] and Canada was left with sole responsibility until September 1944. Murray's moment of singular pride came in this period, when the largest convoy of World War II, HX 300 sailed for the UK via New York on 17 July 1944, with 167 merchant ships (1,500,000 long tons (1,500,000 t)). It arrived in the UK, without incident, on 3 August 1944.[26]\n\nAdmiral Murray was controversially blamed for allowing sailors shore leave in Halifax on VE Day, a decision that is generally considered to have contributed to the Halifax Riot of 7\u20138 May 1945.[27]James Lorimer Ilsley, the Acting Prime Minister of Canada, responded quickly to the situation and on 10 May appointed Justice Kellock to chair a Royal Commission into the disorders. On 12 May, Murray was abruptly removed from his command; and the next day a separate Naval Board of Inquiry under Admiral Brodeur was appointed to investigate naval participation in the disorders. The Kellock Commission placed considerable blame upon the Navy and in particular upon the Admiral, for not having exercised better control over the sailors' celebrations ashore.[28] The Naval Inquiry's findings were more balanced, finding that the riot was caused by several factors, including a failure in the naval command.[29] Murray himself felt that responsibility lay mainly with the civil authorities of Halifax,[18] and he was frustrated that the Kellock Commission effectively placed the Navy on trial without providing him or his officers with an opportunity to defend themselves. He asked for a court martial to clear his name,[30] but this was never agreed. The Government made an attempt to leave the Admiral with his honour intact:\n\n\"It would be a regrettable thing if, resultant upon the Halifax disturbances, the truly great services of this officer and those under his command were to be forgotten by the people of Canada.\"[31]\n\nBut the Admiral was never assigned another command. Concluding that he was being held up as a scapegoat, and feeling bitter that the country and the Navy had abandoned him suddenly at the moment of the Navy's greatest accomplishment, Murray left Canada for the United Kingdom in September 1945, and officially retired from the Navy on 14 March 1946.[5]\n\nMurray remained active in his retirement, qualifying as a lawyer on 17 November 1949,[32] and with his specialty in maritime law he represented the British government at the 1950 enquiry into the accidental sinking of the SS Hopestar.[33] He was involved with his local church, and served as a rural councillor as well as on school boards. His love of the sea was kept alive by keen membership in the Bar Yacht Club where he was racing Captain for ten years, and a leadership role with the Sea Scouts\u2014coincidentally carried back to Canada where a Canadian Sea Cadet Corps in New Glasgow, near his home town, is named in his honour (RCSCC 87 Admiral Murray). Murray stopped practising law in 1960 to care better for his ailing wife, who died in 1962. Following a chance meeting on a Greek cruise, Leonard remarried on 23 August 1963, in Buxton to an ophthalmic surgeon Antonina Schcheyteenin\u2014who quickly came to be known as Nina Murray.[34] He dabbled in British politics, becoming a member of the Conservative Party and ran unsuccessfully as a candidate in municipal council elections in Buxton in 1965,[35] before turning his attention to a spirited debate with the Canadian military establishment, the media and Prime Minister Pearson wherein he opposed the 1966 integration of the Canadian Armed Forces.[18] Although clearly feeling that Canada had abandoned him following the Halifax Riot, Murray maintained his ties to Canada and last visited in 1970, when he participated in the 25th anniversary celebrations of the Battle of the Atlantic.[36]\n\nLeonard died peacefully in Buxton on 25 November 1971, and his ashes were placed in St Paul's Church in Halifax on 17 September 1972. His memory lived on in the Canadian Navy, where the Admiral L.W. Murray Trophy for Gunnery Proficiency was awarded annually at least until the early 1970s. Since his death, a number of commemorative steps have been taken, including the placing of a memorial in his honour in Pictou,[37] a collection of his medals and related naval artifacts in the Canadian Naval Operations School in Halifax,[38] the naming of a Maritimes Branch of the Royal Canadian Naval Association, the renaming of Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps NEW GLASGOW in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia to Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps ADMIRAL MURRAY, and the naming of several naval buildings.\n\n\"Except for the few months at sea in Assiniboine, my war work was a solid slog, mostly at a desk, averaging 15 hours a day with frequently a full 24. My job was to obtain the greatest possible result from relatively inexperienced personnel. There was little opportunity for anyone to step on another's toes. They were spread too thinly and there was a more responsible job for each as soon as he felt confident of his ability to take it on. In the autumn of 1941 young volunteer reserve officers who had never seen salt water before the war took command of corvettes manned by 88 men\u2014the number of white and black keys on a piano and each with his own peculiar note\u2014and took their full part in the Battle of the Atlantic. Experience had taught me this: to find out what you're capable of, it is only necessary to get a chance to do it\u2014and someone else must have enough confidence in you to provide that chance. In my dealings with the young RCNVR captains I did my best to give them the opportunity to find their own feet and they did it. Once having tasted success they never looked back. What a blessing that we had the bright young peoples to accept this kind of responsibility\" - Admiral Murray.[39]\n\n^Although this does not appear in his RCN service record, the Murray papers at LAC contain his navigation notes from a voyage in late 1919, and a period of service from 31 October-1 December 1919 is quoted in a letter of 1924 applying for a civilian Master's license.\n\n^Arguably, close ties to the Royal Navy were important for gaining the trust that, eventually, persuaded the UK to hand over convoy responsibility to Canada, and ultimately to Murray.

{"text":"Upcoming Events\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1870, Charles Wyville Thomson (right), Professor of Natural History at Edinburgh University, persuaded the Royal Society of London to ask the British Government to furnish one of Her Majesty's ships for a prolonged voyage of exploration across the oceans of the globe. On the 7th December 1872, the expedition put to sea from Sheerness aboard the corvette H.M.S. Challenger.\n\nThe vessel was a three-masted square-rigged wooden ship of 2300 tons displacement and some 200 feet in length. She was essentially a sailing ship even though she possessed an engine of 1200 horsepower. It was planned that the ship would be under sail for most of the cruise, using the engine primarily for manoeuvring when conducting scientific observations and deploying heavy gear. All but two of the ship's 17 guns had been removed to make way for purpose-built scientific laboratories and workrooms designed specifically for biological, chemical and physical work. Storage space for all the trawls and dredges was also necessary, together with space for the anticipated sample collection.\n\nThe commanding officer was Captain George Nares (left), with approximately 20 naval officers (including surgeons and engineers) and 200 crew. There were six civilian staff and scientists under the direction of Wyville Thomson that included the naturalists John Murray and Henry N. Mosely, the chemist\/physicist John Buchanan and the official artist J.J. Wild.\n\nBetween her departure in December 1872 and her return to Spithead on 24 May 1876, H.M.S. Challenger traversed 68,890 nautical miles, in the course of which she sampled in the North and South Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and travelled north of the limits of drift ice in the North Atlantic polar seas and south of the Antarctic Circle.\n\nWyville Thomson reported the Challenger to have made 362 sample\/observation stations \"at intervals as nearly uniform as possible\". At each station, the following observations were made, as far as circumstances allowed:\n\nThe exact depth was determined.\n\nA sample of the bottom averaging from 1 ounce to 1 pound in weight was recovered by means of the sounding instrument.\n\nA sample of bottom water was procured for chemical\/physical examination.\n\nThe bottom temperature was recorded by a registering thermometer.\n\nAt most stations, a fair sample of the bottom fauna was procured by means of the dredge or trawl.\n\nAt most stations, the fauna of the surface and of intermediate depths was examined by the use of tow nets variously adjusted.\n\nAt most stations, a series of temperature observations was made at different depths from the surface to the bottom.\n\nAt many stations, samples of sea-water were obtained from different depths.\n\nIn all cases, atmospheric and other meteorological conditions were carefully observed and noted.\n\nThe direction and rate of the surface current was determined.\n\nAt a few stations, an attempt was made to ascertain the direction and rate of movement of the water at different depths.\n\nBack at home, the scientific findings of the cruise were examined by over 100 scientists, primarily under the guidance of John Murray, who should receive the highest praise for the work's eventual publication The Report of the Scientific Results of the Exploring Voyage of H.M.S. Challenger during the years 1873-76 occupied 50 volumes, each measuring about 13 by 10 inches and as \"thick as a family Bible\". They appeared between 1885 and 1895. Scientists involved with collecting and publishing the data were awarded with a specially-minted medal, the original Challenger Medal.\n\nAt its completion, The Report discussed with full detail of text and illustrations the currents, temperatures, depths and constituents of the oceans, the topography of the sea bottom, the geology and biology of its covering and the animal life of the abyssal waters. The Challenger cruise had lain the cornerstone of scientific oceanography and begun its introduction to the wider scientific and lay community.\n\nThe findings of the cruise were correctly described by John Murray in 1895 as \"the greatest advance in the knowledge of our planet since the celebrated discoveries of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries\"."}

The exhibition, which will be opened until mid-September this year, is the first step towards the museum collection \u2013 the 'Museum of Industrial Heritage, Economy and Transport.\n\nThe story of the torpedo begins in the 1860s when Rijeka was rapidly evolving industrially and became a modern European city.\n\nThe inventor of the torpedo was Giovanni Luppis, born in Rijeka and from a family of wealthy ship-owners. Before his retirement as the captain of the Austrian frigate he was thinking about a new weapon called the \"savior of the coast\". It was an elongated vessel filled with explosives with inconspicuous glass sails that could be operated from the shore.\n\nLuppis presented the project to the Technical Committee of the Austrian Navy in 1861. The reaction was not positive, but Luppis did not give up and returned to Rijeka, where he contacted the industrialist Giovanni Ciotte, who later became the mayor of Rijeka, in the era of its greatest rise. Three years later Ciotte connects Luppis with the Director of Rijeka`s Technical Institute, Robert Whitehead, with whom he negotiates cooperation in perfecting Luppis` model. But at one point Whitehead departs from Luppis` approach and decides that the vessel should be immersed under water to reduce its visibility and impact on the course it takes.\n\nIn December 1866 he unveiled his prototype. For the trial launch in 1868, he installed his invention (the launcher) on the gunboat Gemsa. Completed in the shipyard of the brothers Schiavon in Rijeka, Gemsa became the first torpedo boat in the world.\n\nIn 1875 Whitehead opened a torpedo factory with an annual production of 800 models.\nTorpedos from Rijeka were ordered by the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, Sweden, Japan, Argentina, Russia and other countries. The factory established plants abroad, and in time allowed licensed manufacturing around the world. Production of the torpedo in Rijeka lasted until 1966. Along the former factory halls, there is still a construction of a launcher from the 1930s. According to available sources, there were 20 323 torpedoes, 1053 launching tubes and 1368 high-pressure compressors produced in Rijeka from 1866 to August 1943. The production of torpedoes in the Rijeka factory stopped in 1966."}
{"text":"Shipwreck survivor recalls how town altered his idea of race\n\nLanier W. Phillips, 87, is a retired navy sonar technician and oceanographer whose life was changed when his ship was wrecked off the coast of Newfoundland in 1942. Having grown up with the sting of racism in Georgia and in the U.S. Navy, his view of life changed when, to his amazement, he was treated with care and humanity by residents of St. Lawrence, Newfoundland.\n\nEarly on the 18th, the Truxtun and a supply ship, the USS Pollux, were battling a ferocious winter storm when both ships were blown onto the rocks off the southeast coast of Newfoundland. More than 200 men from the ships perished. Phillips and a few dozen others barely survived.\n\nWhen the Truxtun hit the rocks, Phillips was pitched from the topmost of a stack of five bunks. He scrambled up on deck, where it was snowing and a gale was raging. \"The waves would come and . . . just pick the ship up and then slam it against the rock,\" he said. \"You could hear steel cracking.\"\n\nEventually, he said, the ship broke in two, and began hemorrhaging fuel oil into the sea. Daybreak revealed icy cliffs, and sailors swept overboard. Phillips tried to decide what to do. Should he stay with the ship? Or try to get into a life raft, braving the storm and who knew what kind of welcome on land?\n\nHe and the other black sailors believed they were off the coast of Iceland, where, he said they had been told blacks were forbidden to go ashore.\n\nHe decided to brave the raft, which capsized just as it reached land. Wet, frozen and exhausted, he said, he staggered ashore and collapsed.\n\nJust then he heard a voice say: \"Don't lie there. You'll surely die.\" Phillips said he could barely see through the oil in his eyes, but he could tell it wasn't a sailor, and the speaker had an unusual accent. It was one of the locals, and he was white.\n\nThe man helped Phillips to his feet and began walking him around a fire to warm him up. Phillips was amazed.\n\n\"I had never heard a kind word from a white man in my life,\" he said, \"and I had hatred for white men.\"\n\nPhillips was taken to a place where women were washing the oil off the survivors. \"Everybody was black\" with oil, he said. But the women seemed to be having trouble getting him clean. \"I can't get it off\" him, he said one woman remarked. He said he replied: \"It's the color of the skin. You can't get it off.\"\n\nHe said he thought now that the townsfolk realized he was black, the good treatment would end.\n\nInstead, he recalled, the woman said, \"I want him at my house.\"\n\nIt was Violet Pike, the humble wife of a miner, who took him home, fed him soup and put him to bed with blankets and rocks she had heated in her stove.\n\nPhillips, one of 46 men from the Truxtun to survive, and the only black survivor, soon recovered and went on to spend 20 years in the Navy. He had a career in oceanography, marched with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma, Ala., and raised a family.\n\nBut he never forgot Pike, who died at 62 in 1975, or the people of St. Lawrence, whose humanity that wintry day in 1942 so changed his life."}

The film was directed by Richard Lester, who took over after directors Bryan Forbes and Don Medford cruise ship. SS Hamburg had recently been sold by its German owners to the Soviet Union and renamed SS Maxim Gorkiy. Before the Soviets began operating the ship for paying passengers, they chartered it to the film company.\nThe Black Sea Shipping Company livery carried by the Maxim Gorkiy was altered, the Soviet Union's hammer and sickle emblem in the funnel and bow replaced by the logo of the fictitious Sovereign Line, and the ship was renamed the Britannic. Advertisements were run in British papers, soliciting extras who would take a lengthy cruise in the North Sea for free, but with the knowledge that the ship would actually seek out the worst possible weather, as the story demanded seas too rough for the lifeboats to be lowered, trapping the passengers on board.\nBecause the charter of the ship was negotiated as oil prices skyrocketed in February 1974, the Soviets ended up losing money on the deal.\n\nplot:\n\nA cruise liner, the SS Britannic, is in the middle of the Atlantic when the owner of the shipping line, Porter (Ian Holm), receives a phone call from a man with a lilting Irish accent who refers to himself only as Juggernaut.\nJuggernaut claims to have placed seven barrels of amatol (high explosive) aboard the Britannic that will explode and sink the ship by dawn the following day. The barrels are booby-trapped and any attempt to defuse them will result in an explosion. Details of how to render the bombs safe will be sent in exchange for a ransom of five hundred thousand pounds sterling.\nTo show he is serious, Juggernaut arranges a demonstration, a series of small explosions on the Britannic's bridge that seriously injure two crewmen. Porter is all for paying the ransom and saving the 1,200 passengers on board (the seas are too rough to abandon ship). However, officials of the British government inform Porter that if he pays the ransom, they will withdraw his company's operating subsidy.\nInstead, a bomb disposal expert, Lt. Cmdr. Anthony Fallon (Richard Harris), and his team must parachute into the Atlantic, board the Britannic and defuse the barrels before the deadline. Meanwhile, Supt. John McCleod (Anthony Hopkins), whose wife and two children are on board the Britannic leads the efforts on land to find Juggernaut.\nAfter an attempt to defuse one bomb by robot fails, Fallon goes to his backup plan. Fallon's team will defuse one barrel each. Fallon will go first, informing his men of each move. If he fails and the bomb explodes, his men will know what went wrong. However, if two more bombs go off, the ship will sink."}
{"text":"Why can heavy steel ships float?\n\nMay 22, 2012 | Author: Elmar Bergeler |\n\nHave you ever wondered why heavy steel ships float and don't sink? Plain steel would sink in water immediately, as would a wrecked steel ship like the Titanic or the more recently sunken Costa Concordia in Italy. But an intact ship floats.\n\nThe buoyancy force\n\nThe reason that a ship floats is that it displaces a lot of water. The displaced water wants to return to it's original location, where the ship is now, and this pushes the ship upwards. The force which pushes the ship up is called the buoyancy force. It appears due to the Archimedes' principle: \"Any object, wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.\" That means that when an object displaces one liter of water, the object gets pushed up with the buoyancy force equal to the weight of one liter of water. The more water that is displaced, the stronger the buoyancy force is which pushes the object up.\n\nFloating \u2013 equilibrium of forces\n\nAny object which dips into water experiences two forces: the gravity force which pulls it down due to its weight, and the buoyancy force which pushes it up. If these forces are equal, then the object floats. A stone in water also experiences these two forces: a buoyancy force due to the displaced water and the gravity force due to the stone's weight. But a stone's buoyancy force is much smaller than it's gravity force. That's why the stone sinks. However, the buoyancy force makes the stone sink slower than it would fall in the air. A ship also experiences these two forces. But because of the body design of the ship, it displaces enough water so that the buoyancy force is as strong as the gravity force. These forces neutralize each other and the ship floats. A ship always dips deep enough to displace an amount of water that creates a buoyancy force as strong as the gravity force. If a ship carries heavy cargo, it dips deeper into the water. This creates a stronger buoyancy force which is exactly as strong as the increased gravity force.\n\nUser Rating: \/ 77 PoorBest\n\nScience Books\n\nIf you don't see any book covers here you are using an add blocker.

{"text":"Channel Ferry\n\nLoading\n\nCHANNEL FERRY. In the World War the necessity of utilizing the canals and waterways of France and Belgium for transport in order to relieve the pressure on the railways was early recognized, and to take over and develop this work behind the British lines the Inland Water Transport Section of the Royal Engineers was formed in 1914.\n\nThe activities of this new organization became so great that a similar organization (later the Directorate of Inland Waterways and Docks, Royal Engineers) was set up in England. The func tions of this directorate expanded until it took in other branches of transport besides canal traffic, and included the supply and equipment for docks and harbours, and constructional work at various ports which formed bases for transport of munitions and materials for the British armies in all theatres of war.\n\nTo meet the growing demands from France for suitable craft, personnel, plant and stores in an efficient and economical manner, it was decided to establish a cross-channel barge port and stores depot, from which barges capable of navigating the French canals could be sent across loaded. Richborough in Kent was chosen.\n\nThe site had many advantages. It was :\u2014(a) directly oppo site the ports and canals of northern France (see Map) ; (b) within easy access of a main railway system; (c) a flat, low-lying, un occupied ground of over 2,000 acres, capable of being developed without interfering with any vested interests, or existing traffic or other port facilities; (d) situated on a tidal river with a shel tered entrance; (e) comparatively inaccessible to enemy naval raids.\n\nThe development of Richborough was remarkably rapid and by 1917\u2014although the primary object of its existence was the cross channel barge traffic\u2014it had grown into a large and well equipped seaport and workshop base with three-quarters of a mile of wharves and Tom. of railway sidings capable of dealing with 30,00o tons of traffic per week; with extensive engineering work shops and foundries where urgent repair work which could not be carried out in the war areas was done; a spacious salvage transit yard where the sorting, storage and dispatch of salvage was carried on by female labour ; large store warehouses from which con sumable stores, plant, and other material were dispatched over seas at a moment's notice ; camp accommodation for 15,000 troops and a regimental depot for the reception, equipment, training and disposal of all personnel recruited for the Inland Waterways and Docks for service at home and in the various theatres of war.\n\nThese works were constructed by military labour, especially re cruited from skilled trades and working under the supervision of technical officers. The recruits, large numbers of whom were of low medical category, after being given a short military training at the regimental depot were passed on for duty and intensive training to one or other of the formations, e.g., construction, work shops, railway traffic, marine or stores, from which they were drafted overseas for similar service as and when required, 1,200 officers and 51,000 other ranks passing through in this way.\n\nCross-Channel Barge Service.\u2014The expansion of Richborough into a transportation base and the establishment of the channel barge service\u2014carried on without a break day or night until the Armistice with barges specially designed for the crossing and for navigating the French waterways\u2014was an enormous relief to ordinary shipping and the following advantages were also ob tained :\u2014(a) Relief of congestion at French ports as barges passed straight through to inland depots with consequent avoid ance of double handling; (b) return of barges from war zone loaded with salvage; (c) saving of railway carriage in France; (d) relief to English ports; (e) disposal of both marine and war risks into smaller units; (f) no naval patrol necessary.\n\nThe total exports by barge up to the armistice exceeded 31 million tons and the total imports of salvage half a million.\n\nA fleet of 386 craft was controlled from Richborough includ ing 67 sea-going tugs and 255 200-ton barges. Over 20,000 cross channel trips were made and it is interesting to note that no craft was lost as the result of enemy action, though some sus tained casualties when in canals close up behind the British lines.\n\nTrain Ferry Service.\u2014Late in 1916, the serious shipping po sition, the increasing demand from France for supplies, and the delays in the channel ports owing to inadequate appliances for handling heavy cargo, led to the decision to establish a train ferry service on the Richborough cross-channel route to enable heavy war material to be run direct on rail from factories to war areas. In Jan. 1917 orders were placed for three train ferry vessels capable of carrying 54 fully loaded ten-ton trucks or as many guns, tanks, locomotives, or other vehicles as could be arranged on the four deck-tracks, or a total load of 960 tons.\n\nTerminals and berths for these vessels were built at Richbor ough, Southampton, Dunkirk, Calais and Dieppe; the method of communication between ship and shore being a double track self adjusting bridge hinged at the shore end.\n\nThe service from Richborough to Calais began in February 1918 and was carried on without mishap and without convoy. The vessels were good seaboats and crossed in all but the most severe Weather. As a transport unit they were of immense value. Their first cargoes were heavy wagons, 34o of which were taken across in seven trips (averaging 12 hours each). Previously it had taken a 3,600-ton steamer one month to convey 30o wagons. It is estimated that the three ferry boats released six 8,000 ton ocean-going steamers, whilst an enormous economy was effected in the avoidance of double transhipment. One of the outstanding features of the service was the ease and rapidity with which the vessels were loaded and unloaded\u2014the time averaging less than 25 minutes per trip. After the disaster of March 21, 1918, when some 60o British guns were lost, over 700 guns were shipped by train ferry within 48 hours to replace them. In May 1918 two 14-inch guns on railway mountings, each weighing 302 tons and measuring 8 7f t. overall, were taken over safely and run up to the front without the necessity of dismantling in England and re-erecting in France. In his dispatch of Jan. 7, 1919, F.M. Sir Douglas Haig said, \"During the period following the great defensive battles, up to the final triumph of the Allied cause the channel ferry has proved of inestimable value.\" After the war the port at Richborough was acquired by an industrial group with interests in the Kent coalfields.\n\n(A. J. A. W.) In Oct. 1936 a passenger train ferry service was opened between Dover and Dunkirk."}

{"text":"Battle of Coronel\n\nThe Battle of Coronel. When the two forces first sighted each other the light was in favour of the British, the sun\nwould be in the eyes of the German gunners. By the time firing started the sun was just below the horizon, reversing the visibility advantage.\n\nRear Admiral Cradock had his squadron reinforced by the armoured cruiser Good Hope. She had just come out of reserve and was manned\nby a very green crew of reservists and cadets but despite this Cradock transferred his flag to her as she was faster than his current ship.\nHe was then given the task of finding Graf Spee and so headed for the Pacific. His squadron now consisted of Good Hope, the armoured\ncruiser Monmouth, the light cruiser Glasgow and the armed merchant cruiser Otranto. The squadron was inferior to the German squadron\nand so the old pre-dreadnought battleship Canopus was sent to bolster Cradock. Again she was straight out of reserve, slow (17 knots max.) and manned\nby reservists who had never fired her guns before, the guns being outranged by those of the German armoured cruisers. HMS Defence, an armoured cruiser, was also\npromised but never materialised. The Admiralty falsely gave Cradock the impression that they thought that this force was adequate for the task and he should\nengage Graf Spee if he could. The British squadron was to be based out of the Falkland Islands. When Canopus did finally turn up there it turned out that she\nhad engine problems and was limited to 12 knots. Cradock decided to detach her from his main squadron, letting her follow at her own pace with his colliers.\n\nOn October 29 1914 Glasgow was sent to Coronel to pick up intelligence and whilst there she picked up radio transmissions between Leipzig and one of her colliers.\n\nThe squadron was reformed and spread out at 20 mile intervals to sweep north. There was little optimism in the British ships about the outcome should they meet the German\nsquadron of modern ships with crack crews. Monmouth had an even less experienced crew than Good Hope and was an old design that had a poor reputation being badly under-armed\nfor a ship of her size and too slow to run away. Otranto was a converted liner, too slow, armed with old 4.7 inch guns (eight carried) and with a large silhouette and no\narmour. Only Glasgow was a decent ship, a modern light cruiser with a regular crew, decent speed and capable of outgunning the German light cruisers, but not Scharnhorst and Gneisenau.\n\nMonmouth was an attempt to produce a \"cheap\" armoured cruiser. Even when new they were weakly armed with a 6 inch gun main battery. Many of these\nguns were mounted in casemates which were too low in the hull making them unusable in any but the calmest seas.\n\nOn November 1 at 1630 Glasgow sighted smoke from Leipzig and then minutes later the ship and the German armoured cruisers. Spee formed a battle line in\nthe order Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, Leipzig and Dresden, N\u00fcrnberg was thirty miles to the north, still returning from Valparaiso. The British line was\nordered Good Hope, Monmouth, Glasgow and Otranto. Cradock had the opportunity of turning towards Canopus, 300 miles to the south, there not being sufficient\nlight for Spee to catch him that day but that risked the losing Spee during the night. The British turned towards the German line and at\nabout 1930 at 11,400 yards the German armoured cruisers opened fire. The British squadron was silhouetted by the setting sun whilst the German ships were hard\nto see in the failing light. The third salvo from Scharnhorst hit Good Hope, causing a sheet of flame forward and knocking out her forward 9.2 inch gun. Monmouth was\nalso hit by the third salvo from Gneisenau, setting her forward turret on fire. The German gun crews maintained a rapid and accurate fire, both leading British cruisers being\nhit over thirty times, whilst the reply from the British was very ineffectual. The visibility deteriorated so that the Germans has to target the fires on the British ships whilst\nthe British had to make do with aiming at the enemy gun flashes.\n\nLeipzig and Glasgow engaged each other whilst Dresden fired on Otranto which rapidly pulled out of the line and fled, enabling Dresden to also engage Glasgow.\n\nCradock closed the range to 5,500 yards to bring his 6 inch guns to action, Spee interpreted this as an attempt to launch a torpedo attack and increased the\nrange. At 1950 Good Hope suffered a magazine explosion, the crippled ship then drifting out of site and sinking soon afterwards. There were no survivors.\n\nMonmouth was also in a bad way, being on fire and listing to port. Glasgow had been hit five times and seeing that Monmouth was beyond help fled to avoid\ncertain destruction and to warn Canopus to turn back.\nMonmouth was unable to fire but her White Ensign was still flying. The newly arrived Nurberg found her and finished her off with gunfire at point blank, seventy five\ngun flashes being observed from Glasgow. Again there were no survivors.\n\nLeipzig and Dresden were detached to find Glasgow and Otranto, both heading for the Falkland Islands whilst the rest of the squadron made for Valparaiso to coal and provision.\n\nThe British had suffered its first defeat for over a century with the loss of two armoured cruisers and nearly 1600 crew. The only damage to the Germans\nwas two hits on Scharnhorst and four hits and three wounded on Gneisenau.\n\nHMS Good Hope, the British flag ship. As with most warships of this period she had very little structure above\nupper deck level, reducing the silhouette which was vulnerable to gun fire."}

{"text":"May 12, 2011\n\nThis log book kept by the master of the Culloden includes daily recordings on the weather, ship's location, supplies and events such as accidents, disturbances and disciplinary actions. Credit: Steven Pfaff, University of Washington\n\nFilms depicting the 1787 mutiny aboard the British ship HMS Bounty show sailors living cheek by jowl, being forced to dance, enduring storm-ridden Cape of Good Hope crossings to satisfy the ship captain's ego and being flogged for trivial reasons.\n\nWe may not think that these harsh conditions have much relevance today. But mutinies continue to occur, especially in the armed forces of developing nations. And mutinies have similarities to other types of rebellions, including worker strikes, riots, prison rebellions and political uprisings.\n\nUniversity of Washington sociologists are studying naval records of mutinies as a way to see how modern-day ill-treatment toward subordinates can lead to violence.\n\n\"We know that 18th century sailors had lots of grievances, but usually they were not severe enough to cause a rebellion,\" said Steven Pfaff, UW associate professor of sociology. \"Our study looks at what tips the balance from putting up with grievances to risking execution for mutiny.\"\n\nPfaff and Michael Hechter, a former UW sociology professor and now a professor of global studies at Arizona State University, along with UW undergraduate sociology students, are studying ship logs and court martial records from the British Royal Navy to learn what factors disrupted social order.\n\nIn June, Pfaff and Hechter will present a portion of their findings during the Mutiny and Maritime Radicalism in the Age of Revolution conference at the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam, Netherlands.\n\nThe work is funded by the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research and by the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation, which funds research on violence, aggression and dominance.\n\nMuster books -- such as this one from the Culloden -- contain information about all the individuals aboard a ship, including name, place and country of birth, nature of recruitment (volunteer or impress), desertion, discharge and death and age at entry onboard. Muster books were usually updated weekly. Credit: Steven Pfaff, University of Washington\n\nThe sociologists are focusing on Royal Navy mutinies from 1740-1820, a period in which Great Britain achieved global dominance on the shoulders of her navy.\n\n\"During that time, there were about 70 cases in which sailors were able to take over ships for a period of time,\" said Pfaff, an expert on collective action \u2013 how groups of people work together toward a common goal. Previously, he's studied collective action in the context of religion, social movements and political revolutions, such as mass protests following the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe.\n\n\"I have generally found that people do not act irrationally when they protest, even when the costs of engaging in collective action are potentially very high \u2013 as with mutiny,\" Pfaff said. \"Usually they are acting in hopes of redressing specific kinds of grievances.\"\n\nWorking with Moira Bracknell, an expert in maritime history at the University of Exeter, Pfaff has made two trips to England to look through meticulous, hand-written ship logs and muster books kept by naval officers while at sea. He records the demographics of the ship\u00b4s crew, the age and size of the ship, whether the ship was at sea during war or peace, how long the ship had been at sea and the number of sailors aboard due to impressments \u2013 forced recruitment commonly used in that era.\n\nPfaff also looks at how well the ship is governed \u2013 the number of accidents aboard, adequacy of rations and amount of booty captured from enemy ships \u2013 and takes note of quality of life measures, such as severity of punishments, the extent of reduced rations, sicknesses and spoiled food.\n\nIn many cases, Pfaff finds that mutinies emerged because of unpaid and delinquent wages or excessive punishment.\n\nSafety concerns were also a factor. Seamen aboard the Camilla near Jamaica in 1783, for instance, refused to sail because smallpox had killed several men, worsening a shortage of seamen on an understaffed ship. They argued that they could not sail without more men because if a squall \u2013 or a hurricane \u2013 set in, they would not be able to handle the ship.\n\nSometimes there were seemingly trivial reasons for mutiny:\n\nWatered-down grog aboard the Defiance in 1795,\n\nPoor quality beef aboard the Berwick in 1794,\n\nRagged clothes on the Crown in 1764, and\n\nLack of shore leave for sailors on the Orion in 1794.\n\nGrievances related to food, drink and clothing were simultaneously a matter of compensation, Pfaff said, since the seaman\u00b4s wage included specified entitlements to rations and supplies.\n\nAnother seemingly odd reason for rebellion occurred in 1793 aboard the Minerva as it returned from the East Indies. Captain Whitby insisted the men exercise by fiddle-dancing, be quiet when above deck and forbade them from swearing \u2013 a cherished practice of seamen of the era.\n\nPfaff said that the episode on the Minerva was a mild case of mutiny and was settled peacefully. The Minerva mutiny is also an example of a common thread Pfaff finds for motivations to rebel: violation of naval conventions.\n\n\"It was a rough equilibrium most of the time,\" he said of life on board. Many times sailors expected officers to \"look the other way in matters of petty deviance.\" And seamen were willing to endure a lot if they believed that their officers were fair, competent and protective of their welfare.\n\nStudying the size and age of the ships gives Pfaff a sense of the sailors' abilities to plan and coordinate usurpation \u2013 no small feat in such cramped quarters or in the face of supervising officers and armed marine guards.\n\n\"It's a small community and hard to hide,\" Pfaff said of life aboard a ship. Would-be mutineers \"would have to persuade someone to instigate the mutiny, knowing that ringleaders would be punished more severely.\"\n\nBy studying court-martial documents from mutiny trials, Pfaff finds that oaths were a common way to ensure solidarity in advance of an uprising. \"Since the oaths were themselves illegal and potentially punishable by hanging, the willingness to take an oath was a credible signal that one\u00b4s shipmates were reliable,\" he said.\n\nUnlike the well-known mutiny on the Bounty, in which mutineers took over the ship and set the captain adrift in a small boat with his supporters, most mutinies were more like worker strikes.\nPfaff calls these \"voice\" mutinies, after a distinction made by the famous economist Albert Hirschman. Voice mutinies occurred in about two thirds of the more than 60 mutinies Pfaff has studied so far.\n\n\"In voice mutinies, sailors wanted to improve their circumstances and make their conditions better,\" he said.\n\nNow Pfaff and his research team are trying to understand the precise conditions that tipped a restive crew toward rebellion and what inspired some seamen to risk the most by becoming mutiny ringleaders. Pfaff and UW undergraduate researchers are coding data from hundreds of ships\u00b4 records from ships with mutinies and \u2013 as a control group \u2013 ships that did not have mutinies. Then the researchers will perform statistical analyses to isolate the factors that increased the odds of mutiny.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nWesley Autrey, a black construction worker, a Navy veteran and 55-year-old father of two, didn't know the young man standing beside him.

{"text":"Tryon was born at Bulwick Park, Northamptonshire, England, the third son of Thomas Tryon and his wife Anne Trollope. He had three brothers: the eldest, Thomas, joined the 7th Royal Fusiliers, fought at Alma and Inkerman and served through the Indian Mutiny. The second, Henry, passed through Sandhurst before joining the Rifle Brigade, fighting at Alma, Inkerman and Balaclava before being killed in an attack on Russian positions in 1854. George was the third son: the fourth, Richard, also served in the Rifle Brigade. George attended a preparatory school and then Eton College before becoming a naval cadet in 1848, two years older than usual, aged sixteen. The choice of a naval career was made by George himself, rather than his family. Other students reported him to be a quick learner with a wide breadth of knowledge, whether because of his natural ability or his longer period of education before joining the Navy[1] George was described as 'a tall lanky lad nearly six feet high, full of spirits and fond of a lark'[2]\n\nNaval training at this time took place on board ship, and having obtained a nomination and passing the modest exams, he was posted to HMS Wellesley in spring 1848. Wellesley (Captain George Goldsmith under Amiral the Earl of Dundonald) was then at Plymouth preparing to leave as flagship of the North American Station. She was a two-decker sailing ship, since steam power was only then being introduced into the navy. At that time, the principal important art to be taught to new recruits was how to handle a sailing ship, though within ten years almost all first class naval ships would be steam powered. He was required to pay his own schoolmaster at the rate of \u00a35 per year. In particular, his mathematics at the start of his training was considered very poor, but at examinations eighteen months later, he came top of the class. Wellesley sailed on 24 March, arriving at Bermuda on 3 May. In correspondence home, he observed that he was seasick, and that the gales caused considerable broken crockery aboard ship. Yet while the gunroom (where the midshipman lived) suffered badly from its broken cups of a different pattern to those used elsewhere on the ship, their hens, much alike with others on board, never became ill or died.[3]\n\nAs a midshipman, Tryon was not an official member of the crew, but a supernumerary, available as spare crew for posting to other ships. He narrowly avoided a posting to Imaum, a hulk lying in Port Royal harbour which needed crew, which would have been a very unpromising start to his career. Although officially posted to that ship, he prevailed upon Lieutenant Cochran (son of Lord Dundonald) to arrange that he would remain on loan to Wellesley. Tryon started to make sketches of the places he visited, which while not very good at the start, improved steadily. In November the ship reached Halifax, where George noted, 'the other day another of our men was murdered here'.[4] Although Wellesly was a sailing ship, it was accompanied by a paddle-wheel steamer: when the wind failed the steamer would tow the sail ship, when the wind blew well the steamer would be towed to save coal.[5]\n\nIn the summer of 1849, Tryon had the chance of joining a tour of the United States, but declined in favour of study, and that he been allowed command of a cutter, which was unusual for a junior cadet. In the summer of 1850, he took the tour, visiting Boston, New York, Washington, where they visited the House of Representatives, were introduced to senior politicians and witnessed a debate over California's requested admission to the Union as a free rather than slave state. He commented on the great welcome given to them once it became known that they were English. He also commented on the absence of beggars in the streets.[6]\n\nWellesley returned to Chatham in June 1851. After leave, Tryon was posted to HMS Vengeance, captained by Lord Edward Russell. Vengeance sailed for the Mediterranean in August 1851. The ship was second fastest of the battleships and frigates (after Phaeton), lending considerable prestige to her crew at a time when sailing ability and speed were still considered all important. Admiral William Robert Mends later said of Tryon, 'He served with me, when I was commander of the Vengeance, for two years as a midshipman, and a better young officer never existed; ever full of energy and zeal. As a boat midshipman and signal midshipman he was unrivalled'.[7] The ship stopped at Alexandria, where Tryon was given ten days leave to visit Cairo, where the party were received as guests of the Pasha. The party were obliged to stay on as guests, missing the sailing of their ship. The consul advised Captain Russell who then joined the party, which had now transformed into a diplomatic mission promoting British plans for a railway from Alexandria to Cairo. Tryon wrote home, explaining the British desire to create a land route to India, and the continuous vying for power in the region between Britain and France. On a trip to Gibraltar, Tryon and others from the ship joined the local foxhunt in a group of around forty (some in red), riding across the rugged and precipitous terrain on local ponies. Vengeance returned to England in 1852, reaching Spithead on Christmas Day.[8]\n\nOn 10 April 1853 she sailed again for the Mediterranean, arriving at Malta early June to join the Mediterranean fleet under vice-admiral James Dundas. The ship had a new commander, George Le Geyt Bowyear, who reported that Tryon was now signal officer. Considerable competition existed between Vengeance and the fleet flagship in manoeuvres, where Vengeance frequently performed best. Part of Tryon's duties included keeping watch on the flagship before exercises, including going out in a boat at night to see what preparations were being made for the following day.[9] The fleet took station in Bashika Bay outside the Dardanelles between June and October, because of the increasing tension with Russia before the Crimean war. In October the fleet moved through the Dardanelles to the Bosphorus and moored at Beikos Bay.[10] On 30 November, the Russian fleet destroyed a squadron of Turkish ships at Sinop, just after Turkey declared war. Britain was not yet at war with Russia, but Vengeance visited Sinop January 1854 and saw the remains of the ships, which had been caught at anchor by the Russians. The British fleet moved into the Black Sea to land troops at Varna and took part in the bombardment of Odessa on 22 April. Cholera broke out through the fleet in August and eighteen died on board Vengeance. The effect varied from ship to ship, with few officers affected: 140 out of 950 died on board the flagship HMS Britannia[11] The ship assisted with the transportation of the army across the Black sea to the Crimea before attending at the Battle of Alma on 20 September. Tryon as signal midshipman was stationed at the main top and so had a good view of the battle in which two of his brothers were taking part.[12]\n\nVengeance was once again offshore anchored in Kasatch Bay with Tryon as signals officer watching events during the Battle of Inkerman. After the battle he joined the Naval Brigade in the trenches and was wounded. Captain Stephen Lushington commanding the Naval Brigade described him as 'a very promising officer'. Tryon arranged the construction of a hut for himself and two other officers from Vengeance, which uniquely boasted glass windows scrounged from the navy.\n\nTryon passed his seamanship examination on 17 March 1854 at which time he was already acting mate. Having started late, he was anxious to obtain promotion as speedily as possible. Promotion above the rank of captain was on the basis of seniority, so it was important to obtain rapid promotion in the lower ranks. He spent only eight months as mate, then six years as Lieutenant and five and a half years as commander, which was one of the fastest rates of promotion at the time.[13] On 21 October Lieutenant Greathead of Britannia was killed, and in November Tryon was promoted to his position, thereby transferring to Britannia. However, he remained ashore as part of the Naval Brigade.[14]\n\nIn January 1855 Britannia's shore party together with those from other ships which had been serving together ashore were all embarked on Vengeance to return to England. Britannia had already departed for England with Admiral Dundas, who had now been replaced as Commander in Chief of the Black Sea fleet by Admiral Sir Edmund Lyons. Tryon took and passed examinations at the Royal naval college Portsmouth and HMS Excellent before returning to a ship. Commander Mends from the Vengeance had now become flag-captain to Admiral Lyons and requested Tryon be appointed to his ship. HMS Royal Albert was a three-decker, steam powered and brand new. Tryon returned to the Black Sea in June. Tryon now acted as Aide-de-camp to the admiral, travelling ashore to report progress in the siege of Sebastopol and later describing the plundering of the town by the victorious armies. He was present at the fall of Kinburn on 17 October 1855 where he was placed in charge of fire-fighting parties. On account of being on duty, he regretfully was unable to liberate any souvenirs for himself. In his letters home he commented on repeated failures by the British and their allies to follow up successes, instead allowing the Russians time to withdraw and regroup.[15]\n\nTryon in 1857, from a miniature by Easton\n\nIn December 1855 Lyons went to Marseilles to attend peace conference for the Crimea, leaving his ship to sail to Malta. While in the Aegean Sea the gland surrounding the propellor shaft failed allowing water to flood into the ship. The bilge pumps could not cope with the flow, but the ship was kept afloat by connecting the cooling water pumps used to condense steam in the engine to the bilge instead of open sea. After use the water was pumped overboard and provided the engine remained running the ship could be kept clear of water. The ship was near the island of Zea, so Captain Mends circled the island through the night until with daylight he was able to beach the ship on a sandy bay. The engines then had to be kept working for four days while a dam was built around the ship to keep out the water and allow repairs to be made. Mends chose Tryon to go to Piraeus to summon help rather than a more senior officer because of his 'marked intelligence'.[16]\n\nThe remainder of Tryon's time on Royal Albert was largely uneventful. In November 1857 he had an attack of rheumatic fever, requiring him to spend time in hospital in Malta, before being granted leave in Italy to recover. He visited Naples, Rome, Florence and Pompeii, where the volcano was unusually active. When the ship went to Gibraltar he visited Cadiz and Seville. His considerations turned to his career, which risked faltering because he was older than other officers and lacked a patron. However, his good reports meant that his name was submitted to Queen Victoria for consideration for appointment to the royal yacht HMY Victoria and Albert II. This carried with it automatic promotion to commander after two years' service. Royal Albert returned to England where in July 1858 she acted as part of the escort for Queen Victoria's visit to Cherbourg to meet the Emperor and Empress of France. The queen's yacht entered and departed the harbour between lines of British warships stationed at the approach. Ashore Tryon came within ten yards of the royal party: the event was celebrated with much firing of guns in salute, fireworks and the lighting up of the ships by lights spread through the rigging and shown at all portholes. Tryon commented that some of the noisiest and most eccentrically dressed attendees where those on the steamer bringing members of the House of Commons.[17]\n\nRoyal Albert paid off on 24 August 1858 and on 4 November he joined Victoria and Albert. Each year one of the two lieutenants on board would be promoted and replaced. For nine months of the year the yacht had little to do and her officers lived on board the Royal George hulk in Portsmouth harbour. At the end of his two years he duly received promotion, leaving with a commendation from Captain J. Denman, 'as an officer of great zeal and promise. His ready resource, active intelligence, sound judgement and good temper, especially qualify him for success in his profession; and I consider it my duty to recommend him strongly to their Lordships as an officer likely to perform any service required of him with ability.'[18]\n\nTryon was placed on half pay after promotion to commander in October 1860. In June 1861 he was selected to become second in command of HMS Warrior, the world's first ocean-going iron-hulled armoured battleship. Warrior was still under construction, so temporarily he was appointed to Fisguard. Warrior's sister ship Black Prince was a year later in entering service, but in November 1862 the two ships carried out speed trials, where Warrior was deemed to be the faster. Although the ships' armour was considered impregnable at the time they were constructed, they immediately instigated an arms race between armour and gun designers which continued up to World War II, where each successive ship had to have more of each to remain ahead. This meant that despite her initial claim to invulnerability, she rapidly became obsolete.[19]\n\nIn March 1863 Warrior acted as escort for Princess Alexandra of Denmark who came to Britain to marry the Prince of Wales. Alexandra was much impressed by the station keeping of the much larger warship, so much so that her signal to the ship, 'Princess is much pleased', was inscribed into the ship's wheel. In the autumn the Channel fleet toured ports around the coast of Britain where Warrior was much admired.[20]\n\nIn July 1864 Tryon was appointed to command HMS Surprise, a 680-ton screw- and sail-propelled gunboat in the Mediterranean. Tryon was given the task of rescuing the British barque Energy, which had run aground on the coast of Sicily seven miles from Pozallo, and had been abandoned. In two days the ship was refloated and taken back to Malta. Admiral Sir Robert Smart, Commander in Chief of the Mediterranean, recommended Tryon and his crew should receive salvage for the ship, and the sum of \u00a3595 was granted to be divided between them. Once again Tryon received a commendation in the Admiral's report. During this time he wrote a report on punishments within the navy, which was forwarded by his commander to the admiralty. He recommended that fines to sailors absent from duty or incapable should be limited to forfeiting pay for the time they failed to carry out their duties, and this was adopted.[21]\n\nIn February 1866 Surprise was visiting the Greek island of Santorini, which is part of the rim of a volcano. The ship witnessed clouds of steam and explosions as a new island 100 yards long and 50 wide had just begun to appear from the seabed a few days earlier. The eruption completely filled a channel through Santorini and then began to encroach on houses on the land. The Surprise visited a number of ports around the Mediterranean, reporting on their facilities for the admiralty. An issue arose as to whether the admiralty should retain control of warehouses at Gibraltar which were then underused. Tryon reported that in the event of war, stores immediately available at Gibraltar might be vitally important to the fleet, and that at such a time it would be virtually impossible to get back storage space relinquished in peace time. He was one of the few at that time to recognise the port's strategic significance for the fleet. Surprise returned to England to pay off at Plymouth sound in April 1866. On arrival, Tryon found waiting his promotion to post-captain on 11 April 1866, which he had achieved by the comparatively early age of 34.[22]\n\nTryon now spent eighteen months away from ships. Aside from time on half pay on leave he attended the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth to study steam technology. In August 1867 while touring Norway on a fishing expedition he received a recall and appointment as 'additional captain' to HMS Octavia. Octavia was the flagship of the East India Station commanded by Commodore Leopold Heath. Tryon was attached to Octavia, but his duties were to act as transport officer at Annesley Bay which was to be used as a staging post for troops and supplies for Sir Robert Napier'sexpedition to Magdala in Abyssinia. Tryon arrived in Bombay on 10 October 1867 where preparations were already underway. 291 transport ships were chartered, mainly from Bombay but some coming from England via the Cape of Good Hope. The advance party went to Zoulla in Annesley Bay in November, described as one of the hottest places on earth. The expedition delivered a fighting force of 4,000 men to Magdala out of total 13,000 soldiers and 60,000 people involved all together. 36,000 animals, mainly for transport, had to be taken to Zoulla. There was no drinking water, so 30,000 tons had to be distilled by the ships steam engines using 8,000 tons of coal in the process, with ships held at anchor with their engines running. Tryon's duties involved early morning meetings ashore with military authorities, days spent unloading and organising ships and evenings spent in preparation for the next. Tryon was commended for his organisational skills and tact in dealing with all the disparate parties and complaining ships' captains. Approximately half his staff was invalided out because of the heat during the six months' stay, with the rest all suffering. When he left he was presented with a scroll recording the appreciation of his efforts by the captains of the transport fleet, and later in England was presented with a specially commissioned dinner service decorated with scenes commemorating the campaign.[23] He was awarded the CB for his services in Abyssinia.[24]\n\nAlthough he continued working as hard as ever throughout the campaign, Tryon's health suffered. He injured his leg while fighting a fire on board one of the ships and on returning to England at first could not walk a modest distance without resting. In April 1869 he married Clementina Heathcote, and had time away from the navy for the next two years. Clementina was the daughter of Gilbert Heathcote (later Baron Aveland) who was a neighbour of the Tryon's and had been a friend since childhood. Their honeymoon was spent at Bulby Hall, home of Clementina's brother the Earl of Ancaster. They then travelled in Europe for three months before renting Tickhill Castle near Doncaster.[25]\n\nIn April 1871 Tryon was appointed private secretary to the First Lord of the Admiralty, George Goschen. The appointment normally went to an experienced captain with ten years' service, whereas Tryon had yet to serve at sea in that rank. The post carried considerable influence, equivalent in practice to that of other Lords of the Admiralty, in advising upon naval appointments. Goschen said of Tryon, \"I had an immensely high opinion not only of his naval knowledge, but of his general savoir faire, rapidity of judgement, decision, extraordinary shrewdness, and great knowledge of men. He was somewhat cynical in his views of human nature but his cynicism was of a good humoured and harmless cast\".[26] A story was related of the admiralty board travelling to Dover to meet the Shah of Persia in 1872. At the railway station it was found they would have to walk some distance through a large crowd. Tryon commented to a friend that he would get one of the admirals to carry his bag for him, which he duly did by asking the admiral to hold his bag while he opened a way through the crowd. Tryon then avoided reclaiming his luggage until they reached their destination.[27]\n\nTryon left the admiralty to take up command of HMS Raleigh which was a new ship under construction. He was attached to the depot ship HMS Pembroke about a month before, until Raleigh was commissioned on 13 January 1874. Tryon took the opportunity to suggest improvements to her final fitting out. After a cruise of Ireland she was attached to the 'Flying Squadron' commanded by Rear Admiral Sir George Granville Randolph. Raleigh proved to be the fastest of the six ships under steam, but still also the second fastest under sail alone, after Immortalite. The squadron set out on a tour to Gibraltar, then South America where at the Falkland Islands officers from the ships hired a schooner to tour around and organised hunting parties across the island. Next they went to South Africa, arriving at the Cape of Good Hope 6 March 1875. There Raleigh took on board Sir Garnet Wolesley and his staff to transport them to Natal. The remainder of the squadron returned to the Mediterranean, where Raleigh joined them later. At Gibraltar Randolph was replaced by Rear Admiral Rowley Lambert and the whole squadron was ordered to go to Bombay, to attend the Prince of Wales who would shortly be making a tour of India.[28]\n\nTryon showed concern for the well being of his men and the better ordering of the navy: before Raleigh had left England, thirty men had deserted from the ship, and more took the opportunity to escape all ships of the squadron at Montevideo. Tryon wrote a memo to the admiralty recommending that the penalties for desertion should be reduced, suggesting that a number of those deserting were of little use to the navy and should be let go, while others who were good seamen, but who had some urgent personal reason why they had deserted, were afraid to return later because of the severe penalties. He also instituted a programme of weighing his men and ensuring they got enough food, noting that if, as frequently happened on board ship, the men weighed less by the end of a tour than at the start, then likely their strength and fitness was reduced too. He instituted a 'dry canteen' on board to try to improve their diet.[29]\n\nTravelling to the cape a man fell overboard in high seas. Tryon had to make the difficult decision whether to try to rescue him, because any small boat risked sinking taking her crew down also. However, the man was seen to be swimming strongly, so the ship was halted and boat launched to rescue him. The boat got away well, though was sucked back under the stern of the ship before breaking free. The ship then had to manoeuvre under sail, tacking as best she could to follow the boat while keeping it on the safe side for recovery. All went well, and Tryon received congratulations from the other captains for his skill in carrying out the rescue.[30]\n\nThe squadron arrived in Bombay shortly before the Prince, who was travelling on HMS Serapis and HMY Osborne, and a number of grand events took place. On one evening a dinner was arranged for the Prince in the Caves of Elephanta, on an island near Bombay. The ships were arranged around the approach with illuminations and fireworks brought from England. As the prince's ship approached, rockets were set off, one or two hundred at a time. One of Raleigh's sails caught fire, but preparations had been made in anticipation that something would catch fire in the rigging, and it was soon put out. As Raleigh was the only ship fast enough to keep up with Serapis and Osborne, Tryon then accompanied the royal progress to Goa, Bepore, and Colombo where the party disembarked for a tour of Ceylon. Raleigh was required to accommodate all the newspaper correspondents who wished to accompany the prince. The royal party rejoined at Madras to travel to Calcutta, where Raleigh had to leave the party being too big to navigate the Hoogly. Raleigh rejoined once more at Bombay for the return trip to England via the Suez canal, setting out 13 March 1876. Now she was required to accommodate gifts given to the prince, including two tigers, a leopard, a number of birds and smaller animals, which occupied the space previously taken by the journalists. The remainder of the Flying Squadron left for China. The royal party arrived at Portsmouth 11 May and were met at the Needles by the princess of Wales. The whole party proceeded through the Solent with an elephant standing on each of the paddleboxes on Osborne.[31]\n\nRaleigh was refitted and sent to join the Mediterranean squadron, where tension was once again rising with Turkey and Russia. In autumn 1876 Tryon was at Bashika Bay where he had been twenty two years before. He noted the improved health of the sailors this time, which he ascribed to the fact that fresh water was now produced on board ship rather than having to be brought aboard. The political tension came to nothing, and the tour was highlighted by escort duty to the Duchess of Edinburgh aboard the Russian Imperial yacht, hunting trips and visits to places of interest. In June 1877 Tryon was replaced by Captain Jago as commander of Raleigh after a tour of three and a half years and returned home.[32]\n\nFrom June 1877 to October 1878, Tryon remained In England. In January 1878 he was appointed to a committee set up to revise the general signal book. President of the committee was Rear-admiral Hope, other members were Captain Philip Colomb, Captain Walter Kerr, Commanders Bruce and Romilly. Colomb and Tryon represented divergent views on signalling, but all members of the committee were experts in the field while Kerr and Hope held the balance.[33]\n\nOn 1 October 1878, Tryon was appointed to HMS Monarch of the Mediterranean fleet under Admiral Geoffrey Hornby, joining her at Artaki in the Sea of Marmora on 18 November. The British were concerned to protect the Bulair peninsula from Russian advances and had stationed ships at Gallipoli and in the Gulf of Xeros so as to have artillery commanding possible approaches. The main part of the British fleet stayed in the eastern part of the Sea of Marmora during the crisis.[34]\n\nTryon was required to sit on the court of enquiry into the explosion of a gun on board HMS Thunderer. On 2 January 1879 while carrying out target practice in the Gulf of Ismid, one of the guns burst killing seven men and injuring thirty-six. This was of considerable concern since similar guns were used by many ships. It was eventually concluded that the muzzle-loading gun had been double loaded, which produced exactly the same result when tested on another gun. In the summer of 1879 Monarch cruised the Levant, visiting various places were Tryon would land, both for pleasure but also seeking useful information. Britain had just acquired Cyprus, which it was intended to develop into a base for 10,000 troops and a resort, but of which Tryon was skeptical because of its poor climate and lack of a good harbour. In his travels he discovered deposits of coal at Ayas in the Gulf of Scanderoon, and was responsible for organising the transport of Marble statues from Aleppo for the British Museum. In March 1880 Hornby was replaced as commander of the fleet by Admiral Sir Beauchamp Seymour who in the summer sent Monarch and Thunderer to attend the launching of the battleship Italia by the King of Italy at Naples. Tryon was commended by the king for his handling of the British ships.[35]\n\nIn May 1881 Tryon was sent as senior officer with a group of ships to patrol the coast of Tunisia. Although there was no war, France was concerned about events in Tunisia and the French gunboat Leopold searched two British schooners looking for gunpowder. This was a breach of international law and might have escalated into a serious incident, but Tryon handled the matter with tact. He suggested to the senior French officer, Captain Rieunnier, that perhaps a mistake had been made. The French apologised and explained the commander of Leopold had misunderstood his instructions.[36]\n\nA more serious incident took place when the region of Sfax in Tunisia rose in revolt against French intervention. The revolt was started by a local artillery commander, who was called upon to produce his troops in support of the French, but in fact despite receiving pay for the men, had none. To divert attention, he organised a local demonstration against the French. This led to other foreign nationals fleeing the region, although it was only the French who were affected. Local Bedawin then took up the revolt which grew out of control, although order and respect for foreign property in the town was maintained by a local leader, Camoum. The French sent ships and then a fleet to bombard the town, and eventually troops which landed to occupy it on 16 July. After order was restored, the French set up a commission of enquiry to investigate claims for damages and invited the British and Italians each to appoint a representative. Tryon was chosen to represent the British on the commission which first met 29 August. The Commission sat for six weeks, by which time the evidence submitted already indicated strongly that damage to property and looting had been carried out by the French troops, at which point the commission was suddenly dissolved. The British official position was one of neutrality, and in effect allowing the French to do what they wanted. This placed Tryon in a delicate position that while he confirmed the views of locals that the French had caused much of the problems and intended to take control of the region, Britain would do nothing to intervene. He was instructed to send reports directly to the admiralty and foreign office, rather than to his commander Admiral Seymour. Monarch spent much of a six-month period at anchor off Tunisia in temperatures of 80-90 degrees Fahrenheit, without any leave being permitted, which made the task an uncomfortable one for all concerned. Although the warship was not required, the Foreign office specifically requested that Tryon should remain for as long as possible.[37] Tryon was commended for his handling of the affair by Earl Granville from the foreign office, the Lords of the Admiralty and by the French Government.[38]\n\nMonarch was paid off at Malta in January 1882, and the crew returned to England on board Tamar.[39]\n\nTryon had four months leave before being appointed Permanent Secretary to the Admiralty. This post, in charge of a civilian staff, was sometimes given to serving officers and sometimes civilians. Tryon demonstrated great powers of persuasion and an ability to get his way in an argument without offending. His appointment was initially temporary, following the sudden death of the previous appointee, but he proved a great success. One of his most significant contributions was in advancing proposals for the creation of a naval intelligence committee, whose duties would be to collect together all available intelligence both from naval officers and from the army intelligence department. Those first appointed to the committee were Mr Hoste from the civilian establishment and Commander William Hall.[40] The role of Permanent Secretary included many invitations to social engagements, receptions banquets and dinners. Tryon's guiding rule in choosing which invitations to accept was to seek out people who might have useful information. He stated that he learnt something from everybody.[41]\n\nIn 1884 Tryon was promoted to rear admiral and placed in command of the Australian Station. He left England on 4 December 1884 on board the P&O steamer Indus, arriving on board his new flagship Nelson in Sydney 22 January 1885. The growing importance of the Australian colonies (at that time separate colonies under the crown rather than united under one Australian government) meant that the squadron was becoming more important also, so now an admiral was appointed to replace the previous commander, Commodore Erskine. Tryon's political and social skills were considered important for the role, which involved negotiations with the Australian colonies for financing a fast cruiser squadron in the region.[42]\n\nConflicting interests also existed within Australia, particularly in the northern colony of Queensland, where plantation owners sought to expand their holdings on the northern coastlands using imported cheap native labour. Local 'white' labourers objected to this as it undercut their wages and prospects and the government also had some objections, preferring to establish a pattern of smaller farms operated by resident owners, rather than absentee landlords creating vast estates. Part of the squadron's duties included patrolling the waters between Queensland and the islands of New Guinea to prevent kidnapping and human trafficking of native labourers to supply new plantations. The South East corner of New Guinea around Port Moresby had only been annexed as a British protectorate the previous year (1884) by Commodore Erskine on behalf of Queen Victoria. The Germans had similarly claimed an area in the north-east corner of the island, and France was using New Caledonia as a penal colony. The convicts would from time to time escape to Australia where they would cause difficulties.[43]\n\nIn spring 1885 tension had been growing between Britain and Russia because of the Penjdeh incident in Afghanistan. This raised considerable concern in Australia of possible Russian raids on shipping, which could not be prevented by the small Australian squadron. The effect was to concentrate minds on the formation of a larger squadron financed by the colonies. Following orders from the admiralty, Tryon argued the case that defence might best be achieved by a single strong squadron free to move around the whole area, rather than smaller squadrons paid for and attached to individual colonies. That local land forces could be provided to defend individual ports against raids, but that the best way of providing trained and up to date crews and ships for a naval force was to give the task to the Royal Navy rather than forming local ones. Colonies differed in their views on what was best, in particular New Zealand was concerned that part of the force ought permanently to be based at Auckland because of its distance from most of the others. Tryon proposed that a system of indemnity should be introduced, so that anyone whose property was destroyed resisting an attack would be compensated by the colonies as a whole, accepting that local resistance wherever it might occur was to the benefit of all. After the Russian scare had subsided, Tryon continued to assist with the development of land fortifications for major towns, emphasising the importance of preparedness in advance of any military situation arising, and of giving the impression of a united defence even if this had not in reality been entirely achieved.[44]\n\nAn initial proposal was made by Tryon for a squadron of six 'Archer' class ships of 1800 tons armed with 6 in guns capable of 16 knots costing around \u00a3105,000 each, accompanied by eight 150-ton torpedo boats priced around \u00a353,000. However, at this time the French commenced a construction programme for 19 knot cruisers, so the plans were revised. Eventually five 2,500-ton cruisers capable of 19 knots designed by Sir William Henry White were constructed in England and sent to the Australian squadron. A conference of colonial delegates was held in London in 1887 to discuss Australian defence, to which Tryon was not invited despite the large part he had played thus far in negotiations on behalf of the admiralty and British government. His exclusion from the conference prompted him to request to be relieved from the Australian command after two years rather than the normal term of three.[45]\n\nTryon as admiral was provided with a house by the New South Wales government on the north shore of Sydney harbour, near the navy anchorages. This was undergoing refurbishment at the time he took command, but once installed his time as admiral was well remembered for the programme of social engagements and hospitality given to Sydney society as part of his duties. He took an interest in furthering development of the supply depot and repair dock in Sydney harbour, and the construction of a new sailor's home to replace an existing one which had become overtaken by demand. Partly because of the unfinished accommodation, and the war scare, his wife did not accompany him to Australia.[46]\n\nMuch of Tryon's time was spent at Sydney, but he visited Victoria, Queensland and twice visited New Zealand in the summers (southern hemisphere) of 85-86 and 86-87. On the first visit he attempted to reassure ministers that their defence was better served by one combined squadron rather than dispersed ships, even if some were posted there. He also visited the beautiful hot lakes and terraces of the volcanic region, shortly before it was wiped back to blackened ash by an earthquake and eruption.[47]\n\nIn April 1887 he handed command of the squadron to rear-admiral Henry Fairfax before travelling to Melbourne and thence by P&O steamer Ballarat to England. He was commended and thanked by the lords of the admiralty for his efforts in encouraging adoption of a combined defensive position by the Australian colonies, and contributed in some part to encouraging the states to work increasingly closer together and move towards unification. Shortly after returning home he was awarded the KCB for his services in Australia in the Jubilee honours list.[48]\n\nTryon stood for parliament in a by-election held on 1 July 1887 in the Spalding division of Lincolnshire. He was hampered in the campaign by having only reached England on 5 June and the constituency on the 14th, and by an injured leg acquired during the voyage requiring him to walk with a stick. He stood on a platform of maintaining the union of Britain with Ireland, which mirrored his own views from his Australian experience that the colonies there should unite. It was his intention also to speak on colonial issues in the House once elected. He was aided by unionists from northern Ireland who came to plead their cause, but opposed by a local candidate who had had two years to become known and had his own supporting Parnellites from Ireland to tell their own stories. At the time there was a considerable depression in agriculture, and this was the deciding issue in this rural constituency. Farmers sided with Tryon and the unionist government, while their workers who had suffered pay cuts and lost jobs, causing many to emigrate or move away splitting up families, sided with his Liberal opponent, Halley Stewart.[49][50] Halley Stewart received 5110 votes against Tryon's 4363. At the previous election in 1886 Stewart had lost by 288 votes. It was considered that Tryon's lack of agricultural background had counted against him.[51]\n\nFrom June 1887 to April 1888 Tryon remained on half pay enjoying time with his family. He suffered a broken arm in a fall from a stable attic while visiting his mother in law, Lady Willoughby de Eresby at Grimsthorpe Castle in Lincolnshire. Tryon showed considerable regard for his mother in law, who died not long afterwards in November 1888.[52]\n\nIn April 1888 he was appointed Admiral Superintendent of Reserves, which included the coastguard service, and became chairman of a committee on coastguard buildings.[53]\n\nIn 1891 he chaired a committee on naval reserves, where he expressed his views on the importance of cooperation between merchant shipping and the navy in times of war.[53] The committee consisted of Allen Young, C. Rivers Wilson, Thomas Ismay, and two or three naval officers. The committee noted that although traditionally the merchant navy was looked upon as a pool of trained sailors which could be called upon in wartime, the proportion of non-British sailors in British ships was steadily increasing. Moreover, that modern warships were becoming increasingly different from merchant ships, so it was felt a man could not simply be called from a merchantman and placed into a naval ship. A system of reserves was required where men received training and a retainer fee to be ready for war service when needed. Tryon felt it important that men from the reserve should wear the same uniform as regular sailors, so that no sense of inferiority might attach to them. Tryon had been impressed by the quality of merchant sailors serving in the Naval Brigade in Crimea.[54]\n\nTryon was consulted on the best design for new battleships following the naval defence act of 1889, which had authorised seventy new ships including ten battleships. Tryon favoured a high freeboard to allow ships to perform well in rough seas, guns at least twenty-three feet above the waterline, and a minimum length of 380 feet. He opposed the very large 100-ton guns which had become available at that time, preferring smaller guns of around 45 tons. This proved a correct choice, as the 100-ton guns which did enter service proved unsuccessful. Their introduction had been experimental and in part in reaction to other navies trying such guns.[55]\n\nIn 1885 a programme of annual naval manoeuvres had begun, where the British navy would divide into opposing fleets and conduct war exercises as near as possible to real conditions which might be experienced. By 1888 this had become a source of great interest to the public and the navy alike. The navy encouraged attention, allowing reporters on board during manoeuvres, believing that the publicity furthered their campaigns for greater funding.[56] That year, the intention was to test the practicality of blockading an enemy fleet in its home ports when the ships concerned were modern iron and steam vessels rather than traditional sailing ships. The idea was that a superior fleet, taking the role of the British, would surprise an inferior enemy force before it could sail from two home ports.\n\nTryon commanded the 'Achill' fleet based in Berehaven in Bantry Bay on the south-west coast of Ireland and Lough Swilly on the north coast. Tryon chose the nickname 'Achill admiral' for himself, from the name of a small island midway between the two bases. All Irish territory was considered friendly to 'Achill', and hostile to their opponents. The 'Achill' fleet consisted of 19 major warships and 12 first class torpedo boats. The major warships were as follows:[57]\n\nOpposing was Vice Admiral John K.E. Baird, whose force of 26 major warships and 12 first class torpedo boats represented the British fleet. England, Scotland and Wales were considered friendly to the 'British' fleet and hostile to 'Achill'.[57] Baird's major warships consisted of:\n\nHostilities commenced on 24 July. Tryon was of the view at the outset that there was little he could do directly against the superior force, so he set about attempting to wear down his enemy, using feints and false alarms to reduce their attentiveness. They had to continuously maintain station outside his ports, while he and his men enjoyed the Irish countryside. They suffered the difficulties of communicating while at sea whereas Tryon could simply use the telegraph. Albert Markham commanded the blockader's squadron of cruisers, whose job was to stay close to Berehaven, watch for ship movements and attack anyone who emerged, while the ironclads stayed further away.[58]\n\nOn the first day Tryon feinted, pretending to send out two torpedo boats and battleship, causing Markham to scurry to intercept. For the next two days he did nothing, except fire occasional shots at Markham's ships from shore batteries if they came too close. On the fourth evening he sent out two torpedo boats showing no lights with the intention of starting more false alarms. The boats did well, returning with four enemy torpedo boats which they had surprised and captured. By 3 August the enemy had been at sea for nine days and aside from the tedium of their wait would now be low on coal. Tryon ordered all ships to be ready to sail at 9.30pm on 3 August and for all the upper parts of the ships to be painted black. The fastest ships, Warspite, Iris, Severn, Volage, Cossack and three torpedo boats left via the western entrance staying as close to the shore as they dared, heading for the Atlantic. Meanwhile Tryon took the remaining larger ships through the eastern entrance, giving the appearance of an attempt to break through the blockading ships. Within an hour the Hercules was spotted and great excitement broke out amongst the blockaders. Tryon immediately turned around and headed back to port. Just as they returned to anchor, flares at sea showed that too late one blockader had spotted Tryon's escaping ships.[59]\n\nAdmiral Fitzroy at Lough Swilley with Rodney and two other ships also broke the blockade on 4 August, joining Tryon's ships which had escaped.\n\nBaird, on discovering the breakout, had no choice but to break off the failed blockade. He sent his deputy Admiral Rowley to guard Liverpool, while himself proceeding to coal at Portland ready to defend the Thames and London. Fitzroy took his ships north around Scotland 'destroying' Aberdeen, Grimsby, Newcastle and the ships berthed there, before returning to Lough Swilley. Meanwhile, Tryon no longer blockaded at Berehaven took his slower ships to Lough Swilley where they joined the similar slow ships from Fitzroy's command, before proceeding to attack Liverpool. He claimed Belleisle, which had been guarding the port as captured and 'destroyed' the shipping there. Baird regrouped his forces to defend London, leaving Tryon in command of the English Channel and most of the rest of the British coast.[57][60]\n\nTryon was criticised by officers from the enemy fleet that had not given due warning to merchant vessels before attacking, nor allowed their crews time to escape as required under international law. He had bombarded defenceless cities and 'killed' civilians, and it was claimed used false flags and captured signalling equipment. He was praised by the admiralty for his handling of the fleet, but his opponents in turn felt criticised for their failings. The public felt comforted that such an officer was really on the British side.[61]\n\nThe conclusion drawn from the exercise was the serious danger posed by even a small force of fast ships, and the need for considerably greater forces than those available in the exercise to successfully impose a blockade. The official report of events was prepared by Admirals Sir William Dowell, Sir Vesey Hamilton and Sir Frederick Richards. They stressed the importance to Britain of an effective navy to protect its waters and the much greater importance of this to the country as a whole than the army. If control of the seas around Britain could be maintained, then no army was needed to defend it. Whereas, if control was lost then no army however great would surface to defend it, because it must starve deprived of shipping. This contributed to the adoption of the principle that the British navy must equal the combined force of the other two greatest world navies.[62]\n\nShortly after the manoeuvres, Tryon wrote a fictional history of the 'Achill' campaign, describing the opening events of the war against a foreign naval power which had just been played out in the exercise, then going on with an account of what happened next. This incorporated and publicised many of his own views about how national defence should be conducted, without mentioning any real countries which might take offence.[63]\n\nThe manoeuvres of 1889 were similar to the previous year, with an enemy fleet based at Queenstown and Berehaven, but this time Baird commanded the 'enemy' fleet and Tryon the 'British'. Baird's task was to launch raids against Britain, and while Tryon would not attempt to blockade his enemy in port, it was his task to prevent the raiding. Both admirals had slow flagships, while their second in commands, Tracey for Tryon's fleet and D'Arcy Irvine for Baird, had fast ships. Tryon's headquarters was at Milford Haven but he moved to Falmouth during the exercise.[64]\n\nBaird attempted to send his fast battleships by different routes to regroup off Dover and then attack the Thames. Tryon succeeded in intercepting him, and was deemed to capture Camperdown, Immortalite and Hero. Tryon also managed to seal up Baird's slower ships in Queenstown. After the abortive attack on London, D'Arcy-Irvine with Anson and Collingwood was sent to raid the north of Scotland where he ransomed Aberdeen and Edinburgh. He was now joined by the slower but powerful Inflexible and proceeded down the east coast of Britain, bombarding Newcastle and Sunderland. On the day before the exercise was to end they moved on to Scarborough, but were surprised in hazy weather by Tracey with Rodney, Howe, Ajax and three cruisers. D'Arcy Irvine was obliged to retreat, but the slow Inflexible was surrounded and captured. Collingwood was caught next, but D'Arcy-Irvine managed to escape with Anson.[65]\n\nThe four umpires (Admirals Bowden-Smith and Morant accompanying Baird, Lord Charles Scott and Sir R. Molyneux with Tryon) found that Tryon had succeeded in his objective as well as might be done with the inadequate ships at his disposal, but that had the exercise continued his capture of enemy ships would have given him an advantage. Baird's raid on the Thames had failed, but with six fast cruisers he had managed to capture ninety-five merchant ships around the British coast. The cruisers had been chased by Tryon's ships several times, but were able to run and continue elsewhere.[66]\n\nTryon and Tracey commanded a 'British' fleet a little larger than their enemy commanded by Sir Michael Seymour and Admiral Robinson. Seymour's task was to remain at sea interfering with British trade but avoiding action, while Tryon was to attempt to chase him down. Seymour was given 24 hours start from Berehaven before Tryon was allowed to sail from English ports, although Tryon was allowed to use cruisers to scout his movements. Obtaining supplies of coal for the ships was the limiting factor, and Seymour overcame this difficulty by arranging colliers to meet his fleet at sea. Thus he picked a spot off the trade routes he wished to attack, and stayed there. Tryon succeeded in defending the Channel, but could not prevent Seymour intercepting merchant ships 300 miles away at sea.[67] Tryon commented that although this year's exercises were on the face of it the least exciting, they had still been the most useful of the three.\n\nThe exercises were not without critics as to whether they accurately represented real war situations. A number of captains were criticised for not taking the rules sufficiently seriously, continuing to fight their ships after they should have considered themselves sunk or captured. Vice-Admiral Batsch of the German navy published a critique of the 88 and 89 exercises, arguing that the objectives of the admirals had become reversed from those of a real war, where coastal raids would follow opportunistically to main fleet engagements, rather than being main aims in themselves. In the '89 exercise the enemy fleet started at a 25% disadvantage, but steady attrition during raiding reduced it to 43% the size of the British fleet, so that any chance of a decisive victory steadily diminished. The result of dividing forces had been that they were picked off one by one. Nevertheless, the exercises served to improve morale for the sailors concerned, and to raise considerable interest amongst the general public in naval affairs.[68]\n\nTryon became a strong supporter of the idea that in time of war there should be a national insurance scheme for merchant vessels. He was concerned that in the event of war insurance rates for vessels against loss by enemy action would immediately become impossibly high, so that merchant ships would simply stop trading with Britain, even if the numbers being lost were relatively small. This would be disastrous for the country, so it would be far better for the government to implement its own scheme to reimburse owners for lost cargoes and ships.[69]\n\nTryon claimed that he had first heard of the idea from Admiral Hopkins. Having become convinced of its importance he wrote an article explaining the idea in the 'United Service Magazine' of May 1890 as well as having pamphlets printed which he distributed to those likely to be interested. The idea gave rise to an immense amount of discussion nationally. The Times came out against the idea of government intervention in commerce, arguing the important issue was not who paid for sunk ships, but having a navy capable of preventing them being sunk. It argued that the scheme was a diversion from this main objective and would simply provide a false sense of security.[70] Many smaller papers took the same line, as did a number of naval officers including Lord Charles Beresford. Their concern was chiefly that a government might see the scheme as an alternative to a larger navy.[71]\n\nTryon responded in a letter to The Times on 19 September arguing the need for the scheme whatever the size of the navy. The Chairman of P&O, Sir Thomas Sutherland, wrote arguing that a scheme ought to be considered and prepared in peace time, but no legislation should be passed or anything else done unless an actual war situation arose. When it did, it might turn out that insurance would be available privately or that shipowners might benefit from higher wartime profits. He questioned whether any amount of compensation would convince owners to send ships if they expected them to be lost. Sir Arthur Forwood (shipowner and later parliamentary secretary to the Admiralty) wrote observing that during the American war of Independence shipowners had responded to the initial insurance rate of 20% by building better ships and choosing their routes carefully, with the results that the best blockade runners could then obtain lower premiums. He added that they bought cotton at 2d, and sold it at 2s, a 1000% profit if they succeeded. Retired admiral Alfred Chatfield, then a city businessman, observed that the scheme would disproportionately favour smaller and slower ships at the greatest risk of enemy capture, perhaps even making them more profitable and thus discouraging the construction of safer but more expensive replacements. Others, such as Thomas Ismay of the White Star line were in favour of the plan, arguing it would prevent many ships simply being laid up in safety for the duration of hostilities, and suggesting that many who were relying on flying under a neutral flag which theoretically guaranteed safety, were liable for a nasty surprise. Tryon himself argued that the scheme might only be needed at the onset of hostility until shippers had become accustomed to the safest ways of maintaining trade.[72]\n\nIn August 1891 Tryon was appointed to command the Mediterranean station, the most powerful force within the Royal Navy at that time. The Mediterranean was recognised as the sea area then of greatest importance to Britain. Tryon left England on 11 September on board HMS Nile meeting the first division of the fleet under its previous commander, vice admiral Sir Anthony Hoskins, on board the flagship HMS Victoria at Gibraltar. Tryon assumed command on 21 September. The division toured Port Mahon, Madelena, Naples, Malta, Nauplia and Milo, where they were joined by the second division under rear-admiral Lord Walter Kerr. The fleet then exercised until November, when they again divided: the first division wintering at Malta while the second remained in the Levant.[73]\n\nEach year the fleet held a regatta where officers and men from different ships competed against each other, training for months in advance. It was customary for the admiral to provide a cup to be presented to the winner of a sailing race between bona fide service boats of all types. In November 1891 the regatta took place at Suda Bay and the winner of 'the admiral's cup' from 60 boats was Lieutenant Evan-Thomas. The race was initially instituted by admiral Phipps Hornby in 1872 with the intention of encouraging skill in sailing, which was becoming a sideline in a steam powered navy.[74]\n\nOne of Tryon's first actions as commander was to write a memorandum to all commanders requesting that they draw to his attention anything which might concern the fleet or British interests which they might discover but which in the ordinary way they would not pass on.[75] After the grounding of HMS Howe in 1892 he circulated a memorandum to the fleet concerning safe manoeuvring of ships, particularly in difficult circumstances. Of particular relevance to later events, the memorandum warned commanders that their first duty was always to safeguard their ship (at least, during times of peace) and that should they ever be faced with an order which for some reason might be dangerous, then they should attempt to carry out the intention of the order, but only if it could be done without risk to their ship or others.[76]\n\nAs at other stations, the commander of the fleet was provided with a residence and expected to entertain society. The admiral's house in the Strada Mezzodi was one of the smaller auberges, originally palaces for the Knights of St. John. The small size was a disadvantage for the lavish parties which Tryon and his wife were expected to host, but the parties held in the winters of 1891-92 and 92-93 were very popular. The admiral was the second most important person on the island, after the Governor. The admiral's other duties, aside from running the fleet, included corresponding with the director of Naval Intelligence, Captain Cyprian Bridge, passing on and receiving intelligence reports. This required replying personally to information received from his officers: he was described as a fast writer but with difficult handwriting. The correspondence covered everything from problems the Italian were having with their carrier pigeons to details of international law.[77]\n\nAdmiral Tryon was concerned that the normal system of signalling between ships would become unworkable in real war conditions. To send a signal required hoisting a flag sequence, waiting for all ships to raise flags to confirm they had seen and understood, and then lowering the initial flags to signal everyone to carry it out. The signals book had grown to hundreds of pages describing the many possible flag combinations and virtually no one knew them all. In a real battle this process might take too much time, or might be entirely impossible if enemy fire had destroyed the masts from which the flags must fly, or smoke made them impossible to read. Instead, Tryon proposed a simple signal, using the letter-flags T and A, which simply instructed captains to follow their leader. Other flag signals might be used additionally as circumstances allowed, but once the initial order was given, the ships simply had to follow the movements of their leaders. A few, basic, single flag signals were designated for particular movements, which would simply be flown without needing acknowledgement.[78] This was a radical departure from contemporary practice, in which all movements were precisely signalled from the flagship and acknowledged by their recipients. Opinion was fiercely divided about it, for instance The Timesnewspaper considered it \"unsound in theory and perilous in practice\",[citation needed] whilst Rear-Admiral William Kennedy on the East Indies station declared following experiments with it that \"the officers commanding thoroughly appreciated the idea which would be invaluable in time of war\".[citation needed]\n\nHMS Victoria, flagship of the Mediterranean fleet, was in retrospect an unlucky ship. In January 1892 she was at Platea in Greece carrying out exercises firing torpedoes, when she ran aground on Snipe Point. Tryon was not on board, as the fleet ships went individually for torpedo practice. This involved firing torpedoes while traveling at speed, but was made more difficult by the need to conduct the practices in shallow waters so the torpedoes could be recovered. Captain Bourke had sent men to mark the point where the waters shallowed to ten fathoms, but they had misjudged the buoy's proper position. Victoria ran aground at nine knots, leaving the fore end of the ship seven feet higher out of the water than normal, while the stern still had 66 feet of water beneath it. The ship was secured with anchors and unsuccessful attempts were made by the nearby torpedo-depot ship to tow her free. Tryon arrived from Malta on board the Surprise, having given orders for the dockyard tug Sampson, Phaeton, Edinburgh, Dreadnought, Scout and Humber to come to assist. Victoria was refloated six days after grounding, towed by Dreadnought and Edinburgh, with the tug lashed to her side and her own engines running astern. 1200 tons had been removed from the ship to lighten her. Victoria returned to Malta for repairs to torn plates along her bottom.[79]\n\nVictoria was repaired in time for the fleet summer cruise in May. The first division sailed from Malta on 31 May for Nauplia, where they were joined by the second division commanded by rear-admiral Markham. The entire fleet then exercised in the Aegean Sea. In June Tryon visited the Sultan of Turkey in Constantinople. Warships were not permitted in the Dardanelles, so the party went on the admiral's steam yacht, Surprise. Captains Bourke from Victoria, Noel from Nile and Wilson from Sans Pareil accompanied Tryon, who received the Medjidie of the first class from the Sultan. They rejoined the fleet at Vourlah Bay on 25 June. In July the fleet divided, with the second division going to the Levant while Tryon and the first division went to Sicily, where the volcano Mount Etna was erupting. The tour continued around Italian and Spanish ports with a fortnight at Gibraltar, before returning to Malta on 29 September. On 10 October once again they set out to Nauplia to meet the second division.[80]\n\nThe annual regatta pulling races were held at Salonica, and the sailing races at Lemnos. An additional prize was presented by the Vali of Salonica to the winners of the all-comers race. Tryon directed that the junior midshipman should accept the prize for the winners, on the grounds that he would most likely live longest to remember the event. The sailing events took place at Moudros bay, a large expanse of water largely surrounded by low lying land providing good sailing conditions, and plenty of opportunity for officers to go ashore and hunt local game. On this occasion the admiral's cup was won by Commander Tate of the Colossus. The two divisions now separated again, the first with Tryon returning to Malta for the winter.[81]\n\nOn 22 June 1893, the fleet was on exercises when Tryon's flagship, HMS Victoria, sank following a bizarre order from him which brought it in collision with the flagship of his second in command, Rear Admiral Sir Albert Markham. Tryon went down with his ship, his last reported words being \"It is all my fault\". Tryon was considered by many of his contemporaries to be a supremely competent yet radical officer,[82] but with a strong and sometimes overbearing personality. This manner was felt to be a contributory cause to the accident. For instance, an article in Society Journal Talk in July 1893 (following the accident) said, \"Much has been said about George Tryon's charm of manner, and the rest of it, but in truth he was, at any rate when officially engaged, a very brusque and dictatorial man. Unfortunately he was a 'viewy' man too, a man of theories...\"[83]\n\nIt is a tragic irony that the TA system which should have been Tryon's legacy was discredited as a result of, and unfairly blamed for, a disaster which took place when the Fleet was being directed according to the routine Naval Signals Book.[citation needed]"}

{"text":"The Brooklyn Navy Yard has a proud history that goes back to the Revolutionary War. Some of America's most famous ships were built there. After it was decommissioned in 1966, however, the old shipyard was abandoned and allowed to decay, its once-bustling buildings reclaimed by weeds and weather.\n\nBut now it is coming back to life. Now you can find trendy cafes, art studios and furniture makers where there were once offices, machine shops and officers' quarters. These businesses will soon be joined by a movie studio. There are also more mundane businesses, such as a plumbing supplier and a trucking company. More than 250 businesses, employing nearly 6,000 people, have opened in what is now the Brooklyn Navy Yard Industrial Park.\n\nAt the height of production in World War II, 70,000 people \u2014 including many young Rosie the Riveters \u2014 worked in the Brooklyn Navy Yard producing war ships and materiel. World War II era ships were built with generous amounts of fire-retardant asbestos insulation, which no doubt saved many ships and their crews from death by fire. At the time it wasn't understood that asbestos exposure causes mesothelioma cancer, and today retired shipyard workers are succumbing to the lethal disease, the last casualties of the war.\n\nBut more about the history of the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The venerable shipyard is located on a section of the East River called Wallabout Bay. During the American Revolution, the British kept captured revolutionaries on prison ships moored in Wallabout Bay.\n\nIn 1781, a man named John Jackson, with his brothers, built the first shipyard in the area. In 1781, the brothers received a commission from the U.S. government to build a 28-gun frigate, the USS Adams. This first ship of war built on the site of the Brooklyn Navy Yard would be lost in the War of 1812, burned by her crew to avoid capture by the British.\n\nThe United States government bought the shipyard in 1801 and put it to use building ships for the Navy. America's first steam-powered warships were built there. In 1857, the USS Niagara was launched from the Yard and would be put to work laying the first trans-Atlantic telegraph cable.\n\nIn 1862, USS Monitor, the U.S. Navy's first ironclad warship, was outfitted and commissioned at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Built in nearby Greenhaven, the Monitor left Brooklyn under tow to the waters off Confederate Virginia, where she battled another ironclad, CSS Virginia. This was the first naval battle in history between ironclad ships. Neither ship clearly prevailed over the other.\n\nThe battleship USS Maine was launched from the Brooklyn Navy Yard in 1889, although she was not commissioned until 1895. In 1895 an explosion caused her to sink in Havana Harbor; the sinking would touch off the Spanish-American War.\n\nThe USS Arizona was launched from the Brooklyn Navy Yard in 1915. The Arizona was sunk in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.\n\nTwo of World War II's most famous battleships, the USS Iowa and the USS Missouri, were launched from the Brooklyn Navy Yard in 1942 and 1944, respectively. On August 29, 1945, the Iowa and the Missouri sailed into Tokyo Bay to prepare for Japan's surrender. That ceremony took place on Missouri's deck on September 2.\n\nDuring the Korean War the aircraft super carriers USS Saratoga, USS Constellation, and USS Independence were built in the Brooklyn Navy Yard.\n\nThe city of New York bought the decommissioned shipyard in 1967 and tried to attract auto manufacturers to build factories in the Yard, but got no takers. It's drydocks also went unleased. A private shipbuilder operated there for a while but closed its doors in 1979. But in recent years businesses have finally been persuaded to build there, and the Brooklyn Navy Yard \u2014 without the shipbuilding \u2014 is coming back to life."}

The holds of the \"John Barry\" contained over $300 million in silver bullion. The 7200-ton ship broke into two pieces and sank to a depth of 8500 feet, more than one and a half miles. For 45 years the great depth of the wreck ruled out any thoughts of salvage. However, in 1989 salvage rights were acquired by Sheikh Ahmed Farid al Aulaqi who engaged the French International Maritime Institute and Jean Roux, leader of the team which recovered artefacts from the \"Titanic\". Roux and his team have developed technology which has resulted in an operation of deep sea recovery never before possible. In this book, the story of the \"USS John Barry\" is recreated with the help of living survivors, including one of the German U-boat officers, and the intricate politics behind the US government's decision to send $300 million of silver to Bombay is investigated"}

Probably most people have heard of Horatio Hornblower the hero created by C S Forester but over the years many more authors and their heroes have appeared and these pages will summarise them under the Authors A-Z. You can also find them via the Book Title Index. If you want to chat about them or read additional reviews and comments not on this site why not join my Historic Naval Fiction forum.\n\nI aim to provide details of all the naval fiction novels from the age of sail that have been written, not just the Royal Navy but the US Navy, the Bombay Marine and others. Many of these books are now out of print so I have also brought links to purchase them together in the online store. Please browse the various sections for further information.

This is where you will find news and listings of naval fiction set after the Age of Sail.\n\nIn their book Jack Tar: Life in Nelson's Navy Roy & Lesley Adkins explored the life of the ordinary sailor in the ships of the Napoleonic wars, but what was life like when they were ashore and for their families left behind? Naval fiction books will often depict the shore life of officers and their servants but the life of the ordinary seaman is usually restricted to visiting inns and brothels. In their new book, Eavesdropping on Jane Austen's England: How Our Ancestors Lived Two Centuries Ago Roy & Lesley explore what life ashore was really like for all sections of society.\n\nThe book makes extensive use of personal letters, diaries and manuscripts of the time, Jane Austen's being the most famous, to provide a detailed view of the everyday existence and experiences of the population. To explore the differences between the classes the book is divided into sections which explore each aspect such as \"Wedding Bells\", \"Sermons and Superstitions\" and \"Leisure and Pleasure\". The world of young people is also covered in \"Toddler to Teenager\"\n\nThis is an authoritative work which gave me a real insight into the day to day lives that produced and supported our seamen or the vast industries that provided the ships and supplies.

{"text":"Valhalla - Primos 1871\n\nA ship's figurehead represents many things. The quality and design of the figurehead will reflect the wealth, taste and extravagance of the ship's owner. It is the final flourish in the long and expensive business of building a ship, so a gloriously worked, lavishly decorated figurehead would have been something of a public proclamation of status and pride by the owner.\n\nThe model for the figurehead may have been a wife, daughter, son, mistress or even the owner, himself. To the sailor, a figurehead was also an object of pride and also a key part of basic ship identification. Emerging from the fleshpots of Bombay, let us say, an illiterate sailor, whose critical faculties had been blunted by strong drink, might have struggled to pick out his own vessel amongst the hundreds of ships jostling together in the busy port. A figurehead was an obvious and vital source of recognition, in what might otherwise be a rather bewildering situation.\n\nA figurehead might also have some superstitious value, bringing good luck on each voyage, keeping watch over the seas, the ship and the crew. If ever this talismanic power was present in a figurehead, then it was never more so than in that of the Primos. The Primos was an iron barque, built in Sunderland in 1869. She was registered in Bilbao and was carried sugar from Havana to Falmouth and Greenock. On 24th June 1871, around dawn, the Primos struck the Seven Stones. She began to sink fast. One boat drifted away empty, before the captain and four of the 12 crew launched a second. This swiftly capsized in the heavy seas, drowning the occupants.\n\nIn some 12 minutes from first striking the rocks, the Primos slid under the waves, taking with her the entire crew. One man remained alive. Vincenzo Defilice, alone in the dark, heaving sea, had managed to grab hold of a hen coop, that had been swept off the decks of the Primos. For two hours he clung tenaciously to this makeshift raft. Shaking violently with cold and battered by the waves, Delifice began to wonder if a quicker end might be favourable, perhaps he should release his grip on the coop and allow the sea to claim him. Just as his numb fingers began to loosen their hold, something in the water caught his eye. There he could see, torn from the bow of his ship, the figurehead of the Primos.\n\nDelifice later stated, apparently, that once he saw the serene face of the figurehead, he knew that he would be saved. Letting go of the hen coop, he swam over to his buoyant saviour. For another hour, he hugged the figurehead until one the ship's boats drifted by. After rowing himself to English Island Neck by St Maritn's, he was rescued bu pilots. The figurehead washed up on St Martin's, having saved the life of Vincenzo Delifice.\n\nValhalla and the figurehead collection are to be found in the AbbeyGardens on Tresco.

{"text":"Rare Musical Find \u2013 Main Title to \"A Night to Remember\"\n\nThe score was written by acclaimed British composer William Alwyn for the 1958 film A Night to Remember, based on the best-selling book by Walter Lord. Rather than construct fictional characters to tell the story, Lord carefully interviewed as many Titanic survivors as he could, preserving their memories for posterity and laying out an accurate, minute-by-minute narrative of the disaster.\n\nSaid David McCullough of Walter Lord as a writing mentor: \"He was one of the most generous and kind-hearted men I've ever known, and when I had stars in my eyes and wanted to become a writer, he was a great help. I'll always be indebted to him.\"\n\nThe movie was arguably the biggest British film of the 1950s, and today is regarded as a masterpiece of historical filmmaking.\n\nA Night to Remember (complete) \u2013 Part 1 of 13. In reality, the Titanic was never christened. She launched on May 31, 1911 at Harland & Wolff shipyards in Belfast with large crowds in attendance but no ceremony.

{"text":"I'm 6 years old and have heard of the titanic but I don't know what it is. What is it?\n\nI hate to do this, sport, but some really bad information is about to come your way. Have you ever been on a ship before? Or, like, do you know someone with a boat? You do? Great! Imagine if that boat crashed into something and sank. That'd suck, right? You wouldn't be able to ride on the boat anymore because it'd be underwater. Yes, you could totally still hang out on the boat if it was also a submarine but I'm just talking about a normal boat here. Pay attention.\n\nNow The Titanic is like if you imagine that instead of a little dingy the boat is probably about a thousand times bigger and when it sinks people can't get to land. Since conditions are so terrible the passengers don't even drown when submerged in water, the frigid abyss of the open sea will slowly cause them to freeze until they agonisingly die. Around two thousand people did, actually.\n\nOh, you haven't had death explained to you yet? I\u2026 gosh\u2026 you've opened up a can of worms, kid. Immediately after we're done I'm recommending your parents book you in to a couple sessions of counselling. The worst thing that could happen is that you get a little afraid of the sea. You shouldn't, The Titanic was a bit rare in that safety checks that are standard today weren't considered as necessary. They didn't test the ship out a lot before taking on passengers and there weren't nearly enough lifeboats. If anything you should be more scared about lazy health and safety officials or a lack of stringent regulations; someone not doing their job properly in that profession could kill you every day.\n\nNo, gosh, stop crying, you'll be alright. I mean, you like fish, right? They come from the sea! Have you had fish fingers? Yeah? You know, Captain Birdseye? No, Captain Birdseye wasn't the Captain of The Titanic; that was Captain Edward Smith. Where's he now? Well\u2026 Uh, we don't know, actually. His body was never recovered.\n\nYou know, you're asking some really difficult questions here.\n\nIt'd be easy for me to disregard everything you're saying and sugar-coat the answers, but the story of the titanic is truly depressing and grandly important. It's about not overextending your reach and being careful to consider every possibility or else something could go horribly wrong. To try and protect you from the reality of this tale is to do you a disservice and it's important to be aware of humanity's past mistakes so that as a species we know better than to screw up if we're in a position of responsibility.\n\nYou don't want a job with responsibility? I can understand that. I recommend spending a few years as a student.\n\n\"It's not that I hate the idea of a man shielding himself from a torrent of white powder with an umbrella, it's that we've been using the same idea to sell dandruff shampoo for over 30 years, where's your sense of passion for your work? Where's that same glisten in your eye from your first day pitching jingles for botted water?\n\n\"The ad is completely different, now, terry\"\n\n\"It's not completely different, the only change is that last time it wasn't an umbrella he was protecting himself with, he was using a bouquet of flowers to symbolise the new spring fragrance collection and the time before that he was literally shielding himself with a suit of armour and a massive shield\"\n\n\"Say what you want about that ad campaign, but you can't deny the sales boost we saw on St.George's day, anyway, if you can come up with a way to signify that you can protect yourself from dandruff using our shampoo without combining the overwrought metaphor of an avalanche and a man avoiding being encased in a coffin of snow by dispatching it with any method of easily explainable and obvious choice of item, then be my guest, pitch it and we'll do that instead\"\n\nTerry picked up the phone and scheduled a delivery of fake snow and umbrellas for next week.\n\nCity rage as man-fan flaunts naughty bumper\n\nStockport resident Sarah Smith (39) has been arrested for driving a car emblazoned with an anti Man-City slogan.Police responded to complaints that the hate-monger was circling the Eastlands prominently displaying a terrible message for city fans. The sticker's words, too terrible to repeat, offended match day attendees to the point where police were called to the scene.\n\nSarah now faces a maximum fine of \u00a31000 and 6 months in prison; her Husband Graham (40), a Man-City fan himself, calls the situation \"regrettable\" but adds: \"that's just the way she's always been\".Those offended directly by the offensive language have called for stricter punishment, Team Manager Roberto Mancini has held a press conference today where he berated the woman for an hour and a half.\n\nAlternatives to the horrible message have been mandated by her legal defense for now. The current replacement reads: \"Everyone should play a nice game and get along \", though other suggestions such as \"I sure do love football regardless of who's playing\" and \"people who play sports sure are handsome\" were offered.\n\nLent is like a game show where you don't have to answer any questions and there's no prize at the end. You're not even on camera for most of the time and the television company doesn't pay your travel expenses. Phillip Schofield sits you down in front of a mildly empty audience and tells you that you're not allowed to eat any chocolate. Then you have to wait.\n\nAssuming you don't stand up at any point, go to the shops and buy a mint aero bar, you've successfully won the game show and you can tell everyone at your office how glamorous it was. They'll probably ask when it's televised and you'll say you didn't really think to ask. Then they'll go back to what they were doing before without ever giving it another thought.\n\nNow that Lent has lost a lot of its religious connotations it might as well just be a yearly celebration of low stakes gambling and self imposed masochism. When you inevitably fail to keep up with your sacrifice, usually just from forgetfulness and not from any lack of willpower, the only real loss is your ability to be smug for a little while after. As a huge proponent of being smug I've taken the opportunity to cut out all needless bodily toxins like caffeine and\u2026 well not booze, obviously.\n\nWithout any kind of higher power bearing down on you; lent is just you seeing if you can do without something. If you can; it obviously wasn't a big enough part of your character, if you can't; well perhaps you could try next year?\n\nI propose a high stakes Lent where every member of the world's population has their tongue removed for the charity of their choice and they're only allowed to get it back if they can go a full 40 days without trying to communicate using hand signals. I'm sure this would lead to a massive rise in the planet's mutes, but whoever managed to complete the task would be able to brag about it without any interruption from someone with more important topics.\n\n100 Word Fiction 5\n\nIt's too much work.

Ideally I'd love to pick up a lady that's already been pre-made cynical and jaded, but they'll always pass me by in favour of somebody less complicated. I wish I could settle and appreciate her boring interests and lack of reverence for quality film or music; we'd go jogging on Saturday afternoons and re-watch the same six romantic comedies. There's just nothing like a person you can converse with about how unhappy you both are together.\n\n100 Word Fiction 4\n\nThere's no clearly definitive start; it spreads differently in everyone and isn't always apparent until testing, but the majority of cases began showing up two months ago.

She asked:\n\n\"This the man I need to see?\".\n\nHer accent was all over the eastern seaboard and her clothes were bringing the flapper movement back like a catapulted boomerang. I wished I'd cleaned up before she came in. I wished I'd cleaned up any day at all but the job will always come first. I took a smoke from the pack in my pocket and told her:\n\n\"That depends what for, doll.\"\n\nI motioned she should take a seat on the other side of my desk and she complied, letting a little slack out of her dress as she lowered herself down and crossed her legs over. She took a cigarette and I leant over the table to light it as I charred my own.\n\n\"It's my brother\" she says as she wrings her hands along the top of her purse. \"He's in with a bad crowd and they ain't on the up an' up. We was supposed ta' meet this afternoon but he bailed on me. I haven't seen him since Tuesday. I'm worried.\"\n\nI took a long inhale. This type of news isn't uncommon and it's likely that the kid's in a lot of trouble. I did my best to not lead this bearcat onto my line of thought. \"Ma'am, I could beat gums all day but I know what the score is.

I saunter up to the counter and ask the kid there about Joey.\n\nHe pauses, collects himself and shouts \"Hey, Paulie, we got a guy here askin' around for Joey, what do I tell 'em?\"\n\nA rotund man walks out of a corner office wringing his hands clean of mechanical grease. He laughs \"You tell him we ain't never heard of a Joey and you sit your five dollar ass down before I make change\".\n\nHe's visibly angry. I met my mark.\n\nI tell him \"I'm no beat-cop; I ain't lookin' to make trouble for you. I just know a lady who lost her brother. He's in some bad stuff with some bad people and I wondered if you know about it.\" This isn't exactly a cup of camomile tea for the large man. He points a finger and yells \"You come into my store, togged to the bricks and ask if I'm up to no good? You haven't even taken your hat off\".\n\nA bat flies from the now open office door. This was unexpected for me but apparently exactly the opposite of what the rounded man wanted. He let out a continuous stream of \"No\"s as he swiped at the ceiling trying to catch the thing. I ask \"Have I come in at the wrong time?\" The kid tells me \"Nah, we just got the shipment of Yarsagumba in and not all of it was ready yet\".\n\nThe man stops dead in his tracks, stomps over to the kid and smacks him over the head so hard his nose hits the counter and lets out a horrifying crack. The kid is in pain and runs into the next room attempting to block off a streaming rush of claret.\n\n\"You heard none of that\" the man says.\n\nI tell him \"I'm afraid I did, and I might not be the last person to hear it today if I don't find out what happened to Joey\"."}
{"text":"Canadian Shipping Between the Wars\n\nThe period between the outbreak of the first world war and the coming of the Department of Transport in 1936 was marked by many fluctuations in our shipping, due to war, depression and changes in technical methods. The great fleet of wooden sailing ships which had reached a high point in the last quarter of the nineteenth century had disappeared without replacement by more modern tonnage, and the rump of a merchant marine which struggled on through the depression years was hardly significant in terms of the twentieth. Some modernization, and a government shipbuilding programme, had resulted from the demands of the great war of 1914-18, but the bubble of the boom years which followed the armistice had collapsed to reveal a chilling air of depression. The Canadian ship owner was barely able to survive the economic blizzard which swept the trading world.\n\nThe Canadian Government Merchant Marine. Typical of first world war standard ships, the Canadian Exporter is launched from the yard of J. Coughlan & Sons at Vancouver on December 27, 1919. The CGMM house-flag, with a beaver in the hoist, is draped over the starboard forecastle rail. (Public Archives)\n\nThe upswing of government wartime shipping was too late for the war and obsolete for the peace. Early in 1918, because of the serious Allied merchant ship losses by enemy submarines, the Canadian Government decided to create, own and operate a strong merchant marine. In all, 63 cargo ships, in six standard types, were especially built and three more were added from existing Hudson Bay services of the Department of Railways and Canals. These 66 ships, with a total deadweight of 391,212 tons, were collectively known as the Canadian Government Merchant Marine, a company incorporated in 1918 by Dominion letters patent.\n\nThe first of the fleet was the Canadian Voyageur, delivered to the company by Canadian Vickers in February 1919. Deliveries continued through 1919 and 1920, and regular sailings were established to the United Kingdom, Australia, South America and the West Indies, and in the home coastal trade. It was an ambitious undertaking, almost without parallel in the democratic countries; unfortunately, about the time that the full strength of 66 ships was delivered in 1921, there was a decided drop in freight rates and the first two years of operation, which had been encouraging, were followed by a recession. Inward cargoes dropped in volume and voyage losses became inevitable.\n\nTriple expansion engine. Built by Collingwood Shipbuilding and Engineering Co. in 1907, this engine is similar to that fitted in the Chesterfield, Grenville and other Upper Lake ships. It differs from the usual marine design in that the piston rod and crosshead are separate. The connecting rod has a wedge-type upper end. Note the thrust block with adjustable collars. (Public Archives)\n\nAs a result of this decline it was decided to dispose of the smaller and less profitable ships and, by 1933, the company had rationalized its services; the South American run was dropped in 1921, revived for a while after 1928, and was finally discontinued in 1933. The Atlantic service to United Kingdom ports ran into difficulties in 1929 when the obsolete tonnage employed could no longer compete with post war ships of more modern design, and this too had to be abandoned. The last operation of the Canadian Government Merchant Marine, the Australia and New Zealand trade, was maintained continuously till 1936, in which year the company disposed of its remaining vessels.\n\nFinancially, this direct involvement by government in the highly competitive and sensitive business of shipping was a disaster. The original investment by the Dominion had been approximately 80 million dollars; on winding up the company, the total operating loss, exclusive of interest on capital or depreciation, stood in the region of 82 millions. On the credit side, there had been created a body of experienced merchant marine officers and men. The country would be glad of these men on the outbreak of the 1939 war but in the years of depression, as in other maritime nations, there was a surplus of mates and masters, and the crews quarters of many Canadian steamers were occupied by certificated officers. Many left the sea never to return.\n\nOn the technical side of the shipping scene, the changes which had been wrought over the years of war and depression were equally great, but new ships were costly to acquire in a country which was barely emerging from an economy based on natural resources as distinct from industrial production. Wood had given way to steel, sail had disappeared except in the fishing fleet, and even there the slender topmasts of the schooners were being housed for all time with the advent of the diesel engine. In ocean freighters the compound steam engine had long ago been superseded by the more economical triple expansion and, unaware of the impending revolution of the large oil engine, sea transportation had settled down to the scotch boiler and the three-crank triple, immensely reliable and easy to run. Unfortunately, this era of distinctly finite improvement typified by ships fitted with \"three legs and a pump\", as engineers called the usual engine room arrangement of the triple expansion engine, had changed the once challenging philosophy of the old marine engineer to a religion of unquestioning faith which, for many years to come, would survive at the expense of progress.\n\nThere had, of course, been brilliant minds at work on the frontiers of sea technology, but the developments of the water tube boiler, the marine steam turbine, and the change from coal to oil, were to influence the high speed passenger liner and the needs of naval constructors more than they would the board rooms of ordinary ship owners. The eight knot steam tramp of the nineties had risen only to the ten knot well deck steamer of the first quarter of the twentieth century, plodding along, as she would through two wars and innumerable ocean convoys, to dominate the commercial fleets of the world.\n\nMeanwhile, the unrelenting sea, changeless in character but ever changing in its manifestations, was teaching hard lessons to those who would learn, and shipping men of all nations were probing for answers to a number of uneasy questions. The faith and vision inherited from the great practical engineers of the Victorian era had been disturbed by a continuing presence of disaster at sea by stranding, collision and fire, culminating in the icy tragedy of the Titanic in 1912 and the Empress of Ireland disaster of 1914. The design of ships, particularly as to their subdivision by watertight bulkheads, and the provision of enough lifeboats, had become the subject of international review and, interrupted only by the war, many improvements would be made towards the safety of life at sea.\n\nShipping on the Pacific coast, 1920. The five-masted auxiliary schooner Esquimalt is seen passing the CGS Estevan. Two three-masted schooners are in the background.\n\nNot only had ships become bigger, but the sea traffic of the world was changing in response to a more sophisticated age and the ways of a whole generation of seamen trained in the ways of masts and yards had to be adapted to a new discipline; unrealized by many at the time, the change from sail to power would eventually provide an equally great, but entirely different, challenge to the ingenuity of man. Some problems, such as the stowage of bulk cargoes, which had been familiar to Canadian shippers of lumber and grain from earliest days, remained in more acute form. The carriage of timber deck cargoes, piled high above the rail to the detriment of seaworthiness and the encumbrance of working arrangements, had caused much loss of life among seamen in the seventies, and now the filling of steel ships with loose grain poured down from giant elevators required fresh safeguards, by way of shifting boards and ventilation, to mitigate a serious hazard to the steam tramps of the Western Ocean.\n\nWith the advent of the oil business a new risk faced shipping. Before Confederation such oil as was required for lamps and lubrication was shipped in wooden barrels, a highly dangerous procedure which was but little understood. Following the Pennsylvania oil strike of 1859, and the subsequent discovery of oil in the Caspian Baku area in 1873, the trade began to increase and better methods of shipment were urgently needed. Mineral oil was then shipped in cases instead of barrels, each case containing two five gallon tins, and the case oil trade became a world wide business conducted by many different types of ship. Because these cans were so difficult to dispose of, many under developed countries became littered with rusty metal just as the Arctic is now littered with oil drums. In the decade 1870-80 the first bulk tanks were built into ships; the oil tanker, from this modest beginning, would rise to include the largest vessels in the history of the sea and, in the intervening years, it predicated an entirely new technology for ships and ports.\n\nIn the Great Lakes, the six hundred foot bulk carrier and the package freighter had emerged as specialized ship types, almost unseen by the seamen of the salt oceans to whom the grain elevator and the ore chute of the giant terminals of the inland waters of North America were, as yet, but pictures in the illustrated magazines. Isolated by geography, but immensely practical and forward looking from contact with the heartland of the industrial United States, the big laker was becoming inbred from lack of touch with the outside world of shipping at the very moment when it was making progress by throwing off the shackles of an ultra conservative sea tradition. Today, with the opening of the Seaway, not only has the size of ship increased, but the versatility of shipping is shown in the construction of both lake and ocean ships with results which have been for the betterment of both."}
{"text":"Black Crew of World War II Navy Ship Recognized for Heroism\n\nIt took more than 50 years, but sailors on the only Navy warship in World War II with a black crew have been officially recognized for heroism in escorting support ships to England in 1944 through 90-mile-an-hour winds and 40-foot waves.\n\nA convoy commander recommended that every one of the 160 men on the ship, the destroyer-escort Mason, receive letters of commendation. After making their first landfall in England, the sailors had braved harsh weather to quickly weld cracks that threatened to tear their ship apart, then returned to sea to guide other ships to harbor. But the recommendation was lost in channels and then in naval archives.\n\nThe Mason was the only vessel in the segregated, World War II Navy in which blacks were something other than cooks and waiters. The officers on the ship were white.\n\nYears later, the commander's letter of recommendation was found by Mary Pat Kelly, who wrote a book and helped make a film about the ship, which led the Navy to present crew members with official commendations on Thursday.\n\n\"I feel so happy about the whole thing,\" James Graham, who was a radio operator, said at the ceremony at the Navy Memorial here.\n\nNavy Secretary John H. Dalton presented the honors to Mr. Graham, 72, and 11 other crew members. \"It's an important part of Navy history that needs to be told,\" Mr. Dalton said.\n\nMr. Graham, of Roosevelt, L.I., retired from television repair work in 1986 and has since devoted himself to telling the story of the Mason. \"It was a fact of just doing our duty,\" he said. \"In those days, black guys were always proving themselves.\"\n\nThe crew's actions and determination helped remove racial barriers and push the military toward full integration, according to the documentary film, \"Proudly We Served: The Men of the U.S.S. Mason,\" which was shown here and is being broadcast on PBS.\n\nIn the book of the same title, published this month by the Naval Institute Press, crew members recalled the stormy convoy and the prejudice and discrimination they faced.\n\nCharles Divers of Maywood, Ill., said he believed white officers had quashed the commendation because the Mason's crew was black. \"They didn't want us to do too good,\" said Mr. Divers, 73, a retired electrician who was a quartermaster. \"I'm just glad I was able to live long enough to receive this thing.\"\n\nMs. Kelly said, \"The men never knew that they had been recommended.\"\n\nShe added that these men's mettle at sea persuasively argued against the military's relegating blacks to menial tasks, like cooking and serving food. \"The fact that they not only did it, but were so successful, was important because history had forgotten the Mason,\" she said. \"This was like a chapter of history forgotten.\" -------------------- Two Centuries of Service\n\nWASHINGTON, Feb. 18 (Reuters) -- President Clinton joined black veterans on Friday night to commemorate 220 years of African-American service in the United States military, hailing them as \"nothing more or nothing less than what you are: American heroes.\"\n\nRetired Gen.

{"text":"Description:In 1978, Jerald J. Kline, a sport diver, \"discovered\" what he believed was a sunken Spanish galleon in the waters of Biscayne National Monument and soon commenced salvage operations thereon. After the Park Service became aware of his activities, the fight for ownership of the wreck and associated artifacts ended up in court. Following a protracted legal battle, the wreck was awarded to the National Park Service whose archaeologists had foreknowledge of the site.\n\nThe court case prompted an in-depth investigation into the identity of the sunken vessel. Based on British admiralty records, the Park Service's Submerged Resources Center teamed with experts from Florida State University suspected that the ship was likely the H.M.S. Fowey. Recovery of several artifacts from the site, starting in the summer of 1983, confirmed their hunch. The salvaged artifacts, including a 9-pounder cannon, are now displayed at the National Park Service's Southeast Archaeological Center in Tallahassee.\n\nEven before the positive identification of the wreck, the loss of the H.M.S. Fowey in the area was widely known. In fact, the treacherous reef just north of the wreck had been christened Fowey Rocks in honor of the vessel, and in 1878 the Fowey Rocks Lighthouse had been placed atop the reef to prevent similar tragedies. The H.M.S. Fowey was an impressive fifth-rate man-of-war with a twenty-gun lower deck battery of 18-pounder cannons, and a twenty-two-gun upper deck battery of 9-pounder cannons. However, the vessel's wooden hull was no match for the rocky teeth of Florida's reef when it ran aground in 1748.\n\nThe Cape Florida Lighthouse was built at the southern end of Key Biscayne in 1825 to mark the northern end of the Florida reefs. After the construction of offshore lighthouses had been successfully demonstrated at several locations along the Florida Keys, the Lighthouse Board decided to replace the Cape Florida Lighthouse with one positioned directly on the reefs it was to mark. Accordingly, a circular area on Fowey Rocks with a radius of 235 \u00bd feet was deeded by the state of Florida to the federal government on January 6, 1875. A contract for the foundation was awarded to Paulding and Kemble of Cold Spring, New York, while the material for the superstructure was to be supplied by Pusey, Jones & Company of Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nSolider Key, a small island four miles due east of the construction site, served as the project headquarters. From there, workers and materials were lightered to the reef, where the first task was to build a platform, which would rest twelve feet above the water on mangrove piles that were driven into the reef. Next, divers leveled off the reef before nine foundation piles, eight forming an octagon and one in the center, were passed through large disks and sunk eleven feet into the coral.\n\nWhile the tower was being constructed on the foundation, the crew lived atop the wooden platform or on the incomplete lighthouse. During this time, the workers witnessed two dramatic demonstrations of why a lighthouse was needed on the reef. One evening, the men had a near-death experience when the steamer Arakanapka rammed the reef just a few yards from the tower. The remains of this misguided steamer can still be seen in the shallows northwest of the lighthouse. Several weeks later, a second vessel, the Carondelet paid an unannounced nocturnal visit to the construction site. The Carondelet was more fortunate than the Arakanapka, for after jettisoning the majority of its cargo, it was able to float off the reef.\n\nThe two-story keeper's dwelling, built inside the tower's octagonal exoskeleton, was completed on April 30, 1878. The upper story had a Mansard roof, matching the pitch of the supporting piles. Inside the dwelling's iron shell, wooden walls divided the space into eight commodious rooms. From the dwelling, a spiral staircase, wrapped in an iron skin, snaked upwards to the service room. Additional stairs led from the service room to the watch room, and finally up to the lantern room where the first-order Fresnel lens, manufactured in Paris by the company of Henry Lepaute in 1876, was installed on May 25, 1878.\n\nWhen the Fowey Rocks Lighthouse was complete, Cape Florida Lighthouse was discontinued and keepers John and Simeon Frow were transferred from Cape Florida to Fowey Rocks, where they lit the lamps for the first time on June 15, 1878. John served as the head keeper, and his father, Simeon, as an assistant. One of Simeon's two daughters married Robert H. Thompson, who would serve at Fowey Rocks with his father-in-law during 1879 and 1880.\n\nThe Frow's had been aboard their new home for almost three months when hurricane season brought the new tower its first major test of structural integrity. As recorded by John Frow, the hurricane raged for three days loosening the glass panes in the lantern room and \"allowing the rain into the lantern constantly.\" Frow also wrote, \"Eastern door of dwelling so strained one of the panels is almost off and starting to tear the other off.\"\nThe hurricane inflicted moderate damage to the tower, but one can only wonder what affect spending three days imprisoned in a metal hut surrounded by howling wind and raging seas had on the keepers.\n\nThe third participant in this ordeal was assistant keeper Jefferson Browne, who had just graduated from high school. Browne was overworked during the hurricane and subsequent cleanup and repair work, but later, he found ample time to study the law books he had brought along. After fifteen months of lighthouse service and personal law studies, Browne enrolled at the University of Iowa Law School. Two years later, he had completed his degree, passed the bar exams in both Iowa and Florida, and was elected attorney for Key West and Monroe County. Browne would eventually become the Chief Justice of the Florida Supreme Court, and can be seen swearing in Governor Sidney J. Catts in this video clip.\n\nKen Roper served as engineman and lightkeeper at Fowey Rocks from 1965 to 1967, during which time a fourteen-foot square dock was built adjacent to the tower. The coastguardsmen were forbidden to swim while on duty at the lighthouse. After seeing an 18-foot shark swim by the tower, Ken had to agree that this was a wise regulation. The Fowey Rocks Lighthouse received its power via an electrical line that ran to the University of Miami's Sea Lab on Biscayne Bay. In case power ever failed, it was Ken's responsibility to keep the backup generators in readiness.\n\n\"I dreaded the evening and mornings when I had to climb the spiral stairs to the top of the light to turn on or turn off the light,\" recalls Ken. \"I think I remember there were 77 steps round and round to get up there. In those days I could run that in a minute or so flat. The reason the switch was up there was so it could be verified that the light was working.\"\n\nOn Ken's days off, a captain would come by and take him fishing for king mackerel and lobster. With a monthly salary of $107, a bedroom with an ocean view, and a steady supply of mackerel steaks and lobster, life on Fowey Rocks wasn't too bad.\n\nThe lighthouse was manned by faithful keepers until the Coast Guard removed its personnel from Fowey Rocks in 1974, following automation of the light. A decade later, the first-order Fresnel lens was removed and placed on display at the Coast Guard's National Aids to Navigation School in Yorktown, VA. Red panels have been added to the lantern room to warn mariners of the reefs located north and south of the tower.\n\nOn October 2, 2012, Fowey Rocks Lighthouse was transferred from the Coast Guard to Biscayne National Park under the authority of the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act (NHLPA) of 2000. Due to the location of the lighthouse within the park, the National Park Service exercised its option under NHLPA to request a direct transfer.\n\nAlthough the Fowey Rocks Lighthouse must occasionally endure the buffeting of a hurricane, and, sadly, the attacks of vandals, with the tower now standing in the protected waters of Biscayne National Park, its future should be secure.\n\nReferences\n\nLighthouses of the Florida Keys, Love Dean, 1998.\n\nLocation:\nLocated 6.5 miles southeast of the southern end of Key Biscayne.

{"text":"Battlecruiser\n\nA battlecruiser is a large gunship, larger than a cruiser and of comparable size to a battleship. It has the size and guns of a battleship but substantially thinner armor, the weight saving allowing more powerful engines to be fitted to give it greater speed than a battleship.\n\nThe idea was that the big guns would allow it to take out destroyers, cruisers, and other smaller ships before the battlecruiser ever got into the range of their smaller guns or torpedoes, while its speed would enable it to escape enemy battleships. The idea was mainly conceived by Admiral Jackie Fisher.\n\nThe first battlecruisers were HMS Inflexible, HMS Invincible and HMS Indomitable, all completed in 1908. They had armor 6 or 7 inches thick along the side of the hull and over the gunhouses, whereas a comparable battleship of the period had armor 11 or 12 inches thick. Originally known as battle cruisers, these ships had a top speed of 26 knots compared to 20 - 21 knots for a contemporary battleship. They were armed with 12 inch (305 mm) guns, just like battleships. Soon after the British, the Germans started building their own battlecruisers, the first was SMS Von der Tann of 1911. They had only 11 inch (280 mm) guns, but were better armoured than the British ones.\n\nIn practice, the original battlecruiser concept largely failed.\n\nIt was successful at the Battle of the Falkland Islands during World War I when the British battlecruisers HMS Inflexible and HMS Invincible annihilated a German cruiser squadron commanded by Admiral Maximilian Graf Von Spee. But as soon as battlecruisers encountered enemy battlecruisers (or more modern battleships which could keep up with them), their speed advantage would be lost and the thin armor then meant that they were highly vulnerable to their opponent's gunfire. They were also at grave risk if they tried to take on battleships.\n\nAt the Battle of Jutland two years later, the British battlecruisers engaged the German battlecruisers and battleships before the arrival of the battleships of the British Grand Fleet, with disastrous results. The battlecruisers HMS Invincible , HMS Queen Mary and HMS Indefatigable exploded with the loss of all but a handful of their crews, and HMS Lion only survived by intentionally flooding one of her magazines. The German battlecruisers were better armoured, but SMS Lutzow sunk from the damage, and SMS Seydlitz was heavily damaged. No British or German battleship was sunk during the battle, but one old pre-dreadnought. Thereafter, the Royal Navy de-emphasized battlecruisers. HMS Hood was launched in 1920, and was the last British battlecruiser to be built. Between the wars, it was the biggest warship in the world. Her armour was stronger, than of earlier battlecruisers, but it also proved a fatal weakness, as she exploded and sank in a duel with Bismarck during World War II.\n\nImproved engine technology also worked against the battlecruiser formula. The ultimate limit on ship speed was drag from the water displaced (which increases as a cube of speed) rather than weight, so heavier armor slowed World War II battleships by only a couple of knots over their more lightly armored brethren. As it turned out, however, aircraft carriers made both battleships and battlecruisers largely obsolete.\n\nFact-index.com financially supports the Wikimedia Foundation.

{"text":"It Would Take a Titanic Raft of Flotsam to Float Two Actors\n\nCould Rose and Jack have both survived on the raft? Math says no. Image courtesy of 20th Century Fox\n\nDid plot triumph over physics in the climax of the film \"Titanic?\" Could Jack have shared the raft of flotsam with Rose, or would both actors have sunk beneath the waves?\n\nLet's examine the math calculations for floating this improvised raft, made from a door that broke away from the Titanic.\n\nSetting the Stage and the Goal\n\nThe primary question is whether they sink or float under ideal conditions, but we'll also explore exactly how big the raft would need to be, in order to support 2 people. We set the target of \"floating\" to mean that the total volume of the wood could be just at the water line, but that the people remain dry on top.\n\nThe requirement will be that the weight of the sea water that would be displaced by the entire raft must equal or exceed the weight of the raft, plus any survivors.\n\nWeight, Mass, Density, and Buoyancy via the Archimedes Principle\n\nArchimedes understood volume and displacement: Photo by SpreeTom\n\nNormally, it is easy to measure the weight of an object, whether using a spring-loaded weigh scale or a balance.\n\nThe density of an object is equal to its weight divided by its volume. Again, it is easy to calculate the volume of a regular solid such as a cube, which equals the length times width times height.\n\nThe Greek philosopher Archimedes realized that the volume of water displaced by any fully-submerged object is the same as the volume of the object. Therefore, an irregularly-shaped crown displaces the same volume of water as a cube of the metal from which it was cast.\n\nThe weight of the displaced water equals the volume of water times its density.\n\nIn general, the buoyancy provided by any fluid equals the mass that was displaced, multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity. This translates mass into \"dynes.\" However, the downward force opposed by the buoyancy is also the mass of the object multiplied by gravity.\n\nThis article will, therefore, omit multiplying weights by \"9.8M\/s^2,\" since the acceleration due to gravity will be irrelevant to the question of sinking or floating.\n\nThis leaves a slight error due to the buoyancy of the object in air. This is about 0.08 pounds\/foot^3 or (0.08lb\/2.2lb\/Kg) per (1foot\/3.28M)^3 = .0363636\u2026 Kg\/0.02834M^3 = 1.283Kg\/M^3. Compared to water's density of 1000Kg\/M^3, this error just over 0.1%. That is extremely minor, compared to the assumptions about the type of wood or size of the door we'll be making.\n\nThe Archimedes Principle is that a submerged object's effective weight is reduced by the weight of the displaced fluid. If an object is less dense than the fluid it displaces, it will float, partially submerged.

{"text":"Menu\n\nTitanic Pictures Underwater\n\nTitanic, an infamous example of one of the deadliest ocean liner disasters has been visually illustrated by a number of artists. Historical records are usually based on paintings and illustrations rather than photographs. It was after many years that the idea of discovering the wreck of Titanic was brought up.\n\nTitanic sank in 1912 and it was not until 1985 that a joint American and French expedition led to the recovery of the wrecked ship. The only way to gather first-hand evidence of the incident was to discover the ship itself and photograph what remained. The discovery of the debris let the searchers collect astonishing images of the wrecked ship.\n\nTitanic was broken into pieces\n\nThe most shocking piece of information that the discovery gave was that the ship actually broke into two pieces before sinking to the bottom of the ocean. Pictures of the ship reveal that the ship was majorly split into two pieces that were lying 600 meters apart from each other.\n\nDebris on ocean bed\n\nPictures of the wreck show that around five kilometers of the ocean bed was covered with debris from the ship including daily use items, kitchenware, utensils and furniture etc.\n\nDamage to Titanic's Steel\n\nTitanic pictures under water clearly show metal of the ship being eaten away by underwater microbes. When ships sink, the deposits of salts and wastes from the marine life greatly damage their steel. Titanic photos also show this damage that has made some areas of the ship hardly recognizable.\n\nBow of Titanic\n\nPictures of Titanic's bow make a popular image as it is one of the most easily identifiable areas of the ship. Titanic had a signature bow which greatly added to its aesthetic beauty. Due to the delayed discovery of the ship, the pictures show that the bow was greatly decayed by corrosion.\n\nTitanic's Propeller\n\nTitanic had a huge propeller. The underwater pictures show the propeller torn apart from the rest of the ship and eaten away by microbes.\n\nCollision with iceberg\n\nThe first photos of Titanic that emerged were those of its hull. The pictures depicted that Titanic was indeed damaged due to a collision with an iceberg. Rather than one long gash, the ship was extensively damaged at different places due to the crash. This led to more damage and hence the ship sank in just a few hours.\n\nA faded reminder of glory\n\nTitanic's underwater pictures are a touching reminder of its once glorious form. The bits and pieces of the ship shown in the pictures are like a memorial that takes us back a hundred years to its once magnificent structure. Collecting these pictures was a gruesome task as Titanic wreck rested on the ocean floor three kilometers below the surface. With the passage of time researchers were able to gather hundreds of authentic underwater pictures of Titanic. People now do not need to wonder how the ship looked like as the pictures help recreate what once was the most luxurious passenger liner of all times."}

Its not a very big sub so they can drag it to shallower water where they can escape.\n\nI cant help but recall the line in Hunt for Red October wherein the US Senator speaking to the Soviet Ambassador \"Youve lost another submarine ?\"\n\nUla Jolly\n\n08-05-2005, 11:55 AM\n\nThe submarine was there as part of a naval exercise.\nSeeing as Russia has learned from Kursk, help has already been requested from USA and other countries. I have good hopes of the crew making it out well. :up:\n\nDuncan Idaho\n\n08-05-2005, 12:08 PM\n\nI've been following this since the story broke here. I'm hoping for the best! I'm very impressed that the Russian's asked for assistance. In fact, I'm proud of them for that. The lives of their sailors should be paramount.\n\nI'm not usually a praying man, but I am praying for these sailors, and their families.\n\nSmokinTep\n\n08-05-2005, 12:20 PM\n\nSeems like they will be OK.

I guess Russia didn't want to have another Kursk on their hands.\n\nmy pessimistic view earlier stemmed exactly from what happened in the past - the Kursk incident. Not the same extreme circumstances, obviously, but nonetheless... I was just expecting the Russian govt. to let those poor chaps die. Fortunately they screamed for help this time. I'm glad they'll be ok. :)\n\nType941\n\n08-05-2005, 02:06 It's a no brainer there will be a request for help, because not only will it actually HELP, but also would make others say 'hey look at them, how brave that they asked for help, that's the spirit of partnership'. It's also not a 'fault' of the Russian Navy and in that sense, they don't look so bad as with Kursk.\n\nTo me, the only similarity between the Kursk tragedy and this one is that both are underwater vessels. But that's about it.\n\nProbably such discussions took place many times before, but if a Nato sub was in same position as Kursk, there is no way they'd ask the Russians to help - it's just the whole thing would be handled much more gently PR-wise, but the outcome will be the same - only Nato would act and won't let the Russians near it.\n\nSteamWake\n\n08-05-2005, 02:07 PM\n\nThe russians attempt to attach a \"tow line\" has failed.\n\nThe Americans are rushing to the scene.\n\nThis one has yet to be resolved.\n\nRAM\n\n08-05-2005, 02:15\n\n150 crew lives were lost when the Kursk sank. There was a chance to get them out had foreign assistance arrived on time.\n\nIt didn't arrive there because there was no call for help.\n\nI don't get the Kursk comparison either...this time there are 7 sailors in serious trouble, back then there were 150 lives on danger. I am glad that Russia was reasonable this time. But with the Kurks they blooded their hands because a stupid ego-related decision wich made them think that calling for foreign help was equal to losing face. And in the end they not only lost face in a worse way than they would have, had they asked for help in time, the Kursk crew was lost too.\n\nI don't care a bit about the \"naval secrets\", the egos, or the wishes to save face of a navy which can't even scrap their own rusted nuclear submarines and have to do it with foreign money and assistance because they can't do it on their own. They ask for help and a massive ammount of money to decomission their submarine fleet ,and they don't do it to save their own sailors' lifes?\n\nAny \"naval secrets\" the kursk had on board could be kept secure by an adequate set of security measures. Those \"naval secrets\" are difficult to discover if all you're trying is to rescue a trapped crew anyway.\n\nAnd in any case, I don't give a bloody cent for those \"naval secrets\" if I would have to pay with 150 lives of my nation's navy loyal sailors and officers. Russian government betrayed their own sailors, and basically robbed them of any hope of surviving they had. No naval secret is worth 150 lives, much less today (it's not like norway, UK or USA are going to declare war on the Russian federation tomorrow, isn't it?).\n\nGlad this time the story doesn't repeat itself. I hope those men are rescued alive.\n\nDuncan Idaho\n\n08-05-2005, 02:20 PM\n\nI do, to some extent, 'get' the comparison. Apparently this is a military vessel, and it was involved in military operations at the time of the accident. I would hazard a guess that the sub is manned by military personel. (Although it truly is just a guess).\n\nCan't see why it matters either way, these are humans trapped down there, and they need help. What difference does it make who compares it to what? That's not the point of this issue at all, is it?\n\nRAM\n\n08-05-2005, 02:24 lessonsDuncan Idaho\n\n08-05-2005, 02:28 PMThat's the spirit!

And I agree 100% with you, you merely elaborated on what I and another guy were saying, but expressed in two short sentences. :rock:\n\nType941\n\n08-05-2005, 02:34 If someone wants to kid themselves about the end of cold war, I'm not- at least about its new form - both countries still consider themselves as potential enemeis when you scratch the surfaces. Of course - it's about the governments - the oil driven war-waging american, and the superpower-complex russian.\n\nThe people would always get along just fine. :up: EitherALl the secret stuff we don't care about - they do. And it's been like that for years, and will stay that way as well.\n\nDuncan Idaho\n\n08-05-2005, 02:47 PM\n\nRightI can't agree, after all Discovery's docked at the International Space Station right now, which has been upkept and supplied by the Russian's while our shuttles were down. Our Astronaut's have had to hitch rides up with the Russians. Perhaps using the Discovery isn't a great example for your point. I think we've shown great cooperation with the Russians, (and they with us), at least in the Space agency.\n\nBut your point carries some weight when applied to the Military. I cannot disagree with what you said about that at all.\n\nType941\n\n08-05-2005, 02:49 PM\n\nOh Duncan, I hope I'm wrong with the Discovery example.\n\nRAM\n\n08-05-2005, 02:56not sure about exactly how much risk the Discovery runs of being destroyed upon returning to earth. I hope and I believe that it's very low. Otherwise USA would not let Discovery com back ,and send Atlantis in a rescue mission as was planned on advance.\n\nAnd if there was no Atlantis for a rescue, I'm convinced they would ask for help not only from Russia but also from the ESA, if their help could improve the situation somewhat.\n\nOne thing I've learnt about the americans is-they don't let down the people who risk their life on dangerous missions for their nation, and so they do the utmost to rescue and save them from death. I think it has more to do with the american people sensibility about the loss of lifes without a proper effort to save them, than with actual will to ask for foreign cooperation at a gubernamental level. However, US people vote their president each 4 years, and that is VERY important when deciding what and what not to do.\n\nNASA's pride is already damaged beyond repair (at least on the short run) because they have already admitted they sent the Discovery without the proper measures to ensure that Columbia's explosion won't happen again. The mere fact they have allowed that in public makes me think that they would spare nothing to save those astronauts' lifes if they were in serious danger. And that includes calling for help coming from another space programs, Russian or European.\n\nIf I get the signs right I think americans are pretty pissed at NASA for putting those people on such a danger without taking all the measures required to make the passage the safest one possible, including not doing it at all. I don't want to think what would happen if those lifes are lost because NASA didn't ask for help. Probably NASA would collapse if that happens.\n\nAs it is the shuttle program is closed (they haven't said it that way, but that's a fact) as soon as the Discovery touches down.\n\nAnyway I don't want this thread to run off-topic, so...\n\nI'm not saying that foreign help would have guaranteed the rescue of those men who died aboard Kursk (I really don't care about the number either). They would have probably died anyway, and I'm well aware of that fact.\n\nThe thing here is that at least they would have died serving a military and government who would do the utmost to save their lifes...not betrayed by a government wich put their desire to save face before going wherever it was required to rescue themDoing it otherwise would spell doom for any US administration as soon as the news made it into the press. And probably people would ask for certain members of that administration to be judged. No administration would run with that risk on today's world.\n\nI say that because I think I know americans and how they think about their soldier's lives...maybe I'm wrong?. Not sure, I'm spanish, but I've been posting in many american forums for the last years...and that's the impression I got.\n\nEitherand that's just my point. I also don't think this disgrace changes the fact that Putin&Co learnt nothing from the Kursk loss... I hope I'm wrong, but I think I'm not.\n\nALl the secret stuff we don't care about - they do. And it's been like that for years, and will stay that way as well.\n\nI would understand that attitude in a 1970-vintage world, with a real reason to keep those secrets from the enemy. Today is a different matter. As far as I know, Russia and USA are not enemies any longer, there is no threat of a 3rd war erupting between them, and IIRC cold war ended some years ago.\n\nI understand the military reluctance to put in danger the secrets hidden within a nuclear submarine, but I do not understand it if they take the decission to let a complete crew die an horrific death because there may be (not that there will be, may be) some chances that those secrets are not any more after the rescue.\n\nIn any case that is a moot point, IIRC Kursk was raised and recovered with foreign assistance, so giving away any secrets they intended to keep hidden. They could have thought it before.\n\nType941\n\n08-05-2005, 04:01 PM\n\nOne thing I've learnt about the americans is-they don't let down the people who risk their life on dangerous missions for their nation,\n\nWell... When I look at how the Iraqi war unfolds, I'm not so sure Don't forget that there are many russians who still want to believe that it was the american or british sub that sunk the Kursk, that Russia got paid off in a following conference with a huge debt release that was handled by Putin\/Clinton and that the whole thing is a cover up. The fact that such payments took place is a fact, but whether its connected - that's another matter.\n\nAs far as I know, Russia and USA are not enemies any longer, there is no threat of a 3rd war erupting between them, and IIRC cold war ended some years ago.\n\nActually, with the growth of China and India, Russia has probably decided that it needs to be nice with Europe (60% of its trade is with europe - can't screw that up) and establish a strong alliance with Asia. But from what I've been seeing, they are very keen to push the US out of all the air bases they are occupying in the former soviet south asian republics, they are pissed off at all the support the US provides to the opposition in those same republics, and in general, they feel threatened by the US way of international politics. Their national secretary who isnt' excatly a piece maker probably doesn't help things either! Especially that she can handle russia pretty well when it comes to US national interests that in no way coincide with the american interests. I'm glad you feel safe about it, but I have some doubts about the sincerety of Russian-american relations on a governmental level. And trust me - Putin is doing a rather good job in keeping away from major media some of the stuff you hear inside russia about how the russian foreign policy should be run. There's a bunch of radicals who'd bomb the heck out of anyone that dares to put another radar into the baltic states for crying out loud (and I live here).! We all live our lives, do our work, school, etc, but I am not that at ease about the situation in foreing policy and the general balance of power.\nThis whole teething opposition under the surface is basically about US wanting a leading role in the world policy and Russia that doesn't want a single power policing the world order. OR. The whole problem with Russia is that it wants to get back to world superpower level and feels threatened by the enourmous influence the US carries around the world, including in almost all countries around its borders. Either version i think is close to truth.\n\nthere is no threat of a 3rd war erupting between them,\n\nthere is a view that we are living in one already - albeit not between those 2 countries.\n\nIn my humble opinion, you hold a very optimistic view about what the US Navy would do in case of a Kursk like event - I on the other hand have a much less optimistic perseption of a few people in power that actually make the decisions. NO doubt that navy man themselves would help the other navy man without any hesitation. But the people in charge?...\n\nIn modern world, it's rarely about what the 'we, the people' want or think is just. Of course, it's just my opinion on it, and I understand it might not be shared by many or please some. You imply that the americans are caring and decent, while the russian would not care less about their people dying - and you say there's no more cold war thinking around? :dead:\n\nRAM\n\n08-05-2005, 04:19 PM\n\nI still think that if an US Sub is sunk and has crew on board that will die in a few hours, and the only asset able to lend any kind of help nearby happens to be russian because there's no time for own or allied assets to reach the place in time to conduct a rescue mission, USA would indeed call for Russian help.\n\nThe military leadership won't like it a thing. Probably the government itself won't like it either. But if word reaches the press that there are one hundred american sailors dead aboard that submarine, and that had the US government called for help they would have had a chance to survive (as small as that chance may be), I am sure that the outcry between the american people would spell said government's immediate doom, or ,at the very least, would mean for sure a non-reelected president.\n\nIn modern world, it's rarely about what the 'we, the people' want or think is just.\n\nI agree but I still think there are certain limits to that. There's a difference between seeing your nation's soldiers die in a foreign war (even if it is as pollemic one as Irak's) because wars always take a toll on soldier's lifes, and seeing your nation's soldiers dead because the leadership decided that they would rather spend 100 of it's soldiers lifes before calling for help from a no-friend nation.\n\nThe first causes unhappiness between certain sectors of the electoral base and certainly is not popular. The second would set the entire nation against their president for such a decision.\n\nAs I said, I'm not american, but I've been long in american forums and read a lot from them and in their own words. I may be wrong, but I think that I'm right on this particular matter. Maybe some american guy can answer us ;).\n\nYou imply that the americans are caring and decent, while the russian would not care less about their people dying - and you say there's no more cold war thinking around? :dead:\n\nno, no way I'm saying that.\n\nI imply that American democracy may be better or worse, but is deeply marked in each american citizen. They have known no other political system ,and they really know to get their voice heard if the need arises. An \"american kursk\" incident handled by the US leadership in a \"Russian way\" would've caused such a scandal and civil outcry in USA that I'm pretty sure that the president would've had to resign.\n\nOn the other side the Russians have always lived in a totalitarian system. Czarist first, soviet then. Democracy is new for them and they really don't realize how much power the people has in a democracy. They simply don't have a tradition of having their voices heard...in fact until 20 years ago or so doing it meant prison, so they usually simply don't raise it even when today they nominally can do it.\nAnother fact is that Ex-soviet people are used to ruthless coming from the state. Individuals have never mattered nothing to the state. It was true for the Czar, it was true for the Soviets...they're used to it and now that the situation is MUCH better (as bad as it is, it's much better...had the Kursk thing happened within the Soviet Union, probably the involved families would have had no information on how their loved ones died, much less the chance to bury their bodies) they don't react as harshly as the US people would do in similar circunstances.\nAlso, democracy is new in russia, and noone knows up to which point is not a real democracy but another thing in disguise.\n\nI'm not implying anything about russian people's decency. The people as a mass usually is VERY Decent, be it Iraqi, Russian, American, Japanese or Ethiopian...the corrupt and dirty ones usually are those in power.\nBut when those on powers have to answer directly to the people, however, they're forced to take decissions they won't otherwise. In russia the government has to answer to their people, but their people is used to much worse things so they really don't cause much worry when things like Kursk happen.\n\nIn short, what I mean is that US leadership is much more influenced by their people than the Russian one. So the latter doesn't ask for help and survived the kursk incident. The former won't have survived such a thing, not at least if it was made public (and it would).\n\nThat's what I meant.\n\nType941\n\n08-05-2005, 05:02 PM\n\nI want to agree that the americans will hold the government accountable and it would cause a major outcry in case of a an event when a lot of people lose their lives because of government's incopentancy and failure to do certain things.. but when the people who masterminded the iraqi war and who are responsible for those soldiers risking their lives everyday, still stay in power without questioning - I am not sure I agree with your belief in how much power the people carry in the best developed democracy!\n\nI thought that after a number of events in Iraq, all hell would break loose and the people in US would demand answers about what exaclty goes on in Iraq, why is taking so long, etc. But nothing! Rummy recently said it might be up to 12 years for them to fighting in Iraq. Think about that statement, and how much we've heard the 'people' responding to this. It appears to me that the republican majority firmly has the grip on the country's key positions and the right wing media has totally blasted apart the decmocrats... It seems that a very normal word 'Liberal' has become there as an insult and a namecalling term when referred to democrats. In other words - the Bush Dynasty is ruling and apparently noone's asking any questions, and that worries me.\n\nAll this coming back to the power of people who question their government. Apparently the consensus is that the government is right no matter what, and not supporting it during the time of war on terror is unpatriotic. I think that that great democratic government is just scaring people do death every time with their alerts, etc.\n\nAnyway I don't want this thread to run off-topic, so...\n\nSay what? :hmm:\n\nKafka\n\n08-05-2005, 05:34 PM\n\nSeems the Japanese navy is also involved in the rescue operation.

{"text":"Becoming invisible with your surroundings is only one type of camouflage. Camofleurs call this high similarity or blending camouflage. But camouflage can also take the opposite approach.\n\n(Erik Gould, courtesy of the Fleet Library at RISD, Providence, RI.)\n\nThink about zebras: it's hypothesized that their stripes make it difficult for a predator to distinguish one from another when the zebras are in a large herd. The stripes also might make zebras less attractive to blood sucking horseflies. This is called disruptive camouflage.\n\nWhen it comes to humans, the greatest, most jaw-droppingly spectacular application of disruptive camouflage was called Dazzle.\n\n(Anon, photograph of the USS West Mahomet in dazzle camouflage, 1918. Courtesy US Naval Historical and Heritage Command, NH 1733.)\n\nDazzle painting emerged in the 1910s as design solution to a very dire problem: American and British ships were being sunk left and right by German U-Boats. England needed to import supplies to fight the Central Powers, and these ships were sitting ducks in the Atlantic Ocean. They needed a way to fend of the torpedoes.\n\nConventional high-similarity camouflage just doesn't work in the open sea. Conditions like the color of the sky, cloud cover, and wave height change all the time, not to mention the fact that there's no way to hid all the smoke left by the ships' smoke stacks.\n\nThe strategy of this high-difference, dazzle camouflage was not about invisibility. It was about disruption. Confusion.\n\nTorpedoes in the Great War could only be fired line-of-sight, so instead of firing at where they saw the ship was at that moment, torpedo gunners would have to chart out where the ship would be by the time the torpedo got there. They had to determine the target ship's speed and direction with just a brief look through the periscope.\n\nThe torpedo gunner's margin of error for hitting a ship was quite low. Dazzle painting could throw off an experienced submariner by as much as 55 degrees"}
{"text":"Every team needs a mascot, and the Maine Windjammer Association is no exception. Meet the M\/B Watershed, the latest addition to Maine's historic passenger-carrying fleet. Measuring only 4.5 feet long, this unmanned Mini-Boat is part of an educational project designed to engage students in maritime learning.\n\nLast fall, Captain Brenda Thomas, owner of the schooner Isaac H. Evans, urged her fellow captains in the Maine Windjammer Association to support Belfast-based Educational Passages in their efforts to teach the next generation about ocean currents, winds and tides. Since 2009, Educational Passages has launched a dozen Mini-Boats in various parts of the Atlantic, usually with the help of Maine Maritime Academy's training ship during their annual cruise.\n\nEach Mini-Boat is GPS-equipped and designed to sail away to distant lands on the prevailing winds. Throughout each boat's voyage, students are able to monitor the course, position and speed from their computers. Some boats have not only provided information about weather and sailing routes, but have required international negotiations as well, since beach landings can involve contacting foreign communities in an attempt to get the boats rescued or relaunched.\n\nMost of the Mini-Boats have been \"adopted\" by schools around New England. The Maine Windjammer Association donated their Mini-Boat to the Watershed School, an independent high school located in Rockland, Maine. According to Will Galloway, Watershed's Head of School and the teacher who is using the Mini-Boat as part of his 9th grade history class, \"This is a terrific opportunity for us to bring our study of the age of exploration up to speed with current trade issues and international relations.\"\n\nCatching a ride aboard MMA's training ship State of Maine during their annual cruise, the M\/B Watershed was launched on May 18th near the Azores. Although Watershed suffered a slight mishap during the launch (she was dismasted!), she is providing interesting data as a drifter. Over the course of her first month at sea, she has logged nearly 650 nautical miles, heading steadily south-west along the coast of Morocco.\n\nWhen asked which Mini-Boat has sailed the greatest distance, Educational Passages Program Coordinator Richard Baldwin cited CPS, Belfast High School's boat. Launched off Puerto Rica, CPS traveled 8,473 nautical miles over 375 days, through a hurricane, over 30-foot seas and was retrieved 380 miles off the Portuguese coast by the State of Maine. The boat was brought back to Castine, fixed up and relaunched. She is now in the Dominican Republic and still sending position reports.\"\n\nThrough this unique partnership with the Maine Windjammer Association, the Watershed School and Educational Passages, young people in Maine and around the world via the internet will have the chance to learn about ocean wind and current patterns, map reading, geography, oceanography, navigation, earth sciences, computer technology and much more."}

{"text":"HMS Dreadnought - Armament:\n\nHMS Dreadnought - Design & Construction:\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, naval visionaries such as Admiral Sir John \"Jackie\" Fisher and Vittorio Cuniberti began advocating for the design of \"all-big-gun\" battleships. Such a vessel would only feature the largest guns, at this point in time 12\", and would largely dispense with the ship's secondary armament. This approach was validated during the 1905 Battle of Tsushima in which the main guns of Japanese battleships inflicted the bulk of the damage on the Russian Baltic Fleet.\n\nBritish observers aboard Japanese ships reported this to Fisher, now First Sea Lord, who immediately pressed ahead with an all-big-gun design. The lessons learned at Tsushima were also embraced by the United States which began work on the all-big-gun South Carolina-class and the Japanese who commenced building the battleship Satsuma. In addition to the increased firepower of an all-big-gun ship, the elimination of the secondary battery made adjusting fire during battle easier as it allowed spotters to know which type of gun was making the splashes near and enemy vessel.\n\nThe removal of the secondary battery also made the new type more efficient to operate as fewer types of shells were needed. This reduction in cost greatly aided Fisher in securing Parliamentary approval for his new ship. Working with his Committee for Designs, Fisher developed his all-big-gun ship which was dubbed HMS Dreadnought. Including the latest technology, Dreadnought's power plant utilized steam turbines, recently developed by Charles A. Parson, in lieu of the standard triple-expansion steam engines. This greatly increased the speed of the vessel and allowed Dreadnought to outrun any existing battleship.\n\nFor its main armament, Dreadnought mounted ten 12\" guns in five twin turrets. Three of these were mounted along the centerline, one forward and two aft, with the other two in \"wing\" positions on either side of the bridge. As a result, Dreadnought could only bring eight of its ten guns to bear on a single target. Supplementing the 12\" guns were 27 12-pdr guns intended for close defense against torpedo boats and destroyers. For fire control, the ship incorporated some of the first instruments for electronically transmitting range, deflection, and order directly to the turrets.\n\nAnticipating approval of the design, Fisher began stockpiling steel for Dreadnought at the Royal Dockyard in Portsmouth. Laid down on October 2, 1905, work on Dreadnought proceeded at a frenetic pace with the vessel being launched after only four months on the ways. Deemed complete on October 3, 1906, Fisher claimed that the ship had been built in a year and a day. In actuality, it took an additional two months to finish the ship and Dreadnought was not commissioned until December 2. Regardless, the speed of the ship's construction startled the world as much as its military capabilities.\n\nHMS Dreadnought - Operational History:\n\nSailing for the Mediterranean and Caribbean in January 1907, with Captain Sir Reginald Bacon in command, Dreadnought performed admirably during its trials and testing. Closely watched by the world's navies, Dreadnought inspired a revolution in battleship design and future all-big-gun ships were henceforth referred to as \"dreadnoughts.\" Designated flagship of the Home Fleet, minor problems with Dreadnought were detected such as the location of the fire control platforms and the arrangement of the armor. These were corrected in the follow-on classes of dreadnoughts.\n\nDreadnought was soon eclipsed by the Orion-class battleships which featured 13.5\" guns and began entering service in 1912. Due to their greater firepower, these new ships were dubbed \"super-dreadnoughts.\" With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Dreadnought was serving as flagship of the Fourth Battle Squadron based at Scapa Flow. In this capacity, it saw its only action of the conflict when it rammed and sank U-29 on March 18, 1915. Refitted in early 1916, Dreadnought shifted south and became part of the Third Battle Squadron at Sheerness. Ironically, due to this transfer, it did not participate in the 1916 Battle of Jutland, which saw the largest confrontation of battleships whose design had been inspired by Dreadnought.\n\nReturning to the Fourth Battle Squadron in March 1918, Dreadnought was paid off in July and placed in reserve at Rosyth the following February. Remaining in reserve, Dreadnought was later sold and scrapped at Inverkeithing in 1923. While Dreadnought's career was largely uneventful, the ship initiated one of the largest arms races in history which ultimately culminated with World War I. Though Fisher had intended to use Dreadnought to demonstrate British naval power, the revolutionary nature of its design immediately reduced Britain's 25-ship superiority in battleships to 1.\n\nFollowing the design parameters set forth by Dreadnought, both Britain and Germany embarked on battleship building programs of unprecedented size and scope, with each seeking to build larger, more powerfully armed ships. As a result, Dreadnought and its early sisters were soon out-classed as the Royal Navy and Kaiserliche Marine quickly expanded their ranks with increasingly modern warships. The battleships inspired by Dreadnought served as the backbone of the world's navies until the rise of the aircraft carrier during World War II."}

{"text":"The Argentinian failure to improve the runway at Stanley Airfield meant other means would be necessary to secure the waters around the Falklands and prevent British reoccupation of the islands. We saw in the last entry that anti-shipping strikes by Argentinian fighters operating from mainland air bases against the British task force began on the 1st of May.\n\nEven prior to that, the Argentinian navy (the ARA) had sortied two task forces into waters just outside the 200 nm Total Exclusion Zone declared by Britain. The first, northern task force consisted of Argentina's sole aircraft carrier, theARA 25 de Mayo (herself a surplus British ship) escorted by the only two modern surface ships in the ARA, two British built Type 42 destroyers. These Type 42 were almost identical to the Type 42\u2032s serving as escorts to the carriers of the British fleet. The ARA 25 de Mayo's airwing consisted of A-4Q Skyhawks and S-2E Trackers. The Trackers could be used to find the British task force, which could then be attacked by the Skyhawks. In fact, on 1 May, she tried to launch strikes, but unfavorable winds left her Skyhawks unable to fly.\n\nThe other task force, patrolling outside the southern boundary of the TEZ, consisted of the ARA General Belgrano, and two destroyers. The ARA General Belgrano was formerly the USS Phoenix, a Brooklyn class light cruiser. Built in 1938, and serving successfully throughout World War II, she had been sold as surplus to Argentina in 1951. She retained her battery of fifteen 6\" guns, and had been modernized and armed with MM38 Exocet anti-ship missiles. Her escorts were both former US Sumner\/Gearing class destroyers, which the US Navy had modernized under the 1960s Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization Program, or FRAM. The ARA General Belgrano had no antisubmarine capability. The two FRAM destroyers, despite being modernized in the 1960s, had only the most marginal ability to detect or defeat modern nuclear submarines.\n\nThese two task forces might not have been the most formidable ever sent to sea, but they did represent a genuine threat to the British task force. The Brits were operating on a shoestring. If either force were able to close with the British, they could wreak considerable havoc.\n\nAccordingly, orders were sent from the Admiralty for the advance screen of nuclear subs to locate and track these two task forces. HMS Spartan was assigned to locate the carrier group to the north. HMS Conqueror drew the southern assignment. HMS Spartan never definitively located the ARA 25 de Mayo. But on 1 May, HMS Conqueror detected and began tracking ARA General Belgrano and her escorts.\n\nThe British government's declaration of the TEZ said that all shipping and air traffic inside the TEZ was liable to attack, including Argentinian and neutral shipping. But the British government had also made clear that any Argentinian warships and military aircraft were liable to attack if they posed a threat to British operations. After the events of 1 May, the decision was made by the Admiralty to attack the Argentinian task groups despite their being outside the TEZ. The mere possibility of the cruiser closing in and firing volleys of Exocets and following up with a cascade of 6\" gunfire didn't bear thinking about. Accordingly, on 2 May, 1982, HMS Conqueror stalked, closed with and engaged the ARA General Belgrano. Because of concerns about the reliability of the advanced MK24 Tigerfish torpedo in the anti-ship role, Conqueror closed to within a mile of General Belgrano, and fired three Mk8 torpedoes. These World War II vintage torpedoes were the old fashioned, straight running kind, and would be familiar to anyone who's ever seen \"Run Silent, Run Deep.\" Two of the three torpedoes struck General Belgrano, and she quickly began to sink. Incredibly, neither of her escorts at first noticed that she had been mortally wounded.\n\nWhile 770 survivors were eventually rescued, three hundred twenty three lives were lost in this bloodiest single day of the Falklands War. Rescue and recovery operations went on for two days. The British made no attempt to interfere. The Argentinian surface fleet, stunned by the loss of this major unit, sailed for home. The ARA 25 de Mayo, and the rest of the ARAs major surface units, would spend the rest of the war in port.\n\nIn the face of a nuclear submarine threat, the technologically inferior units of the ARA would have been well advised to spend the entire war safely at port. Had HMS Spartan located the Argentinian carrier force, she too would likely have received orders to attack, almost certainly with greater loss of life.\n\nRather than trying to perform barrier operations in the vicinity of the Falklands, the Argentinian fleet, weaker in numbers and in technology, might have been better employed trying to interdict the fragile logistical line running from the task force to Ascension Island. The British task force needed a regular shuttle service of oilers for fuel and other logistical support to stay at sea for any reasonable period of time. Locating and severing this link would have hamstrung the British fleet and might possibly have allowed the ARA to operate away from the British efforts to track and attack them in turn.\n\nFor the expenditure of three thoroughly obsolete torpedoes, the Royal Navy had denied the Argentinians the ability to operate at sea. If the Argentinians couldn't use their land based airpower to defeat the Royal Navy, the Falklands were bound to be restored to the Union Jack.\n\n3 Responses to The Naval War in the Falklands, Part 11\n\nWhen Argentina bought the ex HMS Venerable from the Dutch, Hawker Siddely tried unsuccessfully to woo the Argentines to win a buyer for their Harriers.\n\nHad the Argentine navy been operating Harriers on the 25deMayo during the war, rather than the heavy Skyhawks, they may have gotten off the deck more often and the British built 25deMayo group may have caused a far greater problem for the British task force"}

{"text":"You may find this information helpful when researching the area prior to your visit\n\nThe Mary Rose was a carrack-type warship of the English Tudor navy of King Henry VIII. After serving for 33 years in several wars against France, Scotland and Brittany she saw her last action on 19 July 1545. While leading the attack on the galleys of a French invasion fleet, she sank in the Solent, the straits north of the Isle of Wight. The wreck of the Mary Rose was rediscovered in 1971 and salvaged in 1982 by the Mary Rose Trust in one of the most complex and expensive projects in the history of maritime archaeology. The surviving section of the ship and thousands of artefacts found while it was excavated and lifted have proved to be of immeasurable value as a Tudor era time capsule.\n\nThe excavation and salvage of the Mary Rose was a milestone in the field of maritime archaeology, comparable in complexity and cost only to the raising of the Swedish 17th-century warship Vasa in 1961. The finds from Mary Rose include weapons, sailing equipment, naval supplies, and a wide array of objects used by the crew in service and in their everyday lives. Many of the artifacts are unique to the Mary Rose, and have provided archaeologists and historians with insights into topics ranging from naval warfare to the history of musical instruments. The remains of the hull have been on display since the mid-1980s at the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard while undergoing conservation, along with an extensive collection of well-preserved artefacts at the Mary Rose Museum.\n\nAs a vessel of war Mary Rose was armed with new types of heavy guns that could fire through the recently invented gunports, and was one of the largest ships in the English navy throughout four decades of intermittent war. Mary Rose is one of the earliest examples of a purpose-built warship, having had no known career as a merchant vessel. She was also one of the earliest ships able to fire a broadside, although the line of battle tactics that properly took advantage of the innovation had not yet been developed. Several theories have sought to explain her sinking, based on historical records, knowledge of 16th-century shipbuilding and modern experiments. The precise cause of the demise of the Mary Rose is still unclear due to conflicting testimonies and a lack of conclusive physical evidence.\n\nBy the late 15th century, England was a relatively small state on the periphery of Europe. The great victories against France in the Hundred Years' War were in the past; only the small enclave of Calais in north-eastern France remained as a remnant of the vast French holdings of the English kings. The War of the Roses - the civil war between the houses of York and Lancaster had ended with Henry VII's establishment of the House of Tudor, the new ruling dynasty of England. The ambitious naval policies of Henry V were not matched by his successors, and from 1422 to 1509 only six ships were built for the crown.The marriage alliance between Anne of Brittany and Charles VIII of France in 1491, and his successor Louis XII in 1499, confronted England with a worsened strategic position on its southern flank. Despite this, Henry managed to maintain a comparatively long period of peace and a small but powerful core of a royal navy."}

{"text":"At first known as \"Three Sisters\", the village was founded by the Eaton family who built the community as a sawmill settlement for their extensive timber holdings across Cape Chignecto. A shipyard at the harbour produced over 20 large vessels beginning with the 1000 ton barqueChignecto in 1874[1] and finishing with the tern schoonerJ. L. Ralston in 1919.[2] Eatonville ships were noteworthy enough to attract coverage from Harpers Weekly Magazine which published an illustrated feature article on the launch of the barque Argenta at the Eaton's yard in 1890.[3] A notable example was the large ship Joseph H. Scammell built at Eatonville in 1884 which became a famous shipwreck in Australia when she sank in 1891. Eatonville Harbour attracted considerable shipping for the timber export trade. Two small tugs were based at the harbour to assist in docking ships and moving timber rafts[4] and the volume of shipping led to the construction of the Eatonville Lighthouses on the beach south of the wharf which operated from 1909 to 1923.[5] The harbour witnessed several shipwrecks including the spectacular wreck of the three masted schooner Marjorie J. Sumner which was severely damaged in the harbour in 1906 when it toppled over at low tide and was crushed by its large deckload of timber.[6] The shipyard and large sawmill were located at the harbour while the main village, known as \"the Old Town\" was located 1 mile (2 km) inland. The two were connected by a \"tramway\", a horse-drawn pole railway. The Eatonville Mill was a large steam-powered operation which could produce 60,000 board feet (100 m3) of lumber a day, but the Eatons \"preferred to cut less, waste nothing and strive for quality.\" This allowed them to make the most sustainable use of their Cape Chignecto timber holdings which also had the advantage of very few forest fires because the \"fog forests\" of Cape Chignecto are constantly damp from Bay of Fundy fogs.[7] A network of logging camps across Cape Chignecto connected by trails and log driving streams fed the Eatonville Mills while the adjacent settlement of New Yarmouth provided supplies, horse teams and workers.\n\nThe new Eatonville Interpretation Centre in 2009\n\nThe village had a population of 350 people in its peak years. The Eatons sold their holdings to the Elderkin family in 1897. The population dwindled after World War One as timber stands were exhausted and wooden shipbuilding collapsed. The village was largely abandoned by the 1930s. The last year-round resident left in 1943, although the descendants of several Eatonville families maintain cabins in the area. The surrounding forests were logged by various Cumberland County Mills but especially for pulpwood by the Scott Paper Company until the 1980s. A seasonal wilderness public road for off road vehicles named the \"Eatonville Road\" is maintained by volunteers and leads from Advocate to Eatonville and through to Spicers Cove. In 1989, the Eatonville site became part of Cape Chignecto Provincial Park. The old village site is crossed by the park's main backpacking trail which follows the former tramway for several kilometres and connects to a bunkhouse and wilderness campsites at Eatonville's \"Old Town\" site. An seasonal interpretation centre accessible by car from Spicers Cove opened at Eatonville in July 2009, providing lookoffs and short walking trails.[8]"}

{"text":"Military Organisation and Structure\n\nRAN: Structure\n\nOf the three services, the Navy's structure is the most flexible and indefinite.\nThe Navy can be roughly divided into ships and shore establishments, a shore\nestablishment being a naval base on land. Apart from the obvious material\ndifferences, however, there is little difference between the two. A naval\nshore establishment is commissioned just like a sea-going vessel and, just\nlike a sea-going vessel, is known as Her (or His) Majesty's Australian Ship.\nAlthough they have different jobs to do, the personnel at a naval base are\nalso organised in a similar manner to those aboard ships, having daymen,\nwatchkeepers and duty watches.\n\nFlotilla\n\nA flotilla is composed of two or more ships: these can be destroyers, submarines,\nmine-sweepers, corvettes or light patrol craft. In the case of destroyers,\na flotilla has a rigid structure. There are nine vessels in the flotilla,\nwhich are divided into two divisions of four, with another vessel leading.\nThe divisions are further divided into two sub-divisions of two vessels.\nThere is no fixed organisation for flotillas of the smaller vessels. In the\ncase of three or more vessels, they can also be divided into divisions and\nsub-divisions. A flotilla is usually commanded by a captain, and a division\nby a commander. Destroyers and submarines are usually commanded by a lieutenant\ncommander, and smaller vessels by lieutenants.\n\nSquadron\n\nA naval squadron is composed of two or more capital ships. Capital ships\nare large powerful vessels - battleships, cruisers or aircraft carriers -\nusually commanded by a captain. Squadrons of more than three ships are generally\norganised into smaller units known as divisions and sub-divisions. A squadron\ncan be commanded, depending upon its size, by a commodore, rear admiral or\nvice-admiral.\n\nAugust 1941. Battleships of the United States Fleet operating of the California\ncoast. AWM 009436\n\nTask Force\/Group\n\nA task force, or task group, is a number of ships grouped to carry out a\nspecific task such as the escort of a convoy or the protection of an aircraft\ncarrier. There is no set structure for a task force and the number and type\nof vessels allocated depends upon the tasks the group is expected to carry\nout. A task force is usually identified by a number. Task Force 44, which\nserved in the Pacific during the Second World War, consisted of the Australian\ncruisers HMAS Australia, Canberra, Hobart, and two United States Navy ships,\nthe destroyer USS Perkins and the cruiser USS Chicago. During 1991, the RAN\ntask force sent to enforce the naval blockade of Iraq, known as Task Group\n627.4, consisted of the guided-missile frigates HMAS Darwin and Adelaide and the supply ship HMAS Success. A task force is usually commanded by a\ncommodore or a rear admiral.\n\nAmphibious Force\n\nAn amphibious force consists of a number of vessels grouped together to\nland an army from the sea on enemy territory. It has no fixed composition\nand usually consists of transport ships, landing ships and landing craft,\nas well as a variety of armed ships tasked with the protection of the landing\nfrom enemy sea or air attacks, and the bombardment of enemy positions ashore.\nAn amphibious force also includes small units of specialists to survey beaches\nand select feasible landing spots, and to control and guide the landing.\n\nFleet\n\nA fleet is the largest naval structure and would usually contain a number\nof squadrons, flotillas and\/or task forces. Again, its structure is flexible.\nOften a fleet is organised to work in a specific geographic area, such as\nthe British Pacific Fleet during the Second World War. The RAN has never\nhad enough ships to form more than one fleet, so the fleet, in terms of the\nRAN, equates with the entire sea-going navy. The United States Navy, however,\nhas many fleets.

{"text":"Leadbelly tune about Titanic addresses racial issues at time of ship's sinking\n\nThe African American folk singer Huddie Ledbetter, better known as Leadbelly, sings a wonderful song with the simple title \"Titanic.\"\n\nThis version was recorded in New York in 1948, but Leadbelly said that he started singing it with Blind Lemon Jefferson on Dallas street corners soon after the disaster. What's most immediately striking about the song musically is that it's kind of upbeat, almost cheerful for a ballad about a shipwreck that claimed 1,500 lives. And this is even more evident in the lyrics. The song includes a fictional story about how Jack Johnson, the African American heavyweight boxing champion at the time, was refused passage on the ship:\n\nThe Eagle Rock was a dance, so Jack Johnson's response to the disaster is to spread his arms like an eagle and swing his feet around. Some versions of the song include an additional verse:\n\n\"Black man oughta shout for joy,\nNever lost a girl or either a boy.\nFare thee, Titanic, fare thee well.\"\n\nWhy would Leadbelly suggest that black people should feel joy in response to a tragedy? Why would he celebrate the fact that there were no African Americans among the victims?\n\nTo answer these questions, let's put Leadbelly's song alongside a story about the heroism of the Titanic's two wireless operators told in the New York Sun and other newspapers, and in one of the first books written about the disaster. This story is also fictional, but it's an invention of a very different kind. It went like this: One of the wireless men had left the compartment to find out what was happening on deck. When he came back, according to Logan Marshall in The Sinking of the Titanic, a book rushed out to capitalize on the wreck, \"he found a Negro stoker creeping up behind\" his colleague \"and saw him raise a knife over his head.\" Without time to give a warning, the wireless man pulled out a gun and, in Marshall's words, \"shot the Negro dead.\" In other words, heroism in this story took the form of a lynching.\n\nBlack newspapers were understandably interested in knowing whether there actually were any African Americans on board the ship. (There weren't, it turned out.) Some insisted that \"the Afro-American must have been represented, as he generally is in everything in this country.\" While many newspaper articles, speeches, sermons, and poems had made heroism a matter of racial exclusiveness, African American writers tried to broaden the chivalric honor roll. As one put it, the \"daily press has made no special mention of him, [but] we know he was there, and that he died like the other men. And we shed tears to his memory as well as to the men of other nationalities who died with him.\"\n\nThe silence on this heroic presence didn't surprise African Americans; daily newspapers rarely reported on blacks except as criminals, which prompted a knowing comment in an African American paper about the mainstream coverage of the disaster. \"There may have been a Negro in the sinking of the great steamship Titanic off the Newfoundland coast last week, but the newspapers have not as yet discovered the fact. It is rather remarkable that there could be so great a tragedy without a Negro somewhere concealed or exposed in it.\" When the story of the wireless operators' lynching of the stoker appeared, it conformed to the pattern in which African Americans were either absent as heroes or present as villains in narratives of tragedy or disaster.\n\nA Philadelphia paper sarcastically observed, \"We thought it would be strange if there were no coloured persons aboard the fated ship. Of course, he had to be made to appear in the light of a dastard"}

{"text":"Suez Canal And Its Transit\n\nHistory And Description\n\nThe Suez Canal, is a man made waterway which runs north to south across the Isthmus of Suez in north-eastern Egypt. It connects Port Said in the Mediterranean with the Gulf of Suez, a northern arm of the Red Sea. The canal provides a shortcut for ships operating between Europe or America with ports located in southern Asia, eastern Africa, and Oceania, by avoiding the need to sail around the Cape of Good Hope in Southern Africa. Economically and strategically it is one of the most important waterways in the world.\n\nThe Suez Canal is about 195 km (121 mi) long and ships of 20 m (64 ft) draft can make the transit therefore accommodating ships as large as 150,000 tons fully loaded. Because it connects two points at sea level, and has no high ground in between it has no locks, and transit time is about 15 hours.\n\nThe First Canal\n\nThe first canal between the Nile delta and the Red Sea was excavated about the 13th century bc, possibly on the orders of an Egyptian ruler, either Seti I or Ramses II. During the next 1,000 years the canal was periodically neglected, but several rulers at various times had it re-excavated or modified. All efforts to maintain it in a good condition were abandoned sometime in the 8th century ad.\n\nThe Modern Day Canal\n\nIn 1854 a French diplomat and engineer Ferdinand Marie de Lesseps enlisted the interest of the Egyptian viceroy Said Pasha in a new canal project. In 1858 La Compagnie Universelle du Canal Maritime de Suez (Universal Company of the Maritime Suez Canal) was formed with authority to cut a canal. The company was given permission to operate the canal for 99 years, after which time ownership would pass to the Egyptian government. The company was originally a private Egyptian concern, its stock owned chiefly by French and Egyptian interests. In 1875 the British government purchased Egypt's shares.\n\nExcavation of the canal was begun on April 25, 1859, and the canal was opened to navigation on November 17, 1869.\n\nThe strategic importance of the Suez Canal meant that it has been closed to maritime traffic during several conflicts, the last time during the Six-Day War of 1967, when several vessels were sunk in the canal, blocking the shipping lanes. The canal was reopened in June 1975, after an international task force cleared it of wrecks.\n\nTransit Procedures\nYou will be advised by an official of the Canal Authority on the correct procedure that you should follow. These procedures can take up to three days to complete and can be done by the yacht's skipper who must first visit the Small Craft Department in the main building of the Canal Authority. Here you will be briefed about the various formalities to be carried out as well as the various fees to be paid. The fees include the transiting fee, an insurance policy, ports and lights fee, etc.\nIt may be advisable to use an agent to complete these arduous tasks on your behalf.\nThe procedure in order is as follows for both northbound transits at Suez or southbound transits at Port Said\n\u2022 The Suez Canal Small Craft Department to present the ship's documents and apply for canal transit.\n\u2022 The Port Immigration office to complete arrival forms.\n\u2022 The Insurance company to obtain an insurance certificate.\n\u2022 Then, return to the Suez Canal Small Craft Department to present your insurance certificate.\n\u2022 The Customs and Quarantine offices must be visited on the day before your canal transit for the yacht's outward clearance. (These departments may visit the yacht).\n\u2022 The Port Immigration office to present your departure form.\n\u2022 The Red Sea Port Authority to issue a port clearance certificate.\n\u2022 Then, return to the Small Craft Department with the port clearance certificate (they will hand this to the pilot before your transit).\n\u2022 Call at the Inspection office - for measurement and final inspection of the yacht to issue you with a transit permit for your Suez Canal transit.\n\nPort Said\nIt is not advisable to approach Port Said at night because of the high volume of shipping in the area. You will be met by a pilot boat and directed to the Port Fouad Yacht Club marina. It is advisable however to use an agent that you can contact by VHF when approaching as he can obtain permission from the Port Captain on your behalf and direct you to proceed directly to the Port Fouad Yacht Club. For this purpose, recommended agents are: Messa Egypt Ph +20 123451258 : info@meesaegypt.com contactperson , capt.Yasser Gamal  or Nagib Latif of the Felix Maritime Agency, Ph: + 20 66 333132 or Fax: + 20 66 333510, Mobile: +20 12 211 9365.\n\nNo visas are issued and the immigration procedures are very easy for yachts that are only intending to stay in Port Said for as long as it takes to make the arrangements for the canal transit. Those intending to stay for longer must complete the full Egypt entry procedure.\nOn the day of the canal transit, the Small Craft Department will call you early to collect the pilot and take him to the yacht club to commence your canal transit after you have taken the passports (of all aboard) to Immigration to have them stamped.\nThe pilot will guide the vessel as far as Ismailia, where you must overnight (yachts are not allowed to transit the canal at night). The crew are not allowed to disembark here. Early the following morning, a pilot will continue the transit with you to Suez. Most yachts will stop at the Suez Yacht Club before continuing into the Red Sea.\n\nSuez Suez is at the southern end of the Suez Canal. On approach you will normally be met by an agent's vessel who will attempt to coerce you to use his services. It is recommended to rather contact an agent of your choice on VHF16 in advance, who will meet you on your arrival and obtain permission for you to proceed directly to the Suez Yacht Club marina and also contact the officials to meet you at the yacht club for clearance.\n\nThe Suez Yacht Club is located beyond the Canal Authority office, on the L\/H side of the entrance to the canal.\nYour agent will handle all the formalities for the Canal transit (as listed at the top of the page) as well as to bring the pilot to your boat on the day that you start your transit. It is highly recommended to make use of an agent in Suez.\nIf you would rather not use an agent you must contact \"Port Control\" on VHF16 to notify them of your approach and then again after you have anchored in the waiting area of Port Ibrahim. You must complete all the formalities for the canal transit and once completed Port Control will give permission for you to proceed to the yacht club and collect your canal pilot.\n\nYour pilot will board early in the morning to begin the transit and you must overnight at Ismailia before continuing to Port Said the following morning.\n\nCopyright 2009 World Marine Guide.

{"text":"Why did the london docklands decline?\n\nAnswer\n\nThe London docklands declined due to an increase in ship size meaning they found it difficult to come down the river as far as the Isle of Dogs where the river wasn't as deep. Containerization meant few dockers were needed with large cranes used to lift containers from ships and the decline of portside industries and manufacturing also led to the decline."}
{"text":"History of the Submarine\n\nWorld War II Submarines\n\nBoth sonar and radar technology matured during World War II, and both were used by the Allies to combat German U-boats. Sonar and radar were also added to Allied submarines to warn of aircraft attack and counterattack from surface vessels. Since World War II sonar has been the most important of the submarine's senses. Hydrophones are the submarine's ears, and they listen for sounds from other ships and the echoes of sound waves transmitted from the submarine itself. See Photo: Typical WW II Submarine Layout\n\nSubmarine Snorkels\n\nDuring World War Two German submarine losses increased sharply as radar-equipped Allied aircraft attacked U-boats running on the surface recharging their batteries. To charge the batteries that powered the electric motors for submerged operations, all submarines had to surface to run their air-breathing diesel engines. To counter the Allied radar threat the Germans perfected a Dutch device known as the snorkel. Using a snorkel a submarine could run its diesel engines and recharge its batteries while operating just below the surface. Air for the diesel engines was drawn into the submarine through the snorkel that was extended to the surface. To some extent the snorkel reduced vulnerability to detection and attack, but it protruded above the surface and could be detected by radar. The Germans introduced the snorkel too late in the war to make a difference.\n\nJapan\n\nAlthough the U.S. Navy still had a relatively small number of subs when World War Two broke out, this fact did little to dampen the spirits of American submariners. On January 7th, 1942, one month after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the USS Pollack (SS-179) sank a Japanese freighter off Tokyo Bay. It would be the first of many sinkings by U.S. submarines. When the figures were finally tabulated, it was found that American submarines sank five and one-half million tons of Japanese shipping, over half of the entire Japanese merchant fleet. U.S. subs accounted for about 60 per cent (over 1300 ships) of all Japanese merchant and warship tonnage sunk, yet the submarine strength at that time comprised less than two per cent of the entire U. S. Fleet.\n\nThe U.S. sub campaign deprived Japanese industry of raw materials and effectively shut down Japan's economy. The price of this success was high, 52 American submarines and over 3500 sailors remain on eternal patrol.\n\nGreater Underwater Propulsion Program\n\nTechnological advancements like sonar, radar, and the snorkel came about as a result of the pressures of WW II, and the U.S. Navy applied these advances to improving its Submarine Force. In the late 1940s the Navy began the Greater Underwater Propulsion Program (Guppy), a modernization program for World War Two fleet-type submarines.\n\nUnder Guppy the fleet boats were streamlined by reducing the submarine's superstructure and removing deck guns. Snorkel masts were installed to allow Guppys to remain submerged while they ran their diesel engines and charged batteries. Finally, improved storage battery technology permitted longer submerged operations between battery charges. However, the Guppy program was evolutionary, a development of existing technologies."}

The book they are sharing is the dramatic tale of the sinking of the liberty ship, SS William H Welch, off the mouth of Loch Ewe \u2013 and John Murdo Senior remembers it first hand.\n\nHe was a boy of 12 when the tragedy happened on 26th February, 1944 and he was there to witness the event off Foura and Black Bay in Wester Ross, all those years ago. 74 Americans died and 12 were saved by the tremendous and gallant efforts of the local crofters who battled across the stark bog land through snow storms carrying flasks of tea and blankets for the few merchant marines and navy crewmen who had survived,\n\nThe event is being commemorated on 7th May during WWII and the Arctic Convoys Week at Aultbea on Loch Ewe. There will be a guided walk to the wreck site, and John Murdo will accompany the walkers to tell the story as he remembers it. Young John (aged 3) will walk with his grandpa and the two of them will hand a wreath to the Coastguard Helicopter which will then place the wreath over the wreck.\n\nIt is their act of remembrance to all those that lost their lives.\n\nGuiding the walk is author Steve Chadwick, who has written a book on the story in collaboration with the Russian Arctic Convoy Museum Project at Aultbea.\n\nWith the help of John Murdo and his wife Chrissie, Steve has pieced together the story from local community memories, official sources and from two of the American survivors of the wreck who are still alive. Published by local Gairloch company Wordworks, the book is a comprehensive guide to the story of the tragedy with some stunning pictures illustrating the event. The book will be available at all of the events during WWII Week.\n\nJohn Murdo and Chrissie have kept remembrance of the event by erecting a memorial plaque above the wreck site, and have kept in touch with the survivors over the many years.\n\nOne survivor, Russell Ross, visited the site in 2005 and would wish to have attended this memorial event but ill health has meant he is unable to travel from America. Russell remembers: 'The people of the Loch Ewe community were wonderful as they brought us things. John Murdo McKenzie was 12 years old at the time and it was his mother who had taken me into her home, and who wrote a letter to my mother to tell her that I was among the survivors.'\n\nChairman of the Russian Arctic Convoy Museum Project, Francis Russell, explains that the strong bond between this tiny Scottish community and their American friends is enduring. 'We plan to build a Museum on the shores of Loch Ewe as a lasting legacy to all who took part in the Convoys of WWII. This WWII Week of events (May 7 \u2013 12) is part of our fundraising efforts to realise the dream of our local community to keep the story of the Convoys alive for future generations.\n\n'The William H Welch shipwreck really galvanised the community in 1944 and focused their efforts on that one night of immense tragedt. That spirit of community is still as strong today.'\n\nAnd certainly, John Murdo Senior is keeping the story alive across the generations. John Junior is growing up knowing the full facts of how his family played such a crucial role in the events of that dramatic day in 1944 when the William H Welch was shipwrecked off the coast of North West Scotland.\n\nThe full programme of events in the WWII Week from 7th-12th May and more information on the William H Welch Walk on 7th May is at the Russian Arctic Convoy Museum website - or phone +44 (0)7970 053883\n\nBackground\n\nThe William H. Welch \u2013 commanded by Capt. Lee Marshall of Philadelphia who went down with his ship \u2013 had delivered her war cargo and was on her way to join a homebound convoy when the fierce storm drove her aground in early morning near the mouth of Loch Ewe in Wester Ross. Mountainous waves soon had her decks awash and the entire crew was forced to seek refuge on the flying bridge. British rescue vessels tried in vain to give aid.\n\nThe William H. Welch was built at the Bethlehem-Fairfield. Shipyard in Baltimore, Md, delivered on 31st March 1943. She was operated for the WSA by T. J. Stevenson and Company, Inc., of New York, N. Y.\n\nThe survivors returned to the USA aboard the Queen Mary.\n\nThe importance of highlighting the legacy of the WW2 Russian Arctic Convoys is central to the project plans for a Russian Arctic Convoy Museum in Aultbea, Wester Ross.\n\nThe Museum Project is a key part in the Aultbea Regeneration Plan, together with a new Community Centre to help bring much need employment and income potential to the area.\n\nLoch Ewe was the departure point for nineteen of the convoys leaving for Russia. A further twenty three left from Liverpool, Clyde, Oban and Reykjavik; and thirty six sailed back from Russia to the UK.\n\nOver three thousand men lost their lives in the convoys. Churchill called the Arctic Convoys 'the worst journey in the world'.\n\nThe community around Loch Ewe held a 70th anniversary Memorial Service in August 2011 to commemorate the first convoy to leave for Russia \u2013 'Operation Dervish' which took Hurricanes and RAF pilots to Murmansk. This event was attended by HRH Prince Michael of Kent, top diplomats, fourteen veterans and over 300 from the local community. HRH Prince Michael of Kent has written the foreword to the Programme for the Museum Group's WWII and the Arctic Convoys Week \u2013 7-12 May, 2012.\n\n3 Responses to John Senior to John Junior: no ordinary story\n\nCaptain Lee Marshall was my great uncle. He was born Marshall Hart in Melbourne Australia and served with the 3rd light horse at Gallipoli where he was wounded by a grenade to the head.He emigrated to U.S.A after WWI and changed his name and became a sea captain. It is nice to know that his sacrifice is remembered so many years later so far from where he was born."}
{"text":"Orion class battleships were four super-dreadnoughts \u2014 the first ships of that type \u2014 of the Royal Navy. The lead ship, Orion, was launched in 1910. They were the first Royal Navy dreadnoughts to have all their main guns in the centreline; the U.S. Navy's first dreadnoughts, the South Carolina class, had pioneered this advanced feature. The Orions were quite distinct from the later classes of 13.5\" super-dreadnoughts (King George Vs and Iron Dukes) in that the fore-funnel was placed in front of the mainmast. This arrangement was common in early Royal Navy dreadnoughts but created major problems for the gunnery direction team in the spotting top.\n\nContents\n\nDesign and development\n\nPrevious British dreadnoughts had been built very much with an eye on cost.[citation needed] By 1909, although war still seemed unlikely, the white-hot naval rivalry had loosened the purse strings. These ships were much bigger than the preceding Colossus class and cost almost \u00a31.9 million each to construct.\n\nArmament\n\nThe move to the 13.5-inch (343 mm) gun came out of necessity. The final iteration of the 12-inch (305 mm), the high velocity 50 calibre Mark XI,[2] had been unsuccessful. It lost some of its accuracy and was subject to considerable bore erosion that limited its useful life to about 80 discharges. A lower velocity weapon was indicated, and was realized in the 13.5-inch, of 45 calibres, and with a much heavier projectile. The projectile used was 1,250 lb (567 kg) or 1,400 lb (635 kg) against 850 lb (386 kg). The shorter range of the low-velocity gun was compensated by increasing the maximum elevation from 15 to 20 degrees. The 13.5-inch was considered a successful design, although its effectiveness was compromised by poor shell design until availability of the \"Green Boy\" shells in 1918.[3]\n\nThe adoption of the all-centreline armament was also of necessity. The previous Colossus and Neptune classes had already adopted a superfiring pair of turrets aft in an effort to save deck space, and competing designs in the U.S. and elsewhere had led the way in the all-centreline arrangement. The great investment in displacement and cost of a 13.5-inch turret contra-indicated wing turrets, with their limited arcs of fire and therefore limited effectiveness. Finally, the staggered arrangement of the Colossuses and Neptune complicated internal arrangements and was generally not considered a success. Unfortunately, the retention of outdated sighting hoods meant the Orions were not able to fire the superimposed turrets over the deck turrets for fear that the blast would injure crews in the lower turrets. Also, the design's relatively high centre of gravity gave the Orions a wicked roll in rough seas. Both these defects were eventually cured and the improvements included in subsequent classes of British dreadnoughts.\n\nArmour\n\nThe armour belt was increased to 12 inches (305 mm) in view of the general increase in gun calibre in potential adversaries. It is quite typical of British designs armour thickness lagged behind gun size, this being the opposite design driver of German ships in which armour thickness was usually greater than the calibre of the guns they carried. It is also of interest to note adequacy of ship armour was still being judged by belt (horizontal) thickness, rather than deck (vertical) thickness which became more critical as battle ranges extended beyond approximately 12,000 yards (11 km) as the trajectory of the incoming shells was more vertical than the design of the ships was intended to resist. Practice ranges prior to the war were rarely greater than 5,000 yd (4,600 m) at which the trajectory was nearly flat.[citation needed] By the time that the initial actions were being fought at ranges exceeding 18,000 yd (16,500 m) on occasions all capital ships on both sides were vulnerable to \"plunging\" fire. (German ships were less vulnerable by virtue of having very deep belts, which kept shells away from the armour decks, and because British shells were notoriously weak at penetrating armour at an oblique angle).\n\nHistory\n\nAll four were present at the Battle of Jutland of 1916 in World War I, but took no damage. They had a relatively short career, all being decommissioned in 1921, due to the Washington Naval Treaty. Orion and Conqueror were scrapped in 1922. Monarch served as a target, surviving a full day of shelling and bombing on 20 January 1925 before being sunk by fire from HMS Revenge. Thunderer served longest, acting as a training ship from 1922 until she, too, was sold for scrap in December 1926."}

{"text":"Discuss this post\n\nI agree with almost everything except climate caused more icebergs and tides sent icebergs south. This does not contribute simply because they knew icebergs with in those waters. Everything else contributed as you say.\n\nUrban legend.

Running too fast in an iceberg infested sea. End of story.\n\nAll the other things are only causal factors that do not change the outcome at all. They just made some things, sinking, faster than expected. No ship overcomes the impact at that speed without going under.\n\nLong (long) time \"folkie\" on guitar, autoharp, hammered dulcimer, jews harp and (aaargh!) musical saw. No band but I still make noise that some consider music (others, not so much). Know more songs than I can remember so I guess that means I don't \"know\" them. Generally if a well-known someone does the song, I don't. I relish in the obscure (like Fare Thee Well Titanic).\n\ni may only be 16 but i do know somethings about the titanic sinking. for starters yes it was a mistake for the captin to make a stop then full reverse. It is simple to explain because if the propellers where still going clockwise and moving the boat forward then they could have done a better job of turning the boat. But when the propellers where stopped then started moving counter clockwise it was pulling water the opposit direction in the way of the rudder. so therefor the boat went right when it should have went left. So it sunk because of the fact they tryed to put the very very heavy boat in reverse to stop it. the stopping distance even at 20 knots is 850 yards or 777 metres.\n\nThe owners refused to allow Boxing Champ Jim Johnson to sail on the Titanic because he was a Black Man traveling (as was his custom) with a White Woman.\n\nThat's a fact and there is even a period song about Jim Johnson dancing with joy that he wasn't on board when the Titanic sank.\n\nKharma. Or the iceberg. Take your pick.\n\nIll go with iceberg. Kharma is nothing nothing tangible, nor does it have any influence on anything. Just as chance has no influence or tangibleness to influence an outcome. So iceberg is the only reason. If kharma did exist and it was going to pay back the person who did the wrong deed, then it would havemade the person who refused a black person to fall over some railing to their death , or drown in a pool of spit.\n\nIf Karma is nothing tangible and has no influence on anything and only works against the person who did the dastardly deed, then why is it that when a tornado kills a whole town some people say it was God's vengeance. And people seem to believe that horse crap. And if one person survives their reason is always \"God was watching over me.\" And the others? Pieces of @!$%#e, I guess, huh.\n\nOther things that they forgot to mention was that the lifeboats that left the Titanic (the first few boats) were not filled to their capacity. Along with the fear of returning to pick up any people in the water might cause their lifeboats to be swamped with those in the water trying to save their lives. Never label anything unsinkable or indestructible because they are man made and they will do both, sink and be destroyed\n\nThis story, as usual misses the REAL crime, which is not why the ship sank, but why ONLY 715 people survived, when the life boats had a FULL capacity for 1200, AND, given conditions, the water was universally described as glassy calm (no doubt because of the proximity of field ice) it would have been VERY easy to OVERLOAD the boats with as many as 20 people a boat, with 20 boats, 20x20 equals 400.\n\nIn other words, but for the rank incompetence of the officers of the Titanic, from the captain on down, the numbers that day could have been REVERSED, 1600 ALIVE, 600 DEAD. That's the REAL tragedy.\n\nI couldnt give a f#*@ less about those who died. Because they died so many years ago it is likely that there are at least 20,000 less people on the planet today if not more like 100,000. As horrible as it was, Hitler saved the world from billions more. He probably bought us the time we are living in right now. People dieing is really not a tragedy, It is necassary, and the ones who pass are if anything free from the burdens of life. Yes it sucks when we dont get to see someone we loved anymore, but if everyone stays alive as long as possible and people who were supposed to die dont then we shorten the time line for those down the road and we make the quality of their lives diminish with the damage that we cause.\n\nalso a design change; originally the marine architect had designed the water top bulkheads, to also be capped off, instead the builders decided to only install large pumps, , the spill over only took a couple of hours to bring her under .\n\nI love it that we are blaming God now for the deaths on the Titanic. Yes God was having a fit that the Titanic was so big he would kill a bunch of people by making it sink. Makes sense to me. People are just too big for their boots you have to keep them in their place.\n\nIt is all blah, blah and BS. Running too fast in an iceberg infested sea. End of story. All the other things are only causal factors that do not change the outcome at all.\n\nComprehend Much? You misunderstood the whole article, then contradicted yourself, I am a professional investigator and I can tell you that Causal Factors do EXACTLY as what their names suggest, they are Factors that DIRECTLY AFFECT the outcome of the disaster. The article is not about what caused the sinking, but what mitigated the outcome, and you don't think the idea of not having enough lifeboats would have made a difference, or the fact that many lifeboats sailed less than half full because men were not allowed in them, only women & children. These ARE situations (Causal Factors) that affected the outcome directly, definitely made it worse. All items listed above were Causal Factors, the Root Cause to all of it was an arrogant Captain or a Cruise Company that pushed him to be that way.\n\nBrandon (#1.24): Population control may very well be \"necessary\" for the well-being of the planet, but that doesn't make tragedies any less important or less heartbreaking. If all of the people you care about the most die in horrible tragedies, I wonder if you'll still be spouting such words.\n\nBrandon, you feeling a bit crowded? Or is it just your opinion of the quality of the people around you that bothers you? Well, I personally believe that each person on this earth matters; and any person's death is a tragedy. Though people are always talking about overcrowding on this earth, no one has proven to me that we are TRULY overcrowded. In fact, industrial countries are actually declining in population due to decreasing birth rates for the most part. It is in the developing world that populations are increasing. Pushing for decreasing population appears to me like it would affect them the most and would be rather discriminatory against poor and disadvantaged nations. Brandon, you seem to approve of Hitler, who got rid of the groups he was most able to exploit in Europe. You also approve of a disaster like the Titanic. So what populations should we be decreasing, exactly, Brandon and others? Would you have it come to true survival of the fittest-pure Darwinism to weed out the weak among us?\n\nCan we in the developed world not help those in the developing world with their problems? As our populations decrease or hold steady, can we not help those with increasing populations; or must we greedily hoard what we have while decrying overpopulation and proposing ways to decrease the number of people? We in America act like we are so poor, but even our poor are rich compared to most nations on earth. For example, there are at least dumpsters with cast off food in America-not that that is not terrible-but in Haiti, there are no dumpsters; the poor have to eat dirt to stave off hunger pains. Not a popular idea, I know-helping other countries-we're supposed to look after ourselves. Time was when people would help each other, though, even when they only had a little to share. Isn't that what being human is all about?\n\nThe quote about the ship turned the wrong direction is BS. Only a season veteran would be allowed to take the wheel; and any command given is directly affected UPON the wheel, not the direction you want the ship to go - so \"hard to starboard\" means \"turn the wheel TOWARD starboard\", not the ship. By the way, the Titanic was like most cruise liners in that it was reverse linked; so if the wheel was turned to Starboard, the rudder turned the opposite direction so the ship also turned to starboard (this is the difference between a Rudder and Tiller). A tiller is a SAIL mechanism where to push left to go right and vice-versa. Probably why this BS was never publicized as any Navy man would laugh upon hearing...\n\nI still think that instead of firing distress rockets, had Captain Smith decided to attempt to steam in reverse toward the distant light of the California, he would have had close to an hour worth of steaming time before the situation became critical enough to force the launch of the lifeboats. That hour could have produced 6-8 nautical miles, which would have left the Titanic within a couple of NM from the California, more than close enough for their bridge watch to visually see the depth of Titanic's problem and respond in time to save the vast majority of those who perished.\n\nCertainly the California would not have been provisioned to offer anything more than a few hours worth of temporary floating shelter for the Titanic's 2000+ passengers and crew, but the Carpathia, a mid-sized modern ocean liner, would still have arrived within that time frame too.\n\nYes, the Titanic was damaged, and steaming her in reverse once damaged might have caused even worse damage too, but within 15-20 minutes after the accident it was already well-known among the bridge crew that 1000 or more people were going to die unless the distress rockets were able to alert the crew of the nearest ship in time or some other miracle occurred.\n\nPerhaps another of the unlucky events to befall the Titanic was that she was a new first-rate ship from which the crew was entirely confident in the use of their wireless equipment for communications purposes, while the crew of the California, an older cargo ship, were more familiar with the use of their Morse lamp instead, which they are said to have tried to use to communicate with the Titanic too.\n\nEven if the crew of the older and slower California had immediately started steaming toward the Titanic at full speed once Captain Smith ordered his distress rockets fired, she would have only arrived within a half hour of the Titanic's final plunge, so anything that Captain Smith could have done to decrease that amount of time when he still had the steam necessary to do so should have been attempted anyway.\n\nIt may have taken some time for the realization that the unsinkable ship would eventually sink to fully set in among the Titanic's top officers, but once the grave reality of their situation became known, they still had enough steam to try to move the ship most if not all of the distance closer to the possibility of saving far more people than were saved by taking no action other than launching the lifeboats instead.\n\nOn the subject of the capacity of the lifeboats vs the passenger capacity of the ship, the Titanic actually exceeded the British Board of Trade regulations for the sheer number of lifeboats required (16) because it carried the four extra collapsible lifeboats too, all of which contributed to the number of people saved.\n\nAnother thing that might have been tried but wasn't was having the ship's carpenters try to hastily build some rafts on the foredeck, from which some of the steerage passengers might have ridden to safety too. The Titanic's cargo manifest listed a dozen bales of cork, 16 \"hogsheads\" of wine, (at a capacity of 80 to 90 gallons each), and even hundreds of \"casks\" of wine at a capacity of 9-12 gallons each too. Each of these items (once drained of wine) could have provided enough flotation to build rafts capable of carrying dozens of passengers each, and the Titanic carried plenty of lumber and the necessary hardware to build at least several such rafts too.\n\nThere were a whole number of errors that contributed to this disaster, another of which was the belief that the ship was unsinkable, which led to them steaming at full speed through a known ice field. There is also a theory that the Titanic had a coal bunker fire going too, and that Captain Smith was desperately trying to rush to port when the iceberg got in his way.\n\nI am sure that we could come up with many more errors, unfortunate events, and design flaws that caused the Titanic disaster to be as bad as it was. Watertight bulkheads only as high as E-deck, which basically makes the watertight compartments large open-top tubs, as once the sea reaches E-deck, it just overflows into the next compartment rearward?\n\nThe Titanic was a disaster waiting to happen from the outset, something that we might all learn something from.\n\nWalt, you sound like a man who could answer a question that has been troubling me all my life: Why on earth did mariners invent the terms \"port\" and \"starboard\" when we have had \"left\" and \"right\" available the whole time? At the age of 62, even though I could easily afford a boat large enough to sleep aboard, I still have to endure the privations of weather and perilous beachings to complete my annual summer circumnavigations of Vancouver Island, because the largest craft that can be operated without your overly complicated explanation is a 10-foot Walker Bay dinghy. I push the tiller away from me, I turn left, I pull the tiller toward me, I turn right.\n\nI've always wanted to sail to Hawaii, but this tub won't carry enough grub. Is it the Navy we have to blame for this? And don't tell me it's an ancient custom: the Romans had \"sinister\" and \"dexter,\" and all the prior seafaring nations had words for \"left\" and \"right\" as well. What's up with that?\n\nLeft and right are independent of which direction a person is facing. If two people are facing each other, one person's right is the other person's left. Starboard and port are used in reference to the front of the vehicle being traveled in (regardless of the direction it is moving. Thus, starboard is the right side of a boat or plane, as you face forward on the boat. Port is the left side of the boat as you face front. That way, no matter which direction someone is facing on the boat, when a direction is indicated (starboard or port), everyone goes the same direction. Likewise bow or stern indicate the front and rear of the vehicle (on a plane they use nose and tail).\n\nNice try. But whether it's vertical (a sail) or horizontal (a wing), an airfoil only provides lift when going forward. My boat has a pointy end (the bow) and a square end (the stern) and only an idiot would face backwards to determine left and right. If what you claim were true, those blue highway exit signs would say \"Rest Area Next Starboard.\" And automobiles actually CAN back up, unlike aircraft in flight or sailboats under sail, absent a headwind.\n\nThe Titanic Disaster is what it is a Disaster The Ship was Built Better then any today as if you look at any cruise liners that have sunk they roll to one side making there life boats in accessable Fact Titanic didnt have enough but was able to use them all where other cruise liners of today had more but could only use half!It has been proven that there was nothing MAN built better then the Titanic its own designer gave it an hour to stay a float it stayed 2, it is claim it was just the sheer force of impact and weight that caused its tear along side of boiler 8 nothing more man has built nothing that could have taken the force Titanic took still today there is Nothing,... It's a mass grave yard where it lies nothing more and should be left that way,..Enough said..\n\nNow that I think about Joe, you could be right. Conservativism is a plague, a disease, a virus...Bush's grandfather could very well have been responsible for the Titanic sinking. Maybe he spread his conservative stupidity onto the captain and his crew and that caused all the failures and losses of lives. We all know how rightwingers love for people to die horribly...\n\nPower and glory,Captains all mess up because of it.100 years later they still do the same dumb things,,just look at the cruise ship keeled over. The good news is there is around 8 billion people on earth now,so we did not miss the few that died,because of some dumb captain, Looks like another big make work project,and a feel bad day for the people that get sucked in,\n\nBeing the queen of useless information (I don't know why I know some of the things I know lol)\n\nthe rudder was 78 feet high and weighed 101 tons, tests and standard design ratios have shown that the rudder was slightly smaller (less than 2%) than it should have been. This, however was not enough to have affected the outcome of the collision with the iceberg.\n\nI like hearing factual and relevant information, thank you 1SGFitzWife4ID. As for sandstoney - what is wrong with you??? It doesn't matter if people die, nobody misses them because there are so many? You must be thinking of bugs, not people.\n\nbtw, while I am lauding factual information, what is it with journalists who fail, time after time, to put information into context. \"The ship was going too fast...\" How fast is too fast? What is the standard for that? And all that information about the ship turning starboard mixed with references to right\/left - what side of the ship scraped the iceberg? Is that the starboard side (not everybody knows)? How is it that anybody in the chain of communication didn't understand (they're all sailors for cryin' out loud). And then there's all that ungrounded technical information supported by 3rd party speculation. Like someone else said, it all adds up to \"blah blah blah... iceberg\" - because that's the only thing that needs no explanation. It's a worthless article :\\\n\nThree things come to mind, not necessarily as omissions to your list, but rather as more minor contributing factors, lesser than the major ones you've listed:\n\n1) The ship's course was \"shaved\" somewhat, taking a slightly more northerly-than-usual track to shorten the path between Southampton and New York. The ship was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. This ties into Captain Smith's desire to make his final command voyage prior to retirement, the record-holder. Taking a more northerly track increased the likelihood that the ship would sail deeper into the ice fields.\n\n2) The steel used in the ship's hull was, if I remember aright, a particular alloy containing, I think, not enough carbon, so that the cold-water temperatures decreased the ductility of the metal, making it more brittle than it should have been, thereby contributing to the buckling of the plates as well as the rivet-popping you mentioned. There was much \"cost cutting\" by Harland & Wolff, and White Star. Cheaper materials means more profit when the ship is commissioned and sails ahead of schedule. Much like today, it was profiteering in the face of public safety.\n\n3) Significantly, the watertight bulkheads did not reach all the way to the fairweather decks, allowing spillover from one compartment to the next, thereby increasing the water load in each of the compartments. If the bulkheads had reached all the way to the fairweather decks, only two (I think) compartments would have been flooded, thereby preventing each successive compartment aft to be flooded, giving her more time afloat, or possibly preventing the foundering in the first place.\n\nThen again, we'll never really know, will we?\n\nThese are all things mentioned in the History Channel expedition documentary that Roger Long (a naval architect who helped determine the actual break-up process) discovered or confirmed. I may not be remembering them all correctly, so if I've made an error, it is certainly not out of malice or intent, but rather that of a faulty memory possibly attributed to my advanced age. Heh.\n\nThanks so much, Ed... I tried to slide that reference to the compartments, but that part of the design surely does deserve to be mentioned. In the Physics World article, Titanic designer noted that more than four compartments were breached (in fact, six), meaning \"it was a mathematical certainty that the ship would sink.\"\n\nThe article also refers to the debate over the steel, noting that early tests by Canadian metallurgists suggested that the steel would become brittle and prone to fracture at a higher temperature than modern steel. \"However, more sensitive tests that have since been carried out, which conform more closely to the characteristics of the Titanic's impact with the iceberg, suggest that the steel of the ship's plating was adequate to bend with the impact rather than fracture,\" Corfield wrote.\n\nHadn't heard that part about the more northerly route ... another interesting angle. Looks like it took a somewhat southerly track, but not southerly enough.\n\nThe bulkheads was a major design flaw for sure and they actually pulled up pieces of the ship several years ago and ran some test on the rivets and steel and found them to be much weaker then what was actually required by law. Another thing they have found is the Titanic didn't split at the high angle that people reported. On the History Channel they had several different experts look at the original expansion joint in the blueprints of the Titanic as well as doing another dive on the Titanic and noted that the expansion joint was indeed where the ship broke apart at. The problem they suspected was the expansion joint was designed wrong basically it ended on each side in a square end. To see if the designers thought that might have been the problem the team went and dove on the Britannic, which was a sister ship built after Titanic, to see how the expansion joint looked and sure enough it looked more like a thermometer. They also went to a renown research facility where they put the actual blueprints into a computer so they could test the actual breakaway point and found that the stern didn't have to come out of the water very much before it broke unlike the reports of it rising high into the air basically they concluded that couldn't have happened.\n\n.\n\nA question for Alan Boyle: OK, we all know the Titanic sank at about 2:20am...but what \"time zone\" was that. Or put another way, I assume that was \"local\" time for the middle of the ocean SE of Newfoundland but what was the GMT or Eastern Standard Time for the collision and sinking? Just wondering... thanks!\n\nChris, that's a real poser for me. Apparently it was 2:20 a.m. ship's time, which is adjusted on a daily basis. All I know about this is what I see on Wikipedia. This article, citing Samuel Halpern's \"Report into the Loss of the SS Titanic,\" says that at the time of the collision, ship's time was 2 hours and 2 minutes ahead of New York time.\n\nThat would make the sinking at 12:18 a.m. Eastern time, or 0518 UTC. But if folks more knowledgeable than I am want to weigh in, please feel free. This report on Titanic communications makes the time somewhere around 12:30 a.m. New York time:\n\nOK, two time zones east of NY sounds about right. Thanks. I'll light a candle here in NM at about about 10:20 Mountain Time on the 14th (2:20 on the 15th, Titanic Standard Time). Fare the well, Titanic, fare the well.\n\nIn the U.S., the Standard Time Act wasn't enacted until 1918 (although the railroads adopted time zones much earlier). So, when it is mentioned that the ship was 2 hrs and 2 minutes from New York time, it's apparent that this is given from the perspective of all time being local, when New York time was slightly different than, say, Boston or Philadelphia time.\n\n@The Evil Tessmacher, actually, the damage would have been the same. 5+ compartments breached. But with the bulkheads reaching to the upper decks, it would have stayed afloat. Could have stayed afloat with 6 compartments breached with that in mind. Her sister ships Olympic & Brittanic had the bulkhead modifications after the sinking making that possible. Unfortunately for Brittanic, there were a few other issues leading to her demise.\n\n'Watertight' bulkheads or compartments still are not so watertight. Those ones in the Costa Concordia aren't or weren't sealed at the top either, and she went down, too, although in water shallow enough that she's resting on a reef edge rather than a mile deep. Of course, my comprehension of this could be incorrect, so someone please correct me if I err.\n\nWhy are they called watertight when they're no such thing? When one fills will water, it spills into the next compartment over the open top, and so on and the ship sinks. IMO they should be called something else other than watertight. If they had tops and were truly sealed or sealable, they would be watertight compartments.\n\nWhat I learned by television yesterday was that the watertight bulkheads were not all-encompassing either. So it wasn't just water flowing over the tops of the bulkheads from caompartment to compartment. It was also increasing pressures on the sides of weaker bulkheads. The example used was the boiler rooms. As I understand it, the boiler rooms themselves were within the watertight bulkheads, but the coal bunkers were not. According to the tv documentary, this meant that water was not only overflowing the tops of the watertight bulkheads, but was also finding ways around the sides putting undue pressures on the side walls that were between the boiler rooms and the coal bunkers, which were not watertight.\n\n\".\"\n\nThis is known as a chain of events. A chain comprised of links which, if any one link were broken, would prevent the ensuing accident.\n\nLooking at the track of the Titanic, it looks like the captain began the voyage taking a great circle route (the shortest distance between two points on a globe). This would make for the quickest crossing everything else being equal.\n\nThe Titanic could not remain on a great circle route as it would run into Newfoundland well before it reached New York. About midway across, the Titanic began taking a more Southerly route and, by the time they hit the berg, it appears that they were back on a more typical track.\n\nWho knows? If they had stayed on a great circle route longer they may not have hit an iceberg. Certainly they wouldn't have hit THAT berg.\n\nLower carbon steel is more ductile. Higher carbon steel is less ductile but stronger. From what I have read in the past, while the steel used in the hull plating would be considered somewhat inferior by today's standards for the application, it was quite good for its day. The reason for that is mainly because manufacturing processes have been refined just like anything else, allowing a reduced number of \"interstitials\" (imperfections in the crystalline structure) to form during cooling. Additionally, while the water and air were cold that night, the temperatures were above the threshold where that particular alloy would have reached its \"ductile to brittle transition.\" In general, at temperatures below that point steel shatters (for lack of a better term) rather than elastically and then plastically deforming in that order.\n\nI cannot speak to the varying grades of rivets however, as I was unaware of that possibility. It is interesting for sure though.\n\nI contend that Titanic could have stayed afloat much longer if mattresses, clothes and other similar items had been thrown overboard with the purpose of being sucked into the holes and plugging them in a similar manner as food blocks the sink strainer.\n\nActually the failure wasn't the hull plates but the rivets holding them together. Also not sure I'd chalk up the inferior steel to cost cutting alone, it simply could just have been how it was made, most steel made 100 years ago is significantly inferior to that made today, so it could have been inherent in the process, and therefore a unknown quantity to the engineers. So much of Titanics design was left to situations not thought of, e.g. the height of the water tight bulkheads, size and shape of the rudder, the centerline propeller, and that she broke up. All indicitive of thoughts not carried through. Remember that this ship was built in a time when airplanes were made of wood and fabric, and when automobiles could barely be called reliable, even the battleships of the mighty RN were dwarfed by Titanic, she displaced over 46,000 tons. The third class accommodations on the Olympic class ships were the best in the world hands down. And the rest of her, well one only needs to watch the movie to see how fine that was. They simply didn't think this could happen. Everything had to line up perfectly for the first four comparments to be breeched, because with out that occurance the ship stays afloat, if any event leading up to the collision is changed even slightly the ship makes New York the next day. That it could happen was simply unfathomable, and if it did, then either help would arrive soon, or the damage wouldn't cause it to sink. The idea that nearly two thirds of the ships company would ever perish was as alien a thought as it would be today to consider a ship unsinkable. Which by the way wasn't a term used by her designer, or used much before the sinking. Speaking of terms, starboard comes from the norse term steerboard, which on norwegian clinker built vessels was a device similar to a rudder but placed on the right side of the craft, to protect their steering gear they tied up on the left side, which is why its called port. Referring to things as port and starboard on the ship (i.e. the port anchor windlass) referes to their placement relative to the head of the ship and so you know where to find it even if you are facing aft, the reason this doesnt translate over to driving cars is first usually the references are to objects that are outside the car (i.e. rest stop next right, which would be refered to similarly on a ship as in iceberd to starboard), and second you are very very rarely if ever facing aft while driving a car even if the car is in reverse. So yes nautical names for things like right and left have meanings and reasons that certainly don't make sense at first to your average lubber, but that doesn't lessen the validity of their meaning at all. The idea that Captain Smith could have put Titanic in reverse and driven her over to the Californian is an interesting one, and technically certainly doable, but I think it was beyond any one onboard, the shock of the collision and the news from below that the ship was doomed crippled his ability to find solutions to the problem (and his officers, who were barely up to the task of manning and launching lifeboats), its not certain that he even knew that ship was so close, as it is certainly possible that the radio operator didn't tell him. That is actually a better than fair certainty, because the trasnmitter that interrupted Phillips last was the Californian's radio operator who was rudely told to 'shut up I am working Cape Race'. If Californian's ice report didn't make it to the Captain than her presance probably was entirely unknown to him, and therefore steaming over to her in reverse to ask for a lift to New York after my boat sinks was not really a viable option.\n\nAccording to the 1912 book \"The Sinking of the Titanic and Other Great Sea Disasters\", which my son has an original print of, the Titanic was speeding due to a coal-bin fire, which had a 24\/7 crew assigned and shoveling, to keep it under control. The implication is that Captain Smith was speeding to get to NYC for better fire-fighting equipment to put it out. There was speculation that the bin fire was intentionally set, as UK was undergoing a coal strike at the time, and massive quantities of scarce coal were being diverted to Titanic due to the tremendous press focus.\n\nSo there are two conflicting stories - the chief in charge says it was out by the time of the collision, and one of the fire-fighters says not. I know who I'd believe - the one NOT needing to do CYA. I'll have to check my son's book to see who they cited - much of the book relies on interviews with passengers soon after they disembarked.\n\nyes1fan I have a similar book and it states that the fire had been smoldering for a week (since it was loaded in Belfast) it took them that long to get enough crew members to reach the bottom of the pile, and because they didn't have enough coal (due to the shortage at the time) they didn't want to waste it by dumping it.\n\nCoal fires start spontaneously under pressure. The height of the coal bunkers causes pressure at the bottom of the pile, and, when conditions are right, will create heat that ignites the coal. It is a common problem and happens on land as well wherever coal is stored, such as at power plants.\n\nI'm going to go with the Iceberg Theory rather than the men who remained at their stations keeping the lights on so passengers could be rescued. They died at their posts, shoveling coal, you see. There was no other way to keep the generators and engines going but to keep the fuel feeding them.\n\nThink about that. They knew they'd be likely to die if the ship went down but stayed there to be blamed by their employers.\n\nIf any of you watched the PBS docudrama on the sinking, you'll recall that the fact was brought up that the coal fueling the Titanic was low-grade, highly flammable, coal -- evidently all that was available at that time (due to the coal strike). I wonder whether in fact, had the White Star Line execs not been so cheap, there might have been a better grade coal -- less combustible -- for purchase at a higher price but they cut costs there, too?\n\nAccording to this video, Titanic's low-grade coal was dangerously smouldering from the launch throughout its truncated voyage. The point was made that this burning weakened the (brittler than it should have been, if the comments here are correct) outer sides of the boilers, thus rendering them susceptible to breaking.\n\nAccording to Richard Davenport-Hines new book, Voyagers of the Titanic, the port-side crew interpreted \"women and children first\" to mean \"women and children only,\" and launched lifeboats half-empty rather than allow men and older boys to fill the vacant seats. He recounts a series of other post-collision mistakes that greatly increased the loss of life.\n\nThat was one reason. Another was that while Capt. Smith ordered the lifeboats swung out, he never formally ordered the ship to be abandoned. Without formal orders, the crew basically accepted only volunteers who wanted to get into the lifeboats, and made no effort to fill the boats.\n\nOnly after the Titanic was well down at the bow and it was obvious that it was going to sink did the last few remaining lifeboats get filled to capacity.\n\nAh, the famous \"Birkenhead Drill\" misinterpretation. I had forgotten about this, but it is a significant reason the loss of life was so high. It certainly didn't contribute to the foundering, but it was a major reason for the death toll. In addition to not enough boats, of course. It amazes me that the discussions on MSNBC can run in these directions. I think it's a direct result of the caliber of Mr. Boyle's core of readers.\n\nI read someone's graduate thesis a few years ago, and it contained one of the most profound statements I've ever read. It was simple, direct, and a clear indication that humanity rarely gets it. The statement stuck with me, even though I'd heard variations of it before.\n\n\"If the lessons of History teach us any one thing, it is that no one learns the lessons that History teaches\"\n\nOne account (Lord's \"A Night to Remember?) that I read said that the boats were supposed to be filled with women and children from steerage. That would mean that the boats would have women and children loaded on the upper decks, then lowered to some of the doors (?) lower down to take the steerage women and children.\n\nI have heard that another ship \"The California\" recieved the distress signals, which their captain ignored, even though they were close enough to watch the Titanic sink. Any truth to it? How many hundreds of lives could they have saved? I find it hard to believe. To watch the giant ship sink, and make no effort at rescue. If true, why isn't the incident more publicised?\n\nThe Californian was stopped about 15-20 miles away due to the ice. Her wireless radio only had one operator for the entire voyage. This operator had shut down their wireless for the night and their Captain (Stanley Lord) was in bed for the night. The Californian's night watch saw a ship and saw rockets. they attempted to signal but got no response. They informed the captain and that was that. the next morning the wireleass operator heard about titanic and they went to help.\n\nFor many years Captain Lord insisted that the \"Californian and it's crew said that the ship they saw didnt seem in ditress. it had been sugested that their was a 3rd ship between the two ships that ignored both sets of signals. It has since been put forth that the 3rd ship possibly did exist. a swedish or norwegian ship was engaged in whaling activities (illegal or otherwise and didnt want to get caught.\n\nThe California's captain, Stanley Lord, was vilified for the rest of his life and blamed for the loss of life on Titanic.\n\nThe problem was Titanic wasn't sending company distress signals but firing rockets. They signaled to Titanic with their Morse lamp but received no response. They did not wake their captain but spoke to him while he was sleeping. Later Lord said he had no recollection of the conversation.\n\nIn the scramble to assign blame, Captain Stanley Lord was a convenient target. Although he was asleep and his crew never woke him to assess the situation on deck, his career was ruined so White Star could avoid blame for their egregious mistakes.\n\nHad he responded the most he could have done would have been to have saved 300 lives. There still would have been a large loss of lives in the Titanic disaster, according to a later investigation. The greatest responsibility for loss of life goes to the crew of the Titanic, for launching lifeboats half-full of passengers.\n\nThat error is the proximal cause of the greatest loss of life in maritime history up until that time. Had those lifeboats been overloaded by 50% they still would have floated on that sea of glass and perhaps everyone could have been saved. It was an act of human error piled upon mistake upon sheer human hubris that killed all those people...and still it wasn't to be known that they died of the freezing cold temperatures for another 25 or so years until Nazis did despicable experiments on human beings.\n\nThere were many pieces to that puzzle and they've all come together now, 100 years later, for our understanding and comprehension.\n\nEven if there were more than enough lifeboat capacity for every passenger and the crew, there was nowhere near enough time to load and launch all of them. The last 2 boats actually were floated off the ship, and that was the full compliment of 20. Lifeboats in that day were very large and heavy, and needed real equipment and skill to put into service.\n\nLook at how long it took to evacuate Costa Concordia. The Titanic had 2 hours, and even less by the time the gravity of the situation was understood, and the needed actions became clear.\n\nRegarding the Californian, it is my understanding that the ship's wireless had been shut down for the night and that it's crew mistook the Titanic's rockets for some type of celebration.\n\nAs for the amount of time needed to evacuate a ship, it seems to be a generally accepted fact that even today, in regards to the Costa Concordia, that had it been in deeper water, there would have been a far greater loss of life. And even though the Costa Concordia passengers had not yet had their lifeboat drill, they were all lined up at their 'muster stations' prepared to enter lifeboats when the order given.\n\nI was wondering why some of the passengers couldn't have been dropped off ON the iceberg that the Titanic hit, but as there are no actual pictures I have no knowledge whether there would have been any room\/size of iceberg to do such a task, or due to the time constraints\/panic involved.\n\n@fantomdog. i can only guess, but there are factors there too. Passengers were not dressed to be standing on ice, for one. Another is that the ship didn't stop on the iceberg when it hit. Another is that, after stopping briefly, Captain Smith was strongly urged(\"ordered\") by Mr. Ismay to restart the engines and move on, which they did briefly.\n\n@rugbymom: I have to admit that I would today take \"women and children first\" to mean the same as \"women and children only.\" I would take either to mean that only after all women and children have beeen evacuated from the ship can men fill any remaining lifeboats, if there are any boats left to fill.\n\nIF what you say is true about \"women and children first,\" and crew members should have allowed men to fill vacant seats, then Mr. Ismay should not have been scrutinized so for filling a unused seat on a lifeboat. After all, no lifeboat is said to have been filled to capacity. AND, he was not the ship's captain, just one of the owners...just another passenger on the ship. No laws said the owner had to stay onboard. Even Captain Smith allegedly said something similar directly to Mr. Ismay, that while at sea, the Captain, and only the Captain, is in charge; that even a ship's owner is just another passenger.\n\nFrom my perspective---and I'll disclaim it that way---the answer to your question is yes and no. As an erstwhile naval historian, I will say that some lessons DID make it into people's collective grey matter. Ships are inherently safer than they were 100 years ago; modern navigation has made travel at sea easier to manage. Modern ship construction actually gets its origins from TITANIC and other preceding disasters, and is still some of the best work there is (although as a traditionalist I'm bound to say that I think overlapping steel plates with riveted joinery is still better than welded butt-jointed plates---just my opinion and nothing more. I invite you to do your own research and form your own opinion.)\n\nBut the flip side is that some folks just didn't pay attention in history class; I'm willing to bet that Captain Schettino never read about Captain Smith. To borrow from an aviation maxim, the prudent mariner never places himself or his ship in situations requiring the use of his superior skills. Both captains failed miserably in that regard. The only thing that I can offer in Captain Schettino's defense---and I AM reaching for this---is that not as many people died on COSTA CONCORDIA as did on TITANIC. In the cold clinical analysis, that says that our modern safeguards work. At the human level though...I can't help but feel for the families that lost loved ones.\n\nOne reason that few people died in the Costa was that it wasn't in the cold North Atlantic mile from land. The Costa hung up on rocks and didn't fully sink, giving people time to get off. The next morning there were people still getting off the ship....\n\nHow come these rabid right wing nutjobs never mention that Dubya came into office with the largest budget surplus in history, and left with the largest deficits in history?\n\nHow come these nutjobs don't mention that the economy is improving, unemployment is decreasing, and the stock market is rebounding, all in the face of the greatest GOP obstructionism since the Andrew Johnson Administration? Why do they always try to blame everything on their opponent instead of offering realistic solutions?\n\nI don't remember Mr. Boyle mentioning the current political situation in this article...\n\nI heard that if the would of closed every single door in the ship, there would have been enough air to hold the ship up until they reached land due to the fact the bedroom doors were air tight. not sure how true it was, but it does make sense\n\nAs far as the speed,I think the captain was kind of coeresed to almost flank speed upon the urging of company officials on board,also the California disregarded\/ignored the SOS sent.Thank GOD for the Carpethia or more fateitlys may have occured\n\nSea ice is any small bits of floating ice not so big as to be able to be called a growler. Growlers are any floating ice large enough to be a hazard to navigation, but not so big that they can be called icebergs in their own right.\n\nThe Evil Tessmacher knows his stuff. I grew up on the east coast in Portsmouth, Va. We are surrended by water. And then Norfolk is close by.The largest navel ship yard in the world. This has nothing to do with icebergs what so ever. We can guess all we want but we were not there. I can not imagine what they went through, especially in that freezing ocean. Families lost from each other. I sat and cried when I saw how selfish some , especially the rich were. They decided they would go first. But the sea knows no difference between the rich or the poor. I do not know how strong I would have been. We need the past to help us with the future so we do not make the same mistakes. We should learn from our mistakes if we choose to. That has to be our decisions.\n\nIf you want a true 11th reason, here it is. I don't remember what book I read it in, I'll need to go look but, somebody not to long ago calulated the size of the ship versis the size of the rudder and figured the rudder should have been 10-15 feet longer then what was actually built. In other words, the rudder was to small.\n\nHeck, most ships these days don't have the double keel either. Seems like the builders of ships these days have outsmarted themselves once again thinking their designs won't fail in such a situation. For a while after Titanic sank, ships were being built much stronger, but after a few decades, corners started being cut, and the lessons of history forgotten. Now we have ships sinking again. Funny thing is, what sank the Concordia was something Titanic would have survived, given the watertight compartment design on both ships.\n\nCause number 11: No searchlight. Why not? Searchlight technology of that time was sufficient for the task. The ocean *is* big, but it's not completely empty. No binoculars? No problem! Illuminate the path ahead with a searchlight.\n\nA searchlight of the required size would no doubt also have been too big to easily store and retrieve from a locker, so the lack of keys would not have been an impediment to the use of the searchlight.\n\nA pivoting searchlight would probably have been mounted on the bridge or over the crow's nest, from which the iceberg warning was issued. A white iceberg against a black ocean or dark sky would have been quite prominent. The detection range would have been at *least* a few miles.\n\nMississippi barge tows have searchlights. It helps the tow avoid bridges and other obstacles, natural and artificial, in the river.\n\nCars have headlights. Would you drive at night at high speed without them and not expect to hit something, or even to fly off the road?\n\nShips have searchlights now. It's too bad the Titanic did not have a searchlight sweeping the ocean ahead for 'bergs.\n\nRegarding your item number 1: Yes, shipboard searchlights probably were less common on ships of the day, but the entire thrust of my comment was to speak to the prevailing lack of foresight and imagination that caused suitable searchlights to not be installed on the Titanic, even when the capability existed to do so.\n\nAddressing your point number 2: As for icebergs not being visible for miles ahead in an adequate searchlight beam, you are most assuredly wrong. I am someone who spends his professional life peering through the darkness in search of distant and faint objects. I do not know how else to explain the enhanced visibility of a highly reflective object against a dark background without taking you out on the water some moonless night to show you. However, that will be a bit difficult for the near future because I am presently surrounded by desert.\n\nPerhaps you have seen distant, snowcapped mountain peaks in the moonlight? The apparent angular size of one of the smaller peaks would serve as a simulated iceberg. In this case though, if the moon isn't bright enough, it is not possible to push more electric current through it for a more dazzling view.\n\nThe eyes of nocturnal animals are visible from quite far away in a searchlight beam, in case you ever help a rancher friend to night-hunt (where it is legal) for burrowing animals that dig the holes that cause sheep and cattle to break their legs.\n\nI bring a hefty flashlight with me on my evening walks, the better to illuminate any dark objects deposited by discourteous dogs. Back in the time of the Titanic, people out on evening walks were probably less able to avoid such hazards.\n\nSo, it is always a good practice to have enough light to see where you are going.\n\nSince they ignored the warnings in the first place, they probably wouldn't have utilised a searchlight if they had one.... would probably be the same 'attitude complacency' as to why no one bothered to break the cabinet lock open to get the binculars, either.\n\nIt's like my dad always used to say: \"Why should I bother taking this with me when I already know that I'll have no use for it? That said, I'll not pack it because it is just extra weight...\" Used to drive my mum absolutely mad; of course she wanted to pack EVERYTHING (better to be prepared, right?). I wonder if something other than a complacent attitude and the belief in an 'unsinkable' ship may have made a difference on that 1912 April night.....\n\nIf there had been a huge searchlight on the bow, then Leonardo DiCaprio wouldn't have had any place to stand and do his \"I'm the King of the Worlllllllld!\" schtick.\n\nBut seriously, if the thing had hit the iceberg head on and not grazed it, it is quite possible that the collision would have been survivable. The additional compartments wouldn't have been exposed to the sea from the huge gash along Titanic's side, and they could possibly have limped into port.\n\nIs it just me, or is it absurd that an essential piece of iceberg-spotting equipment went unused simply because they were in a locked cabinet to which no one had the key? The cabinet was only wood, and there were fire axes and other sharp and\/or heavy implements of destruction on the ship. So WHY in heaven's name, with multiple iceberg warnings coming over the wireless, did the captain or some other command crew member not order the cabinet broken open so the binoculars could have been put to the use for which they were intended?!\n\n\"So WHY in heaven's name, with multiple iceberg warnings coming over the wireless, did the captain or some other command crew member not order the cabinet broken open so the binoculars could have been put to the use for which they were intended?!\"\n\nWhy, indeed? Why, indeed? The Titanic was a victim of human folly.\n\nThe no-binocular-locker-keys situation on the Titanic was similar to the one-ammunition-box-screwdriver slowness of the distribution of rifle ammo at the battle of Isandhlwana on January 22, 1879. The screwdriver problem wasn't the sole cause of the massacre of the British by the Zulus, but it was a contributing factor, just as a number of other adverse factors combined to sink the Titanic.\n\nInteresting concept about a spotlight but I don't believe it would have helped and here is why.\n\nUnless the spotlight was constructed in a way where it would illuminate bright light outward from the ship for at least a mile, a spotlight would not have helped. As light is projected outward, it loses it's capability of \"lighting the way\". Take a flashlight and shine it in a dark area for a few hundred yards. You may be able to illuminate the area close to you, but the light will not be as effective 50 feet away and even less so a few hundred yards away. As big as that ship was, only a spotlight that could shine prominently over a couple of miles might have made a difference as it would have taken at least a few miles to allow time for the ship to steer clear at it's speed.\n\nI once read that the real tragedy of the Titanic was that there actually were enough lifeboats. After the sinking, the lifeboats were tested in Liverpool with the weight of grown men, and they remained seaworthy. Everyone on board could have gotten on the lifeboats and they would have reached safety.\n\nPerhaps your source was referring to the original design and not what the end result was. According to the British Board of Trade reports (summarized here : on encyclopedia-titanica . org edits won't let me copy\/paste the link ) There were enough seats for 1178 people. There were over 2200 on board a ship built for over 3000 people. This was actually in accordance with the British Board of Trade as the number of required lifeboat seats were proportional to the weight of the ship, not how many people were on board. This was a carry-over from the schooner days. The laws did not change fast enough to keep up with steam technology. Using the math on the books at the time, Titanic only needed 16 lifeboats. She had 20 thereby surpassing safety standards as listed by the law.\n\nI don't have the source handy (I'm moving so it's in a box somewhere), but she was designed for significantly more lifeboats, more than enough for everyone aboard. However, the powers that be decided to cut it to the minimum so that the first class could have more deck space. Then, the extra 4 were added. The problem with the extra 4 lifeboats was that they were stored on top of the officer's quarters with no easy way to get them down. That's why one of them floated off of the ship upside down.\n\nKelly I read the same thing in a book called \"1912 Facts About Titanic\"\n\nThe upside down one was \"Collapsible B\" 18 people managed to hold onto it and survived.\n\nI always thought that the number of lifeboats coinciding with the size of the ship and not with the number of passengers was just lack of simple common sense who the heck would ever think that was a good idea?\n\nKelly, I think you misunderstand Josie's post. I believe she means that while there were boats with seats for only 1178 people that they could have put all 2200 people on them anyway and still stayed afloat.\n\nAnother important cause for the Titanic sinking is arrogance. The crew honestly believed the ship was unsinkable. The captain is supposed to have told a passenger that \"Not even God can sink the Titanic.\" When he said that, she knew they were in trouble.\n\nThink of the good things that came out of lessons learned from this tragedy. Maybe more than 1514 lives have been saved because of the safety measures that started from this. Here are some I know of, but there are probably more: A change in attitude. Since April 14, 1912, I don't think anyone has gotten onto a boat thinking for one minute that this thing can't go down. Since you know it can sink, then you do things as carefully as possible and don't assume that somehow, no matter how bad things seem, the boat will never go down. The US Coast Guard was established because of the report made by the Senate committee that investigated the disaster. From then on, someone had to man the radio 24\/7. Also, a ship can't send up flares or fireworks unless they're in trouble. When other ships saw the fireworks from the Titanic, they thought those rich people were just having some fun.\n\nBy the way, I read that the reason for the lifeboats being sent out half full was that the crew who built the ship had done an evacuation drill while the ship was still in Southhampton. The crew that manned it had never practiced an evacuation and didn't know how much weight the boats could have held. That's another thing that was changed. When boats go out now, they have an evacuation drill the first day. And, of course, every ship now has lifeboat space for every passenger.\n\nThe US Coast Guard was established because of the report made by the Senate committee that investigated the disaster.\n\nThe Senate committee authorized the International Ice Patrol, then gave the Coast Guard the authority for operating it (1914 or 15). Except for WWII, the CG has been doing the Ice Patrol ever since, and not a single vessel has been lost due to a collision with an ice berg. I think the Senate committee demanded that all (American) vessels be equipped with wireless radio, and the radio be manned 24\/7.\n\nMichaelin is also correct - the Coast Guard was established in 1790 as the Revenue Cutter Service.\n\nReferring to Annette H. post, I just heard that since the Costa Concordia, that has changed again. Not only are lifeboat drills done on the first day, but now are done before a ship is allowed to leave port.\n\nAndrew, do me a favor next time your \"talking\" to your so called God and ask him why he murdered my dad (cancer) when I was three and my alchoholic, depressed mom who suffered a nervous break down had to raise five kids by herself. --------Thanks God your quite a guy. Glad it works for you though.\n\n@Joe: God didn't murder your dad. The cancer did. I see you have a lot of anger going on, and maybe some day, you can get over it. When Adam and Eve sinned, we (humans) had to be punished. What's so different from that to when we do something wrong, and our parents punish us??? Also, you might want to think about this; IF you weren't being so closed minded and selfish, JUST MAYBE, God did a favor by taking him home before some worse fate stepped in. Try being happy that your dad didn't suffer MORE! BTW, your mom DIDN'T HAVE to raise you all by herself. She obviously CHOSE to do so. Get rid of all the hate you have in your heart. I'd like to think you're a BIGGER man than that! I will pray for you, and I wish you all the best.\n\nFirst off I'm sorry about your Father and your mother drinking and raising 5 kids alone. My Father died at just under 40 years old drunk himself to death, I was 5 going on 6 when he died, I do Not blame God. God did not put the bottle in his hand or make him drink it. I had two brothers and a sister all older than me my mother remarried and I had two step brothers. I started to drink just after high school in 1968 and got heavier when I went one year college last semester there I stayed drunk more than not. After I enlisted in June 13, 1969, I drunk even heavier during my 4 years in the USMC and for 2 more years afterward. I was married twice, had all 3 of my children died from first marriage (12-1971-1976) and I do not blame God. I have 4 children from my 2nd marriage (1978-1986 devoiced 1990) I had to raise them without her after she left Oct. 30th, 1986. She decided she do better at making money with another man. I did not blame God than either, I forgave her took years . My children were then, my daughter 8yrs old, oldest son 6yrs, middle son 3yrs and youngest 3 months old and I still DID NOT blame God, in 1986 to now. I did not go back to drinking and I did not go blaming God, He did NOT make her leave it was her own self centeredness that did. I saw her only once since then in 1988 traveling with the man she left with.\n\nI thank God, Him helped me with my children and the drinking problem, God give me victory over drinking in Oct. 1975. It has NOT been a problem since. I'm sorry you feel all your bad problems came from God, I tell you are wrong they did not. Read the book of Job see who is the right one to blame. I'm 62 years old and I do NOT regret my decision to surrender all to Jesus in Oct. 1975. I'm proud of all four of my children and my daughter-in-laws and Grand-daughters my daughters children she is raising her children alone also. But NOT really alone for God is with her always. God can not stop all bad things from happen in this world are no one would really know just how bad sin is and who the real author of sin is, Satan. You have NO idea how many times God has stopped bad things from happening to you to me and my family. For all mankind can think about is the bad sure it is what we see but the day will come and you will know just what all God did for you. First of all His Son died for you too! You can make fun of me all you wish I know who my Saviour is and that is the Son of God, Jesus Christ. If you wish not to believe that is your choice and you will have to face ALL your sins at judgment. I do NOT for I have a Saviour who died for ALL my sins which which have been many and really bad but I need NOT concern myself with them ever again. So I will say it once more I'm sorry for the lost of your father and what your mother when through, you can let go of all that bitterness and receive peace from The Heavenly Father for He does love you Jesus death, burial and resurrection is proof 100%. It is not His plan all this has happen, He created a perfect world and perfect humans to enjoy it, Satan messed it up for self centered reasons, Satan wants to be god.\n\nIt's been cited in the comments, but not in the article: lack of crew preparedness for the actual event. If the crew had been trained, a few hundred more lives may have been saved. Not enough to have saved everyone, but every person counts.\n\nAlso, I heard that one of the reasons the ship sustained as much damage as it did was that it took a glancing blow off the iceberg rather than simply ramming the iceberg. If they had turned INTO the iceberg and simply rammed it, the front one or two compartments would have been completely lost, but the ship was designed to allow that much damage, allowing it to get to shore safely. Hundreds may have died, but it would have been FAR less than the number that actually did. I have no idea if this is a true statement. I'd love to hear if this is true.\n\nNick, if the Titanic had went bow first into the iceburg, she would not have went down. Because the iceburg bounced along the side, it basicily caused a 300 foot long series of buckled plates and popped rivits that was no more the one inch wide.\n\nNick and Dave, I'd thought the same thing for awhile, and the question was raised and studied at the time and long after. The consensus is that she would have sunk even faster (less than an hour). Collision bulkheads are designed and intended as a safeguard against collision between ships, with the energy absorption that entails, not a relatively immovable object like an iceberg. The shock and stress on the entire hull of a 55,000 ton ship x 22 knots hitting the berg dead on would have buckled hull plates the length of the ship, distorted w\/t bulkheads preventing w\/t doors from closing, engines and boilers thrown from their mounts, cut steam and electrical lines, hurling passengers and crew into steel bulkheads, and the list goes on. An easy way to think of it is 2 cars with energy absorbing front ends hitting head on at a combined speed of 50mph versus a car hitting a concrete bridge abutment at 50mph. In the one case you have a trip to the body shop and some minor injuries. With the bridge abutment, you've got a totaled vehicle and casualty collection is done with a dustpan and a broom.\n\nI believe that the theory of ramming the iceberg instead of turning and glancing it, may have already been proven prior to the Titanic tragedy. The Olympic had already had it's bow rammed when it collided with the HMS Hawke, a royal naval vessel. The Olympic survived and was repaired\n\nNot surprising, Captain Smith was on the bridge of the Olympic when that incident occurred. The info i have seen on that does not say he was the Captain in charge of the Olympic, just that he was on the bridge. I do know that Captain Smith was Captain for all maiden voyages of every ship for the White Star Line.\n\nTo canemah: what I get out of you example with the concrete abutment, is that Titanic should not have sank and 1500+ souls should not have been lost, because the ship just scraped the abutment. i guess that's the difference between using a land-based example instead of another water-based example. I think in either example - car vs. car, or car vs. abutment - the car would sink if the collision happened on water.\n\nI'm thinking that there was a ship during WW II that lost its bow either to a typhoon or enemy action, but they operated the ship in reverse and ran it backwards to Pearl Harbor for repairs. Might have been a carrier. Talk about truth being stranger than fiction.\n\nNoah's Ark is not only mythical, it is also impossible. The size of it, as described in th bible, is over 50% too large for any wooden boat to be and still hold together, unless the gopherwood was some kind of now extinct wood that is twice as strong as any other wood on this planet.\n\nAnd, like the Titanic, Noah's Ark also did not survive its maiden voyage, and ended up stranded on rocks.\n\nGod is certainly loving and does not go about looking for who to finish off. But if mortals wilfully do not acknowledge Him, they leave themselves open to attack from evil forces waiting for just that.\n\nHe's just got a funny way of showing it. How many of the 1500 men women and children participated in \"not acknowledging\" him? As I said before no different from the average thug who shoots you for not showing \"respect\".\n\nWith due respect for all lives lost on the tragedy, may I with all humility state that preserving or taking lives is God's prerogative. We will understand it better in eternity. In the meanwhile we are to live our lives in the here and now in acknowledgement of and dependence on Him who is just and loving.\n\nIt would certainly take an eternity to try to reconcile such callous, egotistical and capricious behaviour with the notion of a loving god. You can keep him. I don't intend to spend any time at all engaging in such mental gymnastics.\n\nAnd another reason no one has seemed to mention in the tally of all the deaths....a LOT of the ppl from 3rd class were locked out of being able to get to safety, thus giving the first class rich people more of a chance to \"save themselves\"....with no guilt of course. It doesn't add anything to the cause of the sinking, but sure sheds light on how some lives are valued over others.\n\nSeas were unusually calm that night. Normally, the white caps can be seen at the bottom of the iceberg, but the water was so calm, there was no white-capping at the bottom of the iceberg. They would have been able to spot it sooner.\n\nUs History buffs care, will it change our lives in anyway? Probably not, but there are many people like me who've been fascinated by the Titanic and others like the Edmund Fitzgerald for years and years.\n\nWe all should still care. Those who don't learn from history are bound to repeat it. If you don't learn from your mistakes, you will repeat your mistakes. However you say it, it is important not only to remember, but to learn from it so that is doesn't happen again.\n\nHistory doesn't contain \"lessons\". It only contains information. We have to figure out what the lessons are, for ourselves. And, the point of this article is that there are usually different, even competing \"lessons\", depending on the perspectives of the observers. We all learn from history (its part of our intellectual make up, we can't help it), its just that different people examine things from different perspectives. So, they come to different conclusions about causes. Resulting in recognizing different \"lessons\". You see your cause, and learn your \"lesson\". I see my cause, and learn my \"lesson\". See how it works? You're welcome!\n\nAccording to the Titanic Museum in Pigeon Forge, TN, there was a black Jamaican passenger with his white French wife and 2 daughters on board the Titanic. They were booked in second class, as they were not allowed in first class--their usual way to travel. But they wanted the experience of this fantastic voyage, so they accepted 2nd class. The wife and daughters survived.\n\ndumb comment. there have been 13 titanic movies. even the nazi's made one.(no joke).\n\nit sunk due to the order all back full. they had to completely stop the turn of the props before turning the reverse switch. so for a few seconds maybe more the props became a 93 ton brake. add to that the center shaft was turbine powered and that causes the collision with the iceberg. as water fills the foreward holds and living areas the ship is pulled down by the water's weight and that allows the water to pour over the watertight bulkheads.\n\nship designer thomas andrews wanted enough lifeboats for all passengers and bigger water pumps and the watertight doors to come up to a higher deck but he was overruled all 3 times by whits star line. he went down with the ship"}
{"text":"Security Levels\n\nNMLBS History\n\nThe National Motor Lifeboat School (NMLBS) is located at the mouth of the Columbia River on the United States' northwestern coast at a point of land called \"Cape Disappointment\". The river's strong current runs headlong into the strength of the Pacific Ocean tides at this river mouth and coupled with the frequent storms create some of the roughest waters in the world. Since 1878 this area, also known as the \"Graveyard of the Pacific\", has long been home for Coast Guard rescue facilities and its predecessor the U.S. Lifesaving Service.\n\nDuring the 1960's and early 70's local Coast Guard units pooled their resources in order to conduct coxswain and crew training on the then new 44-foot motor lifeboats. It was acknowledged that these steel-hulled boats were more capable than the wooden 36-foot lifeboats they were replacing. The crews manning them were typically very experienced with the leadership of seasoned veterans whose seamanship skills were passed on directly to each new crewmember. The localized training allowed small groups of Coast Guard crews to share experiences and techniques. A slow trend of decreasing experience base among Coast Guard crews could also be seen through this period.\n\nThe Coast Guard's Thirteenth District (Oregon and Washington coastal area) sought out a method of sharing the lessons learned through hard practical experience with these junior members. They established a training curriculum and routinely gathered their resources to put on classes focused at operating the 44-foot motor lifeboat in the surf environment. The success of these gatherings in passing on skills was soon recognized as\npotentially valuable for all motor lifeboat coxswains nationwide. The training concept was to use experienced Surfmen from the United States northwest coast to show other coxswains from around the nation how best to use the motor lifeboat in its designed element.\n\nResources and budget were identified to give dedicated lifeboats to the newly born school along with personnel to provide maintenance and instruction. With the establishment of a formalized curriculum the U.S. Coast Guard's National Motor Lifeboat School was established in 1980 in Ilwaco, Washington co-located with the existing rescue station at Cape Disappointment. With surf conditions often causing 10 to 20 foot breaking waves and wind \/ sea state extremes such as Beaufort Force 10 across the wide river mouth (also known as a bar), the location was ideal for the lifeboat school. Increased training needs and a focus on standardization have caused the lifeboat school to expand through the years. This included new shore maintenance facilities, offices and classrooms that were dedicated in April 1993."}

{"text":"Bible Stories\n\nThe incredible account of the Voyage of Noah's Ark is an inspiring faith adventure that feature's one man's total dependence on his Creator for his family and in fact, for all of humankind to follow. It is a story that has truly enthralled the generations and when you begin to plumb the depths of the remarkable background facts surrounding the voyage of the ark, the story becomes even more enthralling.\n\nHere was the earth as we know it \u2014 totally covered in water \u2013 leaving a widespread historical legacy of now-fossilized life to be found in the earth's ground. No-one in Noah's time had ever built a seaworthy vessel of any kind. Noah depended on God for all blueprint and design details incl. size, type of wood used, pitching processes, etc.\n\nSome modern-day scientists have determined that, given the 300 x 50 x 30 cubits (a cubit is around 18 inches) 3-level, large volume design, that to fit in every type of animal & living insect of Noah's day would actually have only have taken up around 1\/3rd of the total inside area, leaving ample room for Noah, his family, water and food supplies. Other scientists have agreed that this actual design was deemed to be practically unsinkable.\n\nThe Titanic, designed by Thomas Andrews the head of Harland & Wolff and built by over 15,000 paid Irish shipyard workers between 1908 \u2013 1909 was by comparison also touted as the \"unsinkable ship.\" Yet with a double bottom design and 16 individual watertight compartments, it's fate was very different to that of Noah's Ark.\n\nFor an entertaining narrative of more intriguing background facts by \"Pip The Penguin\" of \"The Animated Kid's Bible\" \u2014 watch Episode 2 \"The Voyage Of The Ark,\" by The Kid's Bible Company and watch \"The Fact File\" within the Main Menu's Special Features.

{"text":"HMS Victory has 3 vertical masts, plus the bowsprit. From the stern (rear) these are: the mizzen mast, the mainmast and the foremast. Each mast is made up of 3 overlapping sections. The lowest section is simply called the mast (e.g. mizzen mast). The middle section is known as the top mast (e.g. main top mast). The highest section is called the topgallant mast (e.g. fore topgallant mast).\n\nProjecting over the bow (front) of the ship is the bowsprit. Like the other 3 masts it is divided into 3 sections. These are: the bowsprit, the jibboom and the flying jibboom.\n\nThe masts were made from light and flexible wood such as fir, pine and spruce. These timbers were obtained from the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) and Norway.\n\nThe original bottom section of the masts were made from a single tree 3ft in diameter. Know as a 'pole mast', the timber for these were obtained from New England, but the American War of Independence interrupted the supply. Because of this a different method of construction was used. Called a 'composite mast', they were made from between 7 and 9 smaller trees that were carefully shaped and joined together.\n\nThe masts currently on the Victory are hollow wrought-iron masts, which were taken from a ship called the Shah in the 1880's. These are lighter than the original wooden masts and require less maintenance"}

{"text":"The Norwegian Coast Guard, or Kystvakten in Norwegian, is a military force and part of the Royal Norwegian Navy, but has separate vessels, many of which are purpose-built. All coast guard vessels have the prefix KV. Four of these vessels are capable of embarking one or more helicopters. Norway's exclusive economic zone, the Coast Guard's area of responsibility, is about 2.2 million square kilometers, the largest in Western Europe. The Coast Guard was formed in 1977 when Norway established a 200 nautical mile economic exclusion zone. At the same time, the former fisheries surveillance was disbanded. The Coast Guard's missions include enforcing Norwegian sovereignty in Norwegian waters, fisheries protection, customs enforcement, environmental protection, search and rescue, assistance at sea, and controlling foreign shipping in Norwegian waters.\n\nIn 2005, the Coast Guard had a budget of NOK 800 million and 800 employees.\n\nContents\n\nThe Fisheries Surveillance Service was established in 1907 with three primary tasks: Border control\u2014controlling that foreign vessels respected national boundaries and rules; auxiliary service\u2014assisting vessels in distress or otherwise requiring assistance; and fisheries protection\u2014protecting fisheries.\n\nAfter World War II, the Fisheries Surveillance Service was assigned to the Royal Norwegian Navy, and until 1961 many of the tasks were carried out by regular naval vessels and hired fishing boats. It is from these days that the practice of hiring private coast guard vessels for government tasks originate\u2014a practice that is now under criticism from many areas and that the Armed Forces wish to reverse[2]\n\nIn 1961, Norway expanded the fisheries zone to 12 nautical miles and the Fisheries Surveillance Service was reorganized and separated with its own commander, personnel and vessels under the name Det sj\u00f8milit\u00e6re fiskerioppsyn (Naval Fisheries Surveillance). When the agreement on the regulations of fisheries in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean (NEAFC) became active in 1970, six Norwegian vessels were reported as inspection vessels. At this time, the Fisheries Surveillance had at its disposal six own vessels in continuous service, three that were used for shorter periods of time, and various fishing boats that were hired in for guarding fisheries.\n\nIn the 1970s, it was clear that oil and gas enterprises and increased international attention to the fisheries resources increased the demands to the Fisheries Surveillance, and in 1974 the so-called Stoltenberg Commission was established. The commission's findings led to the establishment of the Coast Guard on 1 April 1977, at the same time that Norway's 200 nautical mile Economic Exclusion Zone was established.\n\nThe Coast Guard was organized as a Coast Guard Inspectorate in the Navy, with a Coast Guard Inspector as its commander. The service was divided into two regional divisions. Coast Guard Squadrons South and North, with the divide being at 65 degrees north. Coast Guard Squadron South was established at Haakonsvern Naval Station, while Coast Guard Squadron North was established at Sortland after some political quarrel.\n\nAs the Coast Guard was established, the materiel situation was greatly improved. The Coast Guard were assigned ten vessels, of which seven were leased and three large helicopter-carrying vessels of the Nordkapp-class were purchased. The Coast Guard was also assigned two Lockheed P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft.\n\nIn 1996, the Coast Guard was given the responsibility of carrying out various inspection, control and action functions in the inner coastal waters. This led to the establishment of the Indre Kystvakt (Inner Coast Guard), or IKV for short, where the coast was divided into seven zones, with one IKV-vessel in each zone.\n\nOn 1 August 2012, the two administrative Coast Guard Squadrons (North and South) were disbanded and replaced by a single unified Coast Guard, headquartered at Sortland.[3]"}

Faster than full battleships, but not as heavily armed or armoured as them, they were designed to counter the threat of the German \"pocket battleships\" - the Deutschland-class...\n\n, and to plan the first French 35,000 ton battleship.\n\nThe lead ship, Richelieu, was laid down in October 1935. Much stronger than the Dunkerque class, the Richelieu class was designed with speed, armor, armament, and overall technology which compared favourably to contemporary rivals. The turret arrangement for the main battery of eight 380 mm (15 in) guns was unusual, with two 4-gun turrets located forward.\n\nSir Charles Algernon Parsons OM KCB FRS was an Anglo-Irish engineer, best known for his invention of the steam turbine.

The entire main battery could fire forwards, as the ship closed with the enemy, at an angle where she made the smallest possible target.\n\nFor the Richelieu class, this gun arrangement was chosen again, but only after comparison with various other three turrets arrangements (one triple and two double, or two triple and one double, one quadruple and two double, even three triple, as on the Nelson\n\nNelson class battleship\n\nThe Nelson class was a class of two battleships of the British Royal Navy, built shortly after, and under the terms of, the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922...\n\nclass battleships), all carried forward but leading to a less concentrated main battery. But every three turrets arrangement would exceed the Washington Naval Treaty tonnage limits, or have a lower top speed, as in the Nelson class. In November 1934, Vice-Admiral Durand-Viel, Chef d'Etat-major G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Marine choose the two quadruple turret arrangement, the 380 mm\/45 Mod\u00e8le 1935 gun being considered the largest feasible in a quadruple turret.\n\nThe drawback was that a single lucky hit immobilizing or disabling a turret would effectively put half the main battery out of action. So the quadruple turrets of both the Dunkerque and Richelieu class were divided internally to localize damage. The four guns were not in individual mounts because this would have meant an unduly large barbette diameter. Instead there were double mounts for the right and left hand pairs of guns. (In the quadruple 14\" turrets of the British HMSKing George Vclass battleships, the guns were mounted individually.) This design proved effective at Mers-el-Kebir and. However, the guns in each half turret were so close together that when fired simultaneously, there was a wake effect between the shells, which led to excessive dispersal. This problem had not been corrected before 1948.\n\nFor the secondary battery, all early projects kept the 130 mm caliber, in five quadruple turrets, in the same position as on the Dunkerque class, but with two quadruple side turrets in the center of the ship, instead of double turrets. It soon appeared necessary to increase the caliber, however, to 152 mm in triple turrets. The project to have a tertiary anti-aircraft 75 mm caliber battery was momentarily considered, but quickly abandoned. At the very beginning of the war, on November 1939, this idea of a tertiary battery came back, with the fitting, in place of each side central triple 152 mm turret, of three dual mountings of 100 mm guns, removed from the battleship Lorraine\n\nFrench battleship Lorraine\n\nThe Lorraine was a French Navy battleship of the Bretagne class named in honour of the region of Lorraine in France.- Construction :.\n\nAircraft installations (aircraft hangar, hangar and two catapults, for four seaplanes) were fitted on Richelieus stern.\n\nA massive fore control tower was topped by three range finders mounted on the same axis, as on the Dunkerque class. The accumulation of heavy weights high up in the top was noteworthy. The most conspicuous difference from the Dunkerque class was the mounting of the rear main battery rangefinder, not on a separate tower located behind the funnel, but on a kind of, so that the funnel opening was taken out obliquely aft underneath the control position tower.. The hull was floated out on 17 January 1939. Richelieu then left the Salou graving dock, to be armed in one of the Laninon docks at Brest Navy Yards. The bow and the stern, built separately, were attached there, as the Salou graving dock was only 200 m long. Machinery trials began at the end of March 1940.\n\nService entry and Vichy years\n\nIn April 1940, Richelieu went to sea for the first time. In late May and mid-June, the Commanding Officer, Captain Marzin carried out speed and gunnery trials, reaching 32 knots, and firing a few shots from her main and secondary batteries. Due to the advance of German troops, Richelieu hastily left Brest bound for Dakar on June 18, having on board 250 shells but only 48 powder charges for her main battery. Escorted by the destroyers Fougueux\n\nL'Adroit class destroyer\n\nThe Adroit class destroyer was a group of fourteen French navy destroyers laid down in 1925-6 and commissioned from 1928 to 1931...\n\nand Frondeur\n\nL'Adroit class destroyer\n\nThe Adroit class destroyer was a group of fourteen French navy destroyers laid down in 1925-6 and commissioned from 1928 to 1931...\n\n, she reached Dakar on June 23.\n\nAs the local political conditions seemed very dubious in regard of the acceptance of the armistice\n\nArmistice with France (Second Compi\u00e8gne)\n\nThe Second Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne was signed at 18:50 on 22 June 1940 near Compi\u00e8gne, in the department of Oise, between Nazi Germany and France...\n\nbetween France and Germany, Captain Marzin decided to proceed totwo days later, shadowed by a powerful British battle group. Richelieu was sent back to Dakar by the French Admiralty on 28 June where she moored in the outer roadstead, protected only, on the side of the high sea, by a line of five freighters. Her anti-aircraft artillery was very weak. The 152 mm turrets could not fire on aerial targets, as the corresponding uppermost range finder on the fore tower had not been put in service; moreover, shells and powder charges were lacking. Only the six 100 mm turrets were usable. The short range anti-aircraft artillery was only four double 37 mm mountings, four quadruple 13.2 mm Hotchkiss machine gun\n\n13.2 mm Hotchkiss machine gun Second Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne was signed at 18:50 on 22 June 1940 near Compi\u00e8gne, in the department of Oise, between Nazi Germany and France...\n\nprompted British anxiety that the French Navy would be taken over by. This led to attacks from the Royal Navy against the French warships (Operation Catapult), to seize them (in British harbours), sink them (at Mers el-Kebir), or intern them (at Alexandria).

There was a gunnery duel between Richelieu and the British battleships HMS Barham\n\nHMS Barham (1914)\n\nHMS Barham was a Queen Elizabeth-class battleship of the Royal Navy named after Admiral Charles Middleton, 1st Baron Barham, built at the John Brown shipyards in Clydebank, Scotland, and launched in 1914...\n\nand HMS Resolution: the HMS Barham was hit twice by the shore batteries manned by ratings from Richelieu. In the engagement the Richelieu was struck by two 15-inch shells, causing no serious damage, in spite of 250 near misses. Richelieu was damaged in the battle the first time her main battery was fired: a 380 mm shell blew back and disabled two guns in the number 2 main turret: this was traced to the use of a wrong type of propellant. Firing continued during the first day with the other two guns of No 2 main turret. For the second day of the engagement, No 1 main turret was used instead. The propellant for the second day was changed, however this caused serious problems regarding range-finding. In 1941, an inquiry commission under Admiral de Penfentenyo de Kerv\u00e9r\u00e9gen concluded there had been a mistake in the design of the shell base.\n\nDuring the two days, the Richelieu fired a total of 24 rounds. No hits were recorded. The third day, as HMS Resolution had been struck by a torpedo from a French submarine, the British and Free French force retired.\n\nTemporary repairs were completed in Dakar, some light anti-aircraft mountings were added, partly taken from the wreck of the destroyer Audacieux, severely damaged by a heavy cruiser during the battle.\n\nDuring the first months of 1941, Richelieu was the first French battleship to be fitted with French early radar (designated as \"electro-magnetic detection\"). On April 24, 1941, Richelieu could sail at 14 knots (26 km\/h), on three engines, the fourth propeller having been removed.

The fourth barrel from Jean Bart was used for trials at the Dahlgren\n\nNaval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division\n\nThe United States Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division , named for Rear Admiral John A.

The space thus spared on the stern was used to mount 40 mm anti-aircraft guns on the rear deck. The overall anti-aircraft armament was massively reinforced, with 48 20 mm AA guns in single mounts replacing the original 13.2 mm Hotchkiss machine guns, and 14 quad 40 mm turrets replacing the original 37 mm semi-automatic guns. Adoption of US-pattern secondary batteries made providing ammunition easier; a special factory had to be set up to produce ammunition for the main battery. She remained with only two range finders on the fore tower, and the rear mast was shortened. She was fitted with air and surface warning radar, but the U.S. Navy has been reluctant to provide radars for gunnery practice purposes. All these modifications increased the deplacement by 3,000 tons.

{"text":"Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (P.S.N.S.)\n\nThe Puget Sounds Naval Shipyard was established as a naval yard in 1891. During the First World War, this yard built several new ships, including 25 submarine chasers, six submarines, two minesweepers, seven seagoing tugs, two ammunition ships as well as 1,700 smaller boats. Originally, this yard was a repair facility. It then expanded during World War I to include shipbuilding, and ship construction continued until 1979 when it began to focus solely on overhaul work on carriers and submarines.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard primarily worked to repair the damage from battle to the US ships as well as those of the allies. At the start of the war, this was the only yard on the Pacific with the facilities to handle large ships such as the battleships. After the infamous attack on Pearl Harbor, five of six surviving battleships were sent back here for repair as well as modernization. However, you should keep in mind that shipbuilding was only a small part of the operations of this yard.\n\nIt was deemed in 1941 that no more than 20 percent of capacity of navy yards should be used for new construction of ships. The rest should be used for repair in the event of a war. Construction at Puget Sound was mostly limited to smaller vessels, like destroyer escorts. Most of their work was in repairing and upgrading existing ships.\n\nP.S.N.S. also made use of six dry-docks, which was more than most shipbuilding companies of its time. The dry-docks all ranged in size, but dry-dock number five was the most impressive, measuring 1,030 feet long by 147 feet wide by 54 feet deep. Dry-dock No. 3 was considered to be the shipbuilding dock. It was used primarily for ship construction, and it was here that Puget was responsible for an innovation at the end of World War I. Instead of sliding the ship down the traditional incline to launch them, new vessels were launched by flooding the dock, an invention that is still used at countless shipyards today.\n\nAt the end of World War TII, P.S.N.S. began a program that involved modernizing carriers. This included the conversion of conventional flight decks into angled decks. In the Korean War, they entered a new era of construction that had not yet been tackled. They began building a new class of guided missile frigates. 1961 was also a great year, as they were designated as a repair facility for submarines. Another great innovation happened four years later when they were established as a nuclear capable repair facility. By 1987, they were the homeport of the nuclear carrier, USS Nimitz.\n\nPuget Sound Naval Shipyard takes pride in being the biggest and most capable shipyard on the West Coast. It is also the second largest industrial facility in Washington in terms of employees as well as plant investment. The mission of the shipyard is to overhaul and repair a wide variety of ships and submarines for the United States Navy. It also takes pride in serving as the home port for a nuclear aircraft carrier, two nuclear cruisers and three fleet support ships.\n\nThe other capabilities of the yard include the alteration, construction, deactivation and dry-docking of many types of naval vessels. It also pioneered a state of the art emergency power generating system that can provide backup power for all ships in emergencies. As well as doing repair work on site, they also have a program that sends repair technicians on site for repair work. They are also the recipient of the 1991 Commander-in-Chief's Installation Excellence Award.\n\nMany innovations have come from this shipyard. As of 1994, there was a civilian work force of 10,588 and a military work force of 330. The total annual payroll for this year was around $550M. The population in the surrounding area is around 200,000 people. The work force is comprised of 61 percent skilled laborers, 22 percent semi-skilled and one percent unskilled.\n\nThis shipyard is located adjacent to Bremerton and on the west side of Puget Sound. It is also located quite close to the US Navy's Trident Submarine Base, the Fort Lewis Army Base and the McChord Air Force Base. The shipyards in the Puget Sound also have the dark legacy of asbestos exposure and mesothelioma, a rare cancer known only to be caused by prior exposure to asbestos.

They are known as the Guarantee Group.\n\nHeaded by chief architect Thomas Andrews, this select group of shipbuilders was made up of men at the top of their crafts--a distinguished few out of the thousands responsible for building the most sophisticated ship of its time. Suffice it to say, it was considered a huge honor to be a member of the Guarantee Group. Tragically, all nine died in the disaster.\n\nUnfortunately, as Titanic re-discoverer Dr. Robert Ballard has written, \"details of their work have mostly died with them,\" but this gallery tells the stories that we do know about the Guarantee Group.\n\nThomas Andrews\n\nPhotograph Courtesy National Museums Northern Ireland\n\nThomas Andrew, one of the principal architects of RMS Titanic and head of the Guarantee Group, was born in 1873 to a distinguished and well-connected Ulster family. His uncle, Lord Pirrie was the chairman of the shipbuilding firm Harland & Wolff.\n\nIn 1889, at the age of 16, he left school to become an apprentice in his uncle's shipyard. Working in the shipyard by day and taking evening classes in mechanics and naval architecture by night, he learned quickly and rose through the ranks. By 1907 he had become the managing director of the design department and was deeply involved in the construction of Titanic and her sister ships. Despite the family connections that guided his prodigious career, Andrews was regarded as a highly competent manager and ship-builder.\n\nAs leader of the Guarantee Group, Andrews was an active and exacting inspector. He reportedly carried a notebook with him everywhere he went, and frequently consulted the ship's plans. He was even in the habit of checking the ovens in the Titanic's four kitchens for any defects.When Titanic struck the iceberg on April 14, 1912, Captain Smith consulted with Thomas Andrews, the most knowledgeable person on board, to learn the ship's fate. Thomas toured the ship and calculated that the ship would sink in less than two hours. Reports of Thomas' final moments are varied. He was seen handing out lifejackets, helping with lifeboats, and throwing deckchairs in the water to be used as floatation devices. He reportedly was last seen in the first-class smoking room, pondering the ship that he designed.\n\nHe was 39 years old and was survived by his wife, Helen Reilly Barbour, and their daughter, Elizabeth.\n\nRoderick Chisholm\n\nPhotograph Courtesy Deirdre McIntyre\n\nOriginally from Scotland, Roderick worked at Harland & Wolff's shipyard in Clyde before being transferred to Belfast. His father, James, had also worked in shipbuilding, as a journeyman shipwright.Chisholm was the chief draughtsman for both Olympic and Titanic. He worked closely with Thomas Andrews on the design of both ships.\n\nDue to his extensive knowledge of the ship and as a reward for his considerable contributions, Chisholm was selected to serve on the ship's Guarantee Group and sailed with the ship on her maiden voyage. Although he was responsible for the design of the ship's lifeboats, he himself did not make it into one and lost his life with the ship.\n\nAnthony Wood Frost\n\nPhotograph Courtesy Ian Frost\n\nAnthony \"Artie\" Frost joined Harland and Wolff as a machine-boy in 1888, at the young age of fourteen. Shipbuilding was a family career and his father was already working at the yard as a foreman fitter. By the time Titanic began construction, Artie's father was retiring and Artie took on his dad's position for the first time, supervising the installation of machinery on board Titanic.\n\nAfter Titanic collided with the iceberg, Artie reportedly made his way down to the engine room where he was last seen working to keep the ship's lights on.\n\nArtie's daughter, Marjorie, became the first president of the Ulster Titanic Society and helped lead Belfast's gradual recognition that Titanic was not embarrassment, but rather an accident.\n\nWilliam Henry Marsh Parr\n\nPhotograph Courtesy David Marks\n\nWilliam Parr joined Harland & Wolff in 1910, just in time to become an assistant manager in the electrical department for Olympic and Titanic. He supervised electrical installations on both ships.\n\nLetters indicate that after the collision with the iceberg, Parr was working diligently in the engine room, keeping the lights running until the ship's final moments.\n\nFrancis Parkes\n\nPhotograph Courtesy Fred Parkes\n\nBorn into a large family, Frank Parkes began work at Harland & Wolff alongside his four brothers at the age of 16. At the age of 21 he was recognized as a top apprentice plumber and his exemplary work singled him out as the only Parkes to accompany Titanic on its maiden voyage.\n\nFollowing the tragedy, Frank's friends presented his mother with a large, framed memorial portrait, which the family keeps to this day.\n\nWorkers and Propeller\n\nLittle is known of William Campbell, beyond his employment as a young apprentice joiner at Harland & Wolff. It's apparent that inclusion on the Guarantee Group was not limited to the older, experienced employees at Harland & Wolff. Talented, up-and-coming young apprentices were often recognized with a trip on the maiden voyage as part of the Guarantee Group.\n\nLike all members of the group, Campbell lost his life on the ship and his body was never recovered.\n\nHarland & Wolff Workers\n\n[Photo: Workers disembark from an almost completed ship at the Thompson Graving Dock in Belfast.]\n\nAlfred Fleming Cunningham was an apprentice fitter for Harland & Wolff. He was initially reported to have survived the Titanic disaster by local newspapers due to the fact that there was another A. Cunningham, (a steward), on board the ship. Several days after receiving the good news, his family was told the horrible truth.\n\nHarland & Wolff Workers\n\n[Copy of press photograph.

He'd recently studied and received several academic awards at the Belfast Municipal Technical Institute. Ennis is known to have played cricket with Thomas Andrews, who apparently recognized his potential and encouraged his budding shipbuilding career."}

{"text":"Posts Tagged 'adventure cruising'\n\nSmithsonian Study Leader Cassandra Hannahs is a medieval historian specializing in British cultural and architectural history. Here, she describes an action-packed day including sea birds, the Broch of Mousa, and former Irish President Mary Robinson with Smithsonian travelers on our Exploring the British and Irish Isles adventure cruise.\n\nCassandra Hannahs at Orkney.\n\nAs we had been sailing around northern Scotland over the past few days, from the Hebrides to Loch Ewe, Fair Isle, Orkney and Shetland, I was thinking about Vikings, especially since we would be ending our journey in Norway, essentially retracing the water routes of Norsemen a thousand years ago. But this day in Shetland took us back long before the Vikings as well as long after, with a healthy dose of hiking and bird watching thrown in.\nDuring breakfast the captain brought the ship along the southeastern coast of the Mainland of Shetland to the much smaller island of Mousa where we anchored and disembarked in zodiacs. A group of us started out hiking across the island with the ship's naturalist and ornithologist Richard White, who pointed out the many types of sea birds \u2014 including northern gannets, storm-petrels, red-throated loons, and many more \u2014 found along the cliffs. My personal hope of seeing a puffin was not yet realized, but we did get a close view of an otter who suddenly bolted from a boulder beside our path and disappeared between the rocks.\n\nMousa Broch. Photo: Langus\n\nReturning to the landing site, we then explored the Broch of Mousa, which is a massive round tower over forty feet high with inner and outer stone walls flanking an internal staircase up to the top. Built around two thousand years ago, the broch had raised floors which probably served as the main living areas, and various niches for sleeping or storage areas. As the tallest prehistoric structure in Europe and one of the best preserved, the Broch of Mousa is a stunning testament to the engineering skill of its Iron Age builders.\n\nWe returned to the ship in time to hear the former president of Ireland, Mary Robinson, give a talk on board. President Robinson was traveling with us after having just attended Queen Elizabeth II's first State Visit to Ireland the previous week, and she spoke about the significance of the Queen's visit as a moment healing between England and Ireland. As she spoke, we traveled to Lerwick which is the main port and capital of the Shetland Islands.\n\nStretching our legs after lunch, we set out for the southern end of the main island where we hiked up to the Sumburgh Head and viewed the impressive vista from the cliffs around the lighthouse. To our delight, there was a crowd of puffins nesting just a few feet from the walls where we were standing. It was wonderful to watch them in flight, beating their wings so fast they became a blur. I have read that puffins resemble black and white footballs when they fly, but to me they looked more like a cross between penguins and bumblebees.\n\nHaving finally had our fill of puffins, we set off across the grassy fields to the archaeological site of Jarlshof. The occupation of this extraordinary site spans the bronze, iron, medieval and early modern ages, with the earliest houses dating from between 2500 and 1500 B.C. and the latest building, Earl Patrick's \"Old House,\" dating from the seventeenth century A.D. Between these periods, the Norse lived here as well, with a settlement at Jarlshof that lasted from the ninth to the thirteenth centuries. A vital hub in the sea routes between Scandinavia, Ireland, Britain, Iceland and Greenland, Jarlshof brought me back to my earlier thoughts of Vikings, and reinforced once more how so many places on this journey around the British and Irish Isles which seem remote and isolated to us today were at the center of earlier cultural geographies based on seafaring.\n\nReady for your own British Isles adventure?

Sharp\n\nWhen you see Titanic, remember Annie\nFunk\n\nJames Cameron's spectacular movie, Titanic, has\nbeen a gigantic success at the box-office, with sales of $500\nmillion. Kate Winslet plays the lead role of Rose DeWitt Bukater,\na 17-year-old, upper class American, unhappily engaged to a stifling\naristocrat. On the ship she falls in love with a free-spirited\nsteerage passenger, Jack Dawson, played by Leonardo DiCaprio.\nRomance turns to action, suspense and tragedy when the Titanic\nsinks. But Cameron ignored the dramatic real-life story of Annie\nC. Funk, a Mennonite missionary also on board the ill-fated ship.\n\nAnnie Funk served as a missionary in the Central Province\nof India from 1906 to 1915. Her home congregation, the Hereford\nGeneral Conference Mennonite Church in the Butter Valley of eastern\nPennsylvania, had nurtured her interest in missions from the\ntime she was a child. After several stateside assignments, she\nwas called to go overseas. Annie gave an unqualified testimony\nof her trust in God's care when she answered a friend who\nfeared for her safety on her first transatlantic voyage: \"Our\nheavenly Father is as near to us on sea as on land. My trust\nis in Him. I have no fear.\"\n\nAnnie's work included the founding and management of\na school for girls in Janjgir, India, which was later renamed\nin her memory. Her work there was interrupted one day by a telegram,\nwhich urged her to come home to as soon as possible, and that\nher passage was paid. She was not told that her mother was close\nto death. Annie quickly made travel plans. In her final letter,\nwritten somewhere \"Near Suez,\" she worried about what\nthe French would charge for her \"excess baggage\" on\nthe overland route from Versailles to London. She estimated it\nwould take three more weeks to get back home to Butter Valley,\n\"if the weather and strikes do not prevent\" it. When\nshe arrived in Southampton, England, she learned that her ship,\nthe S.S. Havorford, would be delayed by a coal strike.\nShe was guided to another ship\u2014a new one called the Titanic.\nSome were saying this was a modern marvel that \"God, himself\ncouldn't sink.\" Though it cost more, Annie was assured that\npassage on the Titanic would get her home in record time.\nShe boarded as a second-class passenger.\n\nThe Titanic was the White Star Line's proudest accomplishment.\nNo cost had been spared. It was the largest, fastest, most luxurious\nship ever built. This highly acclaimed, maiden voyage would break\nall transatlantic speed records. Many luminaries were aboard\u2014in\nfirst-class accommodations, of course. The ship's captain,\nEdward J. Smith was to retire after he docked\nin New York Harbor. \"So far,\" he had said, his career\nas a ship's captain \"had been uneventful.\" That was\nabout to change. The Titanic steamed out of Southampton's\ndock at noon on April 10, 1912.\n\nNear midnight, four days later the ship struck an iceberg,\nin spite of repeated warnings. The \"unsinkable\" dream\nship began to sink into the icy waters of the North Atlantic\nOcean about 400 miles off the coast of Newfoundland. As elaborately\nas the ship had been furnished, sadly, it lacked an essential\nsafety feature\u2014sufficient lifeboats for all 2, 207 passengers.\nIt was immediately evident that many would not be saved. What\nabout Annie? An unconfirmed report has it that Annie Funk, already\nseated in a lifeboat, gave up her seat to another woman\u2014a\nmother with children. Whether true or not, those who knew her\nsaid, \"That would be just like Annie.\" She, along with\n1500 others, perished in the greatest catastrophe yet known.\nThe mighty Titanic was no more. The date was April 15,\n1912.\n\nJames Cameron's film made $500 million in box-office\nsales. But he neglected to tell the priceless story of a Mennonite\nwoman who gave herself to the people of Janjgir, India\u2014and\nperhaps, died in the place of another woman on the Titanic.\n\nMenno Simons and the Nazi Hunters\n\nAt the end of WW II the Allied army scoured the German countryside\nfor Nazi soldiers in hiding. A company of American troops approached\nthe home of the Christian Landes family, Mennonites who lived\nnear Lautenbach. The officer asked about German soldiers and\ndemanded entrance to the house. Father Landes said there were\nno soldiers hiding in his house. Not trusting the patriarch's\nword, the officer ordered a search.\n\nWhen the officer stepped into the living room of the Landes\nhouse, a familiar image on the wall caught his eye. It was a\nportrait of Menno Simons. So, these were Mennonites. He immediately\ncalled off the search, and gave this explanation to the confused\nsoldiers: \"These people are Mennonites. If they say there\nare no Nazis here, I believe them. Let's go!\"\n\nThe astounded Landes family asked how he recognized the portrait\nof Menno. The officer said he was from Pennsylvania, where he\nhad lived among Mennonites. He had learned to know them as honest\npeople, who could be trusted to tell the truth.\n\nCaring for Memory in the Midst of Integration\n\n\"One day in June 1916 Noah Long, a trustee in the Clinton\nFrame Amish Mennonite Church, went to the church house five miles\neast of Goshen, Indiana, with a ladder and some white paint.\nHe climbed above the entrance to the sign, \"Clinton Frame\nAmish Mennonite Church,\" and expunged the word Amish.\"\nThat's how Paton Yoder tells the story in Tradition and\nTransition. But what was the point? Noah Long was helping\nintegration along. Not the current integration of MCs, GCs and\nCMCs, of course, but rather, the integration of Mennonite and\nAmish Mennonite conferences early in this century.\n\nNoah Long's conference, the Indiana-Michigan Amish Mennonite\nConference had just voted to integrate with its Mennonite counterpart,\nthe Indiana-Michigan Mennonite Conference. Noah wasted no time\nin noting the change on his congregation's hand-painted\nsign.\n\nMost of the members approved of their trustee's action,\nbut others grumbled that he was rushing things too much. Nevertheless,\nthe Clinton Frame congregation was no longer Amish Mennonite.\nOther congregations and conferences followed their lead, so that\nby 1927, official integration of Amish Mennonite conferences\nand Mennonite conferences had been achieved.\n\nWhat were the results? Paton Yoder makes this observation:\n\"In dropping Amish from their name, the Amish Mennonites\nhad undoubtedly facilitated the merger, but at a price. Although\nconstituting more than half of the union, the Amish Mennonites\nhad unwittingly covered their tracks\" (Tradition &\nTransition [Herald Press, 1991], p. 17).\n\nFour-score and two years later, we are again in the midst\nof a major integration. The Mennonite Church, the General Conference\nMennonite Church and the Conference of Mennonites in Canada are\nforging a new Mennonite Church. Some of us, like trustee Noah\nLong, are ready to get this thing done! Others of us, like some\nmembers of Long's congregation, fear we are moving with\ntoo much haste.\n\nSome are focusing on the joy and hope in this new union, believing\nthat we are fulfilling Jesus' prayer \"that they become\none.\" We anticipate new energy, greater clarity of mission\nand purpose, and we hope for greater efficiency in our ministries.\nBut we also experience pain. We're losing something, too\u2014the\nfamiliarity of long affiliation in our own conferences and churchwide\nministries, familiar faces, names, and polity. It will never\nbe the same.\n\nThis is appropriate and to be expected. But what else will\nbe lost? What will historians, with the benefit of hindsight,\nwrite about us four-score years from now? Will they write that\nwe, too, have paid a price? Will they say that we, too, have\ncovered our tracks?\n\nWe do not need to repeat the history of Amish Mennonites in\nthe last merger\u2014to lose the sense of our past identity,\nour stories. However the organizational lines are redrawn, and\nwhatever shape new charts and structures are given, it is essential\nthat we nurture the memory of our own particular pilgrimage\u2014even\nas we hear and embrace the new stories of other pilgrimages.\n\nOrganizational structures will not nurture collective memory.\nA strong sense of memory, however, can survive most any organizational\nstructure."}

In 1803 while he was Minister to France, he and Fulton built a steamboat and operated it on With this success he contracted with Fulton to take advantage of the Hudson River monopoly.\n\nThe ship was built at Charlie Browne's shipyard in New York and fitted with steam engines from England. Her original dimensions were 130 feet (39.6 m) long x 16 feet (4.9 m) wide x 7 feet (2.1 m) deep. The ship had a paddle wheel on each side, but also masts and sails. Skeptics called her \"Fulton's Folly\".\n\nFirst voyage\n\nThe inaugural run, helmed by Captain Andrew Brink, from New York to Albany, with invited guests, left on August 17, 1807 and arrived two days later, after 32 hours of travel time and a 20-hour stop at Livingston's estate Clermont Manor\n\nClermont Manor\n\nThe Clermont State Historic Site, also known as the Clermont estate, the Clermont Manor or just Clermont, is a New York State Historic Site in southwestern Columbia County, New York, USA...\n\n.

The rebuilding was substantial: the ship was made longer and wider, and the paddlewheels were enclosed to prevent damage and splashing. Later the name was shortened to North River.\n\nSubsequent events\n\nIn its first year, the new navigation service differentiated itself from all of its predecessors by turning a tidy profit. The quick commercial success of North River Steamboat led Livingston and Fulton to commission a second very similar boat in 1809, Car of Neptune, followed in 1811 by Paragon. An advertisement for the company in 1812 lists the three boats' schedules, using the name North River for the original vessel. When Fulton died in 1815, he had built a total of seventeen steamboats, and a half-dozen more were constructed by other builders using his plans.\n\nLivingston died in 1813 and passed his shares of the steamboat company on to his sons-in-law. With Fulton's death in 1815, the original power behind the partnership dissolved; this left the company with its monopoly in New York waters prey to other hungry American businessmen.

{"text":"Thorikto Averof Ten years after the Greek -- Turkish War of 1897, (More)Ten years after the Greek -- Turkish War of 1897, the Hellenic Navy had only antiquated torpedo -- ships and three battleships, manufactured in 1889. The need to create an effective fleet resulted at the end of 1908 in its reinforcement. Four brand new English and four German destroyers (torpedo -- ships) were aquired. In adittion, the Battleship \"G. Averoff\", the pride of the Hellenic Navy, joined the fleet. For the resuscitation of the fleet, the re-elected government of Mavromichalis approached the Orlando Shipyards, at Livorno, Italy, where at the time, a battleship was under construction. It had been ordered and then cancelled by the Italian Navy. The Greeks offered to advance one third of its total cost and thus ,secured the acquisition of the battleship. The amount given in advance came from George Averoff' s will and the rest of the cost was covered by a loan from abroad. George Averoff had been a wealthy Greek patriot and benefactor.He had willed funds for the Greek Navy to acquire a training ship for the Greek Naval Academy. The 10.200 tn, steel plated warship had Italian engines of 19.000 hp, 22 French boilers, German generators and English Armstrong type cannons of 190 and 234 millimeters. Its top speed was 23 knots. \"G. Averoff\" was launched on the 27 th February 1910. It arrived at Faliro Bay on the 1 st of September 1911, where the Greeks welcomed it with enthusiasm. The battleship, with the beginning of the First Balkan War in October of 1912, was at the head of the Aegean Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Paylos Kontouriotis and set sail to Dardanelles. It took over Limnos where the anchorage of the fleet was established in Moudros bay. After that, the liberation of Aghio Oros and the East and North Aegean islands (Thasos, Samothraki, Tenedos, Aghios Eustratios, Mitilini, Chios) took place . An engagement with the Turkish fleet was inevitable. Rear Admiral Kountouriotis' plan favoured a battle offensive. On December 3th 1912 , he ordered the fleet to sail towards the Ottoman fleet that had made its appearance at the exit of the Dardanelles. Kountouriotis dispatched his famous signal to the Greek ships which were led by \"G. Averoff\". \"By the power of God and the wishes of our King and in the name of justice, I sail towards the victory against the enemy of the Nation.\" The successful result of the battles of Elli and Limnos that followed, discouraged the Sultan and the Sublime Porte's expectations of controlling the Aegean Sea. The Ottoman Fleet would never attempt another exit to the Aegean. Greece remained neutral during most of World War I. The Eleutherios Venizelos government in 1917 decided to participate on the Allies' side. At the end of the first World War in November 1918 -- Turkey capitulated (Moudros truce) and Greece was on the winners' side. \"G.Averoff\" sailed to Constantinople and raised the Greek flag as one of the winning powers of the Great War. After, the signing of the peace treaties, \"G.Averoff\" with the rest of the fleet moved the Greek troops to Asia Minor.. In 1941 after the start of World War II, the Greek fleet had moved to Alexandria with \"G.Averoff\" at the lead. From Alexandria, the battleship was dispatched to Bombay to patrol the Indian Ocean. At the end of the war 'G.Averoff\" anchored with the rest of the fleet at Faliro (17 Oct.1944) having brought back the Greek government from its exile in Cairo. In 1952'G. Averoff' was decommissioned. From 1956 until 1983, the battleship was moved to Poros. In 1984, the Navy decided to restore it as a museum. Thirty years after being set aside, the battleship was on a new course. The ship was moved from Poros to its present location at P.Faliro, where the restoration took place. The cost for the stabilization and the restoration from 1985 until today is vety large. A large percentage of it comes from donations, the most important of which are those of the Cyprus Democracy, the Latsis family and the Onasis foundation. Today the \"G. Averoff \" battleship museum honors those who served and died during its time of active service. It also keeps alive a sense of the Greek Navy's heritage. The battleship serves its educational purposes by hosting day visits from schools, institutions, organizations and private individuals. Those visits fulfil the second part of the donors' , George Averoff's, vision who wished the ship to fulfill an educational purpose. (Less)"}
{"text":"This outstanding preserved example of a Steam Pinnace is currently moored at Fort Blockhouse, Gosport (formerly HMS Dolphin, the Submarine base).\nShe was built in 1911 at Samuel White's yard at Cowes on the Isle of Wight. By 1914, she was one of 634 examples on the Navy List. She is thought to have been one of two allocated to HMS Monarch as a guard ship. In 1918, a counter stern and brass funnel was added and she changed role to an Admirals barge.\nFollowing Monarchs de-commissioning in 1925, she was used as a harbour launch and a tender to the Royal Naval Hospital at Netley. Sold off in 1949, she was stored at Weevil Creek in Gosport.\nSold again in 1952, she was used as a houseboat on the Thames and renamed 'Ttreleague'. The voyage to the Thames is fully documented in Commander Stapleton's book on Steam Pinnaces. She remained on the Thames for a number of years, her condition steadily deteriorating. Her steam engine was removed and replaced by a petrol engine (sacrilege), eventually being sold for the princely sum of \u00a35:00 to an antique dealer.\nRestoration was commenced but funding was inadequate. She was eventually acquired by the Royal Navy Museum in 1979 for restoration by the Steam Launch Restoration Group in Gosport. She was fitted with a Pinnace boiler and compound engine from a similar vessel donated by the Royal Navy engineering branch at HMS Sultan, Gosport. The Maritime Workshop now have responsibility for her maintenance, manning and management.\nRe-commissioned in 1984, she was used as VIP transport and moored in the Mast Pond in Portsmouth Historic Dockyard. Remaining there until 1998, she was again sent to the Maritime Workshop for a complete re-fit. Steam Pinnace 199 is believed to be the last remaining naval steamboat and is listed in the National Historic Ships Register as a designated vessel.\n\nThe engine room also houses the main condenser which converts the waste steam back into water for the boiler, circulating sea water for cooling the condenser and two engine driven feed pumps for maintaining the water supply to the boiler.\nBoiler:\n\nHoused in a separate compartment to the engine.\nType: Three drum Yarrow built by the Thames Iron Works in 1898.\nConverted from coal to oil firing in the 1920's.\nLaidlaw Drew burner fuelled by paraffin.\nOperating pressure of 140 \u2013 160 psi reached in 2 hours.\nMumford donkey pump used for bilge pumping any of the five compartments and pumping feed water from the tanks or hot wells into the boiler as and when needed.\n\nArmament:\n\nHotchkiss 3 pdr gun built in 1887.\nRe-proofed, 1945.\nPreviously fitted to an armed yacht sunk later that year and salvaged from a trawlers nets in 1980.\nWhen armed, Pinnaces were known as Picket boats to protect capital ships against torpedo attack. Their speed and quick firing made them a formidable adversary in the 1880's \u2013 1890's.\n\nOther armament:\n\nOne light Maxim machine gun fitted onto the cabin roof.\nRifles stowed in after cockpit.\nTwo torpedoes occasionally carried in racks on either side of the hull.\n\nNote: Could it have been one of these vessels that was observed 100 feet in the air, upside down, when HMS Queen Mary exploded ?\n\nRegards,\nBob\n\n7348\n\nBatstiger\n\n06-05-2008, 19:25\n\nHere's a nice picture of a steam pinnace amongst the Nelson's secondary armament.\n\nBob.\n\nbob shayler\n\n06-05-2008, 19:35\n\nThanks for that Bob,\nA brilliant photo.

She has just been out of the water (May\/June 2011) at Trafalgar Wharf, Portchester (the old Vospers' Yard) to touch up the antifoul, sides and other paintwork ready for a shortened 2011 season. Her 10-year boiler certification expires this summer when she was due for some fairly major work - boiler and engine out, refit their wooden bearers and some work on the keel.\nShe was looking good when she left Trafalgar Wharf after a lot of hard work by Group 199 volunteers who operate and maintain her. Photos attached - she has her funnel and gun removed at this point for cleaning.\nSadly the next day she failed her annual boiler certification when a major tube leak was detected. At least better then than underway steam conditions! This means she will now be out of action this season until the boiler has been refitted. This also meant a short notice cancellation of our appearence at the Old Gaffers meet at Yarmouth, IoW. Our apologies for that.\nWe are hoping to have her towed alongside in Portsmouth Dockyard for the Museum's centenary celebrations 28 June - 1st July. Actual dates to be confirmed.\nWe are always looking for new volunteers - contact can be made through the Royal Naval Museum, Porytsmouth which is now part of the National Museum of the Royal Navy, who own her. Naval, engineering or shipwright background ideal but not essential - just lots of enthusism for brass polishing needed!\nI email a monthly newsletter related to 199 and capital ships and events of her period to Group 199 volunteers and other interested friends and supporters.\n\nGroup 199 Membership Secretary\n\nJohn Odom\n\n09-06-2011, 11:23\n\nThanks for the report. I hope you can sometime post pictures of the boilers and machinery. I am a member of a local blacksmith club that meets at a steam railroad museum shop.

A colleague who is an acknowledged expert on pinnaces tells me: \"The picture is one of two originally published by Wright and Logan in Southsea, both showing the admirals steam barge based in Portsmouth which was used by royalty and VIP's before WW II.\n\nBoth pictures show her in 1934 off Whalley Steps in Fountain Lake. The objects in the background are the old floating dock and associated structures.\n\nAdmirals steam barges evolved in the 1880's rather earlier than steam picket boats and were quite the most handsome design used by the navy. They never carried a gun, always used teak skylights with a handrail forward and of course carried larger stern cabins and a counter stern. hey were slower than picket boats however.\n\nThis boat was bought by Barry Millership after the war and in 1985\/90 was being restored by Barry in our yard. He lived in Essex however and progress was necessarily slow. Eventually she found a berth at the Motor Boat museum at Pitsea before being donated (?) to the Royal Yacht Britannia. There she was totally neglected in a deserted area of Leith Docks for some ten years before being sent down to the Maritime Workshop once again for breaking up. A very sad end to a once beautiful vessel.\"\n\nHope that's of interest. I must admit I thought the background looked liked Fort St Angelo having spent a year out there in the early 60s.\n\nPlumber\n\nPlumber03\n\n02-02-2012, 16:39\n\nAnother update on steam pinnace 199. We have been lucky enough to have obtained a Heritage Lottery Fund grant plus further funds from the Friends of the National Museum of the Royal Navy (Portsmsouth) and others. The plan is for 199 to be lifted out at the Maritime Workshop in Gosport later in Feb 2012 for work on her boiler, engine and hull.\nWe will be open to visitors by arrangement and are also offering presentations locally on 199 - her background, history and Group 199 who operate her.\nWe are delighted to hear from anyone who would like to volunteer to help - engineering or shipwright experience a bonus but not essential - just some time and enthusiasm needed.\nYou can make contact with Group 199 through the museum.\n\ncockneydruid\n\n01-05-2012, 12:42\n\nHi all,\n\nHave just seen this thread and thought I would mention that Commander Martin Marks OBE Royal Navy will be giving a talk - Steam Pinnace 199 - The story of a 101 year old naval gunboat - on Thursday 3rd May at Gosport Discovery Centre, 7.30-8.45pm.\n\nTickets are priced at \u00a33 (\u00a32 concessions) and are available from Gosport Discovery Centre.\n\nseaJane\n\n01-05-2012, 13:37\n\nWhoo!

{"text":"Old Torpedo Pulled Off Ocean Floor\n\nAugust 15, 1998|By PETER BERNARD Staff Writer\n\nNavy divers worked quickly Friday to retrieve a WWII-era training torpedo from the ocean floor off Pompano Beach.\n\nAfter 30 minutes of digging sand from around the torpedo, which was discovered about three weeks ago in 75 feet of water, the divers slipped a harness attached to a large air bag around the relic and raised it to the surface.\n\nNo one knows how long the torpedo had been on the sandy bottom, but the date on the side of the Mark 13 training torpedo reads 1942.\n\n``We found some serial numbers on the side of it,'' said Chief Warrant Officer Steve Bebow of the Navy's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Detachment, which was sent from Mayport on Wednesday to look at the torpedo. ``But Navy archives might not date back that far. We'll probably never know exactly where it came from.''\n\nAfter it was brought to the surface, the 13-foot, 2,000-pound device was slowly towed to the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Port Everglades by Vone, a boat belonging to diver Stephen Attis of Pompano Beach.\n\nAttis found the torpedo while working with Historic Shipwreck Expeditions, a company that searches for historical artifacts on the ocean floor.\n\nAt first Attis and his fellow divers thought the torpedo might have been an unexploded German torpedo-mine, causing them to report their find to the Navy.\n\nThe torpedo might contain dye packs that can produce toxic gases when in contact with air, or have steering mechanisms that can still contain pressurized air even after 50 years. But Navy divers say the torpedo isn't particularly dangerous. After the Navy team finishes its research and makes sure any potential hazards have been removed the torpedo will probably be dismantled for scrap metal, Bebow said."}

{"text":"Local fishermen risked their lives, playing a modest role in a mammoth conflict\n\n\"Now we have some really nice boats being built,\" Felando said, \"just in time for the war.\"\n\nShortly after Pearl Harbor, the Japanese \u2014 once central players in the tuna industry \u2014 were interned. Then the military, short of supply vessels, jealously eyed the dozens of clippers anchored in San Diego Bay. The Army took a few as tugs. The Navy's need was greater, though, and chartered most of San Diego's larger fishing boats.\n\nBut who would sail these clippers? \"They're complicated vessels,\" Felando said, citing the intricate engines and refrigeration systems.\n\nW.J. Morcott, a retired Navy commander who served as San Diego Port Director, asked for volunteers. Roughly 600 fishermen stepped forward and were immediately give Navy ranks and ratings.\n\nAfter patrolling the waters off the Panama Canal, by spring 1942 most of the Yippies were in the war's Pacific Theater. Painted battleship gray, armed with machine guns and depth charges, bearing their new Navy designations \u2014 Madruga's Paramount, for instance, was re-christened YP-289 \u2014 the Yippies looked warlike. But only to civilians.\n\nTo Japanese warships, they looked like pushovers. To American crew members like Judd Zolezzi, who knew these boats were too weak to fight and too slow to flee, they looked doomed.\n\nZolezzi, who survived the war, died years ago. But a nephew still remembers his uncle's sardonic assessment of his Yippie: \"We were something for the Japanese to shoot at.\"\n\nLost race, lost boat\n\nBecause the Yippies were helpless in combat, some believed they were useless in war. Rear Adm. Samuel Eliot Morison, a historian of the U.S. Navy in World War II, reported that Atlantic-based YPs were less than gallant when cornered by U-boats. Crew members, Morison maintained, agreed not to radio the German submarines' coordinates in exchange for being allowed to safely abandon ship.\n\n\"He sort of gave the YPs a bad rap,\" Bruhn said.\n\nOne of San Diego's tuna boats, turned into a Navy yard patrol vessel\n\nBut Yippies in the Pacific, far from being accused of cowardice, won more than a dozen battle stars and several Presidential Unit Citations. In September 1942, the Prospect, YP-346, transported a band of Marine Raiders from Tulagi to Guadalcanal. Skipper Joaquin Theodore accomplished this mission safely, then headed back to Tulagi.\n\nTheodore was warned that a Japanese cruiser and two destroyers were cruising The Slot, the narrow channel he had to cross.\n\n\"This was not our first race against enemy ships in the channel,\" Vincent Battaglia, a San Diego tuna fisherman who served aboard the Prospect, noted in a postwar manuscript cited by Felando and other students of the Yippies. \"It's the first race we lost.\"\n\nAs Prospect neared Tulagi harbor, the Japanese cruiser lit the midnight sky with a flare \u2014 and then ripped into Prospect. Shells battered the wooden hull, fragmented the pilot house and punctured pipes. Shrapnel hit Theodore in the chest; an electrician was blown off the vessel. Fifty yards from shore, men began leaping into the water, but Ernie Lopez remained aboard and beached the craft.\n\n\"Here,\" Battaglia recounted, \"the Marines were able to remove the wounded.\""}

{"text":"Until next time,\n\nLeeAnne Gordon and the crew of Lynx\n\nGood morning!\n\nThe past 24 hours have seen a variety of weather cross Lynx's decks, starting with the strong southerly breezes that helped us pull away from the North Carolina capes and around Cape Hatteras. As we rounded Cape Hatteras, the crew took in the reefed fore tops'l and reefed mains'l before wearing ship to head closer in toward shore. Last night's weather forecast had a strong cold front coming overhead, along with the possibility of severe thunderstorms and rain.\nNever ones to shy away from weather, the crew gritted their teeth and bore through, standing watch in periods of rain last night as the cold front passed and the temperature dropped.\nBehind the cold front, we have found lighter airs and this morning we were able to shake the reef in the main and set it, along with the jib and fore tops'l. Currently in about 10 knots of NW'ly wind, we are making just over 4 knots toward the eastern tip of Long Island. Mileage-wise, the vessel is better than halfway to her destination. Time-wise, however, may be a different story. We'll keep you posted as things progress.LeeAnne Gordon\n\nGood morning!\n\nLynx is underway for Greenport, and making great speeds!Waimea resident Woodson Woods dreamed of a tall ship with a sleek hull and rakish masts. This lifelong sailor and serious maritime history student fascinated by the War of 1812 decided in 1997 to build this ship.\n\n\"I wanted to create for others the rewards garnered from a deep interest in maritime history and the rich world of the sea,\" he said.\n\nWoods spent $3 million and four years to create a wooden boat designed after an actual privateer named Lynx, built by Thomas Kemp in Fell's Point, Md. The swift, historical ship was among the first to defend American freedom by evading the British naval fleet, then blockading ports.\n\nHis modern Lynx, inspired by the original and completed in 2001, teaches American history, sailing, celestial navigation and environmental issues. To date, it has welcomed more than a million people aboard for adventure sails, sail training programs and dockside tours.\n\nRecognizing the impact the Lynx has made, the National Maritime Historical Society is honoring Woods by giving him the 2011 Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Maritime Education. He will receive the award at a gala dinner Oct. 12 at the New York Yacht Club.\n\nNational Maritime Historical Society chairman Ronald Oswald praised Woods for \"(his) design, building and crewing of the 1812 privateer Lynx, but most specifically for creating the Lynx sailing program to incorporate sail training with a hands-on educational experience of history.\"\n\n\"The award recognizes work that teaches maritime history in a way that conveys the challenges, excitement and leading role of our seafaring past in creating today's world,\" he added.\n\nWoods serves as president of the board of directors for the Lynx Educational Foundation, a nonprofit overseeing operations of the ship and its interactive sail training program designed to enrich personal achievement through team and discipline. He was \"surprised, overwhelmed, honored and humbled\" by the award.\n\n\"An operation such as ours is the work of many dedicated individuals who give of their time, energy and commitment \u2014 as is the organization which oversees it,\" he said.\n\nLynx sails as \"a living history museum,\" sharing the story of America's struggle to preserve its independence. Fitted with period ordnance and flying pennants and flags from the 1812 era, the eight-member crew wears period uniforms \u2014 striped shirts and bell bottoms \u2014 in keeping with the maritime traditions, Woods said.\n\n\"Lynx provides a training ground for children and adults, giving them the opportunity to learn the ways of seafarers in the 18th and 19th centuries,\" he said. \"Lynx explores the role played by privateers in American history, as well as teaches the important lessons of the Revolutionary War.\"\n\nA common misconception is privateers were pirates. Woods explained privateers were owners of private vessels who were granted special permission to take shipping from enemy vessels and given a portion of the profits.\n\nLynx was based in Newport Beach, Calif., from May 2002 until 2009, when the ship traveled to the East Coast through the Panama Canal. Lynx took six cruises from California to Hawaii during the summers of 2002 to 2007. After several years touring the West Coast, Canada and Hawaii, Lynx is now back east to celebrate the upcoming War of 1812 Bicentennial.\n\nMore than 10,000 students from 600 schools have stepped aboard the ship and explored its wonder. Proceeds from the training programs and tours, as well as donations, go toward maintaining and keeping the Lynx sailing, Woods said.\n\nThe most important accomplishment, Woods said, is \"the Lynx changes lives.\" He shared the experience of Karafaye Buffa, a teen who sailed from California to Hawaii aboard the ship in 2004.\n\n\"In the 18 days of the journey, I changed as a person. I became more passionate about sailing than I already had been. I learned to live life to the fullest and to take more risks,\" Buffa wrote. \"After feeling the sense of responsibility inspired by steering this huge ship, I now undertake more and different responsibilities and leadership roles than I would have ever considered previously. The experience taught me to deal with unexpected obstacles that have the chance to alter the direction of my life. I also learned to accept more challenges and face them to the best of my ability.\"\n\nWoods said three former students are now attending maritime colleges in California and Maine, including Joel Buffa who graduates this weekend.\n\nLeft our mooring in Savannah, GA at 1140 on the 5th and started the transit down the Savannah River on an ebb tide. We had light rain and 15 \u2013 20 kt. Westerly's behind a cold front that passed through early in the morning. Finished final offshore preps during the transit down the river and set the fore and staysail. As we passed Old Fort Jackson we fired a two gun salute which was returned by the Forts 1824 32 pounder .With the fair wind and current we made quick work of the river and cleared the river entrance at 1330. As we cleared the coast we set the Jib and Fore Top as the winds built to 20 \u2013 25 kts and we made our way ENE in 6-7 ft seas. The first day of the trip was uneventful but as we worked our way North the breeze clocked to the NE and eased so we had to motor for about five hours. The breeze then clocked around to the Southwest and freshened to 15 \u2013 18 kts and we secured the engine and started to sail again. Early morning on the 7th the winds eased so we reduced sail and started motoring so we would be at the Cape Fear River entrance at first light.\n\nWe entered the Cape Fear River at 0600 and worked our way upriver on a flood. As the morning wore on the winds built so we were able to sail about half the distance upriver. As we neared the City of Wilmington we called the Cape Fear Bridge to get it raised then set all sail and made our entrance with a four gun salute behind the Wilmington Fire Boat.

{"text":"Engineering\n\nEngineering \u2013 The age of Steam.\n\nSince early times ships were driven by oars and sail. The crews of these ships consisted of ordinary seamen who did the work and officers who controlled the ship and decided where it should go.\n\nThen in the 1700\u2032s with the discovery of how to use steam, everything changed. James Watt a Scottish engineer was born in 1736. He established Scotland as the source of a new breed of ships crew, marine engineers. To this day \"Scotty\" is frequently used as a nickname for ships engineers. (As in \"beam me up Scotty\")\n\nThe first steam engines were very large and could not be moved, but soon efforts were made to put smaller versions in ships. Great benefits were foreseen as ships would then be independent of the wind and could travel directly to their destination.\n\nMany people were experimenting with steamships, particularly in Britain, France and the United States. The first steamship of any size to sail successfully was possibly in France in 1776. By 1802 what is believed to be the first practical steamer, the \"Charlotte Dundas\", towed two barges on the Forth and Clyde canal.\n\nThe first steamship to travel across the Atlantic in 1838 with 40 passengers, using entirely its own engines and paddles, (not using the sails, which were also fitted) was the \"Sirius\". It was necessary to burn all available wood including the masts to achieve this feat.\n\nWith the invention of the screw or propellor, around 1870, ships could go faster, but steam engines using cylinders and pistons were slow. In 1897 Charles Parsons from Birr demonstrated the then fastest ship in the world, the \"Turbinia\" using a steam turbine which was a major revolution in steam power. This ship can be seen in a museum in Newcastle-on-Tyne,\n\nThe last and biggest steamship ever built was the RMS Queen Elizabeth \u2013 QE2 \u2013 launched in 1969."}

{"text":"Sea trial, and can last from a few hours to many days.\n\nSea trials are conducted to measure a vessel's performance and general seaworthiness. Testing of a vessel's speed, maneuverability, equipment and safety features are usually conducted. Usually in attendance are technical representatives from the builder, governing and certification officials, and representatives of the owners. Successful sea trials subsequently lead to a vessel's certification\n\nCertification\n\nCertification refers to the confirmation of certain characteristics of an object, person, or organization. This confirmation is often, but not always, provided by some form of external review, education, assessment, or audit...\n\nfor commissioning and acceptance by its owner.\n\nAlthough sea trials are commonly thought to be conducted only on new-built vessels (referred by shipbuilders as 'builders trials'), they are regularly conducted on commissioned vessels as well. In new vessels, they are used to determine conformance to construction specifications. On commissioned vessels, they are generally used to confirm the impact of any modifications.\n\nSea trials can also refer to a short test trip undertaken by a prospective buyer of a new or used vessel as one determining factor in whether to purchase the vessel.\n\nTypical trials\n\nSea trials are fairly standardized using Technical Bulletins published by ITTC, SNAME, BMT, regulatory agencies or the owners. They involve demonstrations and tests of the ship's systems and performance.\n\nSpeed trial: The vessel is ballasted or loaded to a predetermined draft and the propulsion machinery is set to the contracted maximum service setting, usually some percentage of the machinery's maximum continuous rating.

The vessel is allowed to come to speed and the speed is continuously recorded using differential GPS. The ship is then turned through 180\u00b0 and the procedure is followed again. This reduces the impact of wind and tide. The final \"Trials Speed\" is determined by averaging all of the measured speeds during each of the runs. This process may be repeated in various sea states.\n\nCrash stop: The vessel is ballasted or loaded to a predetermined draft and the propulsion machinery is set to the contracted maximum service setting, usually some percentage of the machinery's maximum continuous rating. The trial begins once the order to \"Execute Crash Stop\" is given. At this point the propulsion machinery is set to full-astern and the helm is put hard-over to either port or starboard. The speed, position and heading are continuously recorded using. The final time to stop (i.e.: ship speed is 0 knots) track line, drift (distance traveled perpendicular to the original course) and advance (distance traveled along the original course line) are all calculated. The trial may be repeated at various starting speeds.\n\nEndurance: The vessel is ballasted or loaded to a predetermined draft and the propulsion machinery is set to the contracted maximum service setting, usually some percentage of the machinery's maximum continuous rating. The fuel flow, exhaust and cooling water temperatures and ship's speed are all recorded. The trial may last from 4 hours for small boats to 24 hours for large ships. The trial may be repeated at various drafts and trims and is often done in conjunction with the Speed Trial.\n\nManeuvering trials: A number of trials to determine the maneuverability and directional stability of the ship may be conducted.

{"text":"The Cannon Beach History Center and Museum is home to the original Cannon Beach cannon. This artifact has always been a subject of interest. The cannon story, however, became much more interesting when two cannons were uncovered on the beaches of Arch Cape, just south of Cannon Beach, in February 2008. An especially low tide made them visible about one and a half centuries after they were deposited on the beach. The relationship between the original cannon, found in Arch Cape in 1894, and the \"new\" cannons is yet to be determined scientifically, though it is probable that the recently uncovered cannons derived from the same ship as the original, the USS Schooner Shark.\n\nThe following link and narrative provide useful information on all three cannons of Arch Cape.\n\nThe Original Cannon and the USS Schooner Shark The U .S. Naval schooner Shark, part of the surveying fleet under Lieutenant Neil M. Howison, arrived off the mouth of the Columbia River after a 25-day passage from Honolulu, in August, 1846. John Lattie, one of the few in the area with a genuine knowledge of bar passages, was summoned to the ship to guide her into safe haven off the Astor Colony.\n\nTrouble plagued the arrival of the ship to present-day Astoria. Anxiety over the boundary question--involving the United States and Great Britain--had started rumors among settlers that war was near and that the arrival of the Shark was a war precaution and not a survey mission. The crew members, weary from long months at sea, began deserting, and replacements were unobtainable. Hard as they tried, the officers were unable to bribe the townspeople of the Astor Colony to divulge the hiding places of the deserters.\n\nOn September 10, without taking proper precautions, the vessel weighed anchor. Crossing the bar, she struck the outlying fangs of Clatsop Spit, this time with a death-dealing blow. The waters were not calm as on her inward trek, and the ship shuddered and trembled while mounting breakers drove into her wooden hull. With her weight fastening her to the bottom, she was working on the sands.\n\nCaptain Schenck was gravely concerned. He ordered the three masts chopped down and all twelve of the ship's cannon jettisoned in an effort to get the ship off the spit. But before these acts could be carried out, the ship began to break up. All hands were ordered to the boats. During the night, the wreck was battered to pieces, parts of it drifting out over the bar. Evidently the crew did not jettison all the cannon, for a large section of the wreck came ashore in the area of present-day Arch Cape, south of Cannon Beach. Fortunately, the crew of the Shark all reached safety and were looked after by the citizens of the Astor Colony.\n\nIn October 1846, Lieutenant Howison received information through the Tillamook people that part of the ship's hull \"with guns upon it,\" had come ashore south of Tillamook Head. The lieutenant sent Midshipman Simes to visit the location. Simes reported finding the wreckage and succeeded in \"getting one cannon above the high-water mark,\" while two others were left buried.\n\nThen in December 1863, mail carrier John Hobson reported seeing a cannon at present-day Arch Cape Creek. Soon after, this cannon became lost when tides buried it in sand. In June 1898, however, it was spotted once again-this time by mail carrier George Luce. With the help of his Nehalem neighbors John and Mary Gerritse and their team of horses, Luce succeeded in pulling the cannon out of the sand, after which time it stood in front of the Austin House Post Office in Arch Cape for several years.\n\n{Portions of this narrative were excerpted from Pacific Graveyard, by James A. Gibbs, 1993.}\n\n^ Original cannon in Arch Cape not long after it was\ndiscovered in 1894, at Austin homestead.\n\n^ Picture of cannon in Arch Cape in 1926, on wooden stand.\nChildren pictured: Juanita Kincaid and Robert Kenney.\n\n^ Freshly uncovered cannon in Arch Cape, February 2008.\n\n^ TWO freshly uncovered cannons in Arch Cape, one\nin foreground, one in background, Arch Cape, February 2008.\n\n^ The original cannon on permanent display at the\nCannon Beach History Center and Museum, 2008."}

{"text":"Steamboats: General History\n\nEvery year has seen some new steamboat constructed which surpasses in size, magnificence, or speed, those previously made. There is no doubt that the mechanics of this country excel those of any other in their inland steamboats \u2014 let us hope that in a few years the same can be said of our sea-going steamships.\n\nDuring the present year the new steamboat JAMES HOWARD has commenced running in the New Orleans and St. Louis trade, and is the largest boat afloat or ever built for the navigation of the Western waters. And as she is the ne plus ultra in architecture and size for this decade at least, it may be well, before speaking further of her character and of her builder and namesake, to look back a little and see what progress has been made since the first steamer ever was launched.\n\nSCOTCHMAN JAMES WATT\n\nAlthough to the United States belongs the honor of originating the first successful steamboat, credit must be given to the Scotchman James Watt, for such improvements on the steam-engine in 1786 \u2014 the structure of the double-acting condensing engine \u2014 without which, steam in the propulsion of boats was almost impracticable.\n\nThere were many men of genius, both in Europe and America, for a few years before this, attempted the project of application of steam to vessels, but of course without success.\n\nJOHN FITCH OF PHILADELPHIA\n\nThe most noteworthy of these was John Fitch, a Philadelphia watchmaker, but native of Connecticut, who, after long endurance and incessant toil, and the sinking of all his means, completed the steamer PERSERVERANCE in the year 1787, which on trial at Philadelphia on the Delaware, made but three miles an hour. She ran twenty miles to Burlington, burst her boiler, but with a new one afterward made eight miles an hour.\n\nFitch was called a dreamer, but he was only a great genius in advance of his age. His vision of the future was very clear, if unsuccessful himself; for he prophesied that \"in less than a century we shall see our western rivers swarming with steamboats,\" and expressed a wish to be \"buried on the shores of the Ohio,\" from a noble bluff of which he beheld this vision, \"where the song of the boatmen may enliven the stillness of his resting place, and the music of the steam engine soothe his spirit.\"\n\nHe was heard afterward to remark that in one century the West should be the centre, and the Atlantic States the suburbs of the nation. That century will not terminate for a score of years, yet the vision or prophecy is fulfilled.\n\nROBERT FULTON OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\nBut after all the failures of others, it was Robert Fulton of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, who was destined to receive from the historian the glory of successfully introducing the steamboat, or one of the most useful applications of mechanics, to the civilized world and very properly, therefore, did the committee of the __st London exhibition, in 18__, say:\n\n\"\u2026it is in the sacrifice and exertions of the Amercian Fulton that is due the everlast- ing honor of having produced this revolution, both in naval architecture and navigation.\"\n\nAlthough Fulton took a deep interest during the last decade of the last century, in originating steam navigation, in connection with Watt, Stanhope, and other noble men in England and France, he is not called the originator thereof, nor, except in planning to a certain extent for Watt, is he the inventor of the mechanism for such navigation; but he was the first successfully to cross the chasm from mere attempts to positive acheivment, rendering steam navigation practicable, and profitable.\n\nFulton's first steamer, the CLERMONT, named after the residence of Chancellor Livingston, was built in New York, and made her first voyage on the Hudson to Albany in August, 1807, (only sixty-five years ago) its engine being built by Watt, from Fulton's plans.\n\nFERRYBOATS\n\nSteam ferryboats also were first built and established upon this ferry between New York and Brooklyn; and to this day, no ferryboats in any other part of the known world equal those plying on that same old track.\n\nSteamboats were not introduced into Great Britain until 1812, five years later than the successful voyage of Fulton.\n\nBell built the first boat upon the River Clyde at Glasgow.\n\n\"ORLEANS\" FROM PITTSBURG TO NEW ORLEANS\n\nIt was a year before this, 1811, that Fulton and Chancellor Livingston of New York (who had been interested in boat-building from the first), established a ship yard at Pittsburg, and built an experimental boat, the ORLEANS, the first ever placed on our western waters. She had a stern wheel and masts, a 400 tonner.\n\nHer first trip was made from Pittsburg to New Orleans in the winter of 1812 \u2014 less that three score years ago \u2013arriving here on the 10th of January, 1812, just after the admission into the Union of Louisiana, and the adoption of her constitution, as if to do honor to the new state.\n\nShe was an extraordinary sight that day, and of course created a greater sensation than would the arrival of the mammoth JAMES HOWARD today, 4000 tonner as she is.\n\nFULTON PREDICTED RAILROADS\n\nIt was during Fulton's stage ride over the Alleghany Mountains, to build this steamer, that he predicted to some incredulous and unbelieving gentlemen voyagers, the early advent of railroads.\n\nHe remarked, \"The day will come, gentlemen \u2014 I may not live to see it, but some of you who are younger, probably will \u2014 when carriages will be drawn over these mountains by steam engines, at a rate more rapid than that of a stage upon the smoothest turnpike.\"\n\nOne of those gentlemen, who, in 1811, laughed at the apparent absurdity, told the anecdote in 1834, when being rapidly drawn in a Baltimore Railroad car over the same mountains.\n\n1817 STEAMBOAT NAVIGATION ON WESTERN WATERS\n\nIt was not until March of 1817, fifty-three years ago, that the public were convinced of the success of steamboat navigation of Western Waters.\n\nThis was by the WASHINGTON, 400 tons, built at Wheeling, running from Louisville to New Orleans and back in forty-five days. She was commanded by Capt. Henry K. Shreve.\n\nThere were but seven or eight vessels built previous to this.\n\nThis settled the practicability of steamboats, whereas up to this date (1817) some twenty barges afforded the only facilities for transporting merchandise from New Orleans to Louisville and Cincinatti, and they made but one trip a year.\n\n\"SAVANNAH\" CROSSED ATLANTIC 1819\n\nIt was but two years after this (1819) that the first steamship crossed the Atlantic. This was the SAVANNAH, 380 tons, built by Crocker & Fickett, New York.\n\nHer first voyage was from New York to Savannah, whence she steamed to Liverpool direct, reaching that port Sept. 21, 1819, in eighteen days, using steam but seven.\n\nAnd of course when, with American banners flying, was greeted with vociferous cheers of the thousands lining the docks.\n\nThe first British steamship which crossed was the GREAT WESTERN, in 1838, about a score of years later.\n\nROBERT L. STEVENS IN \"PHOENIX\" IN 1808\n\nThough really the first instance of ocean steam navigation on record, was the taking by Robert L. Stevens of the PHOENIX, built by his father, John Cox Stevens, in New York, around to Philadelphia by sea in 1808.\n\nThis same steamer came near reaping the first success which Fulton achieved; let Stevens have the honor to which he is entitled of being the first to navigate the ocean by the power of steam.\n\nFIRST TO NEW ORLEANS\n\nIn 1818 a steamship plied from New York to New Orleans, touching at Charleston and Havana.\n\nFIRST REGULAR LINE TO ENGLAND IN 1838\n\nThe regualar line of steam communication between England and America was not established until 1838, with the GREAT WESTERN, BRITISH QUEEN, and PRESIDENT.\n\nThe latter, which sailed from New York in March, 1841, was never heard from after, her fate remaining a melancholy mystery.\n\nEach of these steamers cost 90,715 pounds.\n\nJOHN ERICSSON\n\nWhile England today has no less than fourteen establishments for the construction of iron ships, it was only in October 1839 that the first iron ship, built in Liverpool, the IRONSIDES, was launched.\n\nThis was the year that Capt. John Ericsson, the Swedish inventor and engineer, emigrated to the United States, the British Admiralty having blindly rejected his invention of the propellor, and of the new arrangements of the steam-machinery in ships of war which has revolutionized the Navies of the world.\n\nHe had found more confiding listeners in our consul at Liverpool, Francis B. Ogden, (who joined him in building the propellor of that name), and Robert F. Stockton of the United States Navy, who ordered him at once to build him two iron boats after his plan.\n\nHis first propellor in the United States was the ship of war PRINCETON, the first steamship ever built with the propelling machinery under the water line and out of reach of shot; and therefore the foundation of the present steam marine of the whole world. Ericsson lacks but two years of 70, yet labors daily like a boy for the glory of his adopted country.\n\nSTATISTICS\n\nAt that time (1840), the comparative steamboat force of Britain and America was 68,000 of tonnage for Britain, against 155,000 for America. The United States had 800 steamers (600 of them belonging to Western waters,) where in 1834 the number was but 254.\n\nIn 1850, only ten years later, the United States built thirty-one sea-steamers of a total tonnage of 42,097 tons. Four of these were the Collins steamers, costing $600,000 each, of greater speed than the Cunard steamers; and they were the first warmed by steam by the ships' boilers.\n\nIn that year 1850 was also built the inland steamer, NEW WORLD, (which ran on the Hudson River), then the largest steamer afloat in the world, being 371 feet long by 69 wide. Her decorations were of the most superb and costly character.\n\nTen years later she was certainly excelled in size (though not in speed or stroke of engine) by that completion in London of the mammoth sea-going steamer GREAT EASTERN, which arrived in New York from Southampton just eleven years ago (June, 1860)\n\nA remarkable circumstance is that her planner was I. K. Brunel, son of the renowned Sir M. I. Brunel, and the Frenchman who built the Thames Tunnel, and, who, during his banishment from France in 1793 to New York, was engaged with Fulton in his early efforts at solving the steamboat problem.\n\nThe tonnage of this ship by our Government measure is about 22,000 tons. Her displacement of water is 25,000 tons. Her promenade deck is nearly one-eighth of a mile in length. Her eight propelling engines were of nominally 4,000 horse power.\n\nShe was intended to accomodate four thousand guests \u2013eight hundred first class, two thousand second class and twelve hundred third class \u2014 independent of the ship's complement.\n\nBut, though she is the greatest wonder of nautical architecture in this or any other age, she was too slow, averaging but fourteen miles an hour on her first trip, was too expensive, cost $4,000,000 and was found to be anything but a \"paying institution,\" and is now entirely devoted to laying ocean cables, for which she is admirably adapted.\n\n\"OCEANIC\"\n\nWithin the last few weeks a new ocean steamer, the OCEANIC, which is excelled in size only by the GREAT EASTERN, has arrived in New York. She was constructed in Belfast, Ireland, and is the pioneer propellor passenger ship of the White Star Line, which has five other steamers of a like size and pattern now under construction.\n\nAnd though her engines alone cost over $150,000, the total cost of the ship was but $650,000 \u2014 only $25,000 more than each of the four steamers. ATLANTIC, PACIFIC, ARCTIC and BALTIC, of the Collins line, built in 1850, that were so much smaller, being only 290 feet long on deck.\n\nSPEED\n\nIt takes our American steamboat builders to realize almost the same speed in steamers which the railway engineers have done in the rail.\n\nThe GREAT EASTERN's engines had the enormous stroke of fourteen feet, but our NEW WORLD had fifteen. The Hudson River steamer DANIEL DREW, of a superior model, and built for speed, made an average of twenty-five miles an hour between New York and Albany in October of the same year that the GREAT EASTERN arrived, 1860.\n\nAnd although the greatest steamboat race on record occured the past year on our own river between those Hoosier and Buckeye built races, the LEE and NATCHEZ, yet the DREW's time has never to our knowledge been beaten.\n\nAs steam navigation took its rise on the Hudson, so the steamboats navigating that river, it is but justice to say, have uniformly been before all others in point of speed.\n\nThat great Irish writer on physical science, Dr. Lardner, Britisher as he is, admits the same thing in his work on the steam engine, when he says:\n\n\"Doubtless the greatest speed ever attained on the surface of water has been exhibited in the passages of these vessels between New York and Albany.\"\n\nYet the contests for speed, or practice of racing, between rival steamboats, during the last forty years, have been about as great on the Mississippi as on the Hudson. And though certain journals and parts of the community are alarmed at and condemn this practice, whoever heard of an accident occuring from this cause?\n\nBUILDING BOATS ON WESTERN RIVERS\n\nYet the great field for building and running steamboats is, and always has been, the Western waters. On the banks of the \"white and foaming rivers,\" Ohio, is that mightiest vassal of man's mechanical genius, working its sublimest results.\n\nPittsburg and Cincinnatti are among the greatest manufacturing cities in the world. At these cities chiefly, steamboats are built, and huge engines of all kinds furnished.\n\nBut the Hoosier and Kentucky shores of the same belle riviere are by no means idle in this respects, particularly the former, at Madison, Jeffersonville and New Albany.\n\nThe Cincinnatti district alone turned out during the quarter ending April 1, 1871, three side wheel steamers of 23,064 tons, two stern-wheel steamers of 22, 016 tons, one propeller of 56 tons, and five model barges of 12,023 tons altogether amounting to 52,094 tons.\n\n\"JAMES HOWARD\" BUILT AT JEFFERSONVILLE, INDIANA\n\nAs before intimated, it was Cincinnatti that the beautifully modeled and fast racer NATCHEZ was built, while New Albany, Ind., has the honor of constructing her more successful rival the elegant ROBT. E. LEE.\n\nMadison, in the same state, over thirty years ago, contained the ship-yard of James Howard, he who has just constructed at Jeffersonville, Ind., and at Louisville Ky., the mammoth steamer which bears his name.\n\nSince he commenced building at the \"great cut,\" as Madison in called, \"Jim Howard\" has turned out over four hundred steamboats!\n\nNEW ORLEANS GREATLY ENRICHED BY STEAMBOATS\n\nNew Orleans and Louisiana have been greatly enriched during half a century by commerce which has floated down the thousand miles of clear waters the Ohio. Let those clear waters continue to smoothly and peacefully float down their steamboats and other wealth:\n\n\"Stream of my fathers! sweetly still\n\nThe sunset rays thy valley fill;\n\nPour slantwise down the long defile,\n\nWater, wood and spire beneath them smile!\"\n\nLouisana and New Orleans have indeed derived more important advantages from the use of steamboats than any other state and city in the Union. The introduction of steamboats upon the Western waters has contributed more than all other causes which have grown out of human skill to advance the prosperity of this city and State as well as of the whole West and Southwest, and they should be doubly grateful to Fulton therefor.\n\nSTATUES RECOMMENDED\n\nNew Orleans should erect a statue on her grand levee to Robert Fulton and James Watt for their inventions, if not to James Howard, who has so greatly aided in building up her commerce. Without these men, our great \"valley world,\" though traversed from north to south by a river unmatched among the streams of the earth \u2014 sweeping as a royal conqueror along, receiving tribute from many a province and distant empire \u2014 could never have been peopled, or had what would be worthy the name of commerce.\n\nBut by the inventions and enterprise of Watt and Fulton, and the industry and progressive character of James Howard and other architects on the banks of la belle riviere, our great \"Sea of the West,\" as Henry Clay used to call the Mississippi when eloquently advocating Congressional aid to interior commerce, a mighty empire has sprung up on the banks of the Father of Waters, and such palaces as the JAMES HOWARD are daily borne on this, the most majestic tribute of waters which earth pays to ocean.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF \"JAMES HOWARD\"\n\nThus, after glancing at the progress of steamboat building from the beginning, and at most of the steam craft from the North River, or CLERMONT, to the GREAT EASTERN, let us look again at the magnificent JAMES HOWARD, as she gracefully floats on that gleaming expanse of polished steel in front of the Crescent City, and puts to shame anything known as a steamer in any part of the Eastern continent. The length of her hull is 330 feet; breadth of beam 55 feet; depth of hold 10 feet; extreme width 94 feet; carrying capacity 3400 tons, though 4,000 tons may easily be freighted on her. Her machinery, made at the foundry of Messrs. Arnalie, Cochran & Co. of Louisville, consists of two main engines, with 34 1\/2 inch cylinders, 10 feet stroke of piston, and water wheel 39 feet diameter; six boilers 30 feet long and 46 inches diameter. In addition are auxiliary engines for various purposes. The staterooms are of varying sizes, but the principal ones, with large bedsteads, wardrobes, wash-stands, and every convenience of bed-chambers \"at home\" are remarkably roomy and comfortable. The leading idea communicated from an inspection of this steamer is that there is plenty of room, the greatest solidity, and also elegance, without the gaudy ornamentation so common in American steamboats. In short, this mammoth moving freight and passenger steamer, there is comfort, light convenience and luxury everywhere. Her master, P.B. Pegram, is a model steamboat captain, and as the HOWARD towers above all other river craft, so, though most of his fellow commanders lack not in size, good looks, or other marks of nature's genuine nobility, they are generally pygmies beside such specimens of humanity as the commander on the deck of the HOWARD. As in most of the steamers on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, the HOWARD's engines are of the high pressure character. Formerly one or two of these generally blew up every season, ending a score or two of parboiled passengers to an inconvenient altitude in the atmosphere. But latterly a wide change in this and every other respect has taken place in these steamers and the character of the masters, passengers, and general appointments.\n\nNEW ORLEANS BAD HARBOR PROBLEM OVERCOME BY STEAMBOATS\n\n\"Before the invention of steam navigation,\" says Dr. Lardner in the work already quoted from, \"this Southern capital of the United States labored under the disadvantage of possessing almost the only bad and inconvenient harbor in the vast range of coast by which the country is bounded.\" The steam engine has overcome all difficulties and made it the best.\n\n\u2026STEAMBOAT TRAVEL IN 1833-34\n\nTo show the great contrast between everything pertaining to our steamers of the present day, and those of forty years ago, in closing this already extended article, an extract may be given from Capt. Thos. Hamilton's \"Men and Manners in America,\" printed in 1834, in which that able literary Englishman describes his passage on a Mississippi steamer from Louisville to New Orleans at that time.\n\nOf course, however, it must be taken in consideration that like all other Englishmen traveling in this country, he is affected pert, and there is a spirit of unjust depreciation predominating in all he writes. He says:\n\n\"In regard to passengers, anything so disgusting in human shape I have never seen. Their morals and their manners were alike detestable. A cold and callous selfishness, a disregard of all the decencies of society were apparent in feature, word and action.\n\n\"The conversation in the cabin was interlarded with the vilest blasphemy \u2014 not uttered in a state of mental ex- citement, but with a coolness and deliberation truly thoughtless.\n\n\"The scene of drinking and gambling had no intermission. It continued day and night.\n\n\"The captain of the vessel, so far from discouraging either vice, was one of the most flagrant offenders in both. He was decidedly the greatest gambler on board, and was often so drunk as to be utterly incapable of taking command of the vessel.\n\n\"In every steamboat there is a public comb and hairbrush suspended by a string from the ceiling of the cabin. These utensils are used by the whole body of passengers, and their condition the pen of Swift could alone adequately describe.\n\n\"There is no toothbrush, simply, I believe, because the article is entirely unknown to the American toilet. A common towel, however, passes from hand to hand and suffices for the perfunctory ablutions of the whole party on board.\"\n\nCOMPARED TO 1871\n\nThis was slander always, but would be still farther from the truth today. Look at the superb and costly decorations of the HOWARD!\n\nConverse with the gentlemanly master and his elegantly dressed and intellectual passengers, and observe every comfort and luxury on that three-decker as she glides down the giant river, rolling onward the vast volume of its dark and turbid waters through what was, when Hamilton wrote, a vast wilderness, and be convinced there is no other such impressive scene of progress and greatness in the world."}

{"text":"Common menu bar links\n\nItem Display\n\nWOOD,CHARLES, naval architect and shipbuilder; b. 27 March 1790 in Port Glasgow, Scotland, son of John Wood, a shipbuilder, and Elizabeth Household (Cameron); he did not marry but had a daughter; d. 27 May 1847 in Port Glasgow.\n\nCharles Wood and his older brother John served in their father's shipyard. John Sr died shortly after laying the keel in 1811 for Henry Bell's pioneering steamer, the Comet, and his sons took over the yard and completed the vessel. They went on to earn an excellent reputation as designers and builders of 18 Clyde passenger steamboats and other craft. Among the vessels designed by Charles were a ceremonial barge for service on the Rhine, bought by the king of Denmark, and the steamer JamesWatt of 1820, whose lines revolutionized the shape of steamboat hulls.\n\nIn the early 1820s Charles found backers for a bold scheme to transport timber from Quebec to London in huge raft-ships able to accommodate extra-large sticks and the tallest pine masts, which were difficult, if not impossible, for ordinary ships to handle. Wood's vessels were to be built of square timber and serve only for one voyage, following which they would be broken up and their timber sold. Arriving at Quebec, Wood leased a large site at the westerly end of \u00cele d'Orl\u00e9ans in August 1823 and set to work constructing his first vessel, the 3,690-ton Columbus; the largest merchantman previously built in the port was the 720-ton Harrison of 1811. Wood's extensive operation helped lift the shipbuilding industry out of a depression which had lasted since the War of 1812 and, according to the Quebec Gazette, through the existing demand for other construction work on ships, the \"great number\" of carpenters and labourers he employed \"obtained high prices.\" The novel and immense project attracted considerable attention. Though it was recognized that Wood was a shipbuilder \"of remarkable talents\" and \"intimate acquaintance with the scientific principles of the art,\" some believed that the Columbus would never float. However, with 4,000 tons of cargo on board it was safely launched on 28 July 1824. The river steamboats were on hand, and the St Lawrence was alive with an estimated 100 sailing craft. A crowd of 5,000, which had begun to gather the night before, watched as the vessel slid gently into the water to the strains of \"God Save the King\" played by regimental bands and to salvoes of cannon fire.\n\nThe Columbus, owned by a Scottish syndicate, was manned by a captain and 90-member crew that had been sent out from Scotland. Wood was aboard as, heavily laden, it weighed anchor on 5 September and was towed by the steamboat Hercules to Bic. Under sail, it ran aground at Betsiamites, and part of the cargo had to be sacrificed to get it off. Despite some loosening of its structure by the incident and notwithstanding bad weather, the Columbus reached London in late October, to a tremendous welcome. Though Wood had designed and built it to endure only one voyage, the Columbus was ordered by its owners to New Brunswick for a second cargo five months later, and it foundered in a gale \u2013 fortunately without loss of life.\n\nBefore leaving on the Columbus, Wood had laid the keel of a similar but even larger vessel, the 5,294-ton Baron of Renfrew. Launched with some difficulty in 1825, it crossed the Atlantic safely, only to be grounded by the pilots in the mouth of the Thames and eventually to break up on the French shore. Though much of the cargo was salvaged, the two losses made such rafts uninsurable and resulted in abandonment of the scheme.\n\nFrom 1834 to 1836 Wood was in partnership with George Mills under the name Mills and Wood in Bowling, Scotland, on the north bank of the Clyde. In 1836 he took over the dockyard of James Lang at Dumbarton, where his production included the ship Caledonia for the Cunard Line. An intelligent, practical man, Wood went to London during the 1830s in a successful bid to get the tonnage laws changed so that they reflected the true capacity for carrying profitable cargo.\n\nWood kept abreast of political developments in Lower Canada, where conflict was building to an explosion. \"The French Habitans . . . ,\" he wrote to Colonial Secretary Lord Glenelg in 1836, \"were the most unsophisticated Moral people male and female I was ever among, and very much disposed to be contented.\" They should have been \"most delicately attended to,\" he asserted, but in fact \"the British are too apt to treat them as if they were actually black.\" He condemned the \"mighty talkers\" among the English party as \"not less dangerous than M. Papineau [Louis-Joseph Papineau*] and the other French lawyers\" who had mischievously excited discontent \"against the energetic paternal government of Lord Dalhousie [Ramsay].\" Affirming that virtually no rural Canadians spoke English but that \"many a time they have called out to me for it,\" he believed that everyone should learn to speak it \"perfectly.\" The Canadians \"would not then be liable to be held down by the Saucy English, nor decoyed by the Cunning French,\" he argued. Since steam had made passage of the Atlantic \"short and certain,\" Wood concluded that \"Canada should be united to Great Britain and have Peers and Members of the British Parliament.\"\n\nIn the early 1840s Wood moved his shipyard to Castle Green in Dumbarton, but he was ruined by a bad contract on a vessel for the Royal Mail Company's West Indian Line. He then went to Amsterdam to advise builders, and returned to Port Glasgow in the 1840s to spend his remaining days at the home of his brother John.\n\nJohn Scott Russell, one of Britain's foremost ship architects and engine designers of the 19th century, described Wood as \"a genius in his way.\" According to Russell, the change in the tonnage laws was among \"the greatest benefits conferred on Britain during [Wood's] lifetime,\" and one for which shipbuilders were \"in great measure, and originally,\" indebted to him. Both Wood and his brother had been \"distinguished by their eminent knowledge [and] . . . by the liberality with which they communicated that knowledge,\" even to their immediate business rivals. From these qualities Quebec shipbuilders undoubtedly profited during Charles Wood's presence among them."}

{"text":"The Pilade Bronzetti's involvement in these events began the night of\n6 December 1920, when her crew mutinied. Surprising their officers during\nbreakfast, the crew forced the ship to sail to Fiume. Though facts surrounding\nthis event are vague, there are existing press releases stating that\nthe vessel was delivered to Gabriele D'Annunzio, and that he gave a\nspeech from the stairs of his administrative office, thanking the \"young\nrescuers of the honor of the Italian Navy.\" This indicates that he took\npossession of the vessel. Together with the desertion of two other ships\nand four armored cars, the desertion of the Pilade Bronzetti made the\nsituation in Fiume even worse. Ultimately, it led to the \"Christmas\nof blood,\" the bombardment of Fiume, and an armed conflict between Italian\nsoldiers and the insurrectionists. In the end, the government of Fiume\nsurrendered, and D'Annunzio, slightly injured after six days of battle,\nleft town, followed by his irregulars.\n\nWith the conclusion of hostilities, the Pilade Bronzetti was returned\nto the Royal Navy and renamed Giuseppe Dezza; Dezza was an Italian patriot\nknown for his participation in the military campaign of Giuseppe Garibaldi.\nAs the Giuseppe Dezza, the vessel recommenced its naval service in the\nMechanical School of Venice, and in October of 1923, was sent to Taranto\nto be refitted. At this time her tonnage was increased, as were her\ncompliment of crew and armament. Her weapons were increased to five\n102\/35-mm guns, two 40\/39-mm guns, and four 450-mm torpedoes. The ten-year-old\nvessel returned to service in 1925 and was stationed in Naples. In April\nof 1926, she was assigned to the Torpedo Division and later used to\ntransfer the Governor of Tripolitania from Tripoli to Naples. In 1927,\nthe Giuseppe Dezza was stationed in Taranto as the Flagship, and in\nOctober of 1929 was classified as a torpedo boat in the Command School\nof Taranto.\n\nThe Giuseppe Dezza continued her service throughout World War II as\na patrol and escort vessel. During World War II, torpedo boats were\nassigned the heavy and dangerous duty of escorting merchant ships, which\nwere necessary for supplying troops, with assisting those lost at sea,\nand with hunting submarines. The few surviving torpedo boats were demolished\nin the fifties. The destroyer's wartime record was impressive: twenty-seven\nmissions against submarines and one hundred and seventy-four convoy\nmissions as an escort. The beginning of World War II found her in Messina.\nShe was then immediately transferred to Cagliari, where on 9 January\n1941 she took part in the unsuccessful hunt of the British submarine\nPandora, which had been responsible for sinking several steamers."}

{"text":"Once the decks had been cleared, the ship would grapple its opponent and a boarding party of heavily armed soldiers would be sent aboard. During the fight, part of the boarding party would be assigned the task of damaging the enemy's rigging.\n\nOn deck Marines led boarding parties in close action and repelled enemy boarding parties. The nickname \"Leatherneck\" derived from the thick leather stock worn around the neck to protect the Marine from the decapitating slash of an enemy's cutlass.\n\nTo board an enemy ship or in a final assault on land, Marines relied on the Brown Bess's bayonet and on a short, brass-barreled flintlock blunderbuss. In the confusion of combat, the latter's flared muzzle made it easy to reload with a charge of powder followed by a handful of buckshot, rocks, nails, or whatever nastiness was available. The blunderbuss evolved into the shotgun, and in the 1847 attack on Mexico City, Marine Major Levi Twiggs carried his favorite double-barreled shotgun. For the trench assaults in France in World War I, Marines adopted repeating shotguns, and used them again in the close combat of jungle fighting in World War II and Viet Nam.\n\nThe slow firing muskets made edged weapons a necessary last resort. For close combat, enlisted men's muskets were fitted with bayonets, officers carried a brace of pistols and a sword, and boarding parties from the ship's crew brandished cutlasses and short pikes. The sword for officers was not prescribed until 1829 when the Mameluke sword was authorized. It had become popular with Marines from their service in the Mediterranean against North African pirates. A similar sword is still today a Marine officer's ceremonial sword.\n\nThe battle would be a succession of hand-to-hand conflicts to board or to repel boarders. The order \"prepare to repel boarders\" was issued when a ship was threatened with an enemy assault. Pikemen formed behind those crewmen armed with cutlasses. The Marines, with bayonets fixed, formed behind the pikemen to cover them. At the command \"repel boarders,\" grape and musketry were brought to bear upon the enemy as they prepared to attack. Men remaining on the broadside guns continued to fire, and stood by with pikes to repel enemy attempting to enter through gun ports or quarter galleries.\n\nWhen this was accomplished, a large well armed and armoured boarding party would storm across to engage the disordered and demoralised enemy. The ship's boats would be armed and loaded with soldiers who would attempt to board the enemy at some place away from the main boarding action.\n\nThe sound of the drum is a signal for the crew to take their stations as in action. The call is beaten in such a manner as to be readily understood and distingushed from all others. On hearing it every one on board repairs immediately to his station. When there, the crew is at general quarters. With the order \"Cast loose and provide both\" the guns are cast loose, for the service of the gun placed in their proper positions ready for use, small arms brought up from the armory, while the quarter gunner of each division provides waist-belts for cutlasses, bayonets, pistols and battle axes.\n\nEach gun's crew to divided into boarders, pikemen, sail-trimmers, firemen and pump-men. The boarders provide themselves with cutlass, revolvers, pikemen have their muskets at hand ready to grasp, pumpmen their battle axes. If it is necessary to call away the boarders, the captain commands- \"Boarders on the starboard bow!\" Away rush the boarders to the point indicated. \"Boarders on their port quarter!\" Away they go again and stand by, cutlass in hand ready to board.\n\nAt the order \"Pikemen over the boarders!\" those who are under arms on the poop, with the pikemen, form a line with bayonets, along the deck in rear of the boarders, who keep close down until the order comes to board. At the command \"Repel Boarders\" the pikemen advance their pieces over the heads of the boarders and fire and though at an imaginary foeuntil the order comes to \"Fall back pikemen! Stand by to board!\" Board! and with a wild yell the boarders spring to the hammock nettings and rigging, bandishing their weapons, simulating the real thing.\n\nThe quarter gunner of the after division is provided with a rattle which he springs when the boarders are called; the sound of a gong calls away the pikemen as in the din of battle-the executive officer, though he has a speaking trumpet might not be distinctly heard. If a fire should break out, a quick ringing of the bell calls away the firemen and pumpmen, who repair to the pumps, and the locality of the fire indicated by rolls of the drum if the fire should be formed, by one roll, and if aft by two: at the third roll the firemen and pumpmen return to their quarters, and the carpenters' coil up the hose.\n\n3 Comments\n\nDo you have any information about anti-boarding netting? It's mentioned in the book series a lot but I never could visualize what it actually is. Thanks for your work on this, its been very informative.\n\nHere's a definition from Steel's \"The Elements of Rigging and Seamanship\" (1794), but I'm not sure how much it helps one envision what they're talking about:\n\n\"NETTING. A fence made by setting together the BIGHTS of small ropes, leaving uniform spaces or meshes between: it is used in different parts of a ship; thus, the BOARDING-NETTING is thrown over the sides, to prevent the enemies boarding. BOWSPRIT-NETTING is fastened at the outer end of the bowsprit to the horses, or man-ropes, to stow away the fore-topmast-staysail and jib.

{"text":"Pages\n\nThursday, April 22, 2010\n\nWhere in the world is the mooring?\n\nWhen we deploy an acoustic mooring, we start with the buoy (the big yellow top float) first. Then we attach more wire and instruments as the ship slowly moves forward. By the time we're ready to attach the anchor, we have about 3.5 miles of wire strung out behind the ship. The last step in the deployment is to dump the anchor and let it sink to the bottom. The anchor pulls the rest of the mooring underwater.\n\nWe let go of the anchor at our chosen site, but the anchor doesn't fall straight to the bottom because it's being dragged back by the buoy and other equipment on the 3.5 mile wire. After the anchor has reached the bottom (it takes about 50 minutes), we have to do a survey to figure out exactly where it landed.\n\nNaturally, we use acoustics to do the survey. Similar to how we measured the bottom depth, we send a short \"ping\" from the ship to the anchor. The acoustic release (a piece of equipment attached the anchor) replies with another ping. By measuring the time it takes for this signal to travel to the bottom and back, we can figure out how far away the anchor is from the ship. The picture below shows what we might learn from making one distance measurement:\n\nA single distance measurement tells us that the anchor could lie anywhere on that blue circle. (The distance from the ship to any point on the circle is the same.) Since we need to know the exact anchor position, we obviously have to make some more measurements. So we move the ship and make a second measurement of the travel time (thus the distance) to the anchor. The picture below shows us what that second measurement tells us:\n\nNow we know that the anchor has to lie on both the blue and the red circles. That means that the anchor could be at one of two places (indicated by the stars on the plot). Taking a second measurement obviously narrowed down the list of possible locations for the anchor. Let's see what happens when we take a third measurement:\n\nNow the anchor has to lie on all three circles, so we know it must be located at the intersection point (marked with a triangle). Hooray! We've found our anchor!\n\nAs you can see from this post, acoustic surveys require knowing a bit of geometry (to find the intersection points of these circles). It's a practical application of the mathematics you have learned (or will learn) in school"}
{"text":"The Raft of the Medusa--Theodore Gericault Social Criticism is a loose category used by artists throughout the ages to communicate their outrage over the injustices of their times. This kind of art carries a powerful message and story and my favorite painting of all is Theodore Gericault's Raft of the Medusa, which he painted in 1818. Gericault was a French artist in the Romantic style. No, this style definitely does not deal with themes of love--it comes from the French word roman which means tale, and the Romantic artists told stories of noble deeds, dramatic events, and large scale tragedies. As the story goes, in 1818 the transport ship Medusa sank off the African coast. The officers abandonned the ship in a lifeboat and left the crew of more than 100 to fend as best they could on a raft. For a few days, the officers towed the raft but then cast it adrift.

{"text":"Coast defence\n\nFrom Classic Encyclopedia 1911\n\nCOAST DEFENCE, a general term for the military and naval protection and defence of a coast-line, harbours, dockyards, coaling-stations, &c., against serious attack by a strong naval force of the enemy, bombardment, torpedoboat or destroyer raids, hostile landing parties, or invasion by a large or small army. The principal means employed by the defender to cope with these and other forms of attack which may be expected in time of war or political crisis are described below. See also for further details Navy; Army; Fortification And Siege Craft; Ammunition; Ordnance; Submarine Mines; Torpedo. The following is a general description of modern coast defences as applied in the British service.\n\nNo system of coast defence is of any value which does not take full account of the general distribution of sea-power and the resultant strength of the possible hostile forces. By resultant strength is meant the balance of one side over the other, for it is now generally regarded as an axiom that two opposing fleets must make their main effort in seeking one another, and that the force available for attack on coast defences will be either composed of such ships as can be spared from the main engagement, or the remnant of the hostile fleet after it has been victorious in a general action.\n\nCoast defences are thus the complement and to some extent the measure of naval strength. It is often assumed that this principle was neglected in the large scheme of fortification associated in England with the name of Lord Palmerston, but it is at least arguable that the engineers responsible for the details of this scheme were dependent then as now on the naval view of what was a suitable naval strength. Public opinion has since been educated to a better appreciation of the necessity for a strong navy, and, as the British navy has increased, the scale of coast defences required has necessarily waned. Such a change of opinion is always gradual, and it is difficult to name an exact date on which it may be said that modern coast defence, as practised by British engineers, first began.\n\nAn approximation may, however, be made by taking the bombardment of Alexandria (1881) as being the parting of the ways between the old and the modern school. At that time the British navy, and in fact all other navies, had not really emerged from the stage of the wooden battleships. Guns were still muzzle-loaders, arranged mainly in broadsides, and protected by heavy armour; sails were still used as means of propulsion; torpedoes, net defence, signalling, and search-lights quite undeveloped.\n\nAt this time coast defences bore a close resemblance to the ships - the guns were muzzle-loaders, arranged in long batteries like a broadside, often in two tiers. The improvement of rifled ordnance had called for increased protection, and this was found first by solid constructions of granite, and latterly by massive iron fronts. Examples of these remain in Garrison Fort, Sheerness, and in Hurst Castle at the west end of the Solent. The range of guns being then relatively short, it was necessary to place forts at fairly close intervals, and where the channels to be defended could not be spanned from the shore, massive structures with two or even three tiers of guns, placed as close as on board ship and behind heavy armour, were built up from the ocean bed. On both sides the calibre and weight of guns were increasing, till the enormous sizes of 80 and Ioo tons were used both ashore and afloat.\n\nThe bombardment of Alexandria established two new principles, or new applications of old principles, by showing the value of concealment and dispersion in reducing the effect of the fire of the fleet. On the old system, two ships firing at one another or ships firing at an iron-fronted fort shot \"mainly into the brown\"; if they missed the gun aimed at, one to the right or left was likely to be hit; if they missed the water-line, the upper works were in danger. At Alexandria, however, the Egyptian guns were scattered over a long line of shore, and it was soon found that with the guns and gunners available, hits could only be obtained by running in to short range and dealing with one gun at a time.\n\nThis new principle was not at once recognized, for systems die hard, and much money and brains were invested in the then existing system. But a modern school was gradually formed; a small group of engineer officers under the headship of Sir Andrew Clarke, the then inspector-general of fortifications, took the matter up, and by degrees the new views prevailed and the modern school of coast defence came into being between 1881 and 1885. Meanwhile important changes had been developing in the gun, the all-important weapon of coast defence, changes due mainly to the gradual supersession of the muzzle-loader by the breech-loader. The latter gave the advantages of quicker loading and more protection for the gun detachment over and above the technical improvements in the gun itself, which gave higher muzzle velocity, greater striking effect and longer effective range.\n\nAll this reacted on the general scheme of coast defence by enabling the number of guns to be reduced and the distance between forts increased. On the other hand, the ships, too, gained increased range and increased accuracy of fire, so that it became necessary in many cases to advance the general line of the coast defences farther from the harbour or dockyard to be defended, in order to keep the attackers out of range of the objective.\n\nAnother change resulted from an improvement in the method of mounting. Even in the older days discussion had arisen freely on the relative merits of barbette and casemate mounting. In the former the gun fires over a parapet, giving a larger field of view to the gun-layer, and a larger field of fire for the gun, with, however, more exposure for the detachment. The latter gives a restricted view and greater safety to the layer, but unless the casemate takes the form of a revolving turret, the arc of fire is very limited.\n\nAn important advantage of the barbette system is its cheapness, and thus in order to obtain with it concealment, suggestions were made for various forms of mounting which would allow of the gun, under the shock of recoil, disappearing behind the parapet to emerge only when loaded and ready for the next round. A mounting of this description for muzzle-loading guns, designed by Colonel Moncrieff, was actually in use in the defences of Alexandria and in H.M.S. \"Temeraire.\" But with the increased charges and length of breech-loading guns, a further change was desirable, and after some trials a system of disappearing mountings (see Ordnance: Garrison Mountings) was adopted into the British service.\n\nA word must be now said on the size of gun finally adopted. At first muzzle-loaders figured largely in the British defences, even though these were planned on modern ideas; and even in 1906 muzzle-loading guns still existed and were counted as part of the defences. The sizes of these guns varied from the 320r 64pounder, of which the nomenclature depends on the weight of the shell, to the 7-in., 9 -in.,io-in., 111n.,12.5and finally 17.25-in., the size indicating the calibre. Such a multiplication of sizes was due to gradual improvements in the science of gun manufacture, each advance being hailed as the last word to be said on the subject, and each in turn being rapidly made obsolete by something bigger and better. But with the improvements in gun design which followed the introduction of breech-loaders, the types used in coast defence were gradually narrowed down to two, the 9.2 -in. and the 6 -in. guns. Of these, the 9.2 -in. was considered powerful enough to attack armour at any practical range, while the 6-in. gun was introduced to deal with lightly armed vessels at shorter ranges where 9.2-in. guns were unnecessarily powerful.\n\nA few larger guns of Io -in. calibre have actually been used, but though the British navy has now sealed a 12-in. 50-ton gun as the stock size for battleships, for the heavy armament of the coast defences the War Office remain faithful to the 9.2-in. calibre, preferring to develop improvements rather in the direction of more rapid fire and higher muzzle velocity.\n\nThe 6 -in. has also been retained and is extensively used for the smaller ports, where attack by powerful vessels is for various reasons considered improbable.\n\nThe design of the forts to contain the guns necessarily varied with the type of defence adopted, and the duties which the forts had to fulfil. These duties may be said to be twofold, first to facilitate the service of the guns, and secondly to protect the guns and their detachments from damage by fire from ships, or by close attack from landing parties. The service of the gun is provided for by a system of cartridge and shell magazines (see Ammunition), well protected from fire and suitably arranged. The shelters for the gun detachments must be bomb-proof and fitted with some arrangements for comfort and sanitation. Formerly it was the custom to provide living accommodation for the full garrison in casemates inside each fort, but it is now considered better to provide barrack accommodation in the vicinity and to occupy forts in peace only by a few caretakers. The shelters in the fort itself can thus be kept at the minimum required when actually manning the guns. The protection of the guns and magazines against bombardment is provided, in the British service, mainly by an earthen parapet over a substantial roof or wall of concrete, but immediately round the gun an \"apron\" of concrete is necessary to withstand the shock of discharge or \"blast.\" It has been already mentioned that in the old designs a large number of guns was put in each fort, but with dispersion and improved gun power this number was much reduced. At first the type of fort adopted was for four guns, of which the two in the centre were heavy and the two on the flank of medium power. Such a design was good from the point of view of the engineer; it gave an economical grouping of magazines and shelters and was easily adapted to varying sites, and the smaller guns helped the larger by covering their flanks both towards the sea and also over the land approaches. But from the point of view of the artillery officer the arrangement was faulty, for when the guns are too much separated, ranging has to be carried out separately for each gun. On the other hand, two guns of the same calibre placed near one another can be fought simultaneously and form what is known as a \"group.\" In the typical 4 -gun battery described above, the flank guns had to be fought independently, which was wasteful of officers and staff. Further, in a battery of more than two guns the arc of fire of the centre guns is much restricted by that of the guns on either flank.\n\nFor these reasons it is now generally recognized that new works should be designed for only two guns of the same calibre, though 30r 4-gun batteries are occasionally used in special circumstances.\n\nProtection of the gun detachments against infantry attack is best provided by a line of infantry posts outside and on the flanks of the gun batteries, but as small parties may evade the outposts, or the latter may be driven in, it is necessary to place round each fort a line of obstacles sufficient to protect the guns against a rush and to cover the infantry while it rallies. This obstacle was formerly a wet or dry ditch, with escarp, counterscarp and flanking galleries; but with the new design of parapet a simpler form of obstacle was adopted. This was obtained by carrying down and forward the slope of the parapet to a point well below the level of the surrounding ground, and then placing a stout fence at the foot of the parapet and concealed from view. It is in fact the old principle of the sunk fence, and has this further advantage, that the fence, being visible from the parapet, can be kept under fire by men posted between the guns without any special flanking galleries.\n\nOccasionally two or more batteries are placed inside one line of obstacles, but usually each 2 -gun battery is complete in itself.\n\nCases arise, e.g. with sites on the top of a cliff, where no obstacle is required; in such places the parapet merges into the surrounding ground.\n\nIn old days the parapet was shaped with well-defined edges and slopes. Now the parapet slopes gently down to the front and is rounded at the sides, so as to present no definite edge or angle to the enemy, and concealment is furthered by allowing grass or small scrub to grow over the parapet and round the guns. In order to obtain complete concealment from view the background behind the guns must be carefully studied from the point of view of the attack. Sites on the sky-line, and marked contrasts of colour or shape, should be avoided. In some cases extensive planting, amounting to landscape gardening, is justified. This is most easily arranged in the tropics, where plant growth is rapid. In all cases the guns and their mountings should be coloured to blend with the background and thus avoid hard lines and shadows.\n\nAny change of principle such as that of 1885 involves improvements both in guns and their adjuncts. Of these latter the most important was the position-finder designed by Colonel Watkin. This instrument in its simplest form, when the observer is following a ship through the telescope of the instrument, draws on a chart the track of the ship, so that the exact bearing and distance of the latter can be ascertained at any time and communicated to the guns by electrical and other dials, &c. The position-finder may be some distance from the guns it serves, and connected with them by electric cable. The guns can then be placed well under cover and in many cases out of sight of the target, giving a measure of protection which cannot be obtained with any system of direct laying over sights. This instrument has been applied on a high site to control guns placed low, or where guns are so placed as to be liable to obscuration by fog or mist the position-finder can be placed below the fog-line. In either case direct laying is provided for as an alternative. In some defences batteries equipped with old pattern 9-in. muzzle-loading guns, mounted as howitzers for long-range firing, have been placed in folds in the ground so as to be quite invisible from the sea and therefore invulnerable. Such batteries are fought entirely by the position-finder.\n\nThe next adjunct to coast defences is the submarine mine. In Great Britain the first submarine mining company dates from 1873, and from that date mining defences were gradually installed both at home and abroad; but the modern system of mining, which for twenty years was maintained at British ports, really started into full life under the impetus of Sir A. Clarke, about the same year (1885) in which we have dated the commencement of the modern coast defence system.\n\nWith the increased speed of warships, a method of attack on fortifications was evolved by running past the main defences and either taking them in reverse, or disregarding them and attacking the dockyard or other objective at short range. This was made more possible at most defended ports by the pushing forward of the defences which has been already alluded to, and it is especially dangerous where dockyards or towns are situated some way up a river or estuary, so that once the defences are passed there is a large stretch of water (e.g. the Thames, the Solent, and Cork harbour) in which the enemy can manoeuvre. In such cases there are two possible forms of 'defence, first by arranging for gun-fire behind the main gun position, usually called the defence of inner waters, and secondly by placing in the entrance and under the fire of the main gun defence some form of obstruction to detain ships under fire. This obstruction can be passive (booms, chains, rows of piles or sunken ships) or active (mines or torpedoes). Passive obstructions are only effective against comparatively small craft, and at important ports mines are the only efficient obstruction which can be used against large vessels.\n\nAfter some years of experiment, English engineers adopted two main classes of mines, called \"observation\" and \"contact\" mines (see Submarine Mines). Both were fired by electricity, which was applied only at the moment a hostile ship was within the dangerous zone of a mine. In the observation mines the moment of applying the electric current was ascertained by a position-finder, which, tracing a ship's course on a chart, made an electrical connexion at the moment the ship was over a mine. These mines were placed so as to be well below the bottom of any ships afloat and were used in channels which it was desired to leave open for the entrance of friendly vessels. Contact mines, which are moored a few feet below the surface of the water, are fired after certain electrical connexions have been made in a firing room on shore by the ship itself striking against the mine. These are used in waters which it is intended to deny to friend and foe. Except in narrow waters where the whole width of the channel was required for friendly traffic, contact mines were generally used to limit the width of the channel to the minimum consistent with the amount of friendly traffic which would use the port in war. It will be readily understood that by bending this channel and disclosing its exact position only to special pilots, a very complete measure of security against surprise would be obtained. In English ports the practical importance of allowing free ingress for friendly traffic overruled all other considerations, and the friendly channels were always straight and coincided with some part of the usual fairway channel. They were also carefully marked by lightships and buoys.\n\nA variation of the submarine mine is the Brennan torpedo, purchased by the British government about 1890. This differs from the torpedo used on board ship, mainly by the fact that the engine-power which drives it is on shore and connected with the torpedo by two strong wires. These wires are wound out of the torpedo by the engine, and by varying the strain on the two wires very accurate control of the steering can be obtained. This torpedo shares with the submarine mine the disadvantages that it must wait for the enemy to venture within its range, and with all other forms of defence (except contact mines), that it is made useless by fog or rain. As compared with a mine it has the advantage of being unaffected by tide or depth, and of forming no obstruction to traffic, except when actually in action. It was installed at the principal ports only.\n\nThe system of defence hitherto described is thus a main gun defence of 9.2 -in. and 6-in. guns pushed well forward, assisted by position-finders, mine-fields and torpedo stations, and with some gun defence of inner waters. Subject to improvements in patterns of guns and mountings - of which the most important has been the substitution of barbette mounting and shield for the recoil mounting described above - this system held the field up to 1905, when, partly as a result of the experience of the Russo-Japanese War, and partly owing to the alteration of the naval balance of power due to the destruction of the Russian fleet, both the scale and system of, defence were very considerably modified.\n\nWe can now consider another branch of defence, which was evolved pari passu with the automobile torpedo, and was therefore almost non-existent in 1885. In this year the boats specially built for carrying torpedoes were little more than launches, but in the next five years was developed the type of first-class torpedo boat. This, while seaworthy, was limited as to its radius of action by the small amount of coal it would carry. But with a possibly hostile coast only a few hours' steam away, and with foreign harbours thronged with torpedo craft, it became necessary for the British government especially to consider this form of attack and its antidote. It was obvious that in daytime and in clear weather such an attack would have little chance of success, also that in no circumstances would torpedo boats be able to damage fixed defences. Their best chance was attack by night, and the only form of attack was that referred to above as \"running past,\" that is, an attempt to evade the defences and to attack ships or docks inside. The light draught of torpedo boats and their comparative invisibility favoured this form of attack.\n\nTo meet it the first requirement was some form of illumination of the defended channel. Experiments in the attack and defence of defended harbours took place at Gosport in 1879 and 1880, at Milford Haven in 1885, at Berehaven (by the royal navy) in 1886, at Langston Harbour in 1887, and a series at the Needles entrance of the Isle of Wight up to 1892. During the course of these experiments various methods of illumination were tried, but by far the best was found to be the light from an electric arc-lamp of high power projected by powerful reflectors. At first these were used as concentrated beams forming a pencil of light with an angular opening of about 2\u00b0 to 3\u00b0. Such a beam directed at an incoming ship gives effective illumination up to a mile or more from the source of light, but has the disadvantage that it must be moved so as to follow the ship's movements.\n\nEach beam thus lights only one ship at a time, and the movements of several beams crossing and recrossing have a very confusing effect, with the consequent risk that a proportion of the attacking vessels may slip through unnoticed.\n\nAn alternative method of using electric lights is to arrange the projector so that the light comes out in a fan (generally of 30\u00b0 divergence). Two or three such lights are usually placed side by side, forming an illuminated fan of considerable divergence. These fans are now used for the main defence, with in front of them one or more search-lights to warn the defences of the approach of ships. There is some loss of range when using these fans as compared with search-lights, but by occupying both sides of a channel and placing the defences against torpedo boats at the narrowest point, an effective illumination can be obtained in moderate weather.\n\nHeavy guns can, of course, be fired against torpedo boats, but their rate of fire is relatively slow, and at first they had also the disadvantage of using black powder, the smoke of which obscured the lights.\n\nA small quick-firing gun using smokeless powder was seen to be a necessity. At first the 6-pounder was adopted as the stock size supplemented by machine guns for close range, but soon afterwards it became necessary to reconsider the scale of anti-torpedo boat defences, owing first to the increased size of first-class torpedo boats, and secondly to the introduction of a new type of vessel, the torpedo boat destroyer. The increased size of torpedo boats, and improved arrangements for the distribution of coal on board, made these boats practically proof against 6-pounder guns and necessitated the introduction of the 12pounder. The torpedo boat destroyer, originally introduced to chase and destroy torpedo boats, not only justified its existence by checking the construction of more torpedo boats, but in addition became itself a sea-going torpedo craft, and thus increased the menace to defended ports and also the area over which this form of attack would be dangerous.\n\nThis development was met by an increased number of 12pounder guns, assisted in the more important places by 4.7-in. (and latterly 4-in.) guns, and also by an increased number of lights, both guns and lights increasing at some places nearly fourfold. But even with the best possible arrangement of this form of defence, the possibility of interference by fog, mist or rain introduces a considerable element of uncertainty.\n\nAbout the same time, and largely on account of the demand for better and quicker firing, the \"automatic sight\" was introduced (see Ordnance: Garrison; and Sights). In this, a development of the principle of the position-finder, the act of bringing an object into the field of the auto-sight automatically lays the gun. In order to take full advantage of this, the ammunition was made up into a cartridge with powder and shell in one case to allow of the quickest possible loading. It may be added that the efficiency of the auto-sight depends on the gun being a certain height above the water, and that therefore the rise and fall of tide has to be allowed for in setting the sight.\n\nIn view of the possible interference by fog it was thought wise at an early stage to provide, towards the rear of the defences, some form of physical obstacle behind which ships could lie in safety. Such an obstacle had been designed in the early days by the Royal Engineers and took the form of a \"boom\" of baulks of timber secured by chains. Such booms were limited in size by considerations of expense and were only partially successful. About 1892 the British navy took the matter up and began experiments on a larger scale, substituting wire hawsers for chains and using old gunboats to divide the booms up into sections of convenient length. The result was that booms were definitely adopted as an adjunct of coast defence. Their place is behind the lighted area, but within reach of some of the anti-torpedo boat batteries.\n\nOther forms of obstacle to torpedo boat attack, based on a modification of contact mines or a combination of mines and passive obstructions, have been tried but never definitely adopted, though some form of under-water defence of this description seems necessary to meet attack by submarines.\n\nWe may now summarize the anti-torpedo boat defences. These are, first, an outpost or look-out line of electric searchlights, then a main lighted area composed of fixed lights with which there are a considerable number of 12-pounder or 4-in. Q.F. guns fitted with auto-sights, and behind all this, usually at the narrowest part of the entrance, the boom.\n\nOnce coast defences are designed and installed, little change is possible during an attack, so that the operation of fighting a system of defence, such as we have considered above, is mainly a matter of peace training of gun-crews, electric light men and look-outs, coupled with careful organization. To facilitate the transmission of order and intelligence, a considerable system of telephonic and other electrical communication has been established. This may be considered under the three heads of (I) orders, (2) intelligence, (3) administration.\n\nThe communication of orders follows the organization adopted for the whole fortress. Each fortress is commanded by a fortress commander, who has a suitable staff. This officer sends orders to commanders of artillery, engineers, and infantry. The artillery officer in charge of a group of batteries is called a \"fire commander\"; his command is generally confined to such batteries as fire over the same area of water and can mutually support one another. Thus there may be several fire commanders at a defended port. Anti-torpedo boat batteries are not in a fire command, and are connected to the telephone system for intelligence only and not for orders. The engineers require orders for the control of electric lights or Brennan torpedo. The officer in charge of a group of lights or of a torpedo station is called a director. Though receiving orders direct from the fortress commander, he has also to co-operate with the nearest artillery commander. The infantry are posted on the flanks of the fixed defences, or on the land front. They are divided into suitable groups, each under a commanding officer, who communicates with the fortress commander. In large fortresses the area is divided into sections, each including some portion of the artillery, engineers, and infantry defence. In such cases the section commanders receive orders from the fortress commander and pass them on to their subordinates.\n\nThe intelligence system includes communication with the naval signal stations in the vicinity, one of which is specially selected for each port as the warning station and is directly connected to some part of the defences. Another part of the intelligence system deals with the arrangements for examining all ships entering a harbour. This is usually effected by posting in each entrance examination vessels, which are in communication by signal with a battery or selected post on shore. Any points on shore which can see the approaches are connected by a special alarm circuit, mainly for use in case of torpedo boat attack.\n\nThe administrative system of telephones is used for daily routine messages. These usually take the form of telephone lines radiating from a central exchange. In many stations the same lines may be used for command and administration, or intelligence and command, but at the larger stations each class of line is kept distinct. (W. B. B.)"}

Even looking at the exhibit's 1859 copy of \"The Raft\"--the original is too fragile to leave the Louvre, in part because of Gericault's experimental use of bitumen to create deep, brooding shadow--it's not hard to understand the sensation that attended the painting's London premiere.\n\nThe canvas, which fills an entire gallery, places the viewer amid the Medusa's survivors at the moment of their salvation, as they strain heavenward to signal the Argus on the distant horizon. Yet there's nothing triumphant about the scene: The bodies of the living and the dead are shown in perfect counterpoise, a reminder that we are all, in the larger sense, in the same boat. Gericault, a bit of a melancholic obsessive to begin with, turned his rue des Martyrs studio into a virtual charnel house during the intense 18-month production of \"The Raft\"--his studies of decaying human heads and limbs hang in a gallery adjacent to the finished painting. It's this intimate identification with the plight of the sailors--\"suspended,\" as one survivor wrote, \"between hope and fear\"--that turns the painting into a meditation on human struggle and mortality.\n\nYet \"Crossing the Channel\" makes the point that \"The Raft of the Medusa\" was also a political watershed, an indictment of French corruption as provocative and controversial as Zola's \"J'Accuse.\" The painting's focal figure--presumably a slave bound for Senegal, given Gericault's abolitionist sympathies--immediately brings to mind Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix's well-known 1830 image of bare-breasted Liberty manning the revolutionary ramparts. The scene's implicit class strife even inspired a song by those contemporary poets of discontent, the Pogues, on 1990's Hell's Ditch: \"The architects of our doom\/Around their tables sit\/And in their thrones of power\/Condemn those they've cast adrift.\"\n\n\"The Raft\" also serves to illustrate \"Crossing the Channel\"'s larger point--namely, that British painting, with its looser technique and democratic instincts, helped to liberate French artists from the chilling conformity of neoclassicism. In the image of the British rescuing France from aimless drift, \"Crossing the Channel\" finds its working metaphor.\n\n\"These paintings were partially born out of a period of great turmoil,\" explains the exhibit's curator, Patrick Noon. \"The French had recently tried to destroy their history by obliterating the aristocracy. Then you had Napoleon, who was this great hero, this demigod. Everybody aspired to emulate him. There was a reason hundreds of thousands of people would march off to be killed. They believed in him.\"\n\nAfter Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo, French culture lost both its major patron and its raison d'\u00eatre. \"There was a generation of artists that came of age around this time, including Delacroix, that was completely disillusioned. There were no heroes left: Napoleon was history, and at the same time antiquity and classical literature had become pass\u00e9. So British culture offered something that filled a vacuum.\"\n\nIn times past, Noon explains, the official line of art history has tended to diminish British art's influence on later French movements like the Barbizon School and Impressionism. (Such continental chauvinism suggests that the French were never too demure about cannibalism.) But, as this exhibit's scholarly catalog makes clear, the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 signaled the beginning of a surprisingly productive congress between the two nations, with British tourists flooding Paris, and Parisians clamoring for the poems of Byron and the novels of Sir Walter Scott. Byron even had a popular French cologne named after him. Given the ancient enmity between Britain and (if you'll pardon the Rumsfeldian locution) Old Europe, the d\u00e9tente was naturally not without friction: \"Crossing the Channel\" includes one 1814 illustration by Carle Vernet that depicts British tourists in Paris as comically piggish burghers.\n\nLikewise, France's admiration for British painting was sometimes coupled with disdain for the painters themselves. Upon meeting J.M.W Turner, for instance, Delacroix recorded that Turner had \"the look of an English farmer, black coat of a rather coarse type, thick shoes--and a cold, hard face.\" Still, surveying the luminous seascapes of Turner and Richard Parkes Bonington, or a John Constable canvas like \"The White Horse,\" you get a sense of why Delacroix and company were attracted to the fresh landscapes of their cross-channel colleagues. Here was a style that exploded the neoclassical dogma of David and Gros, simply by ignoring it."}
{"text":"From the Oceanic Discoverer in New Zealand\n\nJan 16, 2013 - Oceanic Discoverer\n\nAnglican Church in Wellington\n\nWellington cable car\n\nWellington, North Island\n\nThe Oceanic Discoverer arrived in Wellington this morning after a rough night sailing down the Wairarapa coast, past the south east of New Zealand's North Island. The boisterous weather was wilder than predicted by the local weather service, but the Lindblad Expedition members and the ship's crew held up well. We did, however, end up starting our day in Wellington a little later than originally planned.\n\nWellington, 'the world's coolest little capital,' is the political capital of New Zealand and a major cultural centre. With a population of around 200,000 people it is New Zealand's third largest city. The artistic world thrives in Wellington, a city particularly known as the major site of New Zealand's film industry. Here Peter Jackson (now Sir Peter), Fran Walsh and the special effects wizards at Weta Workshop worked on Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit.\n\nThe Linblad expeditioneers began their day with a trip to one of Wellington's most beautiful historic buildings, old St Paul's cathedral. The cathedral was built in 1866, constructed entirely of New Zealand native timbers. At St Paul's a local guide explained how the church had been saved as a historic building in the 1960s, after the Anglican (episcopalian) church had moved to a new modern cathedral. He also outlined the church's historic connections with the armed forces of the USA. In 1942, American marines, soldiers and sailors arrived in Wellington in their thousands. New Zealand's own servicemen were away deployed in North Africa and Europe, fighting since 1939 by the side of Britain, the Mother Country. After Pearl Harbor, American forces were sent to New Zealand, both to defend the country and as a base for heading into the South Pacific to roll back the invaders. The Americans were extremely popular with much of the New Zealand population, especially the young women (perhaps less so with some of the young Kiwi men). St Pauls became the favoured place of worship for the Americans and the Marine colors still hang in the cathedral.\n\nAfter our visit to old St Paul's we drove up to Wellington's magnificent botanic gardens. From here a fine view of the city and its harbor was enjoyed. The gardens contain a wonderful mix of exotic and native plants and are a good site to observe local bird life. The tui, a beautiful native song bird, was particularly in evidence during our visit. Our party was particularly taken with the garden's peace monument, a beautiful Japanese-style waterfall and pond. This monument symbolizes the hope that the atomic bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 will never be repeated.\n\nFrom the gardens we descended to the waterfront for a visit to New Zealand's national museum, Te Papa Tongarewa, (the house of treasures). This world class museum had exhibits on a wide range of aspects of New Zealand's natural history, Maori culture, the culture of the Pacific, the history of her immigrant peoples, and the arts and crafts of the country.\n\nThe afternoon was rounded off with a visit to Zealandia, a sanctuary or 'mainland island' established in the suburb of Karori, in the old city reservoir. A predator proof fence has been erected around the sanctuary and pest species eliminated from the area. New Zealand was once a land where the only native land mammals were several bat species and birds and reptiles ruled supreme. Many bird and reptile species were eliminated from the mainland by rats, mustelids, cats and other pests and by the destruction of habitat. Rare species have been reintroduced to Zealandia. Among the creatures seen today were the tuatara, (an ancient reptile unique to New Zealand), the kaka (a large and noisy bush parrot), the saddleback or tieke (a rare and beautiful native wattelbird), the takahe (a large, colourful flightless rail once believed to be extinct), and the brown teal or pateke (a rare endemic New Zealand dabbling duck). It is cheering to know that many of the birds breeding at Zealandia are now seen in other parts of Wellington, flying out from their Karori haven.\n\nWellington proved to be indeed a 'cool' capital, with a variety of experiences to delight the storm tossed visitor.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nPeter Clayworth is originally from the beautiful town of Nelson, in New Zealand's South Island (Te Wai Pounamu). He now lives in New Zealand's capital city of Wellington, on the North Island (Te Ika a Maui). Peter studied history at the University of Otago, in Dunedin, gaining a BA with first class honors and a PhD. In addition to the history of New Zealand, Peter has studied African, Indian, and Pacific history as well as the history of science and ideas. He has also studied zoology and ecology, and he has a passionate interest in the natural environment."}
{"text":"In May 1797 Napoleon, the best-known but still just one of several French generals, took ship from\nToulon with an army bound for Egypt, escorted by Admiral Brueys with 13 sail of the line. Warned of\nthe assembly at Toulon, but unaware of its destination, St Vincent, influenced by a heavy hint from\nthe Admiralty, sent Rear-Admiral Nelson with three of the line and two frigates into the\nMediterranean to reconnoitre: shortly after he reinforced him with ten more of the line under\nTroubridge as commodore.\nNelson learned that in June the French had taken Malta and then sailed again. He guessed for\nAlexandria, and sent the sloop Mutine (16) to Alexandria as a scout. Mutine reached Alexandria\none day before the French arrived, and sailed back again without seeing them; as a result Nelson\nspent three weeks ranging the Mediterranean without finding the French fleet, while Napoleon's army\nconquered Egypt.\nBrueys' fleet was left at anchor at Aboukir Bay, his flagship L'Orient being too big to enter\nAlexandria harbour, and had been there for three weeks when finally Nelson found it on July 29th.\nWhile the two fleets were matched in numbers, Brueys had a slight edge in size: Nelson had thirteen\n74-gun ships and the 50-gun Leander, while Brueys' flagship mounted 120 guns and he had two 80-\ngun vessels as well as nine 74s, plus four frigates, two sloops and three bomb vessels. However, the\nFrench fleet was at anchor, the thirteen of the line moored in line ahead, the shore being to port, with\nthe four frigates inside them, significantly so since it was an indication to Nelson of the depth of\nwater available inside the French line.\nA further indicator was that the French ships were at single anchor, which meant they had been left\nfree to swing with the wind (a ship at single anchor always points into the wind), which meant in turn\nthat there must be enough water inside them to float a 74.\n\nThe battle (29-30 July 1798)\n\nThe shore, and therefore the line of the French fleet, ran at this point roughly north north-west, and\nas the British came in sight in the early evening, the wind was also north north-west: the French line\nwere facing directly into it. Brueys assumed the British would wait till morning before beginning the\nbattle, but Nelson moved immediately into action, coming towards the French from the north-east\nwith the wind slight behind the starboard beam.\nAt the head of the British line, Troubridge's Culloden hit a reef, and though rescued later, played no\npart in the action. That left Orion to be the first British ship to come up to the French, sailing inside\nthe French line and down to engage Peuple Souverain, the fifth ship in the line. Behind her Theseus,\nAudacious and Zealous also sailed between the French and the shore (though outside the line of the\nFrench frigates: one of these, S\u00e9rieux, opened fire, but was sunk by Orion without much ado).\nNelson's Vanguard then sailed down the outside of the French, followed by Minotaur and Defence,\npitting eight British ships against the leading French five, which happened to be the oldest and\nweakest French ships. All of the French line were taken by surprise by the inshore attack in the dark:\ntheir landward batteries were unprepared, without even their guns run out on that side when the\naction started.\nMeanwhile, Bellerophon bypassed the British ships already in action on the seaward side, and took on\nthe French flagship L'Orient in an unequal battle, while Majestic went past her to engage Tonnant.\nThe first French ship driven out of the line was Peuple Souverain, with Orion inside her and Defence\noutside. The gap thus left was taken up by the little Leander, making up for her relatively puny\nbroadside by being in position to rake Franklin across the bows. L'Orient's far heavier broadside\ndismasted and severly damaged Bellerophon, but her place was more than filled by the last two\nBritish ships to enter the action, Swiftsure and Alexander. At 9 o'clock L'Orient was seen to be on\nfire, and at 10 o'clock she blew up with an explosion so immense that all firing stopped for ten\nminutes.\nBy midnight all of the leading seven French ships were out of the action one way or another. Of the\nremainder, only Tonnant, eighth in line, was engaged: by 3 a.m. she was dismasted, and the British\ncould turn their attention to the rearmost ships while waiting for her to surrender, as she eventually\ndid. Heureux and Mercure, the next in line were attacked and forced to strike, and the rearmost,\nTimoleon, ran aground, where she was set on fire by her crew. The remaining two ships, G\u00e9n\u00e9reux\nand Guillaume Tell, relatively undamaged, were able to escape with two frigates.\nDespite the damage to Bellerophon and the grounding of Culloden, no British ship was lost. On the\nother side the French lost one blown up, one burnt, one wrecked and nine surrendered, in what may\nwell have been the most overwhelming naval defeat (in a single engagement) of all time.\n\nAftermath\n\nThis was Nelson's first battle in overall command, and it is distinguished from all other previous\nbattles of the war - indeed for several centuries - not so much by its tactics, unorthodox and brilliant\nas they were but by the way in which Nelson's objective became not merely the winning of the battle\nbut the destruction of the enemy fleet.\nEven Duncan at Camperdown, which had perhaps come closest\nto this aim, had allowed eleven ships to escape: it wasn't until the Helder, the year after the Nile, that\nDuncan moved in to destroy the rest. Nelson had changed the meaning of a naval battle, just as\nNapoleon in a similar way had changed the meaning of a military battle (or, perhaps, to make it again\nwhat it had been in the days of the Romans).\nFrom the point of view of the immediate war situation, the result of the battle was not as great as it\nmight have been. It is true that the Nile marked the triumphant re-entry of the British fleet into the\nMediterranean, from which it would never again be dislodged by force, though a base still had to be\nwon. On the other hand, Napoleon still held Egypt, and his army there was still a threat to India.\nAnd most importantly of all from the point of the war as a whole, the battle had come too late. If there is a\nparallel universe in which Nelson failed at the Nile, its history might not be very different from our\nown. But had Nelson found the French fleet on the way to Egypt, Napoleon would very probably have\nbeen taken or killed: that would have changed subsequent history totally.\nNapoleon subsequently slipped back through the Mediterranean, despite the British fleet, in the\nfrigate Muiron, in just such a way, ironically enough,as Nelson had slipped through the Spanish fleet\nin 1796. For the moment, both their lives were charmed.\nFor his victory, Nelson became a peer: a more important personal result however may have been that\nhe took Vanguard to Naples for repairs, there meeting Sir Charles and Lady Hamilton. Presumably\nwithout prescience St Vincent wrote to him from Cadiz: \"Tell Lady Hamilton I rely on her to\nadminister to your health.\"\n\nNote\n\nBolitho was apparently at the Nile, though the battle is not recorded in any of the Bolitho books (so far).\nHowever, his squadron's interception of some of the French fleet on the way to Egypt weakened it."}

The pre-World War I concept of armoured cruisers had been abandoned, but in their stead the Admiralty saw a place for powerful cruisers, able to patrol the sea lanes of the British Empire, and which were well-armed enough that they could destroy enemy commerce cruisers. The result was a group of British warships, known as the 'Washington Treaty Cruisers', that did everything the Admiralty wanted, but which conformed to the limits imposed by the treaty. These impressive cruisers were high-sided, spacious and stately - perfect peacetime ambassadors for British power. In war they also packed a considerable punch. During World War II the Royal Navy's thirteen heavy cruisers saw service in every theatre of the war, whether facing the Bismarck in the North Atlantic or enduring kamikaze attacks in the Pacific.\n\nBritish Battleships 1939-45 (1): Queen Elizabeth and Royal Sovereign Classes\n\nDetails\n\nBy Angus Konstam\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, Britain's Royal Navy and her fleet of battleships would be at the forefront of her defence. Yet ten of the 12 battleships were already over 20 years old, having served in World War I, and required extensive modifications to allow them to perform a vital service throughout the six long years of conflict. This title offers a comprehensive review of the development of these British battleships from their initial commissioning to their peacetime modifications and wartime service, with detailed descriptions of the effectiveness of the main armament of individual ships. With specially commissioned artwork and a dramatic re-telling of key battleship conflicts, this book will highlight what it was like on board for the sailors who risked their lives on the high seas.\n\nBritish Battleships 1939-45 (2): Nelson and King George V classes\n\nDetails\n\nBy Angus Konstam\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, Britain's Royal Navy and her fleet of battleships would be at the forefront of her defence. Yet ten of the twelve battleships were already over twenty years old, having served in World War I, and required extensive modifications to allow them to perform a vital service throughout the six long years of conflict. This title offers a comprehensive review of the seven battleships of the Nelson and King George V classes from their initial commissioning to their peacetime modifications and wartime service. Moreover, with specially commissioned artwork and a dramatic re-telling of key battles, such as the duel between the Bismark and HMS Rodney, this book will highlight what it was like on board for the sailors who risked their lives on the high seas.\n\nBritish Aircraft Carriers 1939-45\n\nDetails\n\nBy Angus Konstam\n\nWith war against Germany looming, Britain pushed forward its carrier program in the late 1930s. In 1938, the Royal Navy launched the HMS Ark Royal, its first-ever purpose-built aircraft carrier. This was quickly followed by others, including the highly-successful Illustrious class. Smaller and tougher than their American cousins, the British carriers were designed to fight in the tight confines of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Over the next six years, these carriers battled the Axis powers in every theatre, attacking Italian naval bases, hunting the Bismark, and even joining the fight in the Pacific. This book tells the story of the small, but resilient, carriers and the crucial role they played in the British war effort.\n\nRN Submarines in Focus\n\nDetails\n\nBy David Hobbs\n\nCovering a 90 year period, this latest title in Maritime Books' excellent 'In Focus' series traces the development of the submarine from the early 20th century to present day. From the early Vickers' built submarines to the nuclearpowered submarines of today. Each page displays a photograph of the relevant submarine and information including date built and eventual fate. Filled with nostalgia, and covering 140 pages with over 100 photographs this is an excellent reference book that should not be missed for collectors of the series or anyone with an interest in the history of the submarine."}
{"text":"07\/03\/2010\n\nThe last major naval conflict between British and French forces didn't involve point-blank broadsides from Napoleonic-era sailing ships, but instead occurred 70 years ago today, during World War II.\n\nThe attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir, part of Britain's Operation Catapult, was a one-sided engagement off the coast of French Algeria on July 3, 1940, in which a Royal Navy task force attacked and destroyed much of the French fleet, killing 1,297.\n\nFrance and Britain were not at war, but France had recently signed an armistice with Nazi Germany and Britain feared the French fleet would end up as a part of the German Navy.\n\nAlthough French Admiral Fran\u00e7ois Darlan had assured Winston Churchill the fleet would not fall into German hands, the British acted upon the assumption that Darlan's promises were insufficient guarantees.\n\nThe attack was brutal in its ferocity and efficiency.\n\nA British force consisting of the battlecruiser HMS Hood, battleships HMS Valiant and Resolution, and the aircraft carrier HMS ArkRoyal, plus an escort of cruisers and destroyers, gave the French fleet, anchored in a narrow harbor, an utlimatum to surrender or be taken.\n\nThe French did not expect an attack and were not fully prepared for battle. The main armament of two of their key ships, the Dunkerque and Strasbourg, could not immediately be brought to bear.\n\nThe British opened fire a little before 5 p.m. The French eventually mounted an ineffectual reply.\n\nThe third salvo from the British force and the first to hit resulted in a magazine explosion aboard Bretagne, which killed nearly 1,000 of her crew.\n\nAfter some thirty salvos, the French ships stopped firing. Provence, Dunkerque and the destroyer Mogador were damaged and run aground by their crews.\n\nThe Strasbourg managed to escape with five destroyers and eventually reached the French port of Toulon on the next day.\n\nBesides nearly 1,300 French sailors killed, another 350 or so were wounded. The British lost just six dead. Not surprisingly, relations between Britain and France were severely strained.\n\nBritish Admiral Somerville was not enthusiastic about the action, saying that it was \"\u2026 the biggest political blunder of modern times and will rouse the whole world against us \u2026 we all feel thoroughly ashamed \u2026\"\n\nIndeed, the attack on the French vessels at port sowed anger amongst the French towards the British and increased tension between Churchill and the leader of the Free French Forces, Charles de Gaulle.\n\nBut the action demonstrated Britain's resolve to continue the war alone, and rallied the British Conservative Party around Churchill. Churchill later declared the action meant that for \"high government circles in the United States \u2026 there was no more talk of Britain giving in.\""}

(Click for large, high-resolution version.) Image above courtesy of UNOSAT; image on front page courtesy of sxc.hu\n\nIn the past year, maritime shipping has suffered a resurgence of piracy, at a level that the world has not seen since the early 18th century. Sailors working off the Horn of Africa have been particularly hard hit: last year, records show that 125 ships were attacked and 45 seized.\n\nReal numbers are likely much higher, as piracy is believed to be widely under-reported. One of the world's busiest shipping lanes, about 20,000 ships annually pass through the Gulf of Aden on their way to and from the Suez Canal \u2014 carrying a tenth of world trade.\n\nUnlike the popular image of pirates seen in movies and books, modern pirates are more likely to wield machine guns than muskets; and the crime remains as difficult to fight as it ever did. Piracy is an extremely profitable and attractive occupation in a region characterized by lawlessness, bringing in multi-million dollar ransoms for the release of hostages, ships and cargoes.\n\nPiracy has nearly cut off humanitarian aid deliveries to Somalia and has caused shipping insurance rates to skyrocket. Regional economies suffer as ships increasingly choose to go around the Cape of Good Hope. Given the number of oil tankers in the region, it seems only a matter of time before we see an environmental disaster of the Exxon-Valdez scale.\n\nHowever, just as technology may have helped to promote the fall of the Robert Louis Stevenson-type of pirate, say historians (increased size and speed may have helped merchant vessels evade pursuing pirates), there is hope that technological advances will help protect cargos, vessels and crews.\n\nPirates have a romantic image, partly because of the famous series of paintings by N.C. Wyeth \u2014 founder of the Wyeth \"dynasty\" of artists \u2014 that illustrated one of the earliest editions of Treasure Island. The reality was far different, say historians.\n\nUnosat aids monitoring, tracking and evading\n\nSatellite-based maps produced by using grid technology are one promising anti-piracy tool. Different versions of these maps can tell the location of reported incidents and when they occurred, the identity and location of highjacked vessels, and the geographic areas with the highest density of attacks \u2014 accurate to within 100 meters. Some are offered in 3-D imagery.\n\nUNOSAT, a co-operative project between the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) Operational Satellite Applications Program, and the European Organization of High Energy Physics (CERN), delivers satellite images to relief and development organizations. For the past five years, UNOSAT has worked on Somali-related security and humanitarian issues; it has monitored Somali pirate activity since last June as part of a UN Security Council resolution.\n\nTypically, computer-intensive UNOSAT raw images are transferred to EGEE, where programs heavily compress satellite images for transmission over low-bandwidth connections, allowing users to access the latest maps from devices as simple as mobile phones. In this way, merchant ships, for example, can avoid areas where the latest assaults have been reported, and military vessels can know where to deploy."}

{"text":"During his circumnavigation of Australia (1801-1803) Lieutenant Mathew Flinders found himself running short of water whilst charting the arid southern coast of the continent. He entered the then unknown Port Lincoln in search of this necessary commodity.\n\nOur painting depicts the HMS Investigator moored near the head of Port Lincoln (near present-day Tulka). She is drying her foretopsail and loading water casks with her stay tackle. The casks have been towed from the beach in rafts by the whaleboat alongside. Ashore we see two seamen using a crosscut saw to cut firewood for the ship's stove. The cooper is on the beach nearby assembling and checking casks prior to filling at the wells which have been dug about 100 metres behind the beach. The billy boils on the fire outside one of the two tents set up on shore while two other men carry in timber to be cut into firewood.\n\nFlinders found many signs of the local aborigines, but to his disappointment they remained hidden during his stay. This no doubt accounts for the marine guard lounging against the longboat. Although Flinders did not meet with the aborigines he left some gifts of axes wedged into the tree stumps near the wells. During their stay from the 26th February to 4th March 1802 they loaded some 40 tuns of water (a tun is equivalent to 2 butts or 252 gallons) and a large quantity of wood.

The snub bowsprit, counter stern and pleasant sheerline were the only indication of what she may become. Built in Holland in 1902, her riveted \"Lowmore\" iron hull had lasted well. In her lifetime she has had many owners from many countries. She survived two world wars, being captured in one and torpedoed in the other, and has carried the names of Stiena, Adolf, Solway Lass, The Brent, Sundeved, Tui Nasavusavu and finally Solway Lass again.\n\nUnder the ownership of Tim Lloyd and the direction of shipwright Alan Williams she was rebult during 1984\/1985 at Berrys Bay in Sydney. Eighty percent of the framing and shellplating were replaced. The engine was reconditioned. New Masts and rigging were fitted. She was re-launched and re-named on 19th May 1985. She has now changed hands and is working in the Whitsunday area.\n\nThe artist watched her re-birth with interest and was responsible for rebuilding her engine.\n\nMay she last another one hundred years!\n\nAKARANA\n\nBuilt in 1888 Akarana is a rare example of that period's narrow, deeply ballasted racing yachts. She was built in Auckland, New Zealand by Robert Logan to compete in the 1888 and 1889 Australian Centennial Regattas in Sydney and Melbourne. In 1988 the New Zealand government presented the re-built Akarana to the Australian National Maritime Museum as a Bicentennial gift. Returned to her 19th century specifications she can now be seen at the Museum in Darling Harbour."}

Thanks to the breaking of the Japanese Navy code, the U.S. was alerted to a large Japanese force moving into the Coral Sea to seize Port Moresby on the southwest coast of New Guinea. It was to be the first step of a planned invasion of Australia. The Japanese operation centered around three aircraft carriers and dozens of troop transports, but the Americans met them with two carriers of their own. On May 7, the Japanese planes sank two minor Allied ships, while U.S. planes sank an isolated enemy carrier. The next day, both sides launched all their planes against the other. The aircraft passed each other unseen in the clouds, in the world's first carrier verses carrier battle. One Japanese carrier was damaged. The U.S. carrier Lexington was sunk, and the carrier Yorktown was damaged. After this action, both sides withdrew. Although a tactical victory, the Battle of Coral Sea was a strategic setback for the Japanese who never again threatened Australia.\n\nBattle of Midway (June 3-5, 1942). Midway was the turning point of the Pacific war. The U.S. breaking of the Japanese naval code was again the key element as it had been at the Battle of Coral Sea a month earlier. A huge Japanese armada of 160 warships was involved, but Commander-in-chief Admiral Yamamoto split his force, sending some ships north to the Aleutian Islands in a diversionary attack. The Japanese retained superior numbers approaching Midway which included 4 aircraft carriers and 11 battleships. At Midway, the U.S. had 3 carriers and no battleships. The Americans knew what was coming because of the broken codes, and Admiral Nimitz positioned his 3 carriers (the Hornet, Enterprise, and Yorktown) out of Japanese reconnaissance range. As the Japanese carriers launched their planes to assault the Midway defenses, the U.S. planes headed for the enemy carriers. It took many attacks, but finally the U.S. crews got through and sank 3 Japanese carriers. The next day the fourth carrier was sunk. Japanese planes sank the Yorktown. In one day, Japan lost its bid for control of the Pacific.\n\nBattle of Normandy (June 6, 1944). The Navy's most notable Atlantic action may have been its part in the June 6, 1944, invasion of Normandy\u2014the largest amphibious operation in history.

This was another catastrophic example of how morale and discipline could suddenly collapse in the Restoration navy. The loss of the Royal Prince, in the Four Days Battle, is another example.

The person in charge of bringing it to M\u00e9xico was Brigadier of the Navy Angel Ortiz Monasterio. In its journey, it visited the Ports of Cherbourg, Cadiz and the Island of Puerto Rico and it arrived to Veracruz on February 13th, 1892, giving the control of the ship to Captain Reginal Carey Brenton.\n\nThe Zaragoza is 213 feet in length, has a displacement of 1,226 tons and a speed of 13 knots, is built of steel, and its armament consists of four or six 7 inch Canat guns, two Nordenfeidt rapid fire guns and two Hotchkiss revolving guns. Buque Escuela Zaragoza\n\nCorvette \"Zaragoza\" was the first ship to navigate around the world under the orders of Commodore Angel Ortiz Monasterio, who had brought it to the country. It was Commodore Ortiz, as well as Captain Reginal Cary Brenton, who as an English instructor, started the trip around the world departing from Tampico on April 5th, 1895 and having Acapulco as their destiny, going through the Magellan Straits. Angel Ortiz Monasterio completed the trip on July 3th, 1897 in Veracruz.\nThis circumnavigation trip included stops at San Francisco, Honolulu, Yokohama, Nagasaki, Hong Kong, Ceylon, Adam, Portsaid, Tol\u00f3n and Veracruz, where he finished the first trip around the world made by Mexican sailors.\n\nIts first instruction trip was carried out to Europe, as a celebration of the Centenary of the discovery of America. It attended the inauguration of the monument to Genoese navigator Christopher Columbus in the Port of Palos on October 12th, 1892, with the attendance of other countries such as: England, France, Italy, Portugal, Dutchland, Austria, Argentina, etc. It was also present in the ports of Cadiz and Sevilla during those celebrations.\n\nIt participated in the Yucat\u00e1n campaign against rebellious Mayan Indigenous people in 1898-1905 by transporting troops, provisions, ammunitions, etc, to the ports of Progreso, Xcalax, Isla Mujeres, Morelos Port, Cozumel, Bay of the Ascension, Hondo River, etc.\n\nTampico Affair\n\nIt participated in combat in Tampico's port from April 8th to May 13th, 1914, when revolutionary troops sieged the port. In telegram dated August 25th, that same year, the commandant of the Gulf's fleet, Gabriel Carballo, reported to President Venustiano Carranza that chiefs and officers, as well as the crew members of the corvette \"Zaragoza\" were at his disposal. Varacruz and Zaragoza brought reinforcements to Tampico on March 31. Both ships fired shrapnel shells at the rebel encampment.\nFederal officers on the Mexican gunboat Zaragoza had intercepted messages and put in at the Huasteca dock to cut the telephone wire. At the same time they ordered the radio operator to stop his transmissions.\n\nIn 1915, it participated against the rebels of Yucat\u00e1n, transporting troops, material of war and provisions, sanitary material, etc., as well as the surveillance of the coast.\n\nIn October, 1919, it escorted the remain of poet Amado Nervo, who died being Mexico's Ambassador in the Republic of Uruguay.\n\nIn summary, corvette \"Zaragoza\" participated in different acts of the service, Flagship of the Mexican Navy, a Floating Naval School, surveillance of coasts, transporting troops, equipment or participating directly in combat. Since it was purchased until it was decommissioned, it was always in service, becoming the ship that navigated the most in national and international seas.\n\nWhen being decommissioned and in terrible conditions, corvette \"Zaragoza\" served during 35 years since the day it incorporated to the National Navy.

Running these boats is considered very dangerous work, and the crews are paid well if they succeed, whether they volunteered for the work or not. Because of the risks (about ten percent are believed lost at sea), the boats are nicknamed \"coffins.\" The crews are told the pull the plug (literally) and sink the boat (and its cargo) if spotted and about to be boarded. Even with the boarding party on the way, jumping off a sinking boat, often at night, is dangerous. Laws have been changed so that the crews escaping from their sinking boats, can still be charged with drug smuggling (despite the loss of the evidence).\n\nBetween 2000 and 2007, 23 of these boats were spotted. But last year, nearly 70 were seen or captured. Many of the captures are the result of intelligence information at the source, not air and naval patrols out there just looking for them. These boats are hard to spot (by aircraft or ships), which is why they are being used more often.\n\nThese semi-submersible \"submarines\" have been operating off the northwest (Pacific) coast of South America for nine years. Over 75 percent of the 600 tons of cocaine coming out of Colombia each year leaves via the Pacific coast subs, carried in submarines, that move the cocaine north. Despite increased efforts, it's believed that less than ten percent of these subs have been caught.\n\nThese are not submarines in the true sense of the word, but \"semi-submersibles\". They are 60 foot long and 12 feet wide, fiberglass boats, powered by a diesel engine, with a very low freeboard, and a small \"conning tower\", providing the crew (usually of four), and engine, with fresh air, and permitting the crew to navigate the boat. A boat of this type is the only practical kind of submarine for drug smuggling. A real submarine, capable of carrying five tons of cocaine, would cost a lot more, and require a highly trained crew. Moreover, a conventional sub actually spends most of its time running on the surface, or just beneath it using a snorkel device to obtain air for the diesel engine crew. So the drug subs get the most benefit of a real submarine (which cost about $300 million these days) at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe semi-submersibles are built, often using specially made components brought in from foreign countries, in areas along the Colombian coast, or other drug gang controlled territory. Early on, Russian naval architects and engineers were discovered among those designing and building these boats. But that did not last, as the Russian designs were too complex and expensive. Instead, local boat builders created and refined the current design. Some foreign experts have been seen in the area, apparently to help the boat builders with some technical problem. These subs cost over $600,000 to construct, and carry up to ten tons of cocaine. The boat builders are getting rich, constructing the boats in well hidden locations up one of the rivers that empties into the Pacific.\n\nAt one point it was thought that as many as half of them were captured or lost at sea. But this is apparently not the case. That's because most of these subs are built for a one way trip. This keeps down the cost of construction, and the cost of hiring a crew (who fly home). That one voyage will usually be for about a thousand kilometers, with the boat moving at a speed of 15-25 kilometers an hour. The average trip will take about two weeks, because the boats have learned to go very slowly during the day, to avoid leaving a wake that U.S. airborne sensors can detect.\n\nIn the past, some subs making long range trips were caught while being towed by a larger ship. Apparently the plan was to tow a semi-submersible, loaded with a ten ton cocaine cargo, long distances, and then be cut it loose for the final approach to the shore of California or some area in Europe or on the east coast of North America. While the subs are most frequently used from the Pacific coast of Colombia, they are showing up elsewhere as well.\n\nThese subs are not stealthy enough to avoid detection all the time, and the U.S. is working to tweak search radars, and other types of sensors, to more reliably detect the drug subs. For the moment, it appears that these semi-submersibles do work, because the drug gangs keep using them more and more. Delivery by sea is now the favored method for cocaine smugglers, because the United States has deployed military grade aircraft detection systems, and caught too many of the airborne drug shipments. The smugglers did their math, and realized that improvised submarines were a more cost-effective way to go. The technology has spread, with one of these boats found being built in Spain three years ago, by a local drug gang, to bring cocaine ashore from a seagoing ship far out at sea in international waters. GPS makes these kinds of operations possible.\n\nIncreased maritime patrols, and infiltration of drug gangs in Colombia, has led to a significant increase in captures of these boats. On land, Colombian soldiers and police are doing a lot of damage to cocaine production, and making boat production more difficult. All this is having an impact, with cocaine prices going up, and quality going down. Drug testing and surveys indicates that cocaine use in the United States has declined 10-20 percent as a result.\n\nBut the stealthy boats are a concern to counter-terror officials. Bombs and terrorists can be transported in these vessels, and the technology for building them can be, and perhaps already has, spread. The technology is improving as well. Recently captured boats had a system installed that cooled the engine exhaust, making it more difficult for infrared (heat) sensors to sport it. Thus the U.S. Navy is putting a lot of effort into improving its sensors and search techniques, for finding these boats."}

{"text":"Tag Archives: fieldworkI've been enjoying our scientist's fieldwork posts. We have scientist's photographs from several historic field trips in the photography collection. My favourites are in this photo album from the 1907 Expedition to the Subantarctic Islands. The Expedition was initiated by the Canterbury Philosophical Institute with support from the Government, and studied plants, animals, soils and marine life on the Auckland and Campbell Island groups, as well as a few outliers.\n\nThe islands were of real interest to scientists, as they wanted to compare the distribution of species with other parts of the world. The famous British botanist Joseph Hooker had studied plants near the coast during the 1840s, but no one had looked inland or at some of the smaller islands.\n\nThe Expedition party was made up entirely of New Zealand scientists such as botanist Leonard Cockayne. There was also a cook, the crew of their transport ship Hinemoa, and a small crew for a whaleboat to ferry the scientists about.\n\nWhaleboat and crew in Carnley Harbour. November 1907. The head of the crew was Whaitiri, from Ruapuke Island. Photo attributed to Samuel Page. Te Papa\n\nThe Hinemoa left Bluff on 14 November 1907, and returned at the end of the month. The scientists made the most of their time on the islands by splitting between the Auckland Islands and Campbell Island. This photo album was put together by the cook to the Auckland Islands group, Mr W B North, and donated to Te Papa by North's son years later.\n\nThe expedition members were astounded to find a group of shipwrecked sailors on Auckland Island. These men had survived the wreck of the barque Dundonald eight months before, and ate birds, seals and roots until they managed to reach the cache of emergency stores left by the Government. Their story is an epic tale, so I'll cover it in my next post.\n\nThe Expedition was a great success. The scientists described a huge range of flora and fauna, and found a number of new species. Some of the specimens they collected are now in Te Papa's collection. A detailed report was published in 1909 and was well received in the scientific world. The trip was also covered by several newspapers \u2013 the Otago Witness did a two-page spread of photographs on Christmas Day, which includes some of the photos in this album.\n\nDuring our fern fieldwork on the West Coast, we ranged from Stockton in the north to the Cascade Valley (south of Jackson Bay) in the south. We were mostly near the coast, with our most inland collecting site being near Reefton. These are some of the interesting places we visited.\n\nI'm just back from 10 days collecting ferns in the South Island's West Coast.\n\nFrom previous collections, we knew of several currently unrecognised species of fern that occur on the West Coast. We investigated these records, visiting the sites to collect more material for our studies and to assess the plants in the field, including gauging population sizes for conservation rankings. Most of the previous records were old and lacked detailed locality information. This meant they took a lot of re-finding, but we were successful in most cases.\n\nSome of these poorly known ferns are uncommon. While we found some to be more widespread than previously thought, others appear to be teetering on the cusp between the Department of Conservation's rankings of 'At Risk' and 'Threatened'.\n\nWe also collected specimens of several 'problem' fern species, whose boundaries are unclear. They need further study, including with genetic analyses, which our new collections will facilitate.\n\nAltogether, we collected about 170 specimens. These will begin to appear on Te Papa's Collections Online in the next few weeks. However, there are some that we won't be able to confidently identify without a lot more work butSpring is in the air, and for botanists like myself that means it's time to head out into the field to try to find and collect plant specimens for our research. This year, like last year, I will be going to specific places around the country to look for different species of native New Zealand forget-me-nots. Last year I collected this forget-me-not in coastal Taranaki:\n\nMyosotis petiolata var. pansa from the northern Taranaki coast, which we found and collected in Dec 2010 for my taxonomic research on New Zealand forget-me-nots. Photo by Heidi Meudt, copyright Te Papa.\n\nThe first week of October, Jessie Prebble and I returned to coastal Taranaki on our first foray of the field season. We knew from studying previous collections from Te Papa's herbarium and other New Zealand herbaria that we should find at least two other species there: Myosotis brevis and Myosotis pygmaea.\n\nWe planned to visit about eight different sites over two days. Because both species are very small in size, we spent a lot of time at each site searching on hands and knees trying to find them. But I don't think we realized just how small they are until we finally found Myosotis brevis at the third site we visited. Check it out: the entire plant can fit on your fingernail!\n\nCollaboration was instrumental in finding these plants. So far, we've been fortunate that private landowners and iwi have allowed access to most sites we want to visit, and that other colleagues, local enthusiasts and Department of Conservation staff were willing to share their knowledge and accompany us on our plant hunt.\n\nSince our Taranaki trip, we've also found Myosotis brevis at two other North Island locations in November: near Cape Palliser (Wairarapa), and also Te Ikaamaru Bay (see Phil Garnock-Jones' blog about that trip). But I hope I'm not giving you the impression that forget-me-nots are easy to find! Our experience so far shows that, on average we're finding Myosotis in only about half of the known sites where it's been collected before.\n\nThis field work is an important first step to gather the necessary samples to perform genetic and morphological analyses on native forget-me-nots. Continued collaboration and information-sharing will be essential to update the taxonomy and conservation strategies of these plants.\n\nKadavu is a priority for Conservation International. Four species of bird occur there and nowhere else in the world. However, little is known of Kadavu's bryophytes, lichens, and ferns, and it was our job to find out.\n\nWhile on Kadavu, Ratu Kaminieli Nabalarua (\"Tuka\") looked after us very well, taking us to botanically interesting places and keeping us culturally in line (including monitoring our kava intake).\n\nWe did some collecting around the capital Vunisea in the middle of the island, but our focus was the Delainabukelevu (or Nabukelevu or Mount Washington) volcano at the western tip of Kadavu.\n\nAscending a lower flank of Delanibukelevu, through a plantation of dalo (taro) and kava.

We spent a day climbing up and down the steep sides, with a few hours collecting at and around the summit.

{"text":"Share this story\n\nStory Photos\n\nSILVERTON, Ore. \u2013 A family is still looking for answers months after a Silverton man disappeared from a cruise ship in the Caribbean.\n\nJason Rappe, 42, was last seen on a Holland America cruise with his wife last November.\n\nHis brother says they still don't know what happened to Jason, and the company refuses to give them any information.\n\nSearchers never found Jason's body, just his Pittsburgh Steelers cap on the top deck of the ship.\n\n\"That particular piece of information is the thing that tears me apart the most,\" said Eric Rappe. \"Jason never took off his hat, ever.\"\n\nEric said he knows his brother well enough to believe he's not someone who would jump overboard, as the cruise company claimed.\n\n\"I'm sure that every family says that with a suicide in their family. No doubt in my mind. No one wants to believe that could happen. But there's just no doubt in my mind that that is not what happened.\"\n\nJason had just survived a battle with cancer that took one of his eyes, Eric said. After a rough couple of years, Jason and his wife Tina were excited to relax on the cruise.\n\nOn the night he disappeared, Jason was last seen at a bar with his wife, Eric said. She was on the dance floor when he told another passenger he was going to the restroom and walked outside.\n\nSearchers found Jason's hat on the top deck during a full search of the ship.\n\n\"They kept going for four hours, Even after they found his hat.\"\n\nEric said Holland America never gave his family any answer to what happened. He thinks the company is trying to keep his brother's disappearance quiet.\n\n\"They don't care. They just don't care. All they want is for it to go away.\"\n\nA Holland America representative told KATU News he's waiting on management to respond to a request for a comment. In December, the company said in a statement that their thoughts and prayers were with the Rappe family.\n\nShare this story\n\nMore to Explore\n\nI wish the wife had been interviewed, she was with him. \u00a0Did they have a little argument? Was Jason feeling sad or jealous, she was on the dance (floor not alone?) when he vanished. It seems very odd that a man would fight and beat cancer, pay all this money for a vacation \u00a0and the cruise, to then jump over board...but on the other hand, perhaps he was also depressed about the cancer, feeling depression over losing his eye...drinking and getting more down \u00a0and then watching his pretty wife having fun on the dance floor,\u00a0perhaps\u00a0that pushed him over the edge and he jumped, leaving behind his hat as a sign.\n\nI am also unsure what exactly the family expects Holland America to do??? It is a cruise line, not a paid babysitter. When I vacation, I wouldn't want my every step and movement recorded on a video camera. Sure, the unknown would be hard for the family but IF the cruise line had a video camera, would the family REALLY want to sit and watch the footage of their beloved brother, husband, uncle and son jumping over board and taking his own life?\u00c2\n\nNote to Katu, poorly done story. Why did you not do more research before running the story? Only the brother's side of things???....where was the wife's side? What was his mental state when he walked on to the ship. When did the wife report him missing? What did the ship do when he was reported missing? He told another passenger that he was going to the men's room, where did you get that information and why did you not interview that person??? Plus (with all due respect to the family) It's a boat, you get on it, you float around, you get off....some one didn't get off, he jumped (or a stranger on the ship pushed him) they weren't in the Bermuda Triangle, so please explain why this is a worthy news story?\n\nTo Eric and family. \u00c2 My heart goes out to you. \u00c2 I would feel the same way if a loved one just disappeared on a cruise. \u00c2 I don't understand why some people are posting jokes and\/or rude\/cold comments. \u00c2 If they only had a heart. \u00c2\n\nThe accompanying photo shows a guy with a Pittsburgh Steelers logo on his fake eye. Perhaps he took off his hat before he jumped because he didn't want to get it wet? Perhaps the family can engage a psychic or medium to try and make contact with him to find out what happened? At least this didn't come from AP, but only\u00a0KATU on an apparently slow news day?\u00c2\n\nSo many people fall off the ships that to me it's unbelievable.\u00a0I saw the mans interview on the news, and i came away a little confused at what he was trying to imply. I'm almost wondering if he's trying to say that someone ( be it passenger or crew member) threw his brother overboard. You are not alone. Many people don't know how their loved one fell off the ship. I suspect it's just that. He fell off the ship.\n\n@myopinion240\u00c2 The reason i wanted this in the press is to bring light to the cover-up. We don't know what happened. it could have been any of a thousand different things. Our problem is that the cruise lines began lying and hiding things from the first second. they report things that are simply not true. He may have fallen, or been helped, we will never know because Holland America is covering it up. \u00c2 There is nothing I can do to bring Jason back, but I can certainly be a voice for him, and try to bring light to this constant problem (this is FAR from the first time) and help pass legislation to make these vacations safe.\n\n@Eric Rappe'\u00c2 @myopinion240\u00c2 I, too, am very sorry about your brother. \u00c2 I can't imagine how you're feeling but I do understand the not knowing the truth side of things.\n\nWhile I'm not defending the cruise line or its actions, people need to understand that these ships aren't governed by the laws of the United States and, as such, aren't subject to U.S. laws until they are in a U.S. port (or enter U.S. waters).\n\nThe same could be said of many foreign countries -- some U.S. citizen goes missing. \u00c2 The country doesn't have an obligation to tell the family anything (or even look for the person if they don't want to or don't have the financial resources to do so). \u00c2 At least there we usually have the U.S. Consulate to rely on and hope that the relationship between the two countries is significant enough to warrant concern.\n\nCruise ships really are, essentially, floating lawless villages comprised of clans. \u00c2 Once in international waters, all bets are off. \u00c2 If you're rolling on the floor drunk and still want another, they'll be more than happy to serve (and charge) you. \u00c2 They don't care. \u00c2 They want their money any way they can get it (same with on-board casinos). \u00c2 You'll only get cut off if you run out of money. \u00c2 They have security on board but I rarely have seen them. \u00c2 Its usually other passengers who intervene.\n\nMr. Rappe, I hope you get at least some answers but the odds are strongly against that. \u00c2 And, once you do get anything from the cruise line, they're going to slap you with a gag order and not allow you to discuss the matter any further -- which, in turn, limits your ability to affect national and international laws.\n\nAs a side note, once you're on board, you're given a bracelet and\/or a room key which allows you access to your room, the ability to make purchases, etc. \u00c2 It wouldn't surprise me if they couldn't (or don't already) have some type of GPS embedded microchip transmitter that alerts the ship crew of your whereabouts at any given time. \u00c2 It wouldn't cost much more and it would give the cruise line more control over your access (and their financial interest in you personally). \u00c2 If you or your lawyer(s) haven't asked about this, it might be one more avenue to pursue in order to get at least a few questions answered.\n\n@Eric Rappe'\u00c2 @myopinion240\u00c2 Sorry about your brother -\u00c2 it seems to me that if he did choose to end his own life, he may well have taken off his beloved hat in lieu of a note - kind of a \"sorry, goodbye\" gesture. I hope you can find peace.\n\nLet's see,\u00a0an ego maniac Captain\u00a0managed to steer\u00a0one of these ships\u00a0into\u00a0the\u00a0rocks, another has broken\u00a0down, leaving passengers to wade through raw sewage, people falling overboard.\u00a0What next?\u00a0I\u00a0also viewed a television segment\u00a0where ship staff\u00a0were interviewed and spoke about the quest to\u00a0push large amounts of alcohol.\u00a0Just doesn't seem like a safe travel choice.\u00a0\u00c2\n\nLet's see, he staggered out of the bar, went to relieve himself over the railing and drunkenly fell overboard. Sorry folks, but everytime we find a hat on the top deck, we stop the cruise and search the whole ocean to see if somebody fell in.\n\nWhy don't these cruise ships put security cameras in?\u00a0This happens often enough, it wouldn't cost them that much.\u00a0They should at least have them in areas where people can jump or get thrown overboard.\u00a0I wouldn't get on one of those cruises if they paid me.\n\n@QuandoQuandoQuando\u00a0Oh, they DO have security cameras everywhere. \u00a0They just have no legal reason to turn over what is on them if they happen to catch something interesting (whether it is a marriage proposal or a murder).\n\nI saw that too. I didn't recognize it as their logo (nice catch) \u00c2 it looks like stars to me. I've seen several \"designer' replacement eyes like that. They have the contacts too with cats eyes & swirls etc.. I like the idea of offering a custom choice for people that have lost an eye.\u00c2\n\nBetter than the one that I worked on that had a leak between the potable water tank\u00a0into the cofferdam that had a hole in the grease trap and a cracked and leaking weld in the gray water tank. The owners didn't want to fix that one either. every morning there would be three feet of water in the cofferdam that had to be pumped out before work could start on the valve that we were repairing.\n\nThe \"Blue Hat\" line is about the cleanest of the cruise fleet. They even have tours of the food prep areas for those passengers that are really bored. For those that wonder, most of the public areas have cameras, but aren't monitered 24\/7\n\nVery sad story, and if I have to break it down I will. Ship\u2026.Ship is in water\u2026.Jason was on ship that was in water\u2026. Jason no longer on ship so Jason must be in water. Come on family it is not that hard. The real challenge is to determine if there is foul play, or was it an accident? Regardless my condolences.\n\n\" The push to always keep the show on the road without long delays causes\nthe same problems in investigations of passenger disappearances,\nshipboard crimes and gastrointestinal illnesses. These investigations\nare often rushed so the cruise is held up for as little time as\npossible. Cruise ships theoretically follow guidelines set forth by the\nInternational Maritime Organization and the recommendations in the\nSafety of Life at Sea. But the International Maritime Organization,\na United Nations organization, does not have the authority to enforce\nits own guidelines, nor can it impose fines or criminal sanctions\nagainst cruise lines that flout Safety of Life at Sea recommendations.\nThis obligation falls to flag states, like Panama.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0via CNN news article.\u00a0\u00c2\n\nWith no ways to enforce the few laws and guidelines set forth for cruise lines, the chances of ever finding out what truly happened to this man are next to zero.\u00a0Be careful when you book one of these cruises - you might be sorry in the long run.\n\nI would have considered a cruise 10 years ago, but not anymore. International waters, lack of\u00a0jurisdiction, violent crimes that the cruise companies try to keep secret.....no\u00a0thank\u00a0you. I would feel better in a third world country on vacation, with a police dept that may\/may not be somewhat corrupt, than to trust the security of my family to a corporate entity that registers their vessels in Panama to avoid US regulations....."}
{"text":"Titanic\n\nMore to Explore\n\nThemes\n\nEvents\n\nPage 3 of 3\n\nAnalyzing the Titanic Catastrophe\n\nAt least five separate boards of inquiry on both sides of the Atlantic conducted comprehensive hearings on Titanic's sinking, interviewing dozens of witnesses and consulting with many maritime experts. Every conceivable subject was investigated, from the conduct of the officers and crew to the construction of the ship. While it has always been assumed that the ship sank as a result of the gash that caused the compartments to flood, various other theories have emerged over the decades, including that the ship's steel plates were too brittle for the near-freezing Atlantic waters, that the impact caused rivets to pop and that the expansion joints failed, among others.\n\nThe technological aspects of the catastrophe aside, Titanic's demise has taken on a deeper, almost mythic, meaning in popular culture. Many view the tragedy as a morality play about the dangers of human hubris: Titanic's creators believed they had built an \"unsinkable\" ship that could not be defeated by the laws of nature. This same overconfidence explains the electrifying impact Titanic's sinking had on the public when she was lost. There was widespread disbelief that the ship could possibly have sunk, and, due to the era's slow and unreliable means of communication, misinformation abounded. Newspapers initially reported that the ship had collided with an iceberg but remained afloat and was being towed to port with everyone on board. It took many hours for accurate accounts to become available, and even then people had trouble accepting that this paradigm of modern technology could sink on her maiden voyage, taking more than 1,500 souls with her.\n\nThe ship historian John Maxtone-Graham has compared Titanic's story to the Challenger space shuttle disaster of 1986. In that case, the world reeled at the notion that some of the most sophisticated technology ever created could explode into oblivion along with its crew. Both tragedies triggered a sudden and complete collapse in confidence, revealing that we are vulnerable despite our modern presumptions of technological infallibility."}

Her sister-ship the Asama Maru was near-identical, whereas a half-sister, the Chichibu Maru, was slightly larger with only one funnel.\n\n\"Acutely aware of presentation, Dal\u00ed insisted that his design be placed on top of the lolly, rather than the side, so that it could always be viewed intact. It's proved to be one of the most enduring pieces of branding ever and one that's still used today, four billion sales later.\"So I just spent my evening making this. It's a necklace that goes with the theme of my final major project. But no, it doesn't count towards my grade. I made this to sell at the little shop we're having during exhibition. I'm hoping to sell this for maybe \u00a325?? I dunno if that's too much but i'm pretty pleased with it.\n\nMy date looked stunning (;\u2014-)) and so did the restaurant. They must have spent one million pounds doing it. The actual restaurant was 2 floors underground and was designed like an airport. Some of the dining areas were designed in the theme of different countries and we got seated at a table for two in \"india\". The actual buffet was designed to look like china town and all the types of food were sectioned into what looked like different stalls and shops. It was all very spectacular and also a little bit tacky at times but I appreciate the effort in creating an atmosphere i've never dined in before (not even at an airport) I had two plates of main course and two plates of pudding! I'm so greedy but gotta get my money's worth right?? I took a trip to the bathroom and it actually smelt like miami (a kind of sweet breezy smell?) And the sinks looked like they were made of glowstone! Yes, glowstone as in minecraft. They looked pretty cool!\n\nAfter we ate and paid the bill and stared at eachother for ages we took a trip to jessops (that's john Lewis to those who don't remember) and went round all the fancy furniture and rugs pretending we were rich enough to afford such items (we decided that one day we will be) I just want a really nice lamp and rug.\n\nAfterwards we went back to his and took a nap because doing activities like going out make us sleepy. We're such babies.\n\ndecided to go on a date to red hot for tomorrows lunch. Pretty excited for all the food that's gonna be in my belly for the great price of \u00a38.49. I don't usually get excited about food this much but I heard this place was reeall good (and the building is designed to look like an airport hangar??)"}

{"text":"Sponsored by\n\nMETHANE MAY HAVE SUNK TRAWLER\n\nPublished on 23\/03\/2007 13:14\n\nTO a fisherman, all areas of the sea have names, just as a farmer will name his fields or we name our streets.\n\nIt's a means of communication, common ground with other men, an aid to understanding. Small local boats might set out to fish the Heugh Hole or Shald Water; on hearing their destination, other fishermen would immediately know exactly where they were headed without the need for any further explanation. A fisherman setting out for Jock Hutcheon wouldn't have a rendezvous with a male friend, but would be heading for a fishing ground off Newtonhill. He could just as easily be going to the\n\nHoosie on the Dyke, the Skate Hole, the Dog Hole or the Blue Deeps depending on his intended catch.\n\nVessels capable of steaming out to 50 miles could find themselves at the Turbot Bank, Scalp or Aberdeen Bank. Some of these names are self explanatory: skate or turbot would likely be prolific at their namesakes. Others are less obvious. Who was Jock Hutcheon and why has he been immortalised?\n\nAt around 100 miles off, there's a series of grounds whose very names give a clue to their nature \u2013 the Devil's Holes and the Witch's Ground are volcanic areas where the fishing is good, but the bottom is very rough and gear can easily be damaged or lost. The skipper needs to be very precise when shooting his nets to ensure that he finds the small areas of good ground.\n\nWithin the Witch's Ground lies the Witch's Hole. This hole is a 300m wide depression in the seabed like a pockmark. There are numbers of these pockmarks out there caused by methane gas escaping from beneath the seabed. A few years ago, scientists studying the Witch's Hole discovered the wreck of an early 20th century steam trawler. Submersible camera equipment showed that the trawler was sitting upright, undamaged, and with her nets still streamed, right in the centre of the hole. Now experts say it was almost certainly doomed by methane gas bubbling from the sea bed there. The rising gas reduced the density of the sea water so much that the boat couldn't stay afloat. It disappeared down the gas \"hole\" like car keys dropped in the harbour. And fishermen jumping overboard would have done the same. The unknown 75 foot boat is sitting exactly where the methane would have escaped from the sea bed.\n\nMethane is held in the earth's crust by pressure and low temperatures, but where there are weaknesses it can escape. Often this escape is gentle, releasing a constant flow of bubbles; other times the release is sudden with catastrophic consequences for any transport directly above the eruption. Methane has also been implicated in the infamous Bermuda Triangle where numerous boats and planes have simply disappeared without even the time to send out a May Day call. It seems likely that this is what happened to the mystery trawler in the Witch's Hole.\n\nVisit  to find out more about us.\n\nYour online shopping can support MRI also; log onto \n\nFor further information or to get involved with MRI as a volunteer, please contact 01569 765768 or email hamish.mcdonald@btconnect"}
{"text":"The Shipwreck Jupiter\n\nDuring several days of areal surveillance in June 2007, nearly a dozen shipwreck sites were located. Further investigations put a name to one historical, undiscovered site, the Jupiter.A wooden schooner barge, the Jupiter ran aground during a gale force storm on November 27, 1872. The Jupiter was bound from Marquette to Wyandotte, Michigan with a load of iron ore. The General Dix was towing the Jupiter and sister ship Saturn when the lines broke free. Both schooners were lost in the shallows. The Jupiter was believed to be west of Vermilion Point when the ship vanished. Tragically, all hands were lost from both schooners. The Jupiter and Saturn were newly built schooners and in service only a few weeks. The Saturn was discovered July 2006 by members of the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve a few miles west of Whitefish Point in 18 feet of water.\n\nDuring this same November gale storm two other ships also perished. The W.C. Griswald was reported lost west of Two Hearted River. The W.O. Brown was reported lost near Point Mamainse, Ontario. The Jupiter and Saturn were both owned by Captain Eber Ward of Detroit. Through Captain Eber Ward's and other mariner's determined efforts, four Lifesaving Stations were created along the desolate coast between Grand Marias and Whitefish Point.\n\nIn 1874 Congress authorized a total of thirty first and second class Lifesaving Stations for the Great Lakes. Lake Superior would get four first class Lifesaving Stations. The locations were selected by Captain J.H. Merryman of the Revenue Marine in September 1874. The stations at Vermilion Point Station #9, Crisp Point Station #10, Two-Hearted River Station #11 and Muskalonge Lake (Deer Park) Station #12 were built in 1875 and operational in 1876. The Lifesaving Stations continued until 1915, when with threat of European war, it was combined with the Revenue Cutter Service into our present United States Coast Guard. The Grand Marias Lifesaving Station was built in 1899, and the Whitefish Point Coast Guard Station was built in 1923.\n\nThrough the August 2006 Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve article, we came in contact with John Schmitz. John is the great great grandson of Captain Peter Howard of the Jupiter. We shared information on the Saturn and the Jupiter. Locating the Jupiter had become our quest after finding the Saturn. Which initiated our areal surveys in June earlier this summer. I asked John what is means to his family, locating the shipwreck Jupiter. \"The rediscovery of the Jupiter ends over a century of speculation in our family about the final fate of the ship that our great great grandfather captained. For the last sixty years for my father and for the last thirty years for me, we've heard stories about Captain Peter Howard. We never did know what kind of ship he was on or what his last trip entailed. Now, with our recent research and finding the shipwreck, we finally know the story. This added to the recent revelation that those men's deaths actually saved scores of others due to the creation of the Lifesaving Stations along the coast is very exciting to us. We'll now be able to pass on the whole story to our children and grandchildren.\" Stated John. John has also created an informational web site schoonerjupiter.com to share his research on the Jupiter and Saturn.\n\nAlong with identifying the Jupiter, the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve has identified six other shipwreck sites. The Cleveland was blown into the shallows by the Two-Hearted River during a fierce gale storm on October 28, 1864. The side wheel steamer was built to carry passengers and package freight.\n\nThe W.S. Crosthwaite was sheltering peacefully at anchor when she caught fire from a stove which had been placed on deck to heat water for the crew's laundry. The ship burned to the waterline and sank in Whitefish Bay on November 13, 1904.\n\nThe Phineas S. Marsh was driven ashore during a storm and struck bottom on August 26, 1896. Her crew took to the rigging as she sank. They were rescued by the Lifesaving Service near Crisp Point.\n\nThe Mystic was carrying a party of surveyors when she caught fire and was run to shore. The ship burned to the waterline in Tahquamenon Bay of Whitefish Bay on September 27, 1893.\n\nThe Pacific grounded on a sand bank departing Deer Park docks on November 16, 1887. The Lifesaving Service rescued the crew, including a special trip to save the ship's dog.\n\nThe Starucca was driven on a bar by an icy gale off Deer Park on November 15, 1887. She was thought to be in no danger, so her crew stayed aboard until she started to break up. Deer Park Lifesaving Service came to the rescue in a tiny surfboat and took the entire crew off in three trips just before she broke up and sank.\n\nWe are very excited to document these shipwrecks, and give them names. They are precious pieces of our heritage, and should be preserved and protected.\n\nJupiter Shipwreck Site Located in the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve\n\nAerial survey expeditions in June 2007 rewarded members of the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve when they discovered nearly a dozen shallow water shipwreck sites. Further research has identified one unknown shipwreck as the missing Jupiter. The wooden schooner barge ran aground during a gale force storm on November 27, 1872.\n\nA historic find for the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve, and a long awaited emotional connection with the family of Captain Peter Howard of the Jupiter.\n\nThe Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve is supported by the Paradise Area Tourism Council and many dedicated volunteers."}

{"text":"Why are we still so fascinated by the Titanic? I can't give you any profound answers. The answers are pretty straightforward. It was a great tragedy, it was so unexpected, it was the result of man's negligence, and it involved victims who were fabulously glamorous, as well as those, housed in the bottom of the ship, who were impoverished.\n\nIt also, let's face it, makes a whale of a movie. And don't underestimate the power of film to keep an event in the public imagination.\n\nThe Titanic was, in effect, relaunched by author Walter Lord in his 1955 telling of the story of the sinking, \"A Night to Remember,\" later made into a very successful movie. It was one of the books, along with Jim Bishop's \"The Day Lincoln Was Shot,\" that began a craze of non-fiction books about events that occurred within one day. Lord went on to write \"Day of Infamy,\" about Pearl Harbor, and Bishop later wrote \"The Day Christ Died.\"\n\n\"A Night to Remember\" was published 43 years after the Titanic disaster. Walter Lord was able to interview a number of survivors, bringing the event to life. We note that many of those who shaped \"the greatest generation\" of Americans, who fought through the Depression and World War II, also remembered the Titanic disaster from their younger years. When the Titanic went down, Franklin D. Roosevelt was 30. Dwight D. Eisenhower was in his first year at West Point. Harry S. Truman was 27.\n\nOf course, we also had the more recent movie, \"Titanic,\" which was an enormous hit. And the finding of the wreck of the Titanic, and photographing it on the ocean floor, was probably the greatest single factor in keeping the story alive.\n\nThere is a stone representation of the Titanic disaster on the grave of Isidor Straus, of Macy's department store, in Woodlawn Cemetery in New York. Mr. Straus died in the sinking. His wife, Ida, famously refused to take a place in a lifeboat, staying at her husband's side. His body was recovered. Hers never was."}

In January, SCI sent its youngest chaplain to serve as the first Chaplain to the Maritime Service, a position newly created to provide spiritual aid to seafarers in the merchant marine during wartime.

The Institute's auditorium (typically used for film screenings and live entertainment) hosted daily muster drills and calisthenics for men about to head out to war.\n\nAn increased production at the shipyards meant increased demand for trained seafarers. SCI's Merchant Marine School expanded all the way through the 13th-story roof of the building to provide rooftop instruction and pilothouse training.
