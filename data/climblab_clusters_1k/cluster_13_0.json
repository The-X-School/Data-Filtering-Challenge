{"text":"Phil Mickelson's shot didn't fall at Pebble Beach, but he did\n\n2\/10\/2013\n\nGolfers have often gotten flak for their athleticism. Sure, the game takes skill, but when someone who has a physique on par with the Pillsbury Doughboy can compete at the top level, you have to wonder about the difference between \"game\" and \"sport.\" Another argument against golfers' athleticism came this weekend at Pebble Beach while Phil Mickelson was searching for a lost ball. As Mickelson edges closer to the water hazard, he slips and falls directly on his behind. Give Mickelson credit where it's due, though \u2014 he makes a pretty clean dismount from the fall and walks away like nothing happened."}

{"text":"Pros: The course plays through a nice multi-use park, though for the most part the course stays clear of other park uses. There is a mix of open grassy fields with some minor elevation changes and more densely wooded areas with a creek running through. The creek and a tiny pond come into play on one hole adding some risk to your shot. The little bit of elevation available is used well to include a downhill shot on one hole, and a shot that needs to stay on the top of a levy to keep from having a long uphill putt with a roll away possibility.\n\nThere is surprising variety here for a little 9 hole course in a multi-use park, from longer open shots, to grassy fairways through trees, to a tightly wooded hole that's aceable if you hit a tight little line.\n\nThere are nice rubber tee pads that were installed very well. They were all level and well packed underneath so they provided a nice tee surface. The tee signs were basic, but were adequate for navigating the course. The baskets were in good shape. The flow of the course is good enough that it's not hard to get from one hole to the next your first time through.\n\nCons: There are some odd spots with long walks between holes, and a couple places where you have to walk back up the fairway you just played some to get to the next hole. These don't affect navigation, but they do take away from the flow of the course. The course doesn't provide a whole lot of challenge, even for a mediocre player like me, especially on the really open holes. Pretty much every hole is just drive and putt unless you screw up, and even then there's not a ton of risk of taking a bogey.\n\nOther Thoughts: This isn't a bad course, it's just pretty short and not all that challenging. That said, it's got some fun holes and good variety, so it's worth a stop if you're in the area. Newer players will be challenged, but within reason. More experienced players will enjoy a few of the holes, but won't find much difficulty or risk\/reward decisions."}
{"text":"Bann and Lynch are coaches to elite professional and junior players from around the world, including K.J. Choi, Stuart Appleby, Robert Allenby, Nick Flanagan, Kevin Na and Geoff Ogilvy. They are also the only instructional duo to take five teenagers into the world's Top 50.\n\nNow that Bann has joined SwingFix, you don't have to travel to get instruction from a tour-caliber teacher, and we asked him to take a few minutes to share something about himself and his approach to golf.\n\nEditor's note:All of the bolded terms below are defined in more detail on the websites linked above.\n\nFive Questions:\n\n1. First off, talk briefly about your golf instruction philosophy and how you preach it at your facility.\n\nBANN: My\/our philosophy is based on The Holistic Approach (technique, physical, mental and strategy). Each client is assessed and then based on their individual goals and skill level is introduced to the Improvement Cycle Philosophy.\n\n2. What attracted you to the SwingFix platform and how effective can this method be for golfers?\n\nBANN: Most golfers the world over get caught up in what I call the Reactive Cycle. I believe with a consistent and sequential approach to technique improvement working with a coach the Reactive Cycle can be avoided. I think the SwingFix platform provides a way for the golfer to have regular contact with the trusted source of game improvement information.\n\n3. In your opinion, what is the secret to taking the \"range game\" to the first tee?\n\nBANN: The Confidence Cycle, no doubt. And from my experience, all golfers who practice using this approach are able to build confidence across the required range of skills in practice, and they are then able to transfer this confidence to the course. Most golfers don't practice correctly and they are rarely able to feel the sensation of knowing (confidence) when they try to take their practice game to the course.\"\n\n4. Is there a particular training aid that you tend to use most regularly and with the most effectiveness?\n\nBANN: Anything that helps with the Five Laws of Impact is useful. Face and Path are the to most influential Laws of Impact, so I regularly use the impact bag and plane board as training aids to enhance the feel and learning process for these two key areas.\n\n5. Is there a way students who have worked with you most often dramatically improve and achieve that coveted five-shot drop in scores? Power, consistency, short game, management, playing more golf, etc.?\n\nBANN: The combination of SMART goals, embracing the philosophy of The Four Training Factors, The Improvement and Confidence Cycles has worked many times with my\/our students. There are 11 shot categories of golf, nine shots with each category, eight lies and eight different winds. Every golfer is an individual and when they can be accurately assessed and then establish a practice program that targets the area for most improvement for their game, great results are not far away. Avoid the Reactive Cycle(always trying the latest tip and trying not to make the last mistake again) at all costs.\n\nBy SwingFix.com staff\n\nMost average golfers spend less time in the fairway than they do off the grid.\n\nSo we asked SwingFix instructor Tyrus York for tips on how to extract oneself from a variety of bad lies.\n\nThis time around, having just seen this shot played time and again at the Masters, we're focusing on pine straw.\n\n\"The first thing you need to do is determine if the pine straw is fluffy or firm,\" York said. \"Next you must determine what kind of shot you need. If you're closer to the green and you have a wedge in your hand, you have two choices. If the pine straw is firm, play the shot like a standard chip, focusing on making contact with the ball first. If the straw is loose, then you try playing the shot like a standard greenside bunker shot, actually \"splashing\" the straw under the ball up on the green.\n\n\"If you're farther away, then the shot is much like a fairway bunker shot. A premium is put on stability in your feet to prevent slipping, and you must focus on hitting the ball first. When addressing the ball in pine straw, be careful when grounding the club because if you move the pine straw and the ball moves, it's a penalty. If you don't ground the club, though, and the ball moves during your swing, it's not a penalty.\""}

{"text":"Post navigation\n\nSimple Golf Tips & Techniques\n\nScoring well during a round depends on two things: keeping the ball in play and playing well from 100 yards in. Playing well from short yardage is critical. About two-thirds of the shots you take during a round are from 100 yards and in, so if you don't play well from short yardage you won't break 90 or 80. Your short game also has a major impact on your golf handicap over the course of a season. Play well from 100 yards in during the season and you'll lower your golf handicap a couple of strokes.\n\nHaving a great short game is also a key to being a complete player. In fact, you can't be one without a good short game. If you're short game isn't what it should be, you can im-prove it by mastering these four fundamentals: learn the correct set-up position for each shot, create a clear picture of the shot in your mind, choose a specific landing area for the shot, and focus on your finish to promote feel and acceleration. Below are golf tips we recommend to players in our golf lessons to help them master key short game fundamen-tals.\n\nChip Shot\n\nWe cover this shot thoroughly with players in our golf instruction sessions. It's that important. The key with chip shots is to set-up in a pre-set impact position so all you have to do is let your hips turn to bring the club back to impact. Also, play the ball back in your stance, open your hips slightly, create one line with your left arm and the club, and shift more weight to your front side. And take a few practice swings to make sure you're scuffing the grass ahead of the ball.\n\nPitch Shot\n\nThis is another shot you want to keep simple. So set up as if you were going to hit a chip, and then set your hands in a pre-impact position. Now just turn your hips. That's it. Other golf tips are play the ball off your nose, open the clubface slightly, and create one line with your left arm and the club. Also, keep your wrists relaxed during the shot, focus on swinging through the ball, and accelerate through impact. You want to hit down on the ball and create spin. Taking a few practice swings with your eyes on the target is also a good practice.\n\nFlop Shot\n\nYou need more height than spin on this shot. The key is to set up correctly and to bend your left wrist so your hands are low. This position allows you to use the club's full bounce. Keep the hands more in line with the clubhead, aim slightly left of target, and swing the club on a more vertical plane with an open clubface. At impact, the hands should be ahead of the ball so the clubface stays open and can slide under the ball. Take a good aggressive swing. That's something we remind players about in golf lessons all the time. The more aggressive you are, the higher the ball flies. Also, the deeper the lie, the harder you have to swing. Finish with your chest facing the target.\n\nBunker Shot\n\nNo one likes bunker shots. But you can master them with practice. The key is to open the clubface to create bounce first, and then set your hands and club in a pre-set impact posi-tion. Make sure your hands lead the club when you hit the sand. Turn your trunk in the backswing to keep your arms in front of your chest, which lets you hinge on plane. Other tips are play the ball forward, about 2 inches from the center, open the clubface slightly to capitalize on the club's bounce, and aim about a club length left of your target. Bunker shots fly about one-third of normal shots, so plan accordingly.\n\nYou must master the fundamentals of the short game to become a complete player. The golf tips discussed above, gleaned from our golf lessons and group golf instruction ses-sions, will help you master the fundamentals. Keep things as simple as possible, so they're easily repeatable, and be aggressive. Learn to trust your fundamentals once you've mastered them and you'll find yourself breaking 90 or 80 and chopping strokes off your golf handicap.\n\nLike This Article?\n\nSign up for our FREE Newsletter for more golf tips and tricks to help you Break 80."}

{"text":"GolfGist.com\n\n4. The Rule of\nSeven\n\nCochran and Stobbs in The\nSearch for the Perfect Swing found that at 200 yards a drive would\nslice approximately 7-8 yards for every degree the clubface was open to\nthe swing path. This could vary slightly depending on the loft, clubhead\nspeed and ball type.\n\nYou will slice more with your\ndriver and long irons because you hit them the hardest and they have the\nleast amount of loft. This means they put less backspin on the ball, and\nmore sidespin, than any of the other clubs. Because you drive on 12 to 14\nholes per round, a slice can get you off to a bad start, on most of holes.\n\nAnother problem for slicers is\nlose of distance. Distance is lost because of the curving flight of the\nball. Also, when the clubface opens the loft of the club is increased. Go\nget a club and address the ball. Twist the shaft to the right, opening the\nclubface and watch the loft increase. Opening the club actually tilts the\nclubface backward increasing the effective loft. The result is weak, high\nshots landing short of the target.\n\nThe first step to curing the\nslice is to understand the real causes. Sometimes this will contradict\nlong held beliefs which were considered gospel in their day. Your\ninstincts may tell you to help push the ball with the right shoulder and\ntry to pull it over to the left. Or you may aim a little to the left.\nUnfortunately these remedies result in a pull or an even bigger slice. It\nseems contradictory, but the only remedy for the slice will be to go\nagainst your natural impulses. You have to learn to swing toward the slice\n(inside-square-inside) while controlling the clubface. It won.t feel right\nat first, but the only way to improve is to make that leaf of faith.\n\nNo matter what the direction of\nthe swing path, remember the amount of the slice is a function of the\nangle between the direction the clubhead is traveling (swing path) and\nangle of the open clubface. We refer to this angle as the slice angle. The\ngreater the slice angle the greater the slice. You must understand that to\ncure the slice, you will need to control both the swing path and the angle\nof the clubface at impact."}
{"text":"October, 2011\n\nHere are some golf fitness tips that can literally improve every aspect of your game \u2013 from the distance you hit your driver (and every other club for that matter) to the way you feel on and off the golf course.\n\nAsk most club-level golfers and they'll tell you that fitness for golf is the preserve of the world's top players looking for anything that will give them the slightest competitive edge. After all, they have time to spend hours at the gym each day and easy access to the best facilities and fitness coaches. But did you know that a simple home exercise routine, performed just 3 days a week with some basic, low cost equipment, can make a significant difference to your golf game?\n\n1. Increase their swing speed and therefore their average carry distance with every club in the bag.\n2. Improve their accuracy, hitting more shots out the middle of the club.\n3. Reduce their risk of injuries \u2013 particularly to the shoulders and back.\n4. Improve their overall health and energy levels and reduce the risk of serious illness.\n\nAnd best of all, the amateur golfers that took part in these studies didn't have to give up their life for exercise to improve their golf game and their health.\n\nIMPROVE YOUR GOLF-SPECIFIC STRENGTH\n\nA golf-specific strength training program has been shown to increase club head speed in amateur golfers. While golf isn't simply about how fast you can swing the club (or even how far you hit the ball), research shows that faster swing speeds result in lower handicaps.\n\nTo a lot of gym goers, strength training means pumping iron to exhaustion. It means completing lots of isolated exercises such as biceps curls and crunches in split routines (one or two body parts worked each day). But the key to remember is that strength training for golf is NOT the same as body building.\n\nFirstly, you should select exercises that mimic the movements and positions in golf. For example, rotational exercises that work the core region (such as 'wood chops') are more suitable than traditional sit ups or crunches. Likewise, squats or lunges are more beneficial to a golfer than seated leg extensions for example.\n\nSecondly, you should choose a wide variety of exercises that work all the major muscles groups each session (even those muscles that might not predominate in the golf swing). This helps to keep your body and your musculature balanced \u2013 imbalances lead to injury. Whereas a bodybuilder typically splits his or her routine into body parts (chest and shoulders one day, legs the next etc.), a total body routine is usually more suitable for a golfer.\n\nThirdly, you should incorporate exercises that strengthen your core region (stomach, lower back, hip region) and improve your posture. This will help to prevent injury and it will also allow you to make a more balanced, more controlled and more repeatable golf swing.\n\nIMPROVE YOUR GOLF-SPECIFIC FLEXIBILITY\n\nFlexibility is under-rated. Improving your flexibility will allow you to make a fuller turn with less effort during the backswing \u2013 and that means more power in your golf shots. It will help you get into the correct positions during the backswing \u2013 and that means greater accuracy and consistency in your golf shots.\n\nBut more than your ability to hit a golf ball further and with greater consistency, increased range of motion just makes you feel better. Reducing your muscle stiffness can reduce your risk of injury, such as muscle tears, and the right types of stretches can help to improve postural imbalances \u2013 a major cause of back problems.\n\nYou can improve your flexibility through a static stretching routine completed 3x a week. It's best to stretch when your body is warm after exercise. Focus on stretches to the shoulders, upper and lower back, hamstrings, quads and calves. You can hold each stretch for 15 seconds and complete it twice or hold for 30 seconds, completing each stretch once.\n\nThe time to avoid static stretching is immediately BEFORE a round of golf. Contrary to popular belief, there is no evidence to show that static stretching before a sporting activity reduces the risk of injury or improves performance (if anything, it's detrimental). What you can do pre-round is a series of dynamic stretches\u2026\n\nA dynamic stretch uses movement and momentum to bring about a stretch. A classic example is 'arm swings' \u2013 where you start with your arms out in a crucifix position and then swing them across your chest and then out again. This dynamically stretches the chest muscles.\n\nIMPROVE YOUR CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS\n\nCardiovascular exercise will help you to feel more focused and alert on the golf course. It reduces stress and will keep you feeling fresher in the latter stages of your round. If you struggle to maintain your concentration and enthusiasm for 18 holes CV exercise can help. But more importantly\u2026\n\nRegular cardiovascular exercise literally allows you to live longer and healthier. It reduces your risk of major illnesses (such as heart disease, stroke, certain cancers and type II diabetes) and it reduces high blood pressure \u2013 known as the 'silent killer' that affects about 25% of the adult population worldwide.\n\nIf you're short on time, you can structure golf strength exercises in a way that they improve your cardiovascular fitness as well. It's known as circuit training and it's one of the most efficient, time-friendly (and fun) types of exercise.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nResearch shows that a well-designed golf fitness program improves your golf game and lowers your scores, regardless of age or current handicap.\n\nCombining a program of golf-specific strength and flexibility exercises allows you to hit the ball further, more accurately and more consistently.\n\nUsing a circuit training set up allows you to improve your cardiovascular fitness as well. This can have a significant impact on your health as well as your golf.\n\nA golf fitness program doesn't have to take over your life. You'll see benefits from a 3-day per week routine, completed at home, without requiring any expensive exercise equipment.\n\nAre you tired and frustrated of setting a personal goal to lose weight and sustain a healthy diet, only to fall short of achieving that goal? Have you ever lost some or all the desired pounds you were hoping for only to have regained a significant amount of weight? Whatever your health goals are, it's not too late to take charge of your health and improve your current lifestyle; However, I want to share with you some fitness tips that will promote a healthy lifestyle and not a quick and short-term solution.\n\nBecause of our busy lives and hectic schedules, it is difficult to adhere to an exercise routine or fitness program with any consistency. Moreover, we are fascinated with diet pills and rapid weight loss products. I have to admit I have tried several of these diet and weight loss programs as seen on television infomercials. I spent hundreds of dollars trying to find that \"quick fix\" or magic solution that would have allowed me to drop the desired pounds and have the perfect body. To my dismay, the dream never became a reality.I had no consistency with my weight loss and diet efforts. I didn't have the time or commitment to join a gym or health club. I'm sure there are many of you that have difficulty with exercising, dieting, or working out consistently. With a slumping economy, most people can't afford gym memberships or buy expensive exercise equipment.\n\nAfter I invested hundreds of dollars in weight loss and diet products that either didn't work or I lost the motivation to continue with the programs\u2026I decided to re-evaluate how I view weight loss and fitness. I wanted to start a realistic diet and fitness regiment that I could sustain long-term. I wanted to merge a fitness program into my daily routine that I could consider a lifestyle change instead of a short-term fitness plan. There are creative weight loss and fitness tips anyone can use to help with proper dieting and weight loss without going to the gym or buying expensive diet pills. These are practical and simple tips that will promote long-term success instead of a quick fix. You don't have to go to a gym to have an effective workout. There are things you can do in your home to get a good workout such as cardio, abdominal, aerobics, strength and resistance training. These are just a few tips to encourage long-term weight loss and fitness:\n\nDoing various exercises such as push ups, sit ups and aerobics while a television commercial is on. If you're watching television, there is always time during commercials to be productive.\n\nWhen out shopping or doing other business, park further away from your desired place to do some extra walking. We all have to go to various places where parking in a parking are is required. Walking a greater distance than normal would benefit greatly, especially if this is done with consistency.\n\nTake the stairs instead of the elevator when in facilities that need one to go to another floor. I can confidently say this method helps to build endurance. I feel the burn when I have to go up three to five flights of stairs.\n\nThere are several items in your household that can be used for weight and strength resistance. If you have weights or dumbbells to use that is fine. However, you don't have to buy weight or dumbbells to increase muscle mass and strength.I use various types of heavy objects in the home to do repetitious exercises which benefits my biceps and triceps.\n\nChange your diet habits. You can consume affordable healthy foods that will aid in proper weight loss and fitness. You don't have to totally give up the foods you love\u2026however, consumption of not so healthy foods need to be done in moderation. I enjoyed snacking on sweets and other junk food in the past. I decided to replace high sugar and high fat snacks with healthy snacks such as fruits and some low-calorie snacks.\n\nI have shared some practical tips to promote long-term weight loss and fitness that can fit into anyone's lifestyle. \"People often equate successfully managing your weight with losing a significant amount of weight, but past research has shown that even a modest weight loss of 2 pounds can have clinical benefits,\" said Paul Terry, president and CEO of StayWell Health Management. Things things can easily be incorporated into our daily routines. Moreover, there are several other activities that one can do to promote a healthy lifestyle.\n\nTeenage is the phase where one's body undergoes development both physically as well as mentally. So, it is very important to take care of health and stay fit in this stage. Having a regular exercise into day-to-day activities is quite essential because if not only makes you feel better but rather increases your immune system as well. It drives away your boredom at the same time burns out those extra calories out. So, Read along, to know some fitness tips that may make you pass through this segment of your life very smoothly:\n\nHEALTH TIP#1: It would be a good idea to take up a sport that you would enjoy playing. It is said so because you will never feel the pain the pleasure that you derive out of it destroys the pressure to stay fit.\n\nHEALTH TIP#2: Start, build and Persist. We are not speaking about bingeing, purging and later working out for hours to sculpt to your body. It is all about doing things gradually and consistently. Skipping exercise on some days may prove dangerous for your body.\n\nHEALTH TIP#3: Have a balanced diet. Although, teenager are often said to be the victims of junk food, it is not a bad idea to go for it once in a while. Never make them a part of your regular diet. Have nutritious food and include green leafy vegetables in your diet.\n\nHEALTH TIP#4: Set practical goals and work for them. In this case, never compare with others. It is always good to start with a little rather than ending up into an obese adult.\n\nHEALTH TIP#5: Stay away from addictions of any kind. May it be alcohol, drugs or doing your own work outs. Never get addicted to any kind of activity, may it good or bad, as it will hinder your overall progress. ADDICTION is always harmful.\n\nThere is one more general tip for girls. There is a misconception widespread among teenage girls that taking up exercise as a daily activity may turn one's body muscular or manly making them look like a body builder. But the truth is not so, it is always better to do some mild exercises which will not cause any harm to your \"feminine\" appearance."}

{"text":"Golf Games: The Nassau\n\nGolf Games: The Nassau\n\nJuly 18, 2012\n\nThe most popular betting game in golf likely is the $2 Nassau. The Nassau is two-sided bet: either player against player, or team against team. In fact, Nassaus lend themselves to a variety of team play formats. Scramble, four ball and alternate shot matches are common. Handicaps are most often used, but teams could decide not to play with them.\n\nThe Nasssau gets its name from the Nassau Country Club on Long Island, where the format was invented in the early 1900s. The game also is known as \"2-2-2\", and \"Best Nines.\"\n\nNassaus are essentially three separate bets. with awards for winning each side (front nine, back nine) and for all 18. In a basic $2 Nassau, the player or team winning all three events would win $6.\n\nScoring Nassaus is something akin to that of match play golf. When a player or team has the low score on a hole, they score one point. A tie is a \"push. The team or player with the most points at the end of each nine wins that side. The two nines are totaled for the 18 hole award.\n\nBut if that's all there was to a Nassau, it is unlikely that it would be so popular among golfers. The real fun of a Nassau begins with the \"press.\"\n\nIn most Nassau formats, any time a team or individual is down by two or more points, they can \"press\" the bet. That means that an additional bet is placed for the remaining holes on the side. The original bet still stands, however. Players involved in a Nassau typically are obligated to accept a press.\n\nHere's an example of how it works: After six holes, Team A finds itself down by two points. They decide to press. Now, in addition to the original wager, a second bet has been placed for holes seven, eight and nine. If Team A wins two of the three, they still lose the original bet by one point. However, they break even because they won the press. If they lose two of the remaining holes, they end up paying off both wagers. In the best case scenario, they win all three remaining holes, and win both wagers.\n\nIn some Nassau formats, the press is automatic when a player or team is down by two.\n\nWagering on Nassaus can sometimes be difficult to track. At the end of 18, it would not be unusual for players to have placed six or seven separate wagers. Nassaus also can become quite expensive\u2014even with the initial $2 limit. A Nasssau that has been pressed, double pressed, and triple pressed can quickly add up.\n\nMass confusion and bank-breaking payouts can be reduced by limiting the presses to no more than two per nine holes. Some matches also allow presses only on the last four holes of each nine.\n\nIf the number of presses is controlled, Nassaus can be a very friendly betting format. The players who are down (presumably the less skilled players\u2014at least on that day) control the pace of the wagers. And because the bet is broken into two nines and a total, a bad nine won't ruin the whole day"}

{"text":"Changing your chipping technique for tough lies\n\nIt's something I work with my students all the time, but there are certain situations where the normal technique doesn't work.\n\nOne situation is one I find myself in almost every time I play golf -- a bad lie close to the green. A ball nestled deep in the grass just off the green is a tough shot, unless you know how to adjust your swing.\n\nThe basic chip shot consists of leaning on the front foot with the shaft pushed forward. Also, there should be very little wrist hinge throughout the swing.\n\nBut when there's a tough lie around the green, you have to allow your wrists to hinge, creating a more \"V\"-shaped swing. The \"V\"-shaped swing helps get the ball out of the long grass and land softly on the green. I call this technique \"hinge and hold.\"\n\nThe set-up is similar to the normal chipping technique -- weight on the front foot, shaft pushed forward. Bunt on the backswing, hinge the wrists; then swing sharply down.\n\nAfter contact, hold the club face.\n\nThis technique around the green should feel very similar to the way you approach a greenside bunker shot. Because like a greenside bunker, you need to get the ball out of a tough spot, but you want it to land softly.\n\nIf you're like me, and you find yourself with tough lies near the green when you play a round, practice this technique. It's something that will really help you lower your scores."}

{"text":"Golfer's 'swing plane' made plain\n\nI'm sure all of you have heard much talk about the plane of the golf swing. I want to offer a way to simplify it for you when you swing the golf club.\n\nThe term \"swing plane\" is the line the club shaft has a relationship to during a sound swing. This line or plane is established by the angle of the club's shaft and the posture of the player before the swing goes in motion at address.\n\nThe angle of the shaft at address may be the most important angle in golf. This is the angle that the club shaft must return to at impact. Everything a player does with his\/her swing is to permit the club to return to impact on the original shaft plane angle.\n\nTo help understand the plane of a golf swing, it may help to look at a house. The floor of the house is a straight line at a horizontal angle. The wall of a house is a straight line at a vertical angle. The roof of a house is a straight line at an inclined angle. Sound swings keep the club on a plane that has a relationship to the original shaft angle established at address throughout the swing, with few if any compensating movements. The club points to the bottom of the plane (roof) at address and during an on plane swing, the shaft either will be pointing to or parallel to the bottom of the swing plane (roof).\n\nHank Haney, Tiger's swing coach, says a swing is either on plane or it isn't. Every player's goal is to be on plane from start to finish.\n\nRules teaser:\n\nIn four ball (best ball) stroke play, a player holes out and - before his partner holes out - he practices on the fringe of the green. Ruling?\n\nLast rules teaser:\n\nIn a difficult lie, a player struck a rock with his ball and the ball popped up in the air. In disgust, the player swung at the ball in the air but missed it. Ruling? No penalty.\n\nJohn Lucas is the teaching pro at Sky Ridge Golf Course and Learning Center in Sequim. He can be reached at john"}
{"text":"Hitting the ball a long way is a combination of clubhead speed and a square clubface at impact. Sounds easy, but one may have to work a lot to perfect this move. The golf swing has a number of components and if one breaks down, they will immediately experience lack of power, accuracy or even both in some cases.\nBut incorporating a few reminders into your swing will help increase the distance on your shots. Start with a couple of fundamentals: your grip and stance. Make sure your grip is light and you are holding the club more in your fingers than your hands. Also keep it\nneutral. You should ensure that you can only see one and half knuckles of your left hand grip without moving your head (for the right-hander golfer) to apply an ideal pressure.\nBe sure you have a wide and stable base with your stance line (the stance should be as wide as your shoulder). This will help promote better balance and allow you to store more energy in your backswing. The longer your swing path, the more clubhead speed you can generate, so be sure to have a full shoulder turn to create a longer swing arc keeping your left hand straight. If flexibility is an issue, do not complete your backswing by lifting your arms. Get as full a shoulder turn as you can.\nAt the top of your backswing, you have stored the necessary energy and the transfer of that forward allows you to deliver it to the golf ball. It is important to note this energy coil unwind from the ground up. The hips turn to the target. The shoulders naturally follow which pulls the arms down along your swing plane and the hands trail.\nLast point, the key to consistent power is to maintain your wrist cock to create a lag in your swing. Do not release your hands too early as this will decelerate your clubhead. Instead, release your hands through the golf ball at impact. Always be careful not to shift your weight forward too fast and get overactive with your legs. A helpful tip is to think of keeping your back foot down as you drive through the ball.\nTension in your muscles will reduce your capacity to swing with greater speed and cut a lot of distance. Take these tips to the practice range and work them into your swing. Remember to stay relaxed, keep the left arm straight, encourage shoulder turn and lag your wrist (do not unhinge) until at impact to increase your swing speed to hit the ball longer.\n(The author is a golf instructor and golf director at Gokarna Forest Golf Resort & Spa, Kathmandu.\nHe can be contacted through prodeepak@hotmail.com)"}
{"text":"How Golf Teachers Learn\n\n\"Learning From My Students\"\n\nBy:\nJohn Lombardo\nMy first lesson of the year was with two young brothers. I have been teaching the older boy for about 5 years now, and this is the second year for the younger one. We went out to the range on a Saturday morning to hit some balls, when I started my review of some of the things we had covered last season. Since this was their first time out and first swings in quite a while, it took them a bit of time to start hitting the ball.\n\nI noticed that this year they were much more communicative and focused on the lesson event, so I took the opportunity to relay some information about how they should keep the golf club in front of them, in other words stay connected, throughout the entire swing, and stay in balance. They were flailing at the ball pretty good so I took my best shot at giving them some useful golf information that they could us throughout their golfing careers. As an illustration, I hit three or four shots using this technique, and was amazed, at my first swings in over a week, that the ball went straight and true and jumped off the club face with some vigor and life. The club felt on plane and very light as I hit my illustration shots.\n\nI had been working so hard on keeping my right side lined up at and through impact, that my hands were getting quick and my tempo and rhythm were off. I was playing good but not great. Saturday was a so-so day weather-wise, so I got to go out and play that afternoon. I stayed connected together with keeping my right side lined up, and the shots flew off the club face very accurate with better power and distance with the continued feeling a light golf club. All my parts were clicking together as I played hole after hole in great fashion, hitting accurate shots with an effortless swing.\n\nI teach basically by feel and instinct, and I gave the boys what they needed, and took the advice myself. What a great feeling, being comfortable in my golf swing. I hope it continues and I hope I can continue to learn from my students."}

The Club president at the time visited\nCity Hall to ensure they delayed the road work, and succeeded with the\ntournament taking place as planned.\n\nAlso of note is Canada's best Amateur player of the era \u2013 Andrew Smith \u2013 was\nunable to attend the tournament. He was in court answering to the accusation\nof having been found playing golf on a Sunday and breaking the Lord's Day\nact.\n\nThe first playing of the Men's Amateur Championship was a match play event\nthat took place at Royal Ottawa the afternoon of June 7th, 1895. Only eight\nplayers competed. Thomas M. Harley of Kingston Golf Club won the inaugural\nevent beating Alex Simpson of Royal Ottawa.\n\nThomas M. Harley was a carpenter from Aberlady, East Lothian Scotland who had\nmade his way to Kingston in the 1890s to practice his trade. He became a\nrenowned golfer around this time, but eventually gave up the sport to\ncontinue his trade, most likely in his home town, passing away in 1943 at\nthe age of 88.\n\nThe trophy that was awarded had been donated by the Governor General at the\ntime, Lord Aberdeen, naming the trophy the Aberdeen Cup. In addition to the\ntrophy, the champion was awarded a gold medal.\n\nHere's an interesting fact about the Aberdeen Cup. The cup was awarded to\nGeorge S. Lyon -yes, the same George S. Lyon who is the reigning champion of\nGolf in the Olympics- in perpetuity when he won the Men's Amateur\nChampionship three years in a row, 1905-1907. Unfortunately, the cup was\neventually lost.\n\nThe following year, in 1908, a new trophy was donated by the then Governor\nGeneral Earl Grey. And this is the trophy that has been awarded annually\never since.\n\nHere are some other interesting statistics on the Canadian Men's Amateur\nChampionship:\n\nThe Canadian Men's Amateur Championship is the third oldest national amateur\nchampionship in the world with the British Amateur having started 1885, the\nAustralian Amateur in 1894. The U.S. Men's Amateur did not start until later\nin the year of 1895.\n\nGeorge S. Lyon has won the most Men's Amateur Championships with 8 (1898,\n1900, 1903, 1905, 1906, 1907, 1912, 1914), Sandy Somerville has won the\nsecond most with 6 (1926, 1928, 1930, 1931, 1935, 1937).\n\nToronto Golf Club has hosted the most Canadian Amateurs, with 8 (1898, 1901,\n1903, 1905, 1909, 1913, 1926, and 1995), Royal Ottawa Golf Club with 7\n(1895, 1899, 1906, 1911, 1914, 1925, and 1951) is tied with Royal Montreal\nGolf Club (1897, 1900, 1902, 1904, 1908, 1912, and 1931).\n\nTo date, only four players have won both the U.S. and the Canadian Amateur:\nHonoured Member Sandy Somerville, Dick Chapman, Harvie Ward and Honoured\nMember Gary Cowan.

{"text":"Bounce is the angle represented by a line drawn from the bottom of the sole to the leading edge, and affects the way a wedge interacts with the turf. Gap wedges generally carry between eight and ten-degrees of bounce, while lob wedges can carry between six and 12 degrees, as they are required to cope with a wider range of playing surfaces. The more bounce there is, the more the bottom of the club acts like the bow of a boat to prevent the club from digging into the ground.\n\nIs there a simple rule for our course?\n\nA low bounce wedge tends to play well in firm conditions (such as tight links fairways), and a high bounce wedge works for softer, more grassy conditions and fluffy bunkers. But we need to consider your angle of attack. If it is steep then we need to either fix that or get a bounce angle on your clubs that will protect you from digging in.

{"text":"Secrets To Developing A Proper Golf Swing\n\nEvery golf player dreams of uncovering the secrets behind the proper golf swing. However, most players do not realize that the fundamentals of a great golf swing will never change. It will always be based on scientific details such as levers, thrust, power, and centrifugal force. In fact, all golf players are doing the same thing when they are swinging their golf clubs. The only thing that makes a players swing look different is his personality and playing style.\n\nAll these facts imply the same thing great golf players are shaped, not born. If you want to become a good golf player, you have to start learning the fundamentals of developing a proper golf swing. Once you have integrated all of these ideas with your swing, you can start swinging harder without exerting too much effort.\n\nPatience, patience, patience\n\nMost players who wish to develop advanced golf techniques try to look for quick fixes. Unfortunately, there are no quick fixes to developing a great swing. Human nature needs time to learn new skills and areas of expertise. Although a hook grip and a stronger position can help you aim straight at the ball, you will never be as great as you want to be with this mediocre playing technique.\n\nSo how can you hit those golf balls straighter and farther? The answer lies within your golf swing. As soon as you have learned the fundamentals of the proper golf swing, you can easily have more control and power over your unique playing style.\n\nUnderstanding the fundamentals of golf\n\nWhen it comes to playing golf, you will need to develop six skills. These include your swing, posture, pivot, alignment, and hand-arm relationship. After learning these particular skills, you can already hone your mental side by playing golf without thinking about it.\n\nThe grip refers to how you are holding the club. You have to make sure that your hand is fixed on your golf club. You can do this through the overlap, baseball grip, and interlock. You have to strike the balance between a strong and weak grip by not holding the club too tightly or too loosely.\n\nYour posture is the cornerstone of your playing style. You have to start by keeping your feet shoulder width apart and your toes pointed out in about five to ten degrees. Next, you need to bend from your hips without slouching from your shoulders. You have to keep your back straight in order to make a powerful swing without hurting your back.\n\nNext, you have to develop your pivot or the way you move your body. It refers to how you are moving your head and toes without using your arms and hands. The correct pivot will move every muscle in your body without lasting for more than two seconds.\n\nThese are only some of the important things you need to remember when learning about the fundamentals of playing golf. If you want to develop the proper golf swing, you need to have fun during the learning process instead of feeling frustrated about minor mistakes."}

Don.t assume you are lined up\ncorrectly. Remember practice makes permanent, so make sure you are\nstarting off positioned correctly. Learn the square stance first. Later,\nas the need arises, you can experiment with other stances.\n\nTo double check\nyour target line. If you don.t accurately know your target line, you\ncannot easily tell if you are making swing path errors. Before each shot\napproach the ball from behind and pick your target line. Then when taking\nyour stance align yourself toward your target. Better players align\nthemselves much more consistently than poor players. Hitting balls without\naiming at a target is an invitation for swing problems. Make sure you have\na target for every practice shot you hit. Tape, clubs on the ground, or\n.practice partners. are all good ways to check aim and alignment. This\nwill help you to learn to identify the difference between a poor shot and\nan error in alignment.\n\nDo's and Don'ts Don.t leave the club between\nyour feet longer than needed to check proper ball position. Many good\nplayers leave one club on the ground parallel to the target line whenever\nthey hit practice balls. Checking your alignment is a good way to begin\nevery practice session. During a game the rules do not allow you to lay a\nclub on the club to help with alignment.\nCheck your alignment as part\nof your preshot routine. Your preshot routine should be done the same way\nevery time. It.s purpose is to make getting ready for each shot automatic."}
{"text":"Toronto\n\nGolf: A Brief History of Tee Time\n\nLooking back on the lineage of the links\n\nBy Jackelyn \"Tam o' Shooter\" Crawford\n\nMost golfers would rather think about the booked tee times of tomorrow then the overshot pars of the past, but every once in a while, it's important to look back, not just on your last game, but on golf's history as a whole. After all, where would you be next Saturday on a sunny summer morning if no one had initially sowed the seeds of the greens, or blazed the fairway trails? Probably eating instant oatmeal or untangling extension cords or something. We've prepared a brief summary of golf's monumental events to give you a deeper knowledge and appreciation of the game.\n\nWho took the first swing?\n\nLike fish, chips and mushy peas, golf is mostly considered a Scottish invention that developed during the Middle Ages. But its bonnie Scottish roots have oftentimes been disputed, mostly because after a while, people need to debate something other than the merits of crushed ice vs. cubed (crushed melts in a second... what's the point of it?). Research suggests that in the 12th century, golf-esque games were played in both China and the Netherlands. The Dutch used sticks and leather balls to hit targets hundreds of yards away. To match the leather equipment, players dressed in cowhide cloaks, lambskin tunics and studded motorcycle boots.\n\n\"It's beautiful, just beautiful. I call it golf.\"\n\nLike every word, golf sounds silly if you say it enough times. The strange, monosyllabic name of the game may have come from \"kolbe,\" the German word for club, or \"colf,\" the Dutch word for stick, club or bat (give the Netherlands another point!). There's a myth that golf stands for \"gentleman only, ladies forbidden,\" but this is simply a backronym most likely borne from 1950s ad campaigns. Another popular misconception of what golf stands for includes \"game on large field,\" which was recently used as a method for explaining the game to the cast of Jersey Shore.\n\nScotland - the putting propagators\n\nWhile we can't quite figure out who to credit for the club, ball and beer cart aspects of golf, we do know that the Scots are to thank for introducing the hole, a.k.a the ball's home. We also know that they were avid players - so much so that in 1457 and subsequent years, the game was banned because it posed a distraction to the military's archery practice. This golf prohibition didn't last long, though - by the 16th century big wigs like King James IV and Mary, Queen of Scots were taking to the greens. Once royalty teed off, so did the masses, and golf's popularity soared like the popularity of cheeseburgers did after David Hasselhoff was filmed eating one. By the late 1700s, formal rules were established, the first championships were organized, and the famous Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews began promoting golf as an official sport.\n\nGolf crosses the border\n\nIn the 19th century, the game spread to the rest of the U.K., the British Empire and the U.S., almost as swiftly as news spreads about Tiger Woods marital indiscretions. There are a few factors that contributed to golf's boom: Scottish soldiers and immigrants introduced it to the British colonies; the St. Andrews railway transported it from Edinburgh to London on a frequent basis; Sir Walter Scott's writings inspired more tourism and cultural interest in Scotland. However, the thing that made golf go viral before viral was a thing was gutty, a member of the Silly Putty family and a cheap, durable substance from which to make golf balls. This new ball was far less flighty than the previously-used feather one, and more affordable for all classes of golf lovers.\n\nThe course as a catwalk\n\nStereotypically, golf fashion reflects a distinct style, informally known as preppy-goof. It all started with the ruffled cravats and knee-length breeches and stockings of the 19th century. During the 20th century, styles morphed slowly but surely - trousers got longer, bowties were adopted then discarded, blinding colours and kooky patterns made an appearance, and loose-fitting, easy-breathing khakis and polo shirts became the norm. Argyle, the sweetheart of golf garments, has remained a timeless trend. Much to the contrary, the heavy wool coats of the 1930s were more of a one-decade wonder, once it was realized that excessive sweating didn't have its part in a gentleman's game.\n\nAccording to Inspector Gadget and other prominent figures in the golf industry, the game stands to become a heck of a lot faster and a bit more interesting once all humans evolve into cyborgs, and the golf cart is replaced by the rocket-powered jet pack. Rumours have also been circulating about a golf app that allows you to shrink down to the size of the youngest kid from Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and enter your smartphone to play a few virtual rounds."}

{"text":"3 comments:\n\nWayne, thanks for another great video. I have been teaching pivot compression for over 20 years and love to hear you talk about it. Though it seems you have a model that you like the most I believe you also have an eye for how golfers perform it in differing manners.\n\nOn another note. When viewing a golfers routine I feel it is important for them to understand his or her internal rhythm and cadence. Great players walk through their routines in cadence when playing their best. I test to see if a golfer's internal rhythm is a 2, 3, 4, 5 or more beat rhythm. Most golfers own either 3, 4 or 5 beat rhythms. Then I watch to see how they implement it in their routines. I have a 3 beat rhythm. It takes me 3 beats to walk up to the ball, 3 more to address it and 3 more to lock in to the target and 3 more settle in and pull the trigger. That is 12 beats starting with my first step. cont'd\n\nGolfers with 4 beat rhythms commonly have 4 cycles of 4 beats before pulling the trigger, however some have only 3 and some have 5. Golfers with 5 beat rhythms commonly have 3 or 4 cycles. The key is to cycle the rhythmic beats and that is what makes it a cadence. I even notice that when golfers are on the process of swinging is competed in one more cycle, then as the watch the shot there is another cycle right up to the ball landing. Then I have my golfers watch the ball come to rest with one more cycle. That makes sure the whole shot routine is performed in cadence. You can even observe players like Fred Couples walking the course in cadence"}

{"text":"The Origin of Golf as a Game\n\nGolfing has gained increasing popularity in recent years and has since spread to the rest of the world. Golfing is seen as a leisure activity and as a means to network. It is also a way to conduct business in an informal setting. Although, not as demanding physically as football or basketball, golfing demands concentration and precision from its players, where players have to hit a small ball with a club into a series of holes. The one that hits the ball into the right hole with the least number of strokes will be the winner. It is a competing sport as well as an amature sport many people just play for fun.\n\nThe current version that is being played today was first started in the 15th century in Scotland. However, golf existed on other forms prior to the 15th century, and historians cannot agree on a common origin. Some historians think that the Roman's paganica is the origin of golf as there are similarities between paganica and golf. When the Romans played paganica, the players had to hit a stuffed ball made of leather with a bent stick. Since the Romans conquered most of Europe in the 1st century, it is thought that they brought the game with them and thus paganica spread throughout Europe.\n\nHowever, other historians have traced golf to the Chinese's chuiwan. It was played in China between the 8th and 14th centuries. The name chuiwan means striking a small ball which is remarkably similar to the description of golf. Apart from the meaning of chuiwan, there is also a drawing entitled \"The Autumn Banquet\" from Ming Dynasty, dated 1368, showing a member of the court playing the game. It was shown that the player has to hit a small ball into a hole with a club that look similar to the modern golf club. It was recorded in the D\u014dngxu\u0101n Records of the Song Dynasty (960-1279) that the players of chuiwan had to choose between 10 clubs in order to play the game. These 10 clubs included cuanbang, pubang, and shaobang, which from the record are similar to the modern golf driver, two-wood, and three-wood. The Records further suggested that chuiwan was a game for the rich since the clubs were all inlaid with jaded gold. Since there was interaction between the Chinese imperial court and Europe during the Middle Ages, it was suggested that chuiwan could have been spread into Europe during that time.\n\nOther historians asserted that modern golf originated from a game that the English called cambuca and the French called chambot. In addition, there is a game called kolven in Netherlands which bears similarities to modern golf in which the players has to hit a leather ball with curved stick. The aim is to hit the ball into a target a few hundred yards away with as few strokes as possible. It was played annually in Loenen in 1297 in remembrance of the capture of Floris V, an assassin, a year before. No matter whose account one would choose to believe, golf has clearly been around for a long time in one form or another"}

{"text":"Students Q & A\n\nQ \u2013 When you say start with your front shoulder do you mean drop the shoulder to get the swing started?\n\nA \u2013 No not down, you want to wind your shoulders around your spine, and you push your front shoulder in the direction that would do this based on your spine tilt or angle. I know that sounds weird, but it changes for every club. If you were standing straight up and down, you would push back level to the ground, but once you tilt some, you push more up the swing path or tilt path. Some golfers prefer to use their back shoulder to pull back behind them to wind up\u2026 or some use both shoulders working together. Again the key is to \"Wind your shoulders around your spine\". There is a great book out on this called One Move to Better Golf. Carl Lohren saw Ben Hogan making this move in the 1950\u2032s. This is an awesome move once learned\u2026 hope this helped it is very difficult to explain\u2026 Ross\n\nQ \u2013 When I work with your lessons, I am not sure what I'm doing wrong, but I'm getting a lot of pulls and pull hooks. Any thoughts? Thanks.\n\nA \u2013 You may not believe it now, but that is a good thing. It means you are turning (what we want), but at the same time you are letting your hands and club control impact and take over passing your body rotation (makes the ball go left). As you practice with easy 40 yd shots, be totally aware of any grip pressure changes during the swing. You want to feel that your body turn can control impact. Impact is not a moment where you need to do something, it is a continuum, meaning it is where the ball gets in the way of your turn as your body keeps rotating to the finish. The only thing that messes this up is THE HANDS, trying to help. The more you keep them passive, the more the Large Muscles take over and the more consistent you will become\u2026 please let me know how you are doing. Here is a new video I just put up that addresses this move\u2026 notice the slow motion at the end uses body roation, NOT HANDS \u2026talk soon\u2026 Ross\n\nQ \u2013 Do I still shift weight to my back foot when I take the club back?\n\nA \u2013 No \u2026 I don't teach that\u2026 there is no need and only messes things up\u2026 keep 60% front 40% back\u2026 let your shoulders push the club back against a firm lower body.. hence the word \"hold\" that we use\u2026 hold is holding your front knee to keep your lower body still on takeaway\u2026 this creates a ton of torque\u2026 the backswing is really a very small, powerful move\u2026 more of a windup\u2026 all that shift your weight stuff is old school and very bad\u2026 Ross\n\nQ \u2013 Just started golfing 3-4 months ago. Doing pretty well with irons and driver (your videos helped!) My biggest problem is hitting 3 W and 3-5 H off the fairway. I usually either hit it thin or push it to right. Have tried moving ball around (front, middle) but hasn't helped much. Any advice? Thanks!\n\nA \u2013 Hi Jim\nIf the ball is going right (and you are right handed), the face is open, which means you opened is sometime during the back swing. Watch this video  and you can see how the club face should be to not have the going right issue\u2026 Now a couple of things for setup with the clubs you mentioned. Most golfers put their front foot too far ahead of the ball and they get stuck there and can't turn. You want to setup your front toe and the club face in line 90 degrees to the target\u2026 again, the foot and club head are in line with each other. Now if it is on the grass, this is directly behind the ball\u2026 but if on a tee, leave a 1-2\u2033 gap \u2026this allows you to turn into the ball and pick it up on the up swing.\n\nYour thin issue is one thing and one reason always\u2026 FLIPPING. Which is to throw the club head with (usually) your back hand\u2026 just keep your hand quiet, passive and use large muscles to control your swing\u2026 Ross\n\n7 Responses to Students Q & A\n\nAfter a year of your swing ross, I was pushing back on a parallel toe line regardless of my spine angle but that first answer up top fixed everything, first time in my life in the 70s, all I had to do was push back on a line directly 90 degree to my spine angle, on your next video clarify that, I almost came to New Mexico to see you, thanks for your website and videos, I've tried every single golf swing imaginable and now I have one for rest of my life\n\nHi Greg\nYou are right! I learned this move many years ago from the book One Move to Better Golf, by Carl Lohren. With my body, using the front shoulder to push your arms\/club straight back on a parallel toe line, DOES WIND THE SHOULDERS AROUND THE SPINE. I later learned some golfers interpret this as pushing the front shoulder down (not good), as opposed to straight back under their chin. I DO WANT TO CLARIFY THIS ! Here is more\u2026"}

{"text":"A DISCUSSION ON BETTER UNDERSTANDING C.O.R.\n\nC.O.R. is easier to understand with a few additional examples and a little deeper explanation. First, recognize that when two objects collide there are 3 basic conditions of impact that exist. There are perfectly elastic collisions, perfectly inelastic collisions and everything else in-between.\n\nAn almost perfectly elastic collision is best demonstrated by two ivory que balls. When they collide, no or very little mechanical energy is dissipated so the speed-in of one ball is equal to the speed-out of the other ball after the collision.\nSo, the C.O.R. is 1.00 or 100%.\n\nA perfectly inelastic collision is best demonstrated by using two balls of putty, let's say the size of golf balls. When one ball of putty impacts the other ball of putty, they both stick together, so the speed-out of the second ball of putty is 0. So, the C.O.R. is 0 or 0%.\n\nYou will rarely know the real loft of your driver even if you are reading the loft engraved on the driver head or if you are reading the loft and face angle specifications on a company's internet site.

{"text":"29, 2008\n\nStress-Free Thailand Golf Cuts Strokes!\n\nDid you ever notice that right after you or your mate has that first sip of Singha on the golf course in Thailand that drives fly longer and straighter? Why is this almost always the case? The simple answer is stress, or lack thereof.\n\nStress on the Thailand golf course is an insidious golf \"disease\". Tension starts in your hands and creeps into every muscle in your body. It breaks your golf swing and it strips it of power and accuracy. When tension gets into your address position, it generates mistakes like the dreaded pull hook (which is actually the same root cause as a high slice). Eliminate tension from your body and you eliminate strokes from your score when golfing in Thailand. That is why Singha works!\n\nOn the other hand have one too many, and this will not only relieve tension, but also leave you drunk, and if not worse, dehydrated. So what is the best stress-relief solution when golfing in Thailand?\n\nFocus on eliminating all bad thoughts (i.e. recalling a bad shot from memory, thinking about the out-of-bounds or water hazard down the side of the fairway, and lacking confidence in your shot making ability). Doing this produces a smoother, more rhythmic swing that allows you to drive the ball longer with much less effort. Here are three more suggestions for achieving a stress-free swing.\n\n1. Add to your pre-shot thought of feeling relaxed. Take deep 2 breadths with an inhale count of five and an exhale count of five. This prepares you for taking a lighter, softer grip.\n\n2. Make mini swings in slow motion. Concentrate on your rotation, with your hands and arms swinging freely and the club head moving through the impact zone. Make a conscious effort to relax your hands.\n\n3. Before walking into your address position recall your most solid shot and how great it felt when the ball left the club head.\n\nEliminating tension from your hands and body will help you drive the ball further, will add power to your swing, helps cut strokes from your Thailand golf game. Sounds too easy or corny? Try it and watch those drives fly!"}
{"text":"Many people under estimate the importance of a good putting action. Considering the amount of putts you have in a round of golf your putting should be the part of your game that you practice the most.\n\nWhere I see a lot of people going wrong is with their grip. As appose to using your normal grip for your putting try moving the putter more into the palms of your hand which will limit the wrist action in your putting stroke. This can improve your consistency.\n\nStart by placing both index fingers on either side of your putter grip, running parallel down the grip (picture 1). Overlap the rest of your fingers behind the grip just how you feel comfortable. From this position you have two options, you can slide your right hand down the grip for a more traditional right below left grip (picture 2) or swap them round for the left below right putting grip (picture 3). The most important thing is that your putter grip is in you palms and your palms face each other.Try locking your wrists in this position and control your putting stroke with a rocking motion with you shoulders.\n\nWith practice this should get you on your way to a more consistent putting stroke."}

{"text":"Why Scientists Love to Study Golf\n\nOne is that golfers stand in one place when they do their thing, and initiate the action on cue rather than react to an object or person coming at them, as in most other sports. Thus they can be wired to the hilt and every little motion and brain wave pondered.\n\nAmong the most interesting studies presented in Phoenix, by a Canadian professor of kinesiology named Joan Vickers, explained why the \"quiet eye\" technique, which she first reported 15 years ago, works so effectively. Using a helmet fitted out with an external camera and other peripherals, she was able to precisely track the eye movements of golfers as they putted. In the seconds before a stroke, duffers' eyes tend to dart around without purpose or function while elite players control their gaze. Vickers's research revealed how the neural processes associated with the quiet eye help the brain organize itself to make a good stroke while simultaneously overriding competing neural processes responsible for distractions and anxiety.\n\nNot all of the studies at the conference point to immediately practical benefits, but this one did. Vickers's advice is that when you've adopted your stance and are ready to putt, gaze calmly and steadily at the hole (or target spot) for about three counts, bring your eyes back to the ball in one count and fix your eyes on the back (or top) of the ball for two counts. Then make the stroke and continue to gaze at the ground, where the ball was, for at least one more count.\n\nIf there's a frontier in golf research, it's neuroscience. With the increasing availability of machines that can peer into brains as they function, there has been rapid progress in understanding the biological mechanisms by which people transform information, such as from a golf lesson, first into actions and ultimately into automatic motor skills that don't require conscious thought to enact.\n\nAnother reason golf appeals so deliciously to researchers is the availability of quality statistics, particularly the PGA Tour's ShotLink database. Since 2003 the Tour has recorded detailed information about every shot hit by every player in every PGA Tour round. \"It's harder to tease data out of team sports, because the action is so diffuse,\" said Mark Broadie, a finance professor at Columbia Business School. \"In golf it's one golfer, one ball, one shot. It's very clean.\" Since pro golfers are single-mindedly motivated toward one goal, winning tournaments by taking as few strokes as possible, studying such topics as their risk-reward strategies and competitive awareness have real-world implications in business and management, he said.\n\nBroadie and his co-researcher, Dick Rendleman of Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, are the ones who determined that the World Golf Rankings favor players who earn points primarily outside the PGA Tour. At their presentation in Phoenix, summarizing research for a paper to be finished soon, they compared the world ranking of the top 200 players to a ranking of those same players' skill levels calculated using a statistical model they also devised, which simultaneously takes into account players' adjusted tournament scores and the difficulty of the courses. In every two-year period going back to 2003, the bias was stark. \"For every given skill ranking, the official world golf ranking for PGA Tour players averaged 36 positions worse than for non-PGA Tour players,\" Rendleman said. At one point Pat Perez was ranked 95th in skill, according to their model, but 195th in the world rankings"}
{"text":"How To Golf\n\nBy: Ryan Mac\n\nBreak Studios Contributing Writer\n\nFor both business and pleasure purposes, it may be a good idea to learn how to golf. Many business relationships have been solidified with a nice afternoon on the links. Knowing how to golf may impress your boss, but at the end of the day you should also know enough to shank a couple of shots so that he comes out on top and goes home happy.\n\nGet the right equipment. While there are no rules for how many clubs you can have in a friendly round of golf, its always good to be well informed on how to properly golf. According to USGA rules, a PGA professional is allowed to carry 14 clubs in their bag. This typically equates to carrying a driver, 3-wood, 5-wood (or escape wood of some kind), 3 through 9 iron, pitching wedge, sand wedge, a loft wedge and a putter.\n\nHit the driving range. Take your entire set of clubs to the driving range and hit ten balls with each club. Average the distance of the ten shots for each club. This will give you a good idea of what club you will need for each shot when you are on the course with the boss. Something as simple as course management can convince him you know how to golf.\n\nTake lessons from a pro. Even the best golfers in the world have a swing coach. If you find there is an aspect in your golf game that needs improvement, a lesson with your local club pro can help you learn how to get over the hitch in your game.\n\nLearn the rules. Golf has a large number of rules to answer your questions in any situation on the golf course. If it is your first time golfing, consider carrying a USGA rules handbook (these are usually pocket sized) to reference in different situations, at least until you are comfortable on the course.\n\nStudy yardage markers. Studying yardage at the course you are playing can come in handy. Knowing how to golf is more than just hitting shots, it's knowing how to interact with other players on the golf course.\n\nEtiquette is important. Countless unspoken rules exist on the golf course. Learning how to golf is not only about hitting the golf ball, but also how to interact with other players. The only way to get to know and understand them all is by playing with others and learning. Some of the more common forms of etiquette on the golf course include: not talking in another players backswing, helping your playing partner find his ball if he's having a difficult time, and not stepping in a golfers \"line\" on the putting surface prior to his putt.\n\nPut it all together. At the end of the day playing golf is about your swing and knowing course information, but it is also quite a bit mental. Have you ever tried actively thinking about something else in the middle of your swing? It doesn't matter if you know how to golf extremely well at that point, you are most likely not going to hit a great shot. Putting it all together on the course includes analyzing the shot before you address the ball, choosing the right club for your situation and most importantly, pretending you didn't see your boss kick his ball from the rough out onto the fairway."}

{"text":"No belly ban evidence, says Ernie\n\nWith a decision on the future of anchored putters imminent, Ernie Els says there is not enough evidence to support ridding his belly putter.\n\nThe USGA and R&A allowed for a 90-day comment period when revealing its new proposal at the end of 2012 to outlaw a stroke in which the putter is anchored to the body.\n\nAlthough the new proposal would not become effective until 2016, the reigning Open champion is hoping the authorities have a change of heart by letting players continue anchoring putters to their body.\n\n\"Hopefully they don't ban it,\" said Els, who become the third winner in the last five majors to use a belly putter.\n\n\"There's no data that really conforms that they have to ban it. If there were 90% of the guys using it, or if the guys using it were top of the putting stats, guys making more putts from 20-feet, more putts from 4-feet\u2026 Give me something to go by to really make me believe that you have to ban it.\n\n\"I can't see them having a really great way of explaining to me why they would want to ban it.\"\n\nEls believes etching his name on the Claret Jug for a second time in a decade was a huge influence on the proposed rule, occurring just several weeks after Webb Simpson used the fire in his belly to clinch maiden major glory at the US Open.\n\n\"Before Webb won, I saw a quote from [USGA executive director] Mike Davis saying they don't see the great benefit, that they don't see that there's any importance of banning the putter,\" he added.\n\n\"And then Webb wins, and I win, and then the next thing is they want to ban it. So in all honesty, I'm not too sure what their whole reason is behind this whole thing.\n\n\"There's a handful of guys using it. It's helped some careers. Some guys cannot putt another way, so there's some stuff that you have to follow through.\"\n\nEls is correct. When Mike Davis was appointed executive director in April 2011, he told the Golf Channel that the USGA 'don't see this as a big trend'.\n\n\"It's not as if all the junior golfers out there are doing this,\" he said. \"No one's even won a major using of these things anchored to themselves. So we don't see this as something that is really detrimental to the game.\"\n\nIf some guys can't putt any other way then they should not be on tour. It's like saying a tennis player has a great serve but can't return shots,would he be on tour? Probably not. They really missed a trick here,it should have been banned years ago,it's leagalised cheating of the highest order,you need to be able to control your nerves that's part of the game.\n\nHow many people on here actually use a belly putter or broom handle putter? I just wonder how 'easy' it actually makes putting or if it is just another tool in the same way an adjustable driver or graphite shafted iron is. Manufacturers are constantly making new items from balls to GPS devices in order to improve a golfer's game, but you don't see everyone playing off scratch.\n\nI see a lot of compelling arguments for banning it, but there are also several good points why there should not be a ban.\n\nBeen some rumour recently that alot of the players (Woods \/ Stricker) are less bothered than they used to be and that even if the rule goes through the PGA Tour may allow a local rule permitting the putters.\n\nThat would have the ludicrous consequence of european tour players being banned from using them, US Open and Open CHampionship banning them but the PGA events (Including the PGA and Masters) allowing them....\n\nI'm quite up for banning them, but i'd much rather keep the same rules for every event!\n\nIt definitely makes putting easier, primarily for people who struggle with a yippy putting stroke. I have a quote somewhere from Colin Montgomerie from years ago who said he thought that long putters should be banned, but while they were legal, people who struggled with putting should give it a go.\n\nI think you don't see many of them among amateur golfers because a) like anything else you have to practice with them to make them work (they are not a magic wand quick fix) and b) they make you look like a nob and the stick you'd get from fellow players is probably a major deterrent, c) they are (relatively) expensive, and d) they are damned awkward if you haven't got a caddie to sort it all out for you.\n\nBut as I've said before, they were a non issue when only a few players on the senior tour were using them to preserve some sort of career. Now that younger players are using them, people are winning majors with them, and some pros have never used anything else - you combine all that with the fact that very small margins in terms of putting can make significant differences in terms of results and therefore money, and if they are not checked now I think there is a danger more and more pros will feel compelled to use them to remain competitive.\n\nSimilarly though does an insert in the putter face not make it easier? Weighting\/shaping of putter heads to promote a better swing not make it easier? Should we all just go back to using waist high golden goose putters??\n\nMonty lost some majors on the basis of a couple of putts, should he not have used a long putter if it was that easy and while it was legal? Pretty sure that would have left a legacy of a Major winner rather than slightly embittered man never to win one.\n\nAbout an amateur not wanting to use in case of a ribbing from his friends, surely the same would apply to some of the fugly GI irons recently (see the GM test), but if people get results they will use them. Many people do give into vanity, but there are plenty who don't. Surely the amount of practice should be directly correlated to the amount you should practice with any other putter as well.\n\nAlso people have won majors with these putters recently, but they have been about for years. Just because someone is winning doesn't mean you should ban it. Dustin Johnson won his first tournament using the R1 this year, shall we ban it?\n\nI honestly don't have a strong opinion either way as if it is banned it makes no difference to me, but I just wonder how much of this is a knee jerk reaction to some people's comments who, as CBE suggests, have cooled their interest in the subject.\n\nStephen D - your points are well made but irrelevant in the most part.\n\nThis isn't a debate about technology. The rule making bodies have reacted to these before, by banning hot faced drivers or changing the rules on grooves - not always in a timely fashion, but still they do legislate when they feel it necessary.\n\nThis debate is about making a stroke. Anchoring a putter so that it can be moved more consistently in a single plane is what these long putters are all about. And that's potentially removing an important facet of skill from the game, the ability to control the clubface, especially when under pressure situations when poor or inconsistent putters become more erratic.\n\nPaul - I agree that the anchoring is a change in the stroke, but things like weighting of clubs is fundamentally changing the control of a players stroke also.\n\nTake for example Rory: after finding he could not control the stroke of his new Nike putter he added 6 grams to the weight, hence he fundamentally changed that putter to suit his stroke. This means in pressure situations the stroke of the putter is (perhaps) more down to the club than Rory's ability to control it.\n\nOther things like drivers with adjustable weights etc. are taking a players stroke and using club head technology in order to correct a flaw in it.\n\nI accept the above is pretty extreme, but the concept is true. Rory still has to swing the putter whatever the weight in the same way that, say, Keegan Bradley has to swing the putter even if it is anchored.\n\nUnless there is conclusive proof that the anchoring does give an overall advantage, i.e. have all players on the tour use it and find out their stats before\/after, then many could just argue that it is a development in technology as with many other things.\n\nyou are arguing esoterics which might be of academic interest but are not relevant to this point. Changing the characteristics of a club, within the rules, by weighting or changing shafts (eg custom fitting) is not a problem. At the end of the day whether a club is heavier, lighter, has a draw or fade bias, is a matter of personal choice, you still have to swing it, control it, and make it hit the ball towards or into the hole.\n\nThe whole point of the anchored putter is to change the whole way you putt to make it a more two dimensional stroke, removing one of the variables. Remember no-one is saying you can no longer putt with a belly putter, just that you cannot anchor it to your body because that gives you an advantage.\n\nIt's not rocket science Scott, Singh, Els etc have all moved to the long putter after they struggled with a normal length putter, and have had conspicuous success with the switch. Couples the same (though i think he has doen so because of his back). Their claim that \"not everyone is doing it so it's not a problem\" is very disingenuous.\n\nErnie has had a short putter in his bag since the announcement was made near the end of last year.\n\nWhen asked \"what are you going to do about the anchoring ruling?\", he simply pointed to his bag and said \"use the short putter\". He also commented on feeling uneasy about the public perception that those who win with a long putter are \"cheating\".\n\nBut by weighting it could be argued that you are nullifying the negative impact of the third variable to the point that the swing has the characteristics of a 2 dimensional swing. Thus weighting or custom fitting could be said to act in a similar manner as anchoring and, as you point out, even with the belly putter \"you still have to swing it, control it, and make it hit the ball towards or into the hole.\"\n\nThe players mentioned above were all successful in their own right before they moved to the belly putter, so could the change to that club also be seen as a compliment to other changes they perhaps made at that time: new coach, new swing, illegal drugs (allegedly).\n\nI realise this will go on and on as, in my opinion, there are clear arguments for and against. I do wonder though that until it is proven to have a beneficial impact, not hypothesis or a couple of pros opinions, then how can it be banned rather than be seen as part of the evolution of golf?\n\nNice post, but the bottom line is that the pros mentioned have only gone the the long\/anchored putter as a result of their problems in putting normally.\n\nAs simplistic and raw as it is, I am a firm believer that the act of swinging a golf club to hit a golf ball must be done without anchoring the end of the club to the body in order to control the movement of that club.\n\nI agree Lou, if the anchoring took place with any other club and there appeared to be an advantage, then the powers that be would ban it. Ye Gods, poor old Sam Snead's method of side putting was banned because he was so successful with it!\n\nMy younger brother switched to a belly putter recently and putts with much more composure than previously. He went to it to take his wrists completely out of the equation and it's worked. He's had a few jabs thrown his way verbally for making the switch, but it's worked out well for him and he's gone from serious complications on the green that ruined his enjoyment of the game to sinking the odd putt and walking away with a smile.\n\nIn competitive play, it does seem unfair that someone who previously you could rely on to miss putts now stands a fair chance of making them more often.\n\nI think there will always be a mixture of putting strokes in the same way there is a mixture of putters, grips, shafts, weighting and everything else. Is it wrong that guys stick a putter in their stomach or rest it on their chin? It seems odd that the Driver, which is used but 13-14 times (less on some courses) has a length limit, whilst the putter can reach somebody's face.\n\nI'm on the fence with this, but it's interesting to read people's thoughts."}
{"text":"Custom made putter\n\nGeoff:\nYou recommend a center-shafted putter that is face-balanced, shorter in length with good head weight. I would like to try a shorter putter. According to what I calculated I come up with a 29 inch putter with a 73.5 degree lie angle. At those figures, what head weight would you recommend? Or do you recommend using say a 32 inch putter and choking down on the grip. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.\n\nGolfer Postures in Putter Fitting Often Too Perfect\n\nFebruary 24 2006, 8:49 AM\n\nDear Bob,\n\nI recommend trying the 32\" putter first. Lots of golfers in a fitting situation try to get a little \"perfect\" and then when they actually play, their setup is slightly taller and more comfortable than it was in the fitting session. So, since you can only cut \"down\" and never cut back \"up\", try the 32\" putter first -- you may want the adjustability.\n\nAs far as head weight, it really depends on the typical greens you play (Stimp 9?), your body shape and mass (arms and hands especially), and your specific stroke dynamics, as the putter weight overall and in the putter head needs to be tuned to the golfer, his greens, and his stroke. But in general, slightly heavier than usual is what I recommend, mostly because heavier is slower, and slower is almost always what golfers need in their strokes. Something around 340-375 grams is probably pretty good. In terms of swingweight, a shorter putter makes the same putter head mass result in a lighter swingweight (less clubhead awareness). That's not really a big deal in my teaching, as a \"nothing changing\" feel in the hands is the ideal with a smooth tempo. If you need to feel a little \"lag\" of the putter head in the forward stroke inside your hands, a lighter swingweight tends to speed up your stroke, while a heavier swingweight keeps you more relaxed. You'll just have to experiment a bit (with lead tape) and see what feels right for you. It's a very subtle feeling of \"lag\" you should want, if you want any such feeling at all."}

{"text":"Ten Great Golf Gambling Games\n\nRELATED LINKS\n\n7. BOUNCE BACK\n\nPERFECT FOR: Shaking off bad holes\n\nDESCRIPTION: Among the many side bets, this one is my favorite because it rewards players who don't give up. Essentially, any time a player follows up a double bogey or worse with a par or better on the next hole, they win a point (dollar value determined in advance by your group). Any time a player makes back-to-back double bogeys or worse, they lose a point.\n\n8. LET IT RIDE\n\nPERFECT FOR: Hardcore gamblers\n\nDESCRIPTION: Players earn points for making a bogey or better on a hole. A typical point distribution would be 5 for a bogey, 15 for a par, 30 for a birdie and 60 for an eagle (better groups can start with par as the first point-eligible score). After earning points on a hole, the player has the option of banking the amount or \"letting it ride,\" meaning the point total can still grow on subsequent holes. The point totals double for every hole that they aren't banked. So a bogey on a second consecutive hole would now be worth 10 and a par would be worth 30 and so on. However, if a player elects to let his or her points ride and a double bogey or worse is made, the player's total points not banked goes back to zero. Banked points can't be taken away and are credited at the end of the round. The players with the highest point totals are paid a predetermined amount for every point they have earned in relation to the other players. This is a great game for golfers who are streaky and also for golfers who love to gamble. Think about it: If you make back-to-back birdies without banking, you'll have earned the equivalent of making 18 bogeys earned at 5 points each.\n\n9. PICK-UP STICKS (BAG RAID)\n\nPERFECT FOR: Twosomes or foursomes looking to break up the monotony of their usual games.\n\nDESCRIPTION: This is a standard match-play competition with a little twist. When a golfer or team wins a hole, they \"remove\" a club from the opponent or opponents' bags. That means the other team can't use that club for the rest of the round. This continues until the match is decided. A variation of this game allows a team to reinstall clubs to their set if someone on the team makes net birdie or better to win a hole. Things can get really creative and shotmaking becomes a bigger part of the round when certain clubs are eliminated. Obviously, the putter should be first to go.\n\n10. TROUBLE\n\nPERFECT FOR: Improving shot selection and course strategy\n\nDESCRIPTION: Instead of rewarding players for good play, golfers are given points for their mistakes. The players with the lowest point totals are paid a predetermined amount for every point less they have in relation to the other competitors. This can be a side-bet game or the group's main wager. A common point allocation: Hitting a ball in a bunker (1); Hitting into the water (2). Hitting out-of-bounds (3). Three-putting (1). Four-putting (4). Duffing a tee shot (1). Points can also be subtracted for stellar play such as making birdies, holing long putts or stiffing shots from off the green, etc. This is a great game to learn course management and how to stop taking unnecessary risks."}

Working on this skill will have the most impact on bettering your game. To improve your golf swing, use the following tips.\n\nYou want to make sure that your swing is smooth. Swinging violently at the ball is the usual approach of beginners. They approach their swing as having multiple steps. Thinking of a single musical motion can help you improve your golf swing. The backswing is the first part of the measure; the fore swing is the second part, the follow through the third. If you only use raw strength for your shots, they will go wild and you will have no control or accuracy. A smooth, lazy approach is the first step to improving your swing.\n\nMany beginners swing at the ball. The truth is that, if you want to improve your golf swing, you need to swing through the ball. Your follow through is just as important as the rest of your backswing and down swing. Here is how you practice this skill.\n\nYou'll need to set up two tees and then put your ball on the first one. You should place the two tees about eight inches apart. Once the tees are set up, practicing hitting the second tee after hitting the ball. By practicing, you will learn to hit the ball and make it over the second tee with a single swing.\n\nYour right hand needs to now be in the hitchhiker position for backswings. That is to say when your hands are at waist height you should see your thumb pointed toward the stars if you are in the right position. The left hand needs to be in a handshake position during backswing. Straight out with the palm to the right. Doing these things will improve your swing and again your overall game clear through the follow through.\n\nGolf is great pastime activity. People of all ages can enjoy golf. Small children can have fun golfing. Everybody needs to practice their golf swing to perfect it. Developing a good golf swing will take time.\n\nYou will improve your overall golf game as you use these tips to improve your golf swing.

If you want to improve your golf swing, it helps to think of the entire swing as a single musical motion. The first beats would be the back swing; the middle section is your fore swing, and the final notes are the follow through. Violent, raw strength alone will lead to no accuracy and wild shots. A smooth and lazy approach will help you improve your swing.\n\nYour left knee should be out toward your target during your backswing. You should feel your muscle tension as well as a good sense of stability in both knees. Doing this gets you into a proper stance and reduces the body turn many golfers experience during follow through. The most practical way to practice this is to imagine or really use a basketball between your knees while you swing. You will be more apt to point your knee in the target direction and feel the tension and strength yu will need to draw from.\n\nOk, wind again\u2026 just swing easier, ok? If you try to swing too hard when it is windy out you will sacrifice accuracy and trajectory. \"Swing easy into the breezy\" is the battle cry of Greg Norman \u2013 pro golfer extraordinaire. It seems common sensical that when you're hitting into the wind, well\u2026 just hit it harder. It's all about technique and aerodynamics, and they rule the day \u2013 not brute force. When you swing easier, you'll find that your control is much better. Wind can feel good, sure, but don't let it take you down the wrong path.\n\nGolf is a great game. People of all ages can enjoy golf. Small children can have fun golfing. Everybody has to work on their golf swing. It takes time to develop a good golf swing.\n\nThe good news is there are lots of things you can do to improve your golf swing and your overall game.

Gold is a favorite past time for many all over the world. Despite the fact that it originated in the UK, golf is popular in most if not all countries. This is a sport played by all ages. If you like golfing you are probably constantly looking for ways to improve your swing. Even the most seasoned professional players look to find ways to make their swings better. In this article we will talk about some of the best methods for improving golf swings.\n\nIt is patently untrue that you must hit harder when swinging into the wind. One result of hitting hard into the wind is you'll cause spin and the ball will lift higher. This extra height and spin makes it harder for you to control the ball's trajectory and its accuracy will be reduced. Instead, move the ball backwards into your stance by a few inches. Then in addition to that adjustment, you want to place your hands a bit forward. Finally, your choice of club; use one that is longer than that which you would normally be using. Do not hit the ball harder, rather hit it just as you would without the wind. When you do this, just watch and see how much more control you have plus better accuracy. When you hit the ball, you want to hit it down and through. You'll have to follow through to get the club to lift, and that will make the ball lift. The classic mistake that results in top hitting and missed balls is by trying to produce an upswing thinking that will make the ball rise. That is not how it works \u2013 never. Hitting with the fabled upswing can produce a hit that rises, but there's no power and it won't go far\u2026 kinda sucks, really. Also, you risk one of those funny shots when all you get is straight up and down trajectories and who wants that?\n\nFor an effective backswing your right hand should be in the hitchhiker positoin. This simply means that your right thumb should be pointed up as if to be hitching a ride when you look back at your hands at waist height. The left hand needs to be in a handshake position during backswing. Straight out with the palm to the right. This will help you improve your golf swing from the backswing all the way through your follow through.\n\nImproving your golf swing is really nothing more than practicing good posture and core balance. These easy techniques help ensure maximum efficiency on the ball when contact is made. Your ball will fly farther and your accuracy will be better. There are alot of people who believe improving your golf swing is hard. This however is a misconception it really only takes alot of practice. Keep dilligently practicing and working hard and you will soon see the fruits of your labor.\n\nCheck out The Golf Swing Secret if you are serious about improving your swing.

{"text":"In last month's issue we explained muscular loading. This month we are going to explain the most important foundation of the kinetic link which initiates muscular loading: Ground Forces.\n\nNo single link in the process of creating clubhead speed is considered more important than any other; however, your swing is only as strong as your \"weakest link\". During the golf swing, the transfer of energy and power from the lower body to the upper body is certainly the most pivotal, and thus the most common \"weakest link\".\n\nThe role of the trunk musculature in the golf swing is the same as the role of a crank shaft in an automobile. Just like the crankshaft turns horsepower created at the drive wheels, the trunk musculature turns energy created by the lower body into power at the upper body. This in turn creates clubhead speed. With maximum energy transfer comes maximum power.\n\nJust like a house, a solid golf swing must be built on a solid foundation. That foundation is lower body mechanics or ground forces. The movement of the lower body is composed of both Linear components and rotational components. It is this proper interaction between the two that creates a stable basis for the rest of the swing.\n\nYour feet generate forces when they push against the ground. These forces act to propel your body and create motion. There are two kinds of forces that are important to the golf swing: Normal and Shear forces. Normal forces are used to define the linear component of the swing. Shear forces are used to define rotational forces of the swing.\n\nThe Linear Component\n\nNormal force is applied by the feet downward or perpendicular to the ground (see Figure A). Weight is transferred to the back foot during the backswing and to the front foot during the downswing. When weight is shifted to one foot, the amount of normal force applied by that foot increases, while the normal force applied by the other foot decreases. This action defines the linear component of movement. The linear component of the lower body during the swing is very important, because from this movement that the body develops momentum and enhances the rotational speed and power the hips.\n\nShearing Forces\n\nRotational Forces\n\nShear force is applied by the feet along the surface or parallel to the ground (See Figure B). Throughout the swing, shear forces are being applied by both feet. These shear forces create torque that turn the hips around the axis of the trunk. This defines the rotational component of the lower body movement. The rotational component provides the basis for power during the golf swing and can be the most directly related to ultimate clubhead speed.\n\nFaults in Energy Transfer\n\nThe most two common breakdowns in transferring energy from the lower body to the upper body originate with the hip segment.\n\nThe first of these is called sliding hips, which occurs when the hips move laterally to the left without rotating. No rotational speed is created. Muscles aren't properly loaded and there is diminished energy created to be passed to the upper body. In many cases, sliding hips also indicates an excessive spine tilt. When the spine tilts, muscles that work to rotate segments around the axis of the spine become asymmetrical in that one shortens and the other side lengthens. This asymmetry cause inefficient generation of power or speed and can cause increased stress on the back and joints, resulting in back injuries.\n\nThe second is called \"spinning hips\" which occurs when the golfer forces the hip segment through the swing too quickly. This creates excusive lag between the lower body and the upper body. The upper body typically never catches up. The trunk musculature is never used to pass energy created by the hip segment rotation to the shoulder segment which means lost power and lower club head speed.\n\nBy building a solid foundation from the ground up, and then working on the efficient transfer of energy from the lower body towards the upper body, you can effectively increase power, distance and accuracy throughout your game.\n\nScott Beaumont is from ZenoLink. ZenoLink is a diagnostic tool that used 3D motion analysis for coaches to be able to measure their athlete's biomechanical breakdowns in their golf swing. By measuring hip speed, arm speed, shoulder speed, club release speed and club linear speed, ZenoLink creates separate analyses of kinetic linking, stability, muscular loading and club dynamics; helping a coach or instructor identify functional movement discrepancies that rob the player of power, and to design a personalized Progressive Skills Training program that addresses problem areas"}

{"text":"Monthly Archives: January 2012\n\nIn the New Year many of us decide to start a new hobby or take up a new sport. Golfing is a great sport to learn to play since it can be both an individual and a group sport, and it is suitable for people of all ages and genders. The golf course is also where some companies do business, so being able to join your boss and client on the golf course could even boost your career.\n\nGolf is a game which suits many personalities. It can be thought of as an individual sport since you rely on yourself to win, it all comes down to your own skills and technique. On the other hand, golf can also be played in pairs and you need a group of people for a tournament so there is some element of team spirit involved.\n\nIf you've ever watched golf you will have seen many professional players lose their cool on the golf range. It can get pretty tense and competitive out there, so if you are taking up Golf then make sure you read all the tips and advice below to make sure you develop your game and skills successfully.\n\nFirstly, Golf is a fairly easy sport to take up. There are normally lots of golf ranges and clubs around cities so you won't struggle to find somewhere to practice.\n\nDon't buy a brand new set of clubs. There are lots of different clubs to suit different playing styles so it is a mistake to spend a lot of money on a brand new set before you develop your game, especially since a full set can be very expensive. Instead you can hire clubs from golf courses and driving ranges. Alternatively you could buy a half set. This generally comprises five irons and perhaps two woods and a putter. Usually the irons are the odd numbers 3,5,7,9 and a wedge. The best club to start off with is the shortest iron (nine iron) or a wedge.Firstly, Golf is a fairly easy sport to take up. There are normally lots of golf ranges and clubs around cities so you won't struggle to find somewhere to practice.\n\nStart out at the driving range. The golf course is no place for beginners. Here you can practice your shot until you have more control of the ball and can hit a target. Make sure you practice in all weather, since you can't guarantee what the weather will be like during a game of golf. You need to be able to react to wind and rain and adapt your game.\n\nYou will also be able to access lessons from the professionals at the driving range. It is a good idea to get a minimum of 5 lessons, that way you will get a hang of the basics faster and can be assured you have the correct grip on the club.\n\nThe first golf course you play on should be a 9 whole course, before you progress to an 18 whole course. Once you have reached this stage practice and play with other experienced players to pick up the rules and etiquette of golf.\n\nThink about arranging golfing trips. There are lots of excellent golfing hotels in the UK with their own golf course. Check out hotels in Chester with resident pros on hand if you want some tips and access to several magnificent courses.\n\nLastly try watching the pros playing golf tournaments on television. This will help you develop your game, as stance and posture are two of the most important skills in golf.\n\nLet us know how you get on developing your game and if there are any other top tips you want to share!\n\nI enjoyed performing at my first Burns Supper of the season last night. I've been asked to sing and play at four this year. Last night's immortal memory was very interesting and quoted William Wordsworth from his poem \"At the Grave of Burns 1803\"\n\n\"I mourned with thousands, but as one\nMore deeply grieved, for He was gone\nWhose light I hailed when first it shone,\n\nIt's been a long time since I drank my calories - in university I gave up soda (Diet, actually) after I found it ineffective at keeping me up studying for engineering finals. Since then, I've probably had soda once or twice a month, if that.\n\nI know fruit juice, which I love dearly, is to be avoided and I do very well - only fresh-squeezed orange juice when I feel the twinges of a sore throat, and cranberry or apple only on special occasions (and when I can actually find it here in Italy).\n\nYour wedding day is on of the most important days of your life so you want to feel at your best. So getting your look right is vital so that you feel beautiful.\n\n'Springtime flutter' look via Glitzy Secrets\n\nThe main elements you need to consider are: The Dress, Your Hair, Your Accessories and Your Make-up. But before we think about all of that, you need to decide what your theme is as this will make your look much easier to pull together.\n\nAre you going for an elegant, sophisticated wedding or a spring-time butterfly theme (like the image shown). Your chosen wedding theme will help you to decide all the elements in your wedding.\n\nThe Dress\n\nThe dress is the first part of your 'look' you should organise and you should really start looking now! You need to be looking to buy, or at least start visiting shops about 18 months before the wedding in order to get it ordered and to have enough time to get it fitted etc.\n\nHave a look at wedding magazines and online websites and work out what you do and don't like. Although, you are highly likely to change all of that when you actually try them on- it's all part of the process! Have a look at articles like this one from Confetti which explains what you need to think about when choosing your dress. You need to think about your body type and what colour you want your dress depending on your skin colour. Tell the shop assistant what your wedding theme is, the designers you like and what you want to avoid. Once you have found 'the one', sort out your shoes- think about height relative to your fiance! Then you can start thinking about your hair.\n\nhalf up half down via you and your wedding\n\nYour Hair\n\nWhen it comes to thinking about your hair, you need to let your stylist know what your dress is like. There are lots of very different hair styles you can look into and it depends on your dress. For example if you have a low backed dress, it is better to have your hair longer to make the most of the look whereas if you have a high-backed dress you should choose an up-do. Rich Harvey, make-up artist recommends the half up and half down look (like the image across) to:\n\n\"soften the face and add glamour from height and movement\"\n\nYour Accessories\n\nWhat really makes your look extra special is the accessories you put with it. Think about some wedding hair accessories such as the beautiful Butterfly of Enchantment headpiece in the first picture. A statement piece like this can really make your look unique and memorable. Remember and chose some complimentary jewellery pieces, think along the same theme and colour but if you are having a statement hair piece, make your jewellery more simple.\n\nYour Make-Up\n\nThe final part of your look is your make-up. You don't want to go over the top and change your look too much. As Rich Harvey says:\n\n\"I believe, on your wedding day, you should look like a very polished version of the 'normal' you. It's definitely not a time to experiment with fads and styles!\"\n\nDon't try something crazy new, if you haven't before as you won't know how it will be received. Splash out and buy yourself some really good quality make-up and try it out a few times before your wedding day so you can get used to using it. If you are getting a make-up artist, then show them what your 'normal' look is and ask how they can make it a bit more special.\n\nSo I hope that this has helped you decide what you theme you are going for and what elements make up your wedding 'look'."}

There are 52 cards, each having a different situation and corresponding challenge. Too often you lose focus when practicing, which leads to bad habits and makes practice time less productive. Each Golf Challenge Card\u2122 presents a shot that you could face on the course and then puts a little pressure on you to try and achieve a certain goal. This type of practice simulates how you feel on the course, which helps you to be more effective when it counts.\n\nGolf Challenge Cards\u2122 can be used as you practice on your own or play a game with others.\nPracticing On Your Own: Start by shuffling the deck (part of the fun is in not knowing what your challenge might be). Flip over the top card to reveal your challenge. If you haven't done so, now is the time to decide which level you should tackle. Try to pick a level that matches your skill, yet still presents a challenge. Here is a general guide for choosing an appropriate level:\n\nIn some cases there may be a little setup time required. Having a small tape measure and tees handy can be helpful. After getting set up then you are ready to take on the challenge. Try to stick with it until the card has been completed.\n\nPracticing With Others: The Golf Challenge Cards\u2122 Game.\n\n2 to 4 players (Takes 60 minutes to play)\n\nSetting up the game\n\nStart by giving the deck a good shuffle. Take the top 4 cards, look at the and complete any necessary setup work for each card.\n\nPlaying the Game\n1. Determine each player's base level. The base level is the level a player must achieve to get any points for that card. Pick levels that are appropriate for each player's skill level.\n2. Each player starts with 1 of the 4 Golf Challenge Cards\u2122 that was drawn. Each player has 12 minutes to try to complete their card at their designated level. If completed before the time runs out the player may try to achieve the next level up, which will result in extra points.\n3. After time expires move to the next card and reset the timer. Continue until every player has tried all 4 challenges.\n\nCalculating Scores\n\nFor each card you completed at your assigned level you get the value of the card. Jacks, Queens, Kings and Aces are all worth 11 points. Add 3 points if you were able to also accomplish the next higher level. For example, if you completed the King of spades, the 4 of diamonds and finished the 7 of hearts at the next level, but failed to finish the Jack of diamonds, then you would get 11+4+10 for a total of 25 points. The player with the most points wins. In case of a tie, draw one card from the deck; the player to complete this new challenge first wins. Download this Scorecard for team play"}

{"text":"Tips for performing on the course under pressure\n\nThe United States spent the first two days of the 2012 Ryder Cup coasting in the fourball and foursome matches to claim a 10-6 lead going into the final day.\n\nBut Europe staged a miraculous rally Sunday to win 14\u00bd to 13\u00bd, and the end result is more evidence of just how special the Ryder Cup is.\n\nThe pressure the Americans faced on the back 9 during the Sunday singles matches had to be overwhelming.\n\nOn the other side, the Europeans had a different kind of pressure to deal with, as they knew what they had to do and they did it. They quickly turned the tables on the Americans and put the pressure squarely on their shoulders coming down the stretch.\n\nSee the shot you want to hit, tell yourself you can do it, and then execute.\n\n\u2022\nTyrus York\n\nMost of us will never know the pressure Team USA felt Sunday. But if you've played golf at any level competitively, or even had the opportunity to beat your playing partner for the first time, then you know what pressure feels like on the golf course.\n\nSo how can you stay in control of your game when the heat is on?\n\nFollow these tips to perform well under pressure:\n\n\u2022 Breathe: You would be amazed at how easy it is to forget to breathe when you start feeling anxious on the course. Short, shallow breaths are nearly as bad as this prevents the proper amount of oxygen from getting into your body. Your brain senses the lack of oxygen and next thing you know you're freaking out before playing a shot. If you start feeling anxious, take a few slow, deep breathes to completely fill your lungs with air. Hold it in for a few extra seconds then exhale. This will calm your nerves and allow you to perform.\n\n\u2022 Prepare properly with quality practice: Just like when you take a test, if you study properly you'll probably do well. Golf is no different. If you're faced with a downhill, left-to-right, must-make putt on the 18th green to win a tournament and you've practiced that same putt over and over, how much easier do you think it will be?\n\n\u2022 Use nervous energy to your advantage: You will get nervous when the pressure is on, but learning how to use that nervous energy to narrow your focus is what can separate you from your opponents. The simplest way to do this is to focus solely on your desired outcome. See the shot you want to hit, tell yourself you can do it, and then execute. If negative thoughts creep in your mind, start over. Practice thinking properly by eliminating negative thoughts and you will welcome playing under pressure."}

{"text":"Recent Posts by Zenstb\n\nAsk yourself this question, how would your dad feel putting the people he loves through this emotional pain? And what would he do to stop you guys from hurting?\n\nI'll never forget the fear and emotional pain I could see in my families eyes Peg , as they seen me on my death bed twice. I wish I could have ended their emotional pain. That ripped my heart out how much they were hurting. I said to my family and have a will in place, that if I'm ever on life support please let me go, not for me, for my family, I would have hurt them enough and not prolong the pain any further.\n\nPeg I may have been in shit loads of pain etc although from eyes my family were doing it harder than me, I accepted the cards that were dealt they couldn't. Being on both sides of the fence Peg the emotional pain the family goes through is greater.( I experienced both sides).\n\nThis would increase the difference between good shots and bad shots. Because obviously when you are kinking and bending you are doing it at different amounts every time.\n\nSo when you strengthen your core and train and turn around your spine better your shots would surely be more consistent because your turn is more consistent.\n\nHope that all makes sense.\n\nMaxxon, You got it :) the better we turn around the axis of spine the more consistent we become and our swing plane with improve. The arms work around our spine will improve how we rotate around the axis of our spine our arms will move better around our spine. Our swing plane will improve.\n\nThe lateral bending there is some many factors that effect lateral bending. However with tour players have you noticed that their iron swing their movements are better than their driver? Why is that?\n\nThe reason is Speed, The average tour player swings a PW at 82mph. With their driver the average tour player swings at 113 mph. The driver they swing 31mph faster. Their is great force exerted on the body and the body is moving at higher speeds as well. What we need to understand is with their irons just say as an example they only right lateral bend say 5 degrees at start of the down swing.\n\nWith a wedge say their upper body is moving at 550 degrees per second. At impact they may only right lateral bend say to 10 to 15 degrees at impact.\n\nWith a driver say their upper body moves at 800 degrees per second again only right lateral bend 5 degrees at impact with the greater speed they will end up around 25 or more degrees of lateral bending.\n\nOk so if you have lateral bending. The faster you rotate, the faster you right lateral bend, the faster your spine kinks. Which means the spine kinks earlier in the down swing. The spine kinking earlier, the upper body slows down too early in the downswing and cause the arms accelerate too. The end result the arms fly off the body.\n\nYou can have great ground forces and start the downswing, feet, lower body than the upper body. However that spine kinks the upper body slows down early and the arms accelerate early and slow down early, so the club releases. Their sequence is good their coordination and contraction come into play. Or it could be just a Strength issue weak core, weak legs the list is endless.\n\nMate there is so many variable the list is really endless.\n\nWith tour players speed really comes into play they can have a break down in their coordination patterns and muscle contractions as well. Strength plays a massive roll with them and is why many of them hit the gym. Although they do specialized training for this. You wouldn't got to your everyday PT for this they are general fitness and not trained for sports specific training.\n\nTheir core contraction could be weak and need condition to contract hard to resist or handle to rotational speeds of the upper body. Again the list endless it's like asking how long is a piece of string. Golf or any rotational sport the same muscle groups are used , we commonly hear the word golf muscles, although there isn't such thing. We are all born the same, Tiger or whoever they conditioned their body move rotationally from young age. The key is to condition the body to move rotationally\n\nRegards the amounts of lateral bending changing what you will find it will be same amount happens every time for each particular club. Say a driver you create 20 degrees of lateral bending for that club you will produce this same amount of bending each time.\n\nI hope this all makes sense, the human body is complex, this above we have no hope knowing what is going on using 2D video, eye or still pictures. We need to measure the rotations of each body segment to know their sequence and what is crucial is the ability to measure what the muscles are doing.\n\nHow to train it their is functional movement specific training in the gym and for coordination, their is specific activity coordination training. Which is training the body to coordinate rotational movement. How ever it's crucial the training is specific to the activity. Although the training has to be custom built specific to that athlete to improve their break downs and improve their patterns.\n\nTour players are unbelievable athletes I think people nit pick at them too much with out any great understanding of the complexities attached. The further you hit the less room for error. A guy has his club face open 1\/2 degree with who hits it 200 meters he will hit the fairway. A guy who hits the ball up around 280m plus he's missed the fairway and most likely deep in the timber.\n\nThe longer you are the more accurate you have to be. The tops guys are truly thernominal athletes.\n\nHi every one I put together a video to explain what causes stalling and why tour players stall. I used a fellow iseeker as an example to explain stalling and moving forward to how we are improving this.\n\nIn the Zen thread or Cranbourne thread as a suggestion is to watch the other two videos to help you further understand stalling, I recommend watch the lower body mechanics. I know these video's are long winded although take the time to watch them and you start to understand the complexities of stalling and what causes tour player do it and why this break down occurs. I used 2D video to give you a visual as well However what the muscles were doing we used 3D technology and I will do another video in the future to explain muscular loading. Enjoy the video:) What causes stalling\n\nThis video is a continuation explaining Spine Stability, the break downs Smilesy had and the progressions of improvements with his Spine stability. In this video I also explain, what causes stalling and how this occurs regarding the upper body. Smilesy Spine Stability and Stalling\n\nIgnoramus I already explained what he does in my original post. I stand by it 1000%... All my students know exactly what I mean He doesnt drop his hands behind him at all.. His hands and Hogans hands and Sneads hands all come over the top of their backswing hand path. The club lays down behind its backswing path. Pronation and hold on aint the answer. That is a steer and not a three right hand sensation.\n\nBrad this is interesting comments about Sergio, the comments about he waits to accelerate his pivot post impact is interesting. Where did this information come from?\n\nIn 3D measurement from several companies Sergio is a float loader the clubs drops in behind him. As his upper body and arms are going back in his back swing his lower body just before transition change direction and start accelerating toward impact and reach top speed and slow down.\n\nAs soon the lower begin to decelerate or slower his upper body changes direction and start accelerating towards impact.\n\nAs soon as his upper body starts accelerating this causes him arm to quick change direction Float and his arms drop behind him. His Arms change direction the club float loads behind him drop into the slot.\n\nAs soon as his upper body reaches top speed they slow down and the arms then start accelerating into impact.\n\nHis lower body and upper body brace at impact \/ slow down. The arms reach top speed just prior to impact and slow down, the club release and accelerates into impact. Then he goes to a full finish.\n\nThis video is a continuation of Smiles's y golf swing. This video explains the break downs in his lower body mechanics and ground force and the recent improvements he made with his lower body mechanics. I also touched on about stalling which is a word we heard used a lot in the industry and how stalling can be an illusion om 2D.\n\nWelcome to the world of flat Gaz, a bit of useless information is when people turn better around their spine we find their lie angles flatten out from 1 to 2 degrees. I went from 2 flat to 4 and now 5 in the wedges. With your wedges though be careful you don't get too flat with them . Keep your angle of attack steep with them so the ball stops for 100's down.\n\nWhen we get flat we drop it inside and not as steep for the wedges and then find ourselves very deep in the timber out the back , balls just won't hold the green.\n\nAlso mate keep a sharp eye on your short game as well and you don't get too flat and loose your angle of attack, the same issues pitches never stop.\n\nThere is Pro's and cons of being flat my suggestion as time goes on maybe look at weakening your lofts. The flatter the swing becomes, the flatter the ball flight. You will see this over time.\n\nThen what you do is start (lefty Talk) Left Lateral bending to try and get high and you are back to square one, same old swing habbit.\n\nI found I had to weaken mine a few degrees,crazy enough they go further and better trajectory. This is only when you see you ball flat line Gaz.\n\nJust keep that in mind and keep an eye on it for the future mate.\n\nWhen you starting walking in the timber out the back a bit more often, is a great warning sign lolscott can I ask, if the improvements through you have been excellent, what would the explanation for smilesy currently being the worst handicap he has been all year?\n\nlong, short, left and right = ALL FINGERED\n\nGreat question, combinations of things is going on, his short game isn't up to his general standard and putting has been a bit off.\n\nAlthough I expect his handicap to drift out a little bit for a while and this isn't the focus right now. The focus isn't score, the goal is to translate these new patterns into his game. Because his patterns have changed, his ball flight laws are changing, he use to be signifcantly inside to out and he would hit draws. Now his path is only marginally inside to out, his club face is now open to his path, hits a fade or bad miss push slice. His hand position or face position at impact is the same, his path changed, before the face was closed to his path( Just needs some club face control practice.)\n\nHe sets up natural for his draw (alignments right) and push slices he hits his ball deep into the timber. At present he is working on his new alignments and working on some ball shaping. Some positives he's making more birdies, his good shot are really good and his bad is really ugly.\n\nThis is expected it takes time to make adjustments and a ton has changed for him, he is also in early stages learning where things are still in cognitive stage and it will take time for him to trust and everything becomes autonomus for him, where he can just focus on target and score.\n\nHe's basically going through a pretty normal process of development we have a 12 month plan and every thing is tracking well. me permission to post up his improvement over the course of a 3 month period. The training was over a duration of 8 weeks, 3 times a week spending about half hour each session doing his training. Smilesy swing improvements in 3D\n\nHi Smilesy, Here is a video for you on your improvements in 3D, I'll do some more video's explaining the lower body mechanics and ground forces, Upper Body and Muscular loading. Smilesy\n\nI would like to say to thank you to Smilsey for the great effort. His results he gained from his own effort of putting in the time and dedication to train. We provided him the drills, us permission to post up his progression and improvements so far. I quickly put together a video show his data and improvements. I'll follow up with further video's to explain his lower body mechanics and ground forces, Upper body and muscular loading.\n\nHis improvement were over the course of a 3 month period. The training was over a duration of 8 weeks, 3 times a week spending about half hour each session doing his training.\n\nBrad take a look for yourself in the back ground there is the ladder and tarp we put up blocking out the sun as it goes down. Sorry mate you got lied too when he was tested.\n\nIt's when he lost me is when he tried to steal my knowledge I shared with him, to sell his own story to make money selling his swing theories and then told lies when I tested him and many other lies as well. That's the Truth and why I walked away from him. A few others know the story ask them, it's the truth mate.\n\nI probably am not creating any ground force by putting a bubble into a carpet between my feet during a golf swing moving forces in opposite directions between my feet without sliding my feet in any direction but by pushing them into the ground vertically and horizontally during my motion keeping total control of the orbiting club and never having any type of injury in 35 years of golf. LOL\u2026..as Peter Allis would say \"remarkable\"\n\nObviously you are going to believe and push what you think so I waste my breath \u2026..however one quick note about John's 'cube test' that was performed. I have yet to see you mention (and you have brought this 'test' up many times in many threads).....that the swings recorded were John's first swings of the day- straight out of bed with no warm up\u2026 he did it that way to see how he performed cold\u2026. I think that is a pretty important piece of information to leave out as results would have been entirely different if he had decided to hit 10 or 20 warm up balls before doing the test swings\n\nBrad, As I said I can't comment on your ground forces I have no data on your swing.\n\nDo you know that is a lie about testing John first thing in the morning. Because we put a up a tarp in the back ground to block out the sun shining into the camera lens as the sun was going down.\n\nI tested John just as the sun was going down the day before, I have the video , would you like me to post it up so you can see this ? it shows the tarp in the back ground over a ladder blocking out the sun as it goes down.\n\nI tested John the day I arrived and we were grinding 1 and 2 irons and also hitting woods into the valley.\n\nJohn was surprised after being in the car for 7 hours I pulled out the 1iron and after 3 shots I was flushing them down the pipe. We were grind balls for well over an hour. Then I tested him, I always make sure people are warmed prior to testing them.\n\nThe next morning we looked at his data and went and played golf with Loren at Mare Island.\n\nThe times and dates are all recorded and the data being upload in the evening.\n\nWhat about the pics of me that I posted showing the forces at work with the carpet?\n\nIn our previous conversation about Ricky you stated he had a core weakness and in your post above you say he has a leg weakness.. ??\n\nTrue although In both threads I said he had weak core and weak legs. There was other issues as well.\n\nI can't comment on your still pictures Brad or your ground forces I need to know your kinetic link.\n\nI have seen John E do the same thing about 5 years ago roughly, although John didn't have great ground forces . He did the same thing i think he used a bath mat and crumpled the same.\n\nHis lower body use to spin and slide . He didn't use the ground to produce hip acceleration and hip deceleration patterns and then hips acceleration\/deceleration prior to impact.\n\nTo start his down swing he superficially turned his hips .\n\nTo slow them down he slid his lower body, Then he spun his lower out through impact.\n\nHis hips spun out 13 degrees during impact. John didn't use the ground very effectively.\n\nIf had better ground forces he would have been the best swinger on tour, his ground forces was one of the reason swinging never worked for him.\n\nHis body spinning out 13 degrees through collision is pretty hard to time to square the club face up every time which is one of the reasons swinging didn't work form him.\n\nGuys like Norman or people who have a effective kinetic link and effective ground forces etc, their hips at collision turn zero degrees during collision Have a look at the graph below the hips which is red line and you can see the hips speed is basically zero at impact. Not perfect pretty good though.\n\nBelow in the kinetic link you can see the hips accelerate and slow down to start the downswing, just prior to impact they accelerate and slow down again.\n\nThis occurs from creating effective ground forces, how we push and pull against the ground this pattern happens it's self. We don't superficial try and turn our hips to achieve this. Hips red, blue upper body, green arms, black the club release.\n\nAgain Zen you never answered the question. It isnt a trick question It is very simple with no data necessary. I have already answered the question for you And like wise you can have good ground forces and not be in balance Balance is MORE important than the other because like I have said quite a lot here- there is a golf club involved. If you arent balanced against the whirling club then you have no club control and will be forever trying to control the club with all the wrong movements\n\nBrad, Balance is a byproduct of good ground forces mate, as I said about Ricky, why do you think he is working on getting stronger in the legs? So he can apply more force to the ground. For the speed he swings at he can not apply enough force to the ground,so he can resist the force applied to his body.\n\nThe speed he produces is far too great for him, he simply isn't strong enough in the legs to resist it. The stronger in the legs he gets the more force he can apply to the ground and his lower body mechanics will improve. His core is another factor and another topic.\n\nThere is 3 general reasons people lose balance: 1) a lose of connection with the ground. 2)They aren't strong enough in the legs to apply enough force to the ground for the speed they swing at. 3) Physical Limitations in the lower body\n\nThe above one and two is for a conditioned golfer,sometimes for a conditioned golfer three does come into play and quite common.\n\nHowever for the average person who isn't conditioned, physical limitations come into play. There is so many variables of lower body physical issues which effect people connecting to the ground.\n\nThey can having internal hips rotation issues, poor glut activation, flat feet has a massive impact.Lower back issues. The list can go on and on.\n\nI can't answer your question to be honest, I'm not sure how I'm suppose to be able to make an accurate diagnosis looking at still pictures or 2D video.\n\nI can't determine whether or not a qolfer has good internal hip rotation or they are producing an external hip rotation. You can't tell this by still picture or 2d.\n\nI can't tell at what exact point they are losing ground forces, when does this occur, beginning of back swing, half way back, transition, halfway down, just prior to impact. The list goes on, so many variables.\n\nI can't tell with still pictures what their sequence is or if the coordination patterns are an issue. I need to know what their kinetic link is. I can't tell what their muscles are doing either which is crucial to know.\n\nI can't make an analysis from still pictures or 2d whether physical limitations are an issue or strength is an issue, I need to know the rotational movement of each body segment and the speeds each segment is producing plus the club head speed to determine these.\n\nI can't make an accurate analysis with our measuring a person in 3D there is far too many contributing factors that could be the reason to the causes.\n\nI can't answer your question with an accurate answer it's would be a guess and an assumption at best. 2d and still pictures never truly indicates what is happening, the human body and golf club moves in three planes of motion, 2d only measures two planes up and down (straight lines) and horizontal.\n\nGround force I have no chance making an analysis in 2D. Shear Forces work in Z coordinates and X coordinates. 2d can't measure Z coordinates.\n\nNope again making false allegations towards me as normal, you try to make me out to be an bad person and you don't even know me hack pro. You know absolutely nothing about me and to make judgement of a person on a forum where there is no tone or ways of expressions, that sums it all up for me.\n\nI'm not here to get business and not my interest either.\n\nI put up information for free and there is many readers who send very kind and nice emails thanking me for continuing to bringing new information forward for them to read here on ISG.\n\nI'm here for them, I apologize I don't appease some people although good people know don't judge a book by it's cover. They get to know a person first.\n\nThey see through all the ISG BS and see I have a heart of gold and truly genuinely want to help people.\n\nI'm here to help people who want to be helped there is thousand of readers out there who genuinely want to be helped, I'm here for them. They never contribute they just read.\n\nHackpro, Rudness aren't you calling the kettle black? You are one of the rudest and most arrogant people on here. You have displayed how low of a person you can be on here and I have never stooped as low as you have towards people on here.\n\nBrad,cant g\/pressures and forces all lead to a good balance?and indeed vica versa,......just saying..cheers\n\nGolfs ABC\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..Always Be Cool\u2026\u2026\u2026.Thanks paul Hart\n\nBingo Browman, Balance is a by product of ground forces. The Centre of Mass of the body, is your balance point. If you develop effective ground forces the balance will take care of it's self. The faster you swing the club the stronger in the legs you have to be to be able to apply more force to the ground so you can stay connected to the ground. If you lose balance it's easy to work out you have lost connection with the ground. Either it's a strength issue or a ground reaction force issue.\n\nBare with me if I ask silly questions or ones that can't be answered. If you don't ask you won't know.\n\nCheers.\n\nMaxxOn, LOL, You are asking great questions, keep them rolling only too happy to help answer them.\n\nIt's interesting learning how the human body functions, the easy part is understand how it the body moves. The hard part is finding ways how to train the body how to move effectively. It took 25 years of research, testing and trailing and we are still learning better ways all the time.\n\nDo you remember the orange whip?\n\nWe had the company send us their product, when we first seen it we thought, wow cool this could help with change of direction. The shaft being whippy we thought it would give a golfer time to engage their lower body first to start the down swing. So we put it to the test and started trialing and researching. The end result we were really bumbed, What we thought would be a great training aid, it trained the total opposite to what we thought it would train the body to do. For some strange reason every golfer after doing a series of reps and then tested them hitting a driver started their down swing arm first lol. But it goes to show test things first.\n\nWe try all crazy stuff your never know unless you test it. We encourage our clients to upload any idea they have no matter how crazy it seems, you never it could be another drill which has it's place to train a certain move or pattern or change a pattern.\n\nSometimes the most simple drill has the most impact. One of those things you never know until you test and research something to know for sure what impact a drill really has.\n\nBrad, Here is another post showing patterns of tour players. The red indicates where the most force is applied.\n\nRay this is the pattern tour players produce when they have effective ground forces and a kinetic link.\n\nThe force shear and normal forces produce the pattern above. On the back swing the force goes to right heal, on the transition the forces goes from the heel and heads towards the ball of the right foot and force is applied to the ball of the left foot. As you keep applying for more force, the pattern during the down swing, the force increases in the right ball of the foot and left ball of the foot. This produce equal opposite force reaction which produce ground reaction forces where the ground pushes back at you to produce hip acceleration and deceleration pattern. (hips speed up and slow down).\n\nWhen you create effective ground forces this pattern happens every time. it's how ground forces work."}

{"text":"Martin's Blog: A four-point plan for the offseason\n\nCHAPTER 34: Year End Special\nAs we close things out for 2012, here is a four-point plan to help you keep improving during the offseason:\n\n1. Play more than you practice:\n\n\u2022 Try playing a round without using a driver.\n\n\u2022 Take one more club than your initial thought on your approach shots.\n\n\u2022 Play to the center of every green.\n\n\u2022 Use the 70 percent rule, meaning don't attempt a shot unless you think you can pull it off at least 70 percent of the time.\n\n\u2022 Play a round of \"Worst Ball.\" This is when you take two balls off the tee and play the one with the worst result. Do the same for every other shot until the ball is holed.\n\n2. Work on pitching more than putting:\n\n\u2022 Make sure the ball position is consistently in the center of your stance with the left toe pointed out.\n\n\u2022 Get a true wrist cock in your swing, which is up-and-down not side-to-side.\n\n\u2022 Don't let the hips lead in the downswing. Having a kinematic sequence is magic for the long game, tragic for the short game.\n\n\u2022 Practice three different lengths of your swing with three different wedges so you have a shot for nine different yardages.\n\n3. Work on putting more than long game:\n\n\u2022 Work on your technique at home and touch on the practice green.\n\n\u2022 Improve your technique by using feedback tools such as a mirror on the ground aimed at the target or hitting the end of a small circular tube trying to get it to go as straight as possible.\n\n\u2022 Improve your touch and distance control by putting a ball as close as possible to the fringe and putting while looking at the hole the entire time.\n\n4. Practice the Big Three of the long game:\n\n\u2022 Club Shaft: Practice swinging just a shaft at home on the correct plane and when you replace it with a real club, visualize the club swinging through a gate in the impact zone.\n\n\u2022 Clubface: Take a block of wood and drill a shaft into it at a 5-iron lie. Practice hitting the flat side of the block into the flat side of an exercise log or another movable flat surface. This will help you get the correct hand action.\n\n\u2022 Clubhead: Take a shaft or driveway marker and stick it through the grip end of a club. Take practice swings or short shots, never full swings, with the extended shaft lightly resting against your body after impact."}

{"text":"Maybe make marking your lie with a mini mandatory? Just a thought, not an opinion.\n\nThat used to be the rule, but it was found to aid the speed of play by allowing players to use their thrown disc as the marker. I like that rule because I almost always opt to just throw from my disc, plus I like having the extra element of strategy if you're stuck behind a tree or something.\n\nI couldn't agree more that it is nice to choose because it does add that element of strategy, but should it? I know that ball golf needs a different set of rules because it is a different sport, but could you imagine an option of choosing where your lie could be placed in a sport that is so founded on the old saying, \"you must play it from where it lies\"?\n\nEither way it is the discrepancy that I don't like. How about just making it 50cm from the front of the thrown disc or the rear of the marker disc. This would include the full range we are given now and it would clear up any confusion.\n\nTo some extent, the rule that allows the disc to be used as a marker is also safety related (not hitting your hand on a trunk), which can make a difference if your thrown disc is just behind a tree trunk. Disc golf is not really a game where we \"play it where it lies\" like ball golf. We \"take a stance from where it lies\" but the disc release point for the next throw can be from any of a thousand different release points in space.\n\nAll the same, my problem is still in the discrepancy with the way the rule is worded. I agree that a longer line, of which, a player gets to choose where they mark their lie not only resolves some safety issues but also gives some strategy to the players game. Especially since the player can't put their thrown disc back down after picking it up. We allow a group decission for marking a lie with other lie mishaps, why not this one as well?\n\nThat's not what you tell them. They have 30cm behind their marker disc. The \"marker\" is defined as a mini if used, or the thrown disc if it's lying flat on the ground and they choose to use it as their marker.\n\nThe lie is whatever those who write the rules want it to be. There's no natural answer like ball golf where the ball is played from where it lies. Given a choice, I would prefer we went back to the original rule that required a mini marker be used. I'm not sure 50 cm would be easier to judge for foot faults than 30cm since 30cm is closer to the size of a player's foot.\n\nIt being a players association I figured we, as the players, kind of write the rules, or, at least, can mention a possible change to the board and expect an explaination. This conversation is an attempt to see if anyone else feels the way I do or if most people feel pretty comfortable with the way the rule is written. I know there are some that are confused by it but I don't think they make up the majority.\n\nJudging foot faults in this sport is a joke aside from someone stepping on their lie or someone guilty of a falling put; just about every other foot fault judgement needs film.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nMike Rideout\n\nReally?\n\nYou read an article with this diagram in it and THAT'S your comment? Let alone the insane notions about thrown discs needing to be perfectly FLAT on the ground to be considered 'on the playing surface' and eligible to be used as your marker and THIS is what binds your britches?\n\nI had three rules 'discussions' at last weekend's event at Horning's Hideout. One on having all of your support points on the teeing surface, one on the line of play behind your mini marker going to the wrong side of the mando and the last one about lifting the foot on the line of play off the ground before throwing from a backstance. These rules get abused all of the time without making weird rule extrapolations to further complicate the rules that we already play underWOW!!! WTF Sausage Fingers"}
{"text":"Finding Your Correct Iron Shaft\n\n2007-08-19\n\nGolfers may already be fit on a launch monitor for maximizing their driver, but golfers should also remember to make sure they are playing the correct iron shafts! Here are a few tips for choosing the correct iron shafts:\n\nAs always, the starting point for determining the correct flex is your swing speed. You can go into just about any golf shop in the country and have your swing speed checked. You can use your driver swing speed to determine which flex you need in an iron shaft. Typically, the 5-iron swing speed is 80 to 85 percent of the driver swing speed. It is most beneficial to check swing speed for both driver and 5-iron, if that is an option. Keep in mind that most golfers can use a more flexible iron shaft because the irons are shorter. For example, if a golfer swings a driver right at 95 mph (that would put his 5 swing speed around 76 to 80 mph), they may fit into a stiff shafted driver easily enough, but then not be able to optimize their iron play. So a softer flex iron shaft might provide a better feel and more distance, perhaps a \u02dd club or so.\n\nThe second important step to address is the golfer's control versus distance issues. Any golfer can be fit for weight in their irons as they are in their driver. Still, the same choices apply, heavier for more control or lighter for more distance and higher ball flight. A good fitter should dig into this topic and help the golfer determine whether distance or control is the top priority with the irons. Typically, stock graphite iron shafts weigh about 70 grams. Steel shafts have been getting lighter but still range from 110 to 125 grams. Fifteen grams can still make a difference with stronger golfers in choosing steel shafts. Finding an iron shaft in between the 85 grams to 115 grams range could make a world of difference in maximizing distance and control in iron play.\n\nFinally, some iron shafts can be fit for launch type. The launch type in an iron shaft can help fine-tune the ball flight, especially when looking at the mid-to-long irons. Spin can also play a part in fitting here. One place for golfers and fitters to look for high launch, low spin iron shafts is the Hybrid shaft category. Many companies offer such products, like our V2 Hybrid and ACCRA Hybrid shafts which are high launch, low spin and can be used in irons.\n\nWhile these points are valuable to focus on, don't forget the other parameters in iron fitting- factors such as length, loft and lie. For example, graphite iron shafts can affect length and, therefore, an adjustment in the lie is needed. A strategically evaluated analysis makes a precise club."}
{"text":"In this section I will share some of my tips, but not so much technical things, simply because I think that technique tips are very tricky; in order to really take them on you have to be very aware of your own tendencies, something that many average golfers don't know. They might know that they have problems with hitting the ball to the right or left, but not why. If you don't know why you have a certain tendency, it is very hard to really make use of technical tips. Some tips can be good for one player, but make another player play worse. For that reason I will focus on sharing tips about how to practice; what has made practicing more fun and rewarding for me, and how I focus when I practice.\n\nWinning wedges\n\nAt the end of the season of 2010 I won the Dubai World Championship - my greatest individual win in my career so far. I did it mainly thanks to my wedge game. When it was needed the most, I hit three straight wedges within a meter of the pin and made birdie each time. There is no other shot in golf that is so important for your score as the wedge. If you want to improve your wedge game I suggest that you test some of these tips below.\n\nPractice from different distances\n\nDon't hit two balls from the same distance, with the same club. Always change the distance or club between the shots. Practice as you play, I either hit a ball from one distance or then change the distance, or I change clubs from the same distance and then make another type of shot.\n\nCheck your lofts\n\nI use four wedges and of course I know what kind of loft they have. I have 46, 55 and 60 degree loft on my wedges. What do you have on yours?\n\nMy different back swings\n\nWith four wedges and two different back swings, I have eight different start lengths that I can begin from. Here I can get different height and spin on the ball without changing the swing too much.\n\nHands in front of club head at impact\n\nTo get a pure hit on the ball I make sure I have the shaft leaning slightly forward at impact. Another way to describe is; to make sure I get pressure on the ball I focus on having the hands slightly in front of the club head at impact.\n\nMy inspiration\n\nI will never forget an article in the magazine Swedish Golf that I read many years ago. I learned that the key to Tom Kites' success was that he was completely superior on tour when it came to hitting his wedges close to the pin. By being so good with the wedges he could save himself when he was in trouble on par 4s and he made a lot of birdies on the par 5s. He was so good with his short shots so he got a lot of tap-ins and put very little pressure on his putting. This spurred me to improve my wedges and short game.\n\nWhen I played Titleist clubs I used to visit the Titleist Performance Institute once a year, to practice and test new equipment. In this video from 2010, me and my swing coach Mark Blackburn show a few drills and techniques that has helped me in the offseason. I also share some tips for juniors and my best hydration tip."}

{"text":"Tuesday, September 30, 2008\n\nWe get asked all of the time about different putting theories and the best putting training aid to use to help implement the putting theory into their putting stroke. Obviously our students must first must decide if they are going to putt in an arc or use the straight back and straight through putting method. In this article we will discuss the TOMI Putting System and how it can help you no matter which putting theory that you use.\n\nPutting Training Aid \u2013 The TOMI Putting System You will feel like you are taking a personalized putting lesson from one of the world's top putting instructors, Marius Filmalter whenever you are using the TOMI. Tomi records the most critical parameters of your putting stroke in real-time. Tomi shows you what you're doing right and what you're doing wrong, tells you how to fix it and even gives you the drills you need to become a great putter.\n\nTOMI evaluates your putting stroke and Marius gives you constructive feedback on how to perfect Tomi captures, records and gives real-time feedback on your stroke. The TOMI can be used for both putting theories.\n\nThe above putting training aids will help you develop a better putting stroke. You need to first decide which whether you are going to implement the straight back and straight through putting method or if you are going to putting in an arc. Once this decision is made, then you can choose the putting training aid that will work for you and will help you lower your scores.\n\nMonday, September 29, 2008\n\nThe cart golf bag is somewhat smaller than the staff\/tour bag. Despite this you still require the help of a caddie or a cart because this sort of bag is still larger than the travel\/bag. You could infer from the name that the cart golf bag was primarily meant for use in a golf cart. They have a lesser number of pockets and are usually made from materials of a lighter composition.\n\nThe carry bag also known as a stand bag is a smaller bag designed for those who are naturally attracted by bags of such sizes, like the name implies they were basically designed for travel purposes and meant to be carried by the player. They can be used for other purposes as well considering the needs for compartmentalization and minimalism in our daily lives. Such bags usually come with enough space for a limited number golf clubs and space for other golf equipment which may be needed during the game such as balls and equipment.\n\nThe staff bag or tour bag is the largest selection of golf bags available. They are much larger that the travel\/carry bag or the cart golf bag. The average staff\/tour bag will house enough space for about 14 golf clubs and other equipment which may be required during a game. A lot of professional golfers tend to use these sorts of golf bags, but they don't carry them due to the weight, they opt for help from their caddies instead. The amount of equipment that these golfers can carry is as much as they would like. In order to suit the tastes of their end-users such golf bags may come made in leather and other sorts of expensive material September 27, 2008\n\nPutting, putting, and putting! When will you start to believe that you can hit a bad drive and recover but when you hit a bad putt the stroke is gone forever! There are many good putting training aids to help you improve your putting and putting stroke. Here are just a few:\n\nHow about we start with the hole itself. Several putting training aids can help you learn precisely where your ball should enter the hole in order to reliably drop in at the end of a putt. The Bullseye Cup is a simple tool that wraps around the cup, reducing the cup by nearly a third. The two-inch opening in the Bullseye's wraparound helps you visualize the precise angle of entry that will or will not work when you putt. Once you are familiar with this visualization, you can remove the Bullseye Cup and putt with the same precision unaided.\n\nMirrors are also highly important in terms of putting training aids. This is a classic tool, and a simple one, but it is long trusted for a reason: it really helps. The best way to perfect your putting stroke is to really be able to see what you are doing. You can probably tell when your golfing partners are not quite straight, or are over compensating, right? But everyone knows it is harder to see yourself with the same accuracy. There are several putting alignment mirrors by Izzo and other trusted brains that help you get a full view of your stance and motion on a putt. The Putting Alignment Mirror from Eyeline Golf can be easily carried in your golf bag for a quick check before a round. Izzo's Pure Putt Putting Mirror is durable and lightweight putting training aid. In addition, it can help you correct your shoulder position during both indoor and outdoor practice.\n\nFriday, September 26, 2008\n\nIs it just me or does it seem that everyone wants everything to happen right now in our society? Our students want to improve right now. Even with the use of a golf training aid, it just does not happen that way. Here are a couple of the good golf training aids that we use with our students and have seen success using these products when on a consistent basis.\n\nGolf Training Aid: Eyeline Putting Laser Line The EyeLine Putting Laser Line makes putting much easier. The Putting Laser Line quickly attaches to the putter shaft of your current putter. You will immediately see a line square to the putter face as well as on the target line. This line will insure that you are setup squarely to every single putt. You will track your stroke perfectly during your backswing and follow-through with the Putting Laser Line.\n\nGolf Training Aid: Weighted Practice Club The best weighted practice club available is the GolfGym's Club 38 or GolfGym's Club 28. Both golf training aids come with a Katherine Roberts Quick Start DVD. \"Since incorporating GolfGym products into my fitness programs, I have been able to offer a more effective level of golf-specific training and conditioning to my students.\" - Katherine Roberts, The Golf Channel Fitness Expert. Good players feel the golf club throughout the entire golf swing and understand how using a weighted practice club adds power and increases the range of motion in a golf swing. Since they started using a weighted practice club, these players realize increased distance, fewer injuries and more enjoyment of the game. The exclusive club design of the Club 38 or Club 28 allocates the weight of the practice club like that of a standard golf club. This has half of the total weight in the bottom third of the club. With this type of weighting you will develop consistency by staying on plane which will lead to better golf shots and lower scores.\n\nAs the technology has improved in the golf industry as well as the fitness industry over the last few years, the research that has been done on a complete a golf fitness program allows us to look at a golf swing and its parts much differently now than just a few years ago. Many golf courses and country clubs have added a golf fitness program to their year-round programming.\n\nMany of our students would like to start a golf fitness program that they can accomplish at their house and ask us where they should focus their golf fitness program.\n\nMuch of the success of a consistent golf swing is dependent on your core muscles. A great way to improve your core muscles is through golf fitness program that provides resistance. Resistance training means that your body gets used to working against an added pressure or pull. When you get use to performing a certain action or motion with resistance, then removing that resistance makes the act far easier, and adds power to your stroke. Resistance cords help you strengthen almost all of your upper body muscles involved in your swing, including chest, back, torso, rotator cuffs, shoulders, and even hips. You may also consider using a medicine ball to achieve simple yet beneficial strengthening of the core muscles through twisting and flexibility.\n\nThe core muscles are some of the most essential muscles to the game of golf, which is why so many golf fitness programs focus on core training or balance training. Balance training strengthens your core muscles all together because it requires you to use your stomach and back to maintain proper alignment. Balance balls and balance discs offer a variety of positions and exercises that strengthen your balance and, therefore, your core muscles, which can greatly improve the accuracy and distance your swing can achieve.\n\nThursday, September 25, 2008\n\nHoling more putts is always on every golfers mind whether they are playing a casual round of golf or playing for the Club Championship. As my students are always looking to improve their golf game, I keep preaching that a putting training aid is the quickest way to lower their scores. Remember, the majority of the strokes that you take during a round of golf are taken on the putting green.\n\nThe Pendulum Putting Rod helps you with critical fundamentals of the sought after in a pendulum putting stroke. This putting training aid will give you a perfect one-piece connection between the shoulders, arms, and hands. The Pendulum Putting Rod will allow you to feel your perfect posture throughout the entire putting stroke. If you change your spine angle, The Pendulum Putting Rod will fall from your chest. In addition, you will be able to monitor your putter shaft angle at address and all of the way through impact. Hence, you will have a consistent putter loft which will equate to consistent distance control.\n\nAs many of our students seem to think practicing their putting is like a trip to the dentist, putting training aids such as the Pendulum Putting Rod give our students instant feedback that is very easy to understand whether they made a good stroke or not. What will typically happen after our students spend just a few sessions with the putting aid is they have more confidence that they are making the correct stroke and therefore hole more putts. Is it not funny how holing more putts and shooting lower scores always equates into having more fun? But the cycle will start again. They think they \"have it\" and will go for a period of time without practicing their putting and fall back into the same rut. Do not let that happen to you!\n\nUsing your very own putter and The Tomi putting training aid you can capture information such as the alignment of the putter face at the point of impact, the speed of the putter head, the direction that the path of your stroke will take during the motion, the amount of rotation of the putter face on the backswing as well as the amount of rotation of the putter face on the forward swing. After capturing and recording the information on your putting stroke, The Tomi putting training aid will give you real time feedback on your putting stroke.The Tomi putting training aid records the most critical parameters of your putting stroke in real-time. Tomi shows you what you're doing right as well as what you're doing wrong. Then tells you how to fix your problem by giving you the putting drills that you will need to become a great putter.\n\nSo how does this putting training aid work? The TOMI putting training aid evaluates a putting stroke and with the use of the software, Marius will give you constructive feedback on how to improve The Tomi Putting System captures, records and gives real-time feedback on your stroke. You will feel like you are taking a personalized putting lesson from one of the world's top putting instructors, Marius Filmalter whenever you are using the unit.\n\nSaturday, September 6, 2008\n\nAs economic times are making the dollars that the average American family has to spend fewer and fewer, learn how to use a Zelocity golf launch monitor to improve the revenues at your driving range, golf course or country club. Below are reasons how the Zelocity PureFlight and PureLaunch models can help you increase your facilities revenues.\n\n1. Rent out the Zelocity driver monitor for corporate events or use it as an amenity to a golf tournament. This will work two fold. First you will be providing an experience that not many others do for a golf tournament or a corporate event. Second, again, your golf club sales will increase as the players see the hard data in front of them. Third, the teaching revenues administering the corporate event or tournament will be able to grow their lesson business from this type of exposure.\n\n2. Use a golf launch monitor to validate the equipment choices that you are recommending to your customers, students or members. Show them the hard data of what they are swinging now and what the new piece of equipment can do for them and watch your driving range, golf course or country club's golf club sales increase.\n\n3. Using a golf launch monitor, you are able to give your student a baseline skill assessment to quantify where the student is beginning. This will allow you and your student to track the improvements in their golf swing. With this data, you can promote yourself and your teaching by showing them how the information that you gave them is improving their golf scores.\n\n4. You will now be able to offer a service that not many golf professionals offer in that you can \"Gap\" your students clubs. They will no longer have to wonder what to hit from 150 yards. This would be a lesson session resulting in more teaching income for you.\n\n5. With the hard data from a golf launch monitor, you have a measurement tool to show them their progress and where they could still use some more work (in another lesson, of course) In addition, you or your students can use the PureFlight for on-course playing lessons and to better understand course management.\n\nMonday, September 1, 2008\n\nI recently went to two difrerent driving ranges that are within twenty minutes of each other and the differences.\n\nThe first driving range experience that we will walk through is the lower-end driving range. Even though the facility is located close to a busy retail area, you will pull up into their gravel parking lot. From there you proceed into their wooden building to purchase tokens for the range ball dispenser and as many rusted range ball baskets that you plan to use. I do not know how old their range ball dispenser is, but I would almost bet it was one of the first one ever made! HAHA Once you have your golf practice balls, you then proceed to the golf mats. You may wonder how come at this point you do not proceed to the grass hitting area, well, you can. However, when you arrive at that part of the facility you better be ready to practice off of a golf tee as you will only find tufts of grass left to hit off of for the majority of the year.\n\nWhile hitting your range balls, you will more than likely be interrupted by the loud farm tractor better known as the facility's driving range picker.\n\nOnce you are finished with your practice time, you can sit in your air conditioned car and enjoy a cold soda from the soda machine. I have learned correct change is better. To enter the other driving range experience, you pull into their landscaped and paved parking lot. and we enter the literal club house that has a snack bar, meeting rooms and a golf shop full of new golf equipment. You pay for your range basket and fill it as full as you would like without extra range balls falling out.\n\nYou then walk out to the practice tee which is large enough and maintained through proper bag stand rotation and turf grass maintenances. There are additional practice areas for putting, chipping pitching, green-side bunkers and fairway bunkers. You can practice all of the different aspects of your golf game. In addition, this facility has PGA Teaching Professionals on staff and they have a very active clinic schedule and offer individual lessons as well.\n\nAfter practicing, you can sit in the snack bar and be served a soda or adult beverage while watching their big screen tv. They have tables scattered throughout the area as well as some comfortable chairs and a couch to catch your breath in between practice sessions. It is amazing to me that both of these facilities exist so close to each other while charging the about the same prices."}

{"text":"Different types of golf shots are used depending on the spot from where the ball is being played. The opening shot is called the tee shot, while approach shots or feel shots, such as chip, pitch and flop shots, are played from outside the green into the green. The shots played on the green are called putts.\n\nA fairway shot is similar to a drive when done with a fairway wood. However, a tee may not be used once the ball has been brought into play, therefore playing from the fairway may be more difficult depending on how the ball lies. If precision is more important than length (typically, when playing on narrow fairways or approaching a green), irons are usually played from the fairway. Irons or wedges are also often used when playing from the rough.\n\nA bunker shotis played when the ball is in a bunker (sand trap). It resembles a pitch and is done with a wedge.\n\nA tee shotis the first shot played from a teeing ground. It can be made with a driver (i.e. a 1-wood) off a tee for long holes, or with an iron on shorter holes. Ideally, tee shots on long holes have a rather shallow flight and long roll of the ball, while tee shots on short holes are flighted higher and are expected to stop quickly.\n\nAn approach shot is played into the green from outside the green, usually over a intermediate or short distance. Types of approach shots are:\n\nPitch: a high approach shot that makes the ball fly high and roll very little, stopping more or less where it hits the ground. Pitches are usually done with a wedge.\n\nFlop: an even higher approach shot that stops shortly after it hits the ground. It is used when a player must play over an obstacle to the green. This high lob is usually played with a sand wedge or a lob wedge.\n\nChip: a low approach shot where the ball makes a shallow flight and then rolls out on the green. Chips are done with a wedge or \"short\" (higher-numbered) iron.\n\nHowever, one of the most important things in performing these golf shots correctly is choosing the right equipment, tailored to your level. This may considerably help you in 'masking' your temporary shortcomings in the game. To help you make the right choice, we advice you first have a quick look at the articles explaining the different types of clubs. If you are new to the game of golf, make sure you also read this article explaining the basic set equipment for the novice golfer."}

{"text":"It always seems to happen when you are having the round of your life. The sky darkens, the wind picks up and the thunder begins to roll across the golf course.\n\nThe temptation always exists in these circumstances to convince yourself and your playing partners that there is enough time to finish your round, or at least a few more holes. If you play on instead of seeking shelter, your great round could become the last round of your life.\n\nEvery year more people are killed or injured by lightning than by tornadoes, floods or hurricanes. In fact, it's estimated that in the United States, as many as 300 people are killed by lightning each year.\n\nBecause they are generally open areas with scattered individual trees, golf courses are dangerous places during a thunderstorm. A lightning bolt will take the shortest route between the cloud and the ground, which means that a golfer standing in the middle of a fairway or huddled under a tree is a prime target for a strike.\n\nHowever, there are several safety measures you can take to avoid being hit by lightning:\n\nSeek shelter at the first sign of a thunderstorm.\n\nIf possible, get off the golf course or go to a designated lightning shelter."}

{"text":"In preparation for a recent tournament I decided to refresh my understanding of the rule book and found the Optional Relief rule's (803.05(C)) location in the rule book to be a bit confusing.\n\nBasically a player can at anytime decided NOT to play their thrown disc from its lie, and can instead do one of two things. They can choose to take an Optional Rethrow (803.06) or they may take Optional Relief (803.05(C)). Either option involves a one throw penalty. The only difference between the two is that with Optional Relief a player can move his or her shot anywhere on the line of play as long at the new lie is no closer to the basket. These two options are closely related and both should be considered before a player chooses either.\n\nSince the Optional Rethrow and Optional Relief are so similar, I would suggest that they both be combined into a new rule, 803.06, with a section (A) for Optional Rethrows and (B) for Optional Relief. A player's understanding of how these two rules can be used would be clarified if the two rules were presented side by side.\n\nAdditionally, in the same way \"Unplayable Lie\" was replaced with Optional Rethrow, since \"unplayable\" was entirely at the player's discretion, I would suggest \"optional relief\" be replaced with \"Optional [Remark?]\" or something similar, since the rule doesn't require there be anything to take relief from. Technically, you could land in the middle of the fairway, move your lie to a better a position, and take a one stroke penalty.\n\nOne more issue with Optional Relief. Optional Relief provides a way to \"game\" some mandos. A local course (Hyland) has a mando that prevents an easy one shot anhyzer to the basket. Via the legal path, the tight fairway takes you 300' downhill, thick brush on both sides, and then doglegs left for another 100' feet or so. A tough 5, and a nearly impossible 4 (for me).\n\nUsing the optional relief rule rule a player can throw a short layup, maybe 20' and say they made the mando, they could then declare optional relief, move the disc 150' backward, up the line of play, to a point behind the T-Pad, and behind the mando, leaving themselves an even easier shot at the basket than they'd have had from the T-Pad.\n\nOptional Relief is in the rulebook where players normally would take it which is when they need more than 5m from a lie in a casual relief area. It's unclear whether the Rules Committee intended for Optional Relief to generally be available any time or just with casual relief. But, since the wording didn't restrict it to casual relief only, you are correct that maybe it should be combined with the Optional Rethrow rule. Or, leave it where it is but specifically restrict it as an extended relief option only for casual relief situations.\n\nCan you officially make the mando just 20 feet in front of the tee on that hole? It sounds like the mando would be down where you need to dogleg left so you couldn't just declare you made it after throwing 20 feet. But, if you can game it the way as you state, then the mando is simply in the wrong position or another one is needed farther down the fairway. The line of play for Optional Relief when a mando is involved is directly at the mando object, not the basket, until you have officially passed it.\n\nThe rules committee is working on a full re-write for submission to the board and combining the optional relief is one of the many changes already included. We are also proposing wording to the effect that any throw from the tee side of a mando must pass the mando, regardless of whether it has previously been passed.\n\nYour example of gaming the system is currently possible without Optional relief, you could throw just past the mando then turn around and throw as far back as you choose."}

If a player's score is really that bad, it won't be used anyway. And with that, the player's score won't be used in their individual rating. So, the player with the bad round just needs to accept the fact that they didn't perform as expected and move on to the next round.\n\nFrom what I've seen, the players that willfully withheld thier round scores, did so to either protect the almighty \"1000+\" player rating (Pro), avoid seeing a sub 900 round rating (Am), or to avoid getting slack from their peers.\n\nRatings are just a number and a general representative of a player's performance for a given number a rounds (player rating) and a standard to use compare individual rounds (round ratings).\n\nRatings are a great tool to use in comparing performance levels of players (ratings) and courses (SSA) over a given amount time.

{"text":"new proposed anchoring ban was announced by the USGA and R&A on Nov. 28 a lot of pros took to social media to express their opinions.\n\nWell, so did college players.\n\nEven though only a few players use the longer putter, it doesn't mean they don't have opinions.\n\nCalifornia teammates Joel Stalter and Max Homa took to Facebook for their tiff.\n\nHoma had posted that he was excited about the anchoring ban, but upset that it will take four years for the ban to start (2016 is the proposed year). He compared anchored putting to NBA star Dwight Howard of the Los Angles Lakers' free-throw shooting, \"Howard doesn't get an advantage shooting free throws because he has no touch.\"\n\nWhile Stalter fired back with, \"Do metal driver heads and balls that fly further compromise the integrity of the game as well?\"\n\nHoma believes, yes, ban anchoring. He believes it is an advantage for players who use this method of putting. He refers to the 'ys' (yips), as part of the game.\n\n\"I am a traditionalist when it comes to golf, and anchoring seems far different from how the founders of golf would have liked to see the game,\" Homa said.\n\nSince anchoring has grown so much within the last year or so, Homa feels that if players, at any level, were to keep practicing with it, it is possible that their stroke could become infinitely more repeatable since it is lodged in a fixed point on a player's body.\n\n\"I understand that technology has got unbelievably more advanced, however, the swing still remains the same,\" Homa said. \"With anchored putters, the stroke is now being affected.\"\n\nLike he said in the Facebook post, he has never seen someone with a bad swing, step up to the tee and hit RocketBallz straight, but \"someone with a bad putting stroke can get a better stroke with belly putter.\"\n\nHe goes on to say that when a player has a good stroke, meaning they have a stroke that is 'repeatable and predictable' that is exactly why a belly putter makes much it that much simpler to make putt, 'especially when one is nervous.'\n\n\"I don't feel disadvantaged if people use the long putters, I just feel it is straying away from how golf was intended to be played,\" Homa said.\n\nOn Cal, two of the starting five this fall, Stalter and teammate Brandon Hagy, use the belly putter and anchor. They use the belly putter because they feel more comfortable with it and like it better.\n\n\"It's kind of the same thing as why people use mallets or blades,\" said Stalter. \"Putting is a sensitive subject, and there is no truth, but I think you need to find what corresponds you best.\"\n\nHe changed to the longer putter because he was struggling with his short putting, and his putting, in general, was inconsistent.\n\n\"There were rounds where I would make tons of putts and others where I would miss a lot of short putts,\" Stalter said. \"I started putting better\u2026 but it gave me more consistency and helped me gain my confidence back.\"\n\nStalter tested the belly putter for about nine months, before deciding to change back to the short putter after Cal's last fall victory at Isleworth. Although he said he had \"absolutely no clue about the ban, and did not expect it to happen that soon so my change (in putters) is not the result of the ban.\"\n\nThe reason for the change back to the short putter was control. He considers himself a 'feel player,' meaning he thinks it's important to be able to swing the putter freely without an anchoring point. So he made the switch back.\n\n\"I also believe it gives me more control over speed, which is directly associated with the line and the read,\" Stalter added.\n\nEven though Stalter has switched back to the short putter he still believes that the belly putter\/anchoring is not any more help than a short putter.\n\n\"There is absolutely no hard data that proves it is any help. It is more a belief than a concrete and solid statement,\" Stalter said.\n\nThe college game will be affected to some point - if the ban sticks - since everyone has different opinions.\n\nHoma thinks differently.\n\n\"I don't think it will make a huge impact on their games because most have only used them for a brief amount of time (similar to many professionals).\"\n\nThere is no bad blood between Stalter and Homa. They are teammates, but also humans, and their opinions are going to be different and they matter.\n\n\"We probably are not on the same page yet, but it's not like it matters. Had they not banned the anchored putter, we would still go about our business of playing golf,\" Homa added.\n\nBut Stalter says it best, \"It's a good thing (that we disagree), because we can learn from each other and challenge our ideas.\""}

I'm still a rec player overall, and mostly have played as one, but I have never seen par 2 holes at any course I've ever been to\nbesides this one, and I've been to quite a few. I had to take a second look at the sign when I saw it...huh, par 2? Does the PDGA even recognize par 2, or\nhas there ever been a par 2 in any PDGA-sanctioned tournament? I don't think it exists in ball golf. As (mostly) recs, my friends and I were kind of thrown\noff by this; we just went ahead and played the course at par 3 since most of the holes listed at par 2 were challenging enough to be 3s (hole 1 seems like\nit's a par 2, at least). During tournaments at Roper, are those holes listed at 2 played at par 2? Seems tough! May I dare say it seems silly!....\n\nWith the short tees, the course Scratch Scoring Average is 44 as measured by the PDGA tournament round in May 2006. That is 10 less than using the \"every\nhole is par 3\" method. On a clear day, with no wind, a disc golfer with a 1000 rating would expect to make the hole in two throws at Roper. In Maytag,\nIA, a course used at the PDGA World's a few years ago, some of the tees signs say par 2What does \"par\" mean to you?\n\nThe way I understand this, would mean that any given course would recognize par 3 as the minimum for any given hole. Two close range throws would indicate\nupshots or putts, a drive would not be consider amongst these 2 throws.\nSIPNTHROED wrote:Argument one which I agree with.\n(Golf) The number of strokes required for a hole or a round played without mistake, two strokes being allowed on each hole for putting.\nDisc golf par is at least one drive allowing for two close shots. Minimum being par 3.\n\nArgument two which looks more at the definition of \"par\" than it does golf par.\nSports The number of golf strokes considered necessary to complete a hole or course in expert play.\nPar as a definition by itself is a standard of excelence.

People get hard headed and never budge with their opinions. I'm talking about\nmyself as much as any one else. But since I like to argue and I still believe I can change peoples minds, I will make a few more points. Unless you ignore\n\"two strokes being allowed on each hole for putting.\" and substitute it with some arbitrary, 'two close shots' or 'throwing your putter\nis putting' par two is wrong headed. I have played all the par two holes in Lincoln and I never was allowed two putting strokes to complete the hole. We\ncan get into this silly arguement about since a pro will throw a putter from the tee box it is a putt. However in regular golf you can drive with a putter yet\nit doesn't make it a putt because of how hard one swings the putter. I would define a putt as a throw not requireing your body to twist.\n\nThe reality is that some people choose to ignore \"two strokes being allowed on each hole for putting.\" So either suck it up and deal with the par\n2s in Lincoln or ignore the signs outside of tournament play and call them par 3s. Unfortunately par is set by the course designer and\/or tournament director.\nOmaha is no better really, nothing like a 100 foot straight ahead par 4. I ignore the signs at Seymore and Lincoln as do most every one else.\n\nPS. Par 3 at Seymore is 54 where sign par is 68 a difference of 14. However if Seymore were to allow \"two strokes being allowed on each hole for\nputting.\" and define putting as a throw not requrering your body to twist. The course would be around 55 - 57 with the long pin placements. Hole 4, 7\nand 12."}

An actual shove is illegal.\nIt's only a feel. What gives this shove feel is the stroke is made with\na very short backswing and a long followthrough. The advantage of this\ntype of stroke is the shorter the backswing, the less chance of error.\n\nThe grip most certainly will influence the clubhead, but any type\nof grip that will keep the wrists from opening or closing the blade\nis a good grip regardless of how the hands grip the club. Whatever grip\nis chosen the thumbs should be on top. The thumbs are the feelers and\nbeing on top one can feel if the blade is square. Any stroke that holes\nthe ball consistently is a good putting stroke. Regardless of the style\nof the stroke the putter head should never be taken to the outside of\nthe target line on the backswing.\n\nFinally, I have a drill that may work for you when practicing your\nputting stroke called the Tap stroke. To learn this stroke pretend there\nis a tack stuck in the back of the ball and when you make your stroke\nhave the putter head drive the tack further into the ball.

{"text":"Aim and stance key to successful stroke\n\nMost of your success in this game will be determined by your setup. Most golfers have the physical ability to set up correctly, but few do. The problem is that they adjust their address position until they feel comfortable, but comfort doesn't always equal correctness.\n\nTaking the time to set up correctly in order to give yourself the best chance to hit a good shot is one of the secrets of great players. It is extremely important to aim the club face correctly, and then, stand to the club properly so ball position and body alignment are ideal to achieve proper impact.\n\nSet the bottom edge of your club perpendicular to the target line, while maintaining the correct loft on the club, so that the sole of the club is resting flat on the ground. Then, stand to the butt-end of the club, so that the handle points approximately to the center of your body. Depending on the individual, the handle may point one or two inches forward of the body.\n\nAlign your feet, knees, hips and shoulders parallel with the target line. Your feet should be approximately shoulder-width apart, with the front foot turned outwards slightly. Be careful not to open your stance. The handle points to the same point of the body for every club. This dictates the correct ball position in relation to your feet for each club, which will vary, depending on the club being used.\n\nBecause your golf club is swinging on an inside-to-straight-to-inside swing path, ball position is very important. The club head will be going straight through toward the target for only a short distance, so you need to have the ball positioned exactly at the point in your swing arc where this occurs.\n\nOtherwise, if the ball is too much toward your rear foot, you will tend to push shots. Conversely, if the ball is too far forward in your stance, you will tend to pull them.\n\nA correct setup will probably not feel comfortable at first, and this is also true when you try to aim better and adjust your ball position. Please give yourself several practice sessions at the driving range to become accustomed to the change. Your success at better controlling the direction of your golf ball, through better aiming and proper stance, will help you quickly get over how uncomfortable it feels at first. Good luck with applying this information to your setup and swing.\n\n(Mike Smuniewski, a 17-year Class A PGA Professional, is head instructor for the John Jacobs' Golf School at Lely Resort.

It's now time to address the right hand.\n\n3. Place your right hand on the side of your right leg. Bring it slowly towards the base of the golf club.\n\n4. Your right hand will need to be placed more in the fingers than the palm. Fold the right hand around the fingers of your left hand.\n\n5. Important- Keep both palms facing each other at all times.

Full details by clicking the link below:\n\nWith the basics covered, the next thing to cover will be the grip variations available. Think of these variations as a way of pinpointing your individual style, to find the golf swing that's best for you.\n\nA Note On Golf Club Grips\n\nBefore we discuss the important topic of grip variations, it's worth taking a moment to cover the grip you have fitted on your golf clubs.\n\nMost clubs will have a \"men's\" grip or a \"ladies'\" grip. If you have smaller hands the clubs should have a \"ladies'\" grip fitted, even if you have \"men's\" clubs.\n\nLarger hands should have golf clubs with \"men's\" grips fitted. To complicate matters further, you can have \"jumbo\" grips for larger hands or those who suffer arthritis. Very small hands can benefit from \"junior\" grips.\n\nWhy worry about the grips fitted to your golf clubs? Well, the size of the grip, in relation to your hand size, affects the flight and travel of the ball.\n\nLarger grips will take to make players fade the ball, while smaller grips will tend to make players draw the ball.\n\nIt even more things about it!\n\nI've loaded your blog in Several different browsers and I must say your blog loads a lot faster then most.

{"text":"Ian Kitrick shows off his disc golf technique on the East Field. Disc golfers are equipped with a bag of different discs that include drivers and putters. The distance of the throw depends greatly on the disc used and the type of throw. Photo by Nick Paris.\n\nAs the sun gains strength for the day on an early morning in January, two athletes emerge from the shadows that low light has cut upon the East Field. These UC Santa Cruz students are throwing what look like petite Frisbees hundreds of feet across the field. The discs cut the clear air for a few moments before skidding to a stop across the grass, still dotted with dew. One of the students, Ian Kitrick, comments on the beauty of the gliding discs as he leans back and admires his 400-foot throw.\n\nKitrick is the captain of the disc golf club team. He, along with Colin Chambers, the club's president, are avid disc golfers.\n\n\"I began playing when I was four years old,\" Chambers said, peering out at the field through his glasses. \"My mom took me to play so I could burn off some energy. In high school I played occasionally with friends, and last summer I played pretty much every day.\"\n\nAlthough Kitrick has not played disc golf for as long, his enthusiasm for the sport is evident.\n\n\"Some friends got me into disc golf about a year ago and now I'm hooked,\" Kitrick said.\n\nDisc golf is very similar to regular golf. The goal of both is to complete the course in the fewest attempts possible. Players use discs of varying size depending on the distance of each shot, just as golfers use specific clubs depending on distance and terrain. And disc golf courses are sprawling grass fields, just like golf courses \u2014 though disc golfers throw toward large chain baskets rather than putting toward holes.\n\nOn disc golf courses, there are mandatories, known as \"mandos,\" which are specific obstacles that everyone must follow, such as having to throw a disc to the right of a particular tree. There are also one stroke penalties added to players' score if they lose a disc or throw one out of bounds, in water or too high up in a tree.\n\nThe discs are composed of a hard, somewhat thick plastic and vary in size and width of rim. There are different styles of throwing the discs: the tomahawk, thumber, backhand, or sidearm, to name a few.\n\n\"There is a basic form to learn,\" Chambers said, \"but everyone ends up tweaking it to find their own style.\"\n\nKevin \"Skippy\" Givens is the UCSC sports club supervisor and former coach of the disc golf club. The game has been around since the late '60s, Givens said, and it is a natural progression from the game of Frisbee.\n\n\"In 1976, the first official disc golf course was created at the Oak Grove Course in Southern California,\" Givens said. \"Prior to that, people would throw Frisbees at lamp posts and objects of the like, creating a kind of course by themselves. It was only a matter of time until this game became official.\"\n\nThe team is fortunate to have a world-class champion, Avery Jenkins, training them. Jenkins was gone fall quarter, but the club eagerly awaits his return this quarter.\n\nFor world-class champions like Jenkins and college-age enthusiasts alike, there are few better locations to practice disc golf than the world-renowned DeLaveaga Golf Course, located in Santa Cruz. Known as \"DeLa\" to the club, this course is known for the challenging shots its terrain imposes. When not at DeLa, however, the club sometimes works on distance throws down at the East Field.\n\nNow that the UCSC team has a great coach and a location for practice, there is just one piece missing.\n\n\"We'd love to grow enough support to hopefully get a consistent group out playing,\" Chambers said.\n\nKitrick and Chambers both said that though the team is a tight niche of friends, it has no problem including newcomers into the group. This is evident in its motto: \"The most fun wins.\"\n\nAs the two friends saunter out to collect their discs, the crispness of the morning fades. Hidden among the grass, the discs will eventually be found and packed away until the next cold winter morning when the team will throw them again."}
{"text":"Out of curiosity, what are the rules for the mulligans the first round going to be? i.e. Can you go get your errant throw\/disc to re-tee? Or do you need to throw one of your remaining two discs? If not, that'll make using mulligans pretty rough the first round (as I'm guessing most players will be bringing a fairway, a mid, and a putter).. but otherwise it'll possibly slow the pace of play a bit."}
{"text":"work with numbers and measurements five days a week so I fell pretty sure about two things:\n\n1) Most people who say unbelievable things about how far they hit it or how much clubhead speed they generate are not \"lying\". They believe certain things to be true and are only remembering or believing certain numbers that support their initial idea. The ignore everything else.\n\n2) Golf is played under extremely variable conditions, leading to all sorts of funny numbers once in a while. If you ignore the vast majority of your tee shots you can always find a couple that happen to support such-and-such ridiculous overestimate of your actual distances.\n\nIt's mostly selective recall, with a little bit of ego-driven \"rounding up\" or slight exaggerations. And there are plenty of \"launch monitor\" setups out there specifically intended to provide very ego-boosting numbers, supplied by people hoping to make a few bucks off that ego.\n\nGo look at the swing videos people post, a lot of the guys who say they have 120mph swing speeds are swinging out of their shoes and actually do have 120mph swing speeds. The hit some serious foul balls when they miss it and its harming their ability to score but they aren't lying in a lot of cases.\n\nThe posts I find interesting are the guys who say they have the same swing speed that I do yet carry it 40 yards further than me. I know my driver is shorter than normal and I launch it a little lower than normal so my carry isn't optimal but sorry, if your swing speed is 110 and my swing speed is 110 and I carry it 265 at sea level with a smash factor close to 1.50 you don't carry it 310 at sea level, its not physically possible. maybe you carry it 275 or 280 with optimal launch conditions but not 310.\n\nTrue. Some of us actually do post swing videos too, so we can actually get some idea what the truth is! It makes my stomach turn when I see a post like \"I have a 130mph SS\" and they post a video with a swing that looks like a) they couldn't hit a grapefruit on a tee and b) their back's days are numbered.\n\nHonestly, it's fun to talk numbers and try and tweak things, but I realized after pillaging my own money last year that my time is better spent improving than ho'ing. Yeah, my swing speed has been measured anywhere from 110 to 117, but I don't trust every launch monitor I see. In real life I play at sea level (literally, on the Chesapeake) and often in a 1-2 club wind. Optimization is trumped by confidence and hitting fairways. With back to back holes in a wind like that, I might have a 250 carry and a 310 carry on back to back holes. So it goes.\n\nWhat I do know is that being dishonest on here only hurts you in the long run. When you do that, you might actually find a club that you don't want to sell the next day on BST.\n\nI was just looking over some score cards from some of my local clubs. Must be something wrong with these cards. I see no place to write in spin rate, launch angle, or side spin. Some of them don't even have a place for smash factor. These cards are worthless................It's really hard to figure how guys like Hogan,Nicklaus,Player,and Palmer ever broke par without the help of a launch monitor ?????\n\nEven in a thread where people are talking about questioning distance...some people feel compelled to still slip their numbers in there.\n\nI never understood the fascination. Most people on this board will never meet. How far somebody else hits the ball (or claims to hit the ball) has absolutely zero impact on you or your golf game. If someone claims, or generally believes they hit the ball farther than you...who cares? You see the same things on all forums. Everybody on the Apple forum claims they bought in cheaper. Everybody on a car forum gets more horsepower out of their ride than possible. On watch forums people claim highly questionably purchase prices.... take it all with a grain of salt and move on shoulderHow are you supposed to \"help the best you can\" when you know someone is full of $hit?\n\nIsn't helping them back to reality, help?\n\n1. If someone is lying that badly, and want to choose a shaft that is based upon such an outrageous lie....you stand little chance of saving them from themselves. As the OP stated, the pain of trying to play a shaft that is woefully ill-suited to them will snap them back to reality. You can't save people from themselves....and some things they just have to learn the hard way.\n\n2. To people who AREN'T lying---and places like this draw from such a large (and largely self-selected) group of avid golfers so the odds are good that many people are NOT lying----you can come accross as rude and patronizing:\n\n\"I know your game better than you do, even though I've never seen you hit a shot....\"\n\nWhich is why many blade players find the GI iron players who pound their shoe on the table insisting that everyone who isn't a pro needs to play GI irons (like they do), to be REALLY annoyingDude, you are guilty of too many good posts....most every topic you have solid insight. Too many people use thier current situation\/conditions blended with ego and extropolate across the whole population = erronious judgementWere here because we like clubs and shafts. I like to see what people have in their sigs just like I like to see what people have in their witb pics. For a lot of us here this is our major hobby, were having fun with it.\n\nThere's a mini-tour guy that frequents the same range I do and I've gotten to know pretty well. It has confirmed 2 things for me, 1) the difference in ball striking between the average low handicap and aspiring pro is downright emasculating and depressing, 2) yes, some people can hit ridiculous distances. He just got fitted for a club off the tee that won't go over 280. It was a 5 wood. Yep, I stood there and watched him hit it farther than my driver. I won't even mention the stinger driver that he can hit for the Texas wind. It was just silly, he's the best non-PGA ball striker I've ever seen in person and I've played with a lot of very good players shoulderYes and no.\n\nA hard swing that fails to produce the right impact conditions will not hit the ball very far....but a swing with perfect impact conditions that doesn't generate any speed won't hit it very far either.\n\nThe challenge (like being a major league pitcher) is striking the right balance of power...and precision of contact. Good players hit the ball a long way, not because they swing \"hard\"....but because their swings are technically sound and efficient, and thus generate a great deal of speed without a lot of perceived \"effort.\"\n\nThen their contact is solid with good impact conditions...and they efficiently transfer the energy their swings generate to the golf ball.\n\nAverage players have the problems that they do, because that chain breaks down. They have inefficient, technically-flawed swings..and thus feel they have to \"swing hard\" in order to generate speed. Then they make glancing contact with the golf ball...and transfer that energy in an equally inefficient manner.\n\nIf I create a new thread asking for help on a driver shaft and say that my swing speed in 110, why would I be lying? I'm asking a serious question so that people with good knowledge of equipment on here can give me some help with regards to something that would improve my game. I don't see any benefit in saying my swingspeed is 118 instead of 110 because I'll get feedback that's useless for me.\nYou'll always find people that lie about their swing speeds because they have nothing better to do than argue and make up stuff on an internet forum, just like you'll find people who enjoy arguing or calling out people on what they think is a lie just because they feel like it or don't have the same ability as others.\nOver time, you'll be able to tell which users try to be helpful and which ones show up to just ruin the party so to speak. I've been on here consistently for at least a year, so I can often tell by the username whether the post will be of a helpful sort or something I should just ignore.\n\n\"What club you hit\" 150 yard par 3 \"Pitching Wedge\" they pull out a pitching wedge and go 130 tops and wonder what happend. Some people hit it longer , I do with my irons jacked up lofts or not with my MP32's 145 to 150 my Di11 I can get 155 to 165.\n\nOne day years ago I caught up with a twosome on the back nine of a public course I'd played a couple times before. One big muscular guy and one little skinny guy, both 10-15 years younger than me. The 17th hole is a slightly downhill Par 3 with a huge bunker in front of the green and a steep embankment behind the green all the way up to the 18th tee. Very shallow green, only about 16-18 paces deep. Playing maybe 165-170 yards slightly downhill.\n\nThe other guys were the tail-end of an alternate shot afternoon round following a tournament that morning. It was the big guy's turn to hit on the Par 3. He pulls out a pitching wedge and blows it over the green and a few yards up the embankment. I look at the 7-wood in my hand and think \"I know I need more than a short iron but C'MON!\". So I grabbed a 5-iron and figured it must be more downhill than it looks.\n\nOf course I flew it right into the front bunker. The skinny guy looks at me real serious-like and says \"Don't EVER look at what club this guy hits, he's a freak\". So we walk down to the green, I hit up onto the fringe somewhere and eventually three-jack for my double. The skinny guy goes up the hill with a lob wedge, pulls a Tom Watson and chips the ball into the hole for a birdie. Never seen anything like those two shots.\n\nAs we walked to the next tee I asked how they were doing in the alternate-shot game. The skinny guy says \"Well let's see, we were two under so that birdie makes it three\". I was like \"You mean Net 3-under\" and he says \"No, just regular 3-under\". In alternate shot. So anyway, that's the last time I payed any attention to what club another person uses. Learned that lesson real well and it stuck with meThats what i thought...............What do you really know about him??Based on my 7.5 years at a golf retail store, I can hopefully provide some information on this topic. Does it really matter whether the person is lying about their swing speed\/smash factor\/carry or total distance? No. At the end of the day I sleep fine. But as one poster pointed out almost right away, was that it does help the person to level them back to reality whether the OP realizes it or not. I'll give you an example. If I took everything I heard people tell me at my job for the truth, my average driver sale would be along the lines of: 8.5*, low launch, low spin, extra stiff shaft. That's a really large discrepancy compared to the study the USGA or Golfdigest (I can't remember) did a few years ago when they studied the average driver distance of players and found that most people do not hit over 215 yards when measured correctly.\n\nHmmm....who do you think is lying here?\n\nIt comes down to three important factors:\n\n1) Ego. People watch the tournaments and they see Rickie Fowler or Bubba Watson for example, who are like string beans, it looks like not an ounce of muscle on them, and they easily hit it 290-300+ all day long. So the average male, gets intimidated by this, thinking \"I'm stronger than they are, so I MUST be able to hit it just as far, if not farther than they do.\"\n\n2) Somebody mentioned it above as well, that course markers and scorecards make it seem like people hit farther than they actually do. Sure that Par 4 may be 450 yards and you only had 120-130 yards left in. But did you take into account the drop in elevation, the considerable tailwind or rock hard fairways? No. People don't, I know I don't take fairway speed into consideration, but I do take into account elevation changes. Also, a lot of these older courses that people are playing like your average muni track, may not have up to date, correct laser yardages. I don't know how many times I've been standing around the 150 stake to a middlish pin, used my laser to double check yardage, and it is out by 15-20 yards. Sure, these digital measuring devices are helping, but not everybody has the money to afford a GPS that gives them actual yardages off the tee.\n\n3) Again, this has been said before as well, people remember that one drive. Just like they remember that one girl\/guy back in high school or college. Sure, most of us all have the potential to score those big drives, or those incredible girls\/guys, or large, trophy-worthy fish, but on the average, it is not a routine occurrence. As the law of averages says, the meat sits between that 25-75% chunk of the curve, while some people luck out and are further towards the elite end of the spectrum and can hit the ball inhuman distances all day long with virtually no (apparent) effort on their part. This also ties in a little bit with #1. People who are the longest hitters in their group of playing partners, mostly assume they must hit the ball at least 260+, because their Uncle Fred, who is a good player and has been playing for years, HAS to hit the ball at least 240-250, because well, he just does all the time.\n\nI'll conclude with a little bit of evidence I have found, before I turn this into a novel nobody will read. I have found that the people who boast the loudest about how far they hit it, or how fast they swing, or how high they hit it, are just average frankly. It's the quiet guys who just want to get the right club for them and never mention a word about how far they hit are usually the ones who absolutely munch the ball. I had a guy buy a 910D3 off of me on Saturday, set to 8.75 with a RIP 60 Stiff. He swung between 119-125 on the simulator. His best carry was 315, and he walked out with it, despite my protests that he was likely better off ordering the same head in a RIP 70X to get a little more control. He didn't care, he liked the way it felt. Pretty simple when you don't overthink it huh?"}

The hitting mat itself has never moved when hitting balls, that concern can go away completely. The mat has some heft to it and it would take more than a golf club to make it move. As for storage, I believe the two piece combo is easier as well, since they can fit in a tighter space, taking up less room in the garage or shed.\n\nI originally purchased a small, 12\" x 24\" hitting mat at a retail golf store, not knowing what I needed.

{"text":"Andy: Hi and welcome to episode 8 of Home of Golf. TV and today I'm joined by Barry Rhodes the rules expert and we're just a few meters away from the R&A building on my left and Barry the first question I have for you. How long have been the R&A have been administrating rules at golf and has it always been that way?\n\nBarry: No, it's going back to the 18 and 17 or the 18th and 19th centuries there were several different club with different rules and obviously this wasn't very convenient when they started playing each other in matches so the leading clubs of that time are obviously R&A based here in St. Andrews to unify the rules and come out with one set of international rules and they did that in 1899.\n\nAndy: Yeah okay, that's it. And also what about the USGA, I mean there's a bit of confusion there how does that work?\n\nBarry: Yeah, they picked up on the same rules. They agreed to take the St. Andrew or the R&A rules in 1899. They published them themselves in 1900 but from then on to the next 50 years they went their own way.\n\nAndy: Okay and are there any differences between the rules now or is it just standing across both.\n\nBarry: Well they did come back together in 1952 so there is one unified set of rules that are used across the world and that has been the case since 1952 but there is still one rule which differs and unfortunately it's not going to affect most of us because it is to do with the hole in 1. In America and Mexico if you have a hole in one there's no maximum price that you can receive but in the rest of the world those of us that play under the R&A hospices the maximum prize is just 500 pounds or the equivalent in the local currency.\n\nAndy: That's the one difference between them.\n\nBarry: That's the only difference between the rules and you know that is what makes golf such a great game because we're all playing to the unified set of rules. If you're playing any other games, even things like golf or soccer or poker or even trivial pursuits. If you're in the game long enough there will be times where people are arguing about the next play on what the rules are so you need to have a unified set of rules and that's what we have in golf and if you don't like the rules then you're not playing golf. If you're not playing golf, if you're not playing to them you're not playing golf. If you want to play golf you play it to the one set of rules and that's what retains the integrity of this wonderful game that we play.\n\nAndy: So Barry what's the most confusing rule of golf that you find nowadays?\n\nBarry: Well the one that I think confuses most of us is nearest point of relief but I'm not going to go in to that now but that is an area that a lot of people get wrong. But I think recently we've had a few tournaments where players ball has been moved by the wind and the fact is that if you addressed your ball, if you grounded your club and if you taken your stance and the ball moves you have deemed to have moved it. A lot of people think that's unfair because it can be obvious that it's the wind that moves that you're still penalized but that's the way it is.\n\nThere is one way of if you like getting out of that. If you have taken your address and you see your ball oscillating on the ground, the thing to do is to quickly market again and lift it because as soon as you do that you have cancelled the fact that you have addressed the ball. That's the only you can cancel it.\n\nAndy: But Barry the number one question is, it's so impossible to learn the rules of golf, what have you done in the last few years to make it easy for us?\n\nBarry: Okay, you're right, Andy. And the easy answer to that question is to ask everybody to take the rules of golf book with them wherever they go. To take it out, read it and digest it but we know that's not going to happen.\n\nAndy: No.\n\nBarry: So most people learn their golf through things that happen to them on the golf course or things they see on the television when they're watching the tournaments and that's a very good way to pick up the rules. They go in to the bar, they talk about it or they go into the pawnshop and they ask a professional there and bit by bit they will get to learn the rules. But I have done something which I think will assist people to learn the rules; I have written a book with 999 questions.\n\nThese are questions concerning things that happen on a golf course on a day-to-day basis and of course there are answers there those references to the decision or to the rule. There is even explanations where necessary and it comes with a myriad of situations that might happen on the golf course.\n\nAndy: That's 999 questions and answers, is it like simple questions and the complex ones?\n\nBarry: Yes we've broke it out into 3 areas so those questions that everybody should know if they play golf at all. The middle section is for golfers who play competitively whether it's a society or club golf and then those of you that do know the rules as a 3rd section at the end which is more advance questions and I believe by dipping in and out of this book you will get to know your rules without really trying. You'll absorb the rules without really trying.\n\nAndy: Brilliant, thanks Barry. So this is the book 999 questions on the rules of golf. Barry where do we get it from?\n\nBarry: Well if you Google 999 Questions on the Rules of Golf or Google my name Barry Rhodes you will see that most of your bookstores are stocking it. If you want a signed copy, well then just email me at rules@barryrhodes.com and I would be very happy to sign it and send your copy.\n\nAndy: Really, say that again?\n\nBarry: rules@barryrhodes.com.\n\nAndy: Excellent, I appreciate it.\n\nBarry: And at barryrhodes.com website it contains a lot of information for people who want to improve their understanding of the rules of golf.\n\nAndy: I really appreciate that so hopefully all you guys out there. This is the book you need rules made simple with 999 Questions on the Rules of Golf. So that's the end of the show I hope you thoroughly enjoyed it and Barry, we are going to ask you to day, what's the most confusing golf rule they have ever had so I can lead them down on the comment section and we'll have a good fun rating them and thanks very much Barry."}
{"text":"How to Control Your Yardages\n\nCreating good birdie opportunities isn't just about firing your irons close. If your distance control isn't spot on, an arrow-straight approach may not find the green. To control your distance, you need to make minor adjustments to the way you attack each shot. Retief explain his strategy from three key yardages - 200, 150 and 100.\n\nLie of the Land\n\nThe first thing to do from any yardage is to assess the lie of the land around your ball and up at the green itself. These slopes, however small, will dictate the way you play the shot, as will the location of the pin. In this instance the ball is slightly below my feet while the pin is on the right-hand portion of the green, so it makes sense to hit a gentle fade. It's also easier to hit a fade with a straighter-faced club. At the same time it should offer good control when it lands on the green.\n\nClub Selection\n\nOnce you have determined what sort of shot you will hit, it is vital to select the right club. Remember to ignore what others are hitting and concentrate solely on your game and your distance. From 200 yards a 5-iron is usually the correct club for me, but after studying the particulars of this shot - such as the fact that it is playing uphill - I will hit a soft 4-iron with a gentle fade. Hitting a three-quarters shot will also help me keep the ball down, out of the wind.\n\nTake Control\n\nFrom 150 yards, an 8-iron is perfect for me, but whatever iron you choose make sure that you aren't hitting it flat-out. At the top of my backswing I'm in a controlled position. If you hit the ball hard from this range, too much backspin will cause it to balloon into the wind. To maintain a lower flight, take one extra club, grip down the shaft and swing easy. This will help you control both distance and trajectory.\n\nWeigh up Your Options\n\nFrom 100 yards out there are plenty of ways to get the ball close, so again you must think carefully about the conditions, the lie of the land and the pin placement. The wind is into my face here so I'll play a little 'knock down' shot to keep it below the breeze, it will also allow me correctly judge the spin giving me the distance control I need.\n\nFlight Control\n\nIf you are playing a 'knock down' shot make sure the ball sits back in your stance and close the face fractionally (if you don't do this the club will sit open at address). If you are after a higher flight move the ball forward in your stance.\n\nCommit to the Shot\n\nThe most crucial aspect in getting your yardages right is to commit fully to the shot - something that many amateurs fail to do, especially when they are nervous about the trouble that often surrounds greens. Whether you are hitting the shot high or low, remember that your weight should ALWAYS move onto your left side through impact. Never lean back as this will increase your chances of thin or duff strikes. In the perfect finish position, you right heel should be off the ground and your upper body should rotate to face the target."}

{"text":"Simple Shotmaking\n\nHow To Be A Complete Player\n\nBy Tom Stickney, PGA, With Mike Chwasky, Photos By Warren Keating\n\nBall Position\n\nBall Back To properly position the ball back in your stance, play it off the middle of your right peck. I recommend this position any time you want to produce a low-trajectory shot or one that moves from left to right. Don't play it too far back, however.\n\nBall Centered A ball that's properly positioned in the middle of the stance should be placed off the middle of the sternum. If you want to produce a medium trajectory, this is the proper position. A fade or draw can be played from here.\n\nBall Forward To properly position the ball forward in your stance, place it opposite your left armpit, or just inside your left heel. This position lends itself to high-trajectory shots and facilitates a draw. But don't play the ball forward of your left instep.\n\nSpine Tilt\n\nSpine Back In a \"normal\" address position, you should have just slightly more weight on your back leg than your front, but with the spine tilted away from the target, you'll have significantly more weight on your back foot than normal. This position at address will tend to promote a more ascending strike, and a high shot will almost always result. Be careful not to tilt back too much, or you'll risk hitting some bad hooks and could develop a serious back injury as well.\n\nSpine Neutral Due to the rear hand being lower on the grip than the forward hand, your spine will tilt away from the target at address even when you feel you're in a neutral position. This slight bend away from the target places approximately 55 percent of your body weight on your rear foot, which is necessary with a driver to promote favorable launch conditions and adequate carry. This should be your standard address position because it allows you execute all types of shots.\n\nSpine Forward Hitting the ball on a lower trajectory than normal requires a spine angle that can range from centered to slightly forward leaning (toward the target). This alteration in spine tilt causes your body weight to shift toward your forward foot at address, which hinders your ability to make a long, flowing backswing. Instead you'll feel yourself making a shorter backswing with less wrist hinge. Don't lean too far forward, or you won't be able to rotate at all."}

{"text":"Question re shaft length\n\nAdjusting your stance for the length of the club is a compromise, it should be done the other way around, adjust the club for your stance providing your stance is correct.\n\nYou are basically saying you need to alter the angle of tilt at your waist\/hips which might not feel that natural. ie if you are extremely tall and you want to be tilted a long way by all means play short clubs\n\nClub fitters would be out of business!\n\nPlay it as it lies, get on with it, its not life or death, its just a game!\n\nStink, You hit the nail on the head mate, so many factors need to be considered when fitting people. If some one is making swing changes their lie angle and shaft lengths can change. I have seen golfers lie angles change 2 degrees either more flat or more up right. Just say a guy had excessive forward flexion with his upper body so he's bent over 25 degrees in back swing or at address and is 35 degrees bent over at impact. This fault will cause him to need flat lie angles and shorter length. As he improves his swing and turns better around his spine and is 25 degrees bent over his lie angle change to be more upright and will require more length.\n\nWhat a good coach\/fitter would do is for starters, fit them in between so the player stops making compensations and start to make changes. As the golfer improves the fitter\/coach can add length and adjust the lie angle, so as the golfer is improving he can progressively adjust to the changes of his euipment.\n\nVice versa for some who has extension of the upper body in back swing or at address they are 25 degrees and at impact on 15 degrees bent over. They would need more length and more upright clubs. Again as they improve and turn around their spine better and not extend as much you would reduce their length and flatten out their lie angle as they improve.\n\nThese are only examples and every golfer is different of course, these are just examples of some impacts movement patterns can have on how people are fitted.\n\nIn a nut shell Stink movement patterns, swing mechanics have a significant impact on how you are fitted. As my swing keeps on improving I have to tweak my equipment to match my movement patterns and swing mechanics. If I don't the equipment stops me from improving, i revert to my old swing faults and not improve. I have had to change my lie angles and shaft 4 times so far. Now my patterns are more stable and now it's a matter of fine tuning my equipment is now stable and won't change all that much now.\n\nPeople are better off having a coach\/fitter because he understands their swing and tweak there gear as they go. Also a good coach will fit out doors because they know people react to ball flight. As he is fitting someone he can fit them towards the future changes and the golfer can see the differences in ball flight of what happens with the improve swing vs the old so when they are playing and see ball flight, they can tell the differences of outcomes with the improved swing and old swing mechanics or patterns.\n\nIf distance is your thing choose the longest clubs you can and have the lies adjusted so you can take your normal stance.\n\nOne proviso to this you need to be able to swing it at the same speed and make the same contact which is not easy to do.\n\nYou hit a wedge straighter than a 4 iron because the club is shorter.\n\nI prefer accuracy and distance control rather than distance and went from 1 inch over standard and upright to standard off the rack clubs.\n\nIf your clubs are 1 inch longer than standard and you are not tall you will either have to bend them flatter or reduce the tilt from your hips to have the sole flat which I consider compromise. ie stand taller\n\nDo we agree?\n\nPlay it as it lies, get on with it, its not life or death, its just a game!\n\nI'm not disagreeing with anything, I have no opinion about it, I'm just trying to understand why someone chooses 1 or 2 inches over, or what factors a fitter uses to decide on length of shaft other than just a measurement from hand to ground.\n\nStink you should have the same tilt (some call it angle) and arm position for all clubs. I have arms hanging from shoulders approximately 1.5 hand spans from thigh for all clubs..\n\nAll that happens is that the ball is further from your body as the club gets longer.\n\nPlay it as it lies, get on with it, its not life or death, its just a game!\n\nWhat happens to the all golfers who don't use this type of setup and don't adjust their stance instead they change the ball location further back in their stance for mid irons and wedges? What about the guys who move the ball back and forward in their stance to hit draws and fades as well?\n\nWith hip tilt this also causes the shoulders to right lateral bend which leads the back issues and also causes break down in their swing patterns. The spine kinks it causes the upper body to slow down too early and causes the arms to accelerate too early, which cause the club to release to early. Why would you recommend hip tilt for?\n\nie. The bend at the hips and the angle formed between lower body and upper body.\n\neg Wie was bent over when putting so her upper body was parallel to the ground (almost 90 degrees) whereas somebody anchored at the chin putting is virtually upright (almost 180 degrees)\n\nIn my opinion this angle is almost constant for all clubs no matter where the ball is in your stance re back\/forward.\n\nTilt is also automatic as your right hand is below your left and therefore there will be a tilt with left shoulder higher than right and the hips follow unless you are into contortion.\n\nPlay it as it lies, get on with it, its not life or death, its just a game!\n\nNice one Shanks, The hips and shoulders are perpendicular to spine and what you refer to in your words as tilt, the shoulders and hips are on the same tilt axis to the spine.\n\nAlthough this is where we have to consider as well, if a club is too short for some one this causes excessive right lateral bending to try and get to the low point of their swing to strike the ball. This can be another reason why some people need longer clubs to reduce the right lateral bending so the shoulders can turn perpendicular to the spine as much as possible. The shoulders and hips are perpendicular to the spine or same tilt axis to the spine."}

{"text":"I think you know that I know spin decreases during a shot. That's obvious to everyone isn't it?\n\nA ball hit with a non-horizontal spin axis is always curving, just as a putt on a slope is always breaking.

Initial ball speed hides the curve but it's not traveling on a straight line.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by k-troop\n\nA ball hit extremely hard on a certain starting path will maintain that initial flight path due to the strength of that initial force, which will nullify the effect of competing forces\n\nThe ball flight depends on launch angle, spin axis and spin rate. You can't hit balls that magically moves barely off the ground for 1\/3 of the flight and then suddenly takes off up and to the right. Bubba plays golf with the same laws of physics as anyone else.

For the first part of the flightpath, the \"greater\" force is the initial directional force (which, as we know, is primarly dictated by face angle).\n\nIf you graph out what you're saying, the curve that you depict will show that you agree with me. It's not an illusion--it is, in fact, rising at a greater rate (relative to run) in the middle of the flightpath.\n\nI think this is where you're going wrong. The ball is a ballistic object. The only forces on it in flight are gravity and drag (which can vary in direction due to spin). Once it leaves the clubhead, it has all the lift and forward velocity it will ever have, and they both start decreasing from that point.\n\nI think this is where you're going wrong. The ball is a ballistic object. The only forces on it in flight are gravity and drag. Once it leaves the clubhead, it has all the lift and forward velocity it will ever have, and they both start decreasing from that pointWell, the physics is sound. I haven't graphed out an equation, so I don't know specifically what the spin rate (or initial ballspeed) would have to be in order to generate an L which would exceed 9.8m\/s^2, but I promise you that the laws of physics allow for it. And what I've been seeing with my eyes for the last 25 years playing golf, watching golf on television, and seeing ShotTracker confirms my thinking on this--at least to me. It is possible that the spin rate would have to be something ridiculous like 15,000RPM, in order to create a coefficient of lift that overcomes gravity (although it wouldn't have to completely overcome gravity, since the ball already has enough vertical directional force to overcome gravity due to the IDF, so you'd just have to bend it a bit), and what has appeared to me all of these years to be the effect of \"lift\" is really some grand illusion.\n\nEveryone has seen this effect. You've tried to hit a knockdown shot into the wind, and it starts low, but you hit it too hard and the spin causes it to \"balloon\" into the wind. The ball will keep climbing into the wind, eventually traveling almost straight up, and then backwards. This is an extreme version of lift overcoming the IDF, becuase the wind resistance is amplified by the headwind, so less actual spin rate is required to achieve the same effect.\n\n\"The Magnus force can be thought of as due to the relative drag on the air on the top and bottom portions of the golf ball: the top portion is moving slower relative to the air around it, so there is less drag on the air that goes over the ball. The boundary layer is relatively thin, and air in the not-too-near region moves rapidly relative to the ball. The bottom portion moves fast relative to the air around it; there is more drag on the air passing by the bottom, and the boundary (turbulent) layer is relatively thick; air in the not-too-near region moves more slowly relative to the ball. The Bernoulli force produces lift. (Alternatively, one could say that \"the flow lines past the ball are displaced down, so the ball is pushed up.\")\"\n\nIn the case you mentioned, the headwind quickly kills the forward speed, while having much less effect on the upward velocity and lift, so the ball appears to go straight up. But if there were no wind, the ball would go just as high, but it wouldn't look like it, because it's going away from you so fast that you don't have to look up to see itThe ball is always curving. Just because you don't see it doesn't mean it's not happening. Reference my putt example: speed plays a role, but the ball will actually curve more over the same period of time when it's traveling faster than when it's traveling slower. Just like with a putt.\n\nPart of why you don't see it? The same change of direction (say, five degrees) when the path is directly away from you (call it 0\u00b0) is less noticeable than the same 5\u00b0 delta when the ball is moving 15\u00b0 from \"straight away\" from you because we track curvature as left\/right.\n\nAnyway, the physics of hitting a curved shot aren't really the topic here, so let's put a cap on all of that.\n\nObviously the double eagle is the rarest thing in golf, and his shot was incredible.\n\nHowever, given the setting, the pressure, and circumstances, I'm leaning towards Bubba's shot. To be able to drop it to 10 feet from that lie with that much pressure is amazing.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nEven Oosthuizen would admit that the double eagle was just dumb luck - aim, grip and rip, while Bubba's shot was intended. Perhaps the result was better than he expected, but none the less it was a planned shot.\n\nI've pulled off the type of shot Bubba hit - intentionally, too - and it was a couple years ago when I was considerably worse than I am now. However, I've tried quite a few other times with less-than-desirable results.\n\nThat's not to take away from Bubba's shot, though. When I saw it live I was pretty excited that he executed it so well. Out of Oosthuizen's and Bubba's shots, I would say Bubba's, solely because of the circumstances. Had it been during any other moment of the tournament, I probably would have reacted much differently, but it becomes a lot more special when it's an incredibly clutch shot to win The Masters.\n\nI can't really pick one over the other, though. Both were extremely important in achieving the final result of the tournament. Had Oosthuizen not made his albatross, there would not have been a playoff. Had Bubba not executed his shot as well as he did, there may have been a different result of the playoff.\n\nBoth were amazing shots to be honest. I don't understand where the degrees of luck come in. We could say that for so many golf shots. What about the 2 hole in ones? Luck?\n\nObviously with that sunday pin position guys are purposefully aiming for that bank to bring it back down to the cup. That's not to say they are genuinely trying to hole out from the tee, but that is kinda the intention.\n\nLouis knew the pin position and there's no other way to really get the ball down there with the pin tucked away as it is. And he hit literally the perfect shot to do so. Kuchar's shot on 15. Luck? Or a great shot? He was trying to land it short of the pin and roll it up? Where it ended up we were all saying amazing shot. If it went it we'd have been saying luck. It's the same thing to me. Luck is a tricky old wench to work out. But Louis was intentionally playing to those contours of the green and pulled it off. Just as intentionally as Bubba was playing his on 10th. So I think it's a little unfair to differentiate them in terms of luck.\n\nWoa I don't even know how people are comparing the two. Okay a double eagle is good... but it's not something you can repeat. Louis hit a good solid shot andWoa I don't even know how people are comparing the two. Okay a double eagle is good... but it's not something you can repeat. Louis hit a good solid shot andThe question could be which shot is more repeatable and I say it's Bubba's not Louie's. The chances of a pro golfer hitting the controlled hook that Bubba hit are better than hitting Oostie's iron to that exact spot. Yes it was lucky but that was the shot he wanted to hit and he pulled it off. Of course this takes out the pressure factor but I think Oostie's shot was the better one."}
{"text":"Why do people \"trash\" courses?\n\nI am wondering why people leave their litter all over disc golf courses? I installed a new course at Black Butte Lake (a Federal Park outside Orland CA) last Friday (12\/18\/09). Yesterday when I went out to meet some Rangers to discuss how things are going so far, I picked up a 6 PACK of Natty Ice, 1 Coors can, a 2 liter soda bottle and an empty bottle of JAGER! All on the first 9 holes! What's up with that? How is it that disc golfers have so little respect for themselves, our courses and other park users? You would think it would be otherwise, but again and again it is proven not to be the case...\n\nHere in Michigan most courses it seems to be not such a problem, but there is one particular course that you would think is built on a trash dump.\nI have found that the people who are leaving all the trash on the ground are mainly just the people who are out there to party and get a tan. They don't give a crap about the course.\nThey are also the people who vandalize the course all to hell.\nIt is hard what to say to do about it you just gotta hope the others who are playing around them look out for the course when you see people acting a fool.\nIts a shame isn't it??\n\nMost of the courses in this area are very clean, Rolling Hills, Hudson Mills, Kennsington, Willow, Independence lake, The ponds. There is only one course particularly that I am thinking about and if you are from the area you should know exactly what course I am talking about.\n\nHopefully at Knollwood...the new regime is going to take care of that problem. In other courses in the area, I find trash cans not dumped could be the problem for trash on the ground. I find alot of coursees have trash cans provided, but dont' dump the trash that's in them. Possibly the reason for accumulated trash elsewhere on the course. JMO.\nK.\n\nI think it stupid when i go out to a course and they is stuff all over and all the bums have dumped out all the trash cans on the course to find cans that respectful golfers have thrown a way. it would be nice to have one can for recyclables so if a bum does come by he doesnt just dump the trash everywhere. i know not many states have to worry about things like that but it happens in MI a lot because cans are 10 cents. i also live in a college town so when a bunch of kids who dont go out discing more then once in a great while they dont care about the course and they destroy all of the trash can that are there by kicking them in."}
{"text":"However, the same can't be said for anchoring, though a decision is likely in the coming months.\n\n\"I think it's incumbent on us to make our position reasonably clear in months rather than years,\" Peter Dawson, chief executive of the R&A, said about the anchoring issue while attending the Open at Royal Lytham & St. Annes Golf Club.\n\nMike Davis says the complication of defining the act is the current topic for discussion.\n\nAccording to Davis, who became the USGA's seventh executive director in March 2011, equipment is off the table and the focus is solely on the stroke itself.\n\n\"If you want to ban something, what do you want to ban? Because you just say the word anchoring, it can mean a lot of different things,\" Davis said in outlining the difficulty of any rules change. \"And it's not just putting, either. There are clubs that come out that you can literally put \u2013 people that have yips with the pitch shots \u2013 there are clubs now where you can anchor a club underneath your armpit and pitch that way. The point is, there's a lot more to this than just somebody with a belly putting.\"\n\nI can agree with that. I've never had a problem with the length of the putter. I do have a problem with anchoring it to your body; whether the person is chipping or putting. I'm sure they come up with a definition of anchoring there are medical and legal terms for each part of our body so it's not that difficult.\n\n1) Is there any research\/facts to support that anchoring or the long putter improves putts per round? If so, by how much compared to a conventional putter? This would need to be averaged for numerous players\/skill levels (avoiding bifurcation), and rounds played.\n\n2) While an illegal golf ball or driver can be determined to hit the ball further, can a similar metric be applied to the long putter (i.e.reduction in putts per round)? For it to be illegal, this improvement would have to be NEARLY universal for anyone who uses one.\n\n3) IF, the long putter or anchor putter is so helpful in regards to the previous question, why doesn't everyone use one?\n\nI have never seen these questions answered in regards to the long putter or anchoring.\n\nD. I think I am right in saying Dave Pelz has researched the benefits of the longer putters. I think his study was from a purely technical aspect of the quality and consistency of the stroke\n\nIf Pelz research is right - that the longer putters are better - then there will be a whole generation who will never use the short putter. If you don't care about the short putter don't ban the long one.\n\nEnjoyed the comments. I had questions similar to D. a while back, then read some remarks that claimed the good putters don't need or usually utilize the long putter or anchoring. But it does make the golfers who are below average putters better, especially on the relatively short putts. And I think that is what Pelz has said, though I don't know if this is in reference to the long putter or specifically anchoring with the long putter.\n\nNot that it should play a role in any rule determination, but one thing I like about the long putter is, if one has back issues, practice with the long putter may be associated with much less pain. I think that is one reason Rocco initially went to the long putter.\n\nGive a 4 year transition or something like that, then ban anchoring - including the broomstick anchor where the club might not actually be touching the chest, but the fist or hand is. And @D as for why, it is against the tradition of the game, and that is reason enough. Prior to the last few years, peer pressure and frankly shame kept all but Sr golfers or basket cases from using it, but that has broken down. As for the argument that if it made everyone better, than all the players would use them - that is not needed. Right now it makes on category of player - those with yippy or shaky putting strokes - better, and that is problematic enough. If putting is supposed to be part of the game, having a semi-uniform way of swinging the club should set out in the rules.\n\nD. I would say the reason is because the hands must always be the sole controlling force in the gripping of any club- part of the challenge is that the hands are full of fast twitch muscles which adds to the challenge of the game- especially on the greens. Anchoring fundamentally alters that- it changes the nature of the game. Just my opinion.\n\njgw- I think it's because most pros believe that their hands , through practice, don't need to anchor or it might create a problem with feel. However,if you're Els and you are yipping- the anchoring rule is a godsend.\n\nAgree with Lloyd Cole - Ray Floyd had a bad back and short arms, and thus used a putter as long as his two-iron with a traditional stroke. Besides, regulating which club should be the shortest doesn't make any sense, you could move around the rule by stamping the word \"putter\" on the sole of your lob wedge and claim that you're in fact putting with your 48\", mallet-headed 2-degree driver. And if you stipulate that you have to putt with the shortest club in the bag, you are also removing the option of putting with anything other than your lob wedge should you break the shaft of your putter \u00e1 la Ben Crenshaw in the 1987 Ryder Cup.\n\nI just dont care that much about the belly\/long putter. I would much rather see the focus be on reining the ball in. Good putters dont seem to need it, bad ones do sure-but you know what-I like watching some of the good classic ballstrikers that cant putt continue to play. Scott, Ells, etc. 95% of putting still has to be reading the greens and getting the speed right.\n\nAnd whose to say golf shouldnt evolve? All other popular sports are constantly adding new rules and tweaks all the time. I think its kind of myopic to think that with all the changes in equipment, the one that probably has the least effect on results gets focused on.\n\nThink about the difference between a modern driver and one of 20 years ago and the difference in the way they would play. But putting equipment is always supposed to stay the same?\n\nI saw some times in the past few days when carrying one less wedge, and adding an extra putter that was seven feet long (one could anchor it on his shoulder and behind his ear) would give a player a huge advantage. There isn't any requirement to actually strike a ball with every club, but it would really help when taking relief. Mike Davis says it would be perfectly legal, although I suspect one's fellow pros might not care for the strategy. But if five feet is legal, why not seven.....why not ten?\n\nMy guess is that it is somehow easier to make a change regarding the game itself (ie: \"the stroke\") than to make changes in \"equipment\" that is allowed\/disallowed. Mike Davis at the Open was quoted as saying if there was a change made, it would concern the stroke. Fine, once anchoring is eliminated then the length of putter issue will go away - if you can't anchor, the longer the putter is, the harder it would be to control.\n\nIf you ban the long or belly putter, say good bye to 10 to15% of the day to day players. The usga can't afforded to loose any more players. Let's work on the ball and the pace of play. Remember the women's open? 3 hours for nine holes is a far worst crime than the long putter.\n\nActually, doing something about a ball that goes 195 yards (in the air, straight) when struck by a 7-iron under \"normal\" conditions is far more important than the putter. Still, I heard Sir Nick say on BBC today that only one long putter user did not make the cut. That number will get some attention. Just ban anchoring to the trunk, as jjshaka says. Kuchar's style will remain legal, as will anyone else who uses a long(er) putter, but who doesn't anchor it at a pivot point that is not on an extremity (no belly or chest or chin). Meaning also that holding the putter against the sternum or chin with the top hand will not be within the rules. So simple only the Bird Man tackler could fail to see it. \/s\n\nso people who hit 7.5 degree drivers (yes, they are out there, whether they should be hitting them or not) have to use a putter with more than 8 degrees of loft?\n\nNo, I think the suggestions above have the answer -- define what is legal and illegal anchoring and go from there. If someone has a bad back and they want to use a 38 inch putter, then so be it. Just don't smoosh it against your belly.\n\nTake a look at the Tour Putting stats, Strokes Gained, overall putting....these are not littered with long putter users. It's a mental benefit only, like those wrist bracelets some of them wear. When Stricker, Faxon, Christie Kerr, Loren Roberts switch its a problem.\n\nSorry to keep harping in this all, but they are not going to do anything about the \"club\". It will be the anchoring\/stroke that they potentially deal with - and rightfully so - that is what has people offended, not just the length of the putter. And again, if they ban anchoring, long putters will be a liability and disappear.\n\nFirst to those trying to reason that just because the top putters in stats don't have a long putter...are you serious? Can you not understand that a terrible putter may be better with an anchored putter but still might not rank the highest. If a guy goes unfairly from 115 to 40 in putting you don't think its an issue because he's not the best putter?\n\nAlso, I'd the r&a so busy they can't address both issues with putters and the ball? can't they fix both?\n\nA few months ago I read a several page article in a golf magazine about short versus long putters. From memory they used all sorts of tests including putts made from various distances and the Short putter proved to be the winner. I have used both types of putter and if I dont pick the right line, correct speed and make a good stroke neither of the putters works very well.\n\nWhen Jack, Player, Watson and Palmer are interviewed they always talk about the ball being wound back and not about long putters in the interviews I have seen. I think that puts the long putter into perspective.\n\n@Steve...jack and the others have already been on the record wanting to ban long putters. they've made it pretty clear about this. They still have issues with the ball so they are still answering questions about this, but haven't ignored the putter.\n\nOf course you still have to make the right read, right speed, and right line. Pretty obvious, but starting the ball on your intended line with a long putter is easier for most especially under pressure. I think that's the main benefit of a long putter. takes the nerves out of putting and makes one who struggles more consistent in their stroke.\n\nThe USGA is a joke. They can ban a putter that doesn't provide an advantage, but they can't ban the CHEATER LINE? Screw them. I don't give a damn about their arbitrary decisions as to what the game of \"Golf\" is. I already KNOW what it is, regardless of what they say.\n\nGolf means you don't use a cheater line because you're not allowed to mark your way to the hole. Golf also means that you use whatever fricking club and whatever fricking stroke will get the ball in the hole in the fewest strokes. That's the way it's been since the 1400s, and we don't need these meddling megalomaniacs to tell us what the game is or isn't. Frankly, at this point, most of their decisions are dead flat wrong, and contrary to the spirit of the game. They're almost like Kostanza on Seinfeld - we'd be better served by following the OPPOSITE of what their instincts tell them."}

{"text":"What Happened to Rory, Luke, Tiger, and Jim?\n\nTuesday, June 19th, 2012 at\n11:33 am\n\nAccording to the USGA the average score for men, women, amateurs, and professionals has not changed in the last sixty years. Statistics also show that very few golfers ever improve after their third year in the sport. This is difficult to understand given the facts that equipment (clubs and ball) allow golfers to hit the ball farther and straighter than any time in history, scientists have identified the biomechanics of the perfect swing for various body types, and error detection equipment pinpoints precisely where individual golfers swings differ from the ideal. Weren't the technological and scientific advances meant to help all golfers improve? If they had, wouldn't we have seen an across the board improvement in golfers' ability to score?\n\nThis is not to trivialize the great performances some golfers have been able to achieve. Nor is it an indictment of qualified professional instructors who have helped golfers achieve these performances, but something seems wrong. Is it that some people are meant to play golf and others not. If it were, all the technological and scientific advances would have helped tour professionals and elite level amateurs lower their scores. They haven't!\n\nThis past week we saw Luke Donald and Rory Mcilroy, the number one and two payers in the world miss the cut in this year's US Open at The Olympic Club in San Francisco. We also saw Tiger Woods fade away on Saturday and Sunday after being tied for the lead going into the weekend where he would have dominated in the past. We saw Jim Furyk's hopes dashed on Sunday after the USGA shortened the 16th hole by about 100 yards. He didn't know how to play the hole and succumbed to pressure, a fact that was often repeated by the TV commentators.\n\nWhy do great players 'lose it'? Why do they play well one week only to fall apart the next or play well for two days and then play poorly the next two days? Why do they ever hit the ball poorly? They have great swings and have honed them on the range for years. Why do the greatest players in the game feel it necessary to retool their swings to be able to compete? They've been competing quite fine for a long time. That's why they're the best in the world. Why do some golfers find it difficult if not impossible to develop even mediocre levels of performance? Why do some golfers have great practice swings that disintegrate into a series of slashes, swats, and lunges every time they have to hit the ball? Why do some golfers practice better than they play? Why do most golfers succumb to pressure more times than not, even those who have reached the pinnacle of success? Why is golf the greatest yet most frustrating game ever created by man?\n\nProfessionals from inside and outside the sport have addressed this perplexing problem, including professional club fitters and manufacturers, teaching pros, nutritionists, fitness experts, Sport Psychologists, and Sports Vision specialists among others. Each have contributed to our knowledge and understanding. Professionals from each of these area of expertise have assisted a number of golfers perform better. Yet we haven't seen consistent improvement across the board. The sixty year trend reported by the USGA continues. What are we missing?\n\nI have my ideas and I'm sure you have yours. Over the next several weeks I will offer several opinions and potential solutions. I welcome your comments, questions, and criticisms. Maybe through an open dialog we will begin to change the state of the game.\n\nOne Comment\n\nI teach a golf swing and do not concern myself about the golfers ability to score but I want to address golf scores because the problem dates back to the beginning of the sport.\n\nWalter Travis wrote about it and so did Sir. Walter Simpson in 1887. The problem will never go away because of man's ego to be stronger and men in golf pride themselves on how far they can hit the ball not how low they can score. It will never change except for a few so the effort must be made to provide them Knowledge, Application & Feel without them realizing it. Judgment (scoring) can't be adequate until one knows what they are doing and why they are doing it.\n\nAs to the psycological aspects of scoring and winning, well I can't speak on that issue because it fades also. No golfer can keep up the intensity it takes to win all the time unless it's a scratch golfer playing a 15 handicap and even under those circumstances the best mind set of the scratch golfer may fail thus providing a loss.\n\nDan\n\nThere is no clear cut issue for Tiger Woods,the irony for me is now I root for him to win and he doesn't and before I wanted others to win but not him and he did. His ears are open to a few who don't know the right words and the old words he used to hear are gone and dead, they talk no more so he looks through his eyes and hears with his ears but the picture and the sound is different on game day."}
{"text":"Do your putts ever bounce or get airborne? How do those putts turn out? Not so good, huh. When I teach putting, I stress the importance of solid contact in order to control distance. Solid contact is second only to club face control in the order of importance in a good putting stroke. The question is,\"Should you hit up on the ball or hit down to achieve the best roll?\" About 10 Years, I had the same question, so I decided to put a video camera on the ground to see what impact characteristics produced the best results.\n\nWhat did I find? A ball hit with a shaft that leaned toward the target slightly produced a ball that had a small skid and then a consistent roll. The ball that was struck with a neutral to backwards leaning shaft tended to hop or bounce. Which way is going to be more consistent, the forward lean of course.\n\nThe worms eye view:\nEven though the golf ball weighs slightly less than an ounce, on a soft putting green it creates a slight depression on the ground (a hole perse). If you hit a putt on the upswing, you will drive the ball down into the front of the depression and the ball will hop.\n\nA Forward Press Helps:\nA typical putter has 3 to 5 degrees of loft on it. In order to get a consistent roll, the last thing you want to do is add more loft. Good putters tend to be neutral or take loft away at impact. This is why I like to see a slight forward press at set up. This means that your hands will be positioned just ahead of the club face. I use high-speed video when I teach putting and I have found that 4 to 5 degrees of forward shaft lean seems to produce the most consistent roll and contact. The more I use \"The Kure\" putting solution training aid, the more I like it because it forces you to get your handle forward at impact in order to make the green light to come on. So why not go ahead and start there.\n\nHit Down Not Up:\nIf you have always hit up on your putts for whatever reason, when you lean the shaft forward you will have the sensation of hitting down. If you are topping your putts, you are doing one of three things. 1) your lead wrist is breaking down 2) your weight or your head is too far behind the ball 3) your ball position is too far forward. Start with placing the ball a putter head length inside your lead foot.\n\nA drill to find low point in your putting stroke\nPlace the grip end of a golf club about 6 inches behind your putter as you set up to hit a putt. Hit putts as you miss the grip in your backstroke. You will feel your stroke swinging from high in the backstroke to low in the follow through. This will help get your hands ahead at impact.\n\nThis something that you can work on in the house on the carpet. Best of luck and I will5 Responses to 20 Days With the Guru, Day 4: A Forward Leaning Shaft (Even For Putting)\n\nI putt with a forward leaning shaft and a forward press. It's what feels comfortable to me, and, on fast greens, I get great results. However, most manufacturers are making thier putters with only 3-3.5 degrees of loft. My Odyssey #9 comes in 3 degrees (as do most Odyssey putters). With the forward press, combined with our slow, shaggy summer greens here in the South, I have difficulty avoiding driving the ball into the ground with what I believe is ultimately negative loft (when you factor in the forward press.) It's almost impossible for us mere mortals to get these manufacturers to send us putters with lofts other than what is standard. Mickelson (whose putting style is similar to mine) uses putters with 5-6 degrees of loft. Furthermore, Dave Stockton is ALWAYS saying that most people putt with too little loft on their putters. Just a comment.\n\nFred,\nGreat comment. I use a putter that is 3.5 degrees of loft as well. I try to get to a 0 loft if possible but you are right, the type of grass does have an effect and you can get your putter bent to accomadate your stroke assuming you are consistent with what you are doing, which doesn't always happn. Slower greens tend to need a bit more loft. Thanks for the feedback\n\nHi Jason,\nI've played competitive golf for 12 years (a few PGA Tour events as well) and have never had forward shaft lean\u2026I just can't do it. As a golf fanatic, I've obviously read about the forward shaft lean (my full swing is $ haha) but can't execute it with the flat stick. There are a few (Zach Johnson is the most prevalent right now) that are neutral or even behind neutral. As soon as I forward press, I lose all knowledge of my alignment, and my focus goes out the window\u2026.So, I went to a sport eye specialist, and went on the QuietI system, and found my right eye to be extremely dominant; and since I shoot left in hockey, my perception is all messed up. I've used the belly putter and had success because it gives my setup proof that I'm at least neutral. I've had my stance 30degrees shut to the target line, b\/c my eyes lied to me\u2026I thought I was square\u2026\n\nHave you ever encountered this and do you have ways to either address it, or make it work? I can putt crosshanded and claw quite comfortably haha!\nDo I need to use those alignment glasses as seen on Roy McAvoy a la Tin Cup??\n\nTodd,\nthanks for the comment. You have great insight from what alot of players go through. If you are not comfortable with a press, you can knock some loft off of your putter which will help the roll. Zach Johnson has a putter with 0 degrees of loft because he didn't want to change his style. Now he is the exception not the rule. Ball position has alot to do with it as well. With your eye issues, you must find the right ball position that allows you to aim. I recommend using a laser (or the kure putting solution) to check this. You might need to move it back a little to get the aim and also to still hit it on the downswing. As long as it is consistent there are alot of strokes that can work (see Mayfair). Your closed stance doesn't make sense from what you told me but if it works, don't change it. If you have played in some pga tourneys you obviously can roll the rock at times. Thanks for posting the video on your site. I think you product is very good. Best of luck and spread the word about my blog if you think it is worthy.\nJason"}
{"text":"Assuming a TD error has resulted in my new rating being slightly higher than deserved, should I contact the TD (again, because I already got it corrected once, but it seems to have gotten changed back in the update) or should I bug you, or go away, or what?No search like that I'm aware of. You can do advanced searches to narrow down by state and the cities of those events will be shown in that list. And it's pretty common that the same event will be run about the same dates each yearJen\n\nYou can do a search tath will actually provide you with all the SSA's of all the previous events - it just takes a few steps.\n\nFirst, you must know the name and date of a previous event on the course.\n\nGo to the \"official results\" for the event.\n\nAt the top of the event results page it gives you a choice of EVENT INFO\/COURSE STATISTICS. Click on Course Statistics.\n\nYou are then taken to a page that will show the course(s) used for the event. You can find further information on a specific course by clicking that course nameUse a google site limited search. In the google search box enter \"site: and the name of the course you want.More likely it is to prevent other web sites from scraping the data and providing rating services.\n\nDo you mean DGU? Have there been any sites other than PDGA and DGU that do any kind of ratings?\n\nQuote:\n\nits called DGCR\n\nThe DGCR reported average score and SSA do not correlate well in my experience. For example, DFW courses ranked by DGCR reported average round score (score\/par) for the most difficult permanent and commonly played tees, I get the order below (Bicentennial's data are normalized to 18 holes):\n\nI tried to duplicate the results by picking out PDGA tournament round SSAs for 18 holes and averaging them (18+ holes normalized to 18 holes for certain courses). I didn't take rounds from short, temp, or championship tees, and I avoided rounds with temp holes. The ranking is very different.\n\nThe novice men and intermediate women played short tees, which was an appropriate call for the course and their skills. However, there were not enough gators to produce unofficial ratings. There are some sub-800 players with quite a few rounds in their database. Do you think they might get ratings by some manual process like has happened sometimes at other tournaments where Intermediate and Rec women get short tees?\n\nJust eyeballing the data, the players' ratings correlate strongly with their order of finish. Diana felt like her rounds were consistent with her current rating and she shot similar scores to two men with a similar rating, so ratings generated off the best non-gators here would be likely to be as valid as if there had been sufficient gators.\n\nWe've been able to rate rounds manually when there aren't enough propagators so it shouldn't be a problem. Roger is close to allowing players with established ratings down to 750 to be gators anyway so this will be a good test.\n\nIn the interview on the front page, Jonathan led me to believe throw and distance will be used this year. Do you have any info regarding how Winthrop will be played? My league partner qualified and is really hoping I can help him prepare. Any info is appreciated. Thanks.\n\nSome of us tried to persuade them not to use throw and distance for 2011 (or ever again for that matter). Far as I know their plan is to use T&D again. I think you just have to ask them.\n\nWhy never again?\n\nAfter 6 years of playing the event I really felt they finally got it right last year...other then the 2 days notice. No corny buncr rule, no arbitrary spots, no lobbying for position, no burden on the spotters....just seemed to work and play really well.\n\n\n\nAs a \"B\" tier event, how does the world tournament fit into the poy and roy picture. Are there two tournaments, i.e. the world tournament and the local tournament? If so the round rating, if good, might be counted twice towards poy\/roy. Also, how is the finish position calculated for the \"world\" portion?\n\nA player's ranking within each global event division is simply based on the sum of each player's three round ratings. A player shoots a 990, 1000 and 1010 rated rounds and their score for the global standings is 3000.\n\nEach B-tier (British is A-tier) result will be just like any other B-tier in terms of POY and ROY. The Global rankings won't be used for POY\/ROY\/World rankings at least this year. Some events will have more than three 18-hole rounds like a Final 9 and those scores will only count for the local event standings.\n\nChuck, can you please tell us a little more about how round ratings change when made official due to being averaged in with previous SSAs for the same layout?\n\nFor example, if the previous SSAs for a course layout were 50, and then the next tournament had unofficial ratings indicating the SSA on the same layout at 46, would it be reasonable to expect the ratings at the second event to go up by 15-20 points upon being made official due to the averaging?\n\nNo old tournament data is ever used for averaging, only scores from different rounds in the same event on the same layout get averaged in the official process, but not in the unofficial process when scores are posted by the TD."}
{"text":"Importance of Proper Equipment in\nYouth Sports, Especially Golf by: Ahna Hendrickson, National Program Coordinator for Hook A Kid On Golf,\nprogram of the National Alliance for Youth Sports\n\nIn the days where technology has really stepped up to the plate developing quality equipment for beginners, the occasional golfer and the elderly trying to get back those 15-30 yards they lost from last year, I must ask why should it be any different for juniors? After all, those first experiences often determine the likelihood of a child continuing with the sport.\n\nWhen teaching a child a sport, naturally you want them to succeed. You want to see their eyes open wide and the smile on their face after they hit a good shot or throw and catch a ball for the first time. You want them to be safe, have good coaches and instructors and have the proper equipment in order to provide the best experience possible. Let's be honest, golf is not the easiest sport to introduce your child to. If we actually sit down to think about what one needs to get started with the game of golf it is pretty overwhelming: golf clubs, bag, balls, collared shirt, shoes, glove, tees, ball marker, etc. The idea of running out to find all of the above can be a little exhausting as well, not to mention expensive.\n\nIn order to provide access we need to eliminate such barriers which may prevent kids from learning the game of golf. It may seem like the obvious choice to eliminate the high cost of equipment and resort to hand-me-downs. You may be thinking, is it really that important to have proper equipment? Can't we just give a kid any old club, cut it down or tell them to grip down and be happy that they had a chance to play a sport they might not have had a chance to learn otherwise? Well, that's pretty much like giving a 7-year-old an adult size basketball and a 10-foot hoop to try and make baskets. It can be done, but the fun factor of the sport is taken out and fundamentals are not developed properly.\n\nIn my opinion, there is a time and a place for hand-me-downs and junior golf clubs is not one of them. Improper equipment in itself is often unknowingly a barrier. I think you will agree with me when we look at the results of modifying and cutting down golf clubs. When you cut down a club it will take a considerable amount of length off of the club, which in turn will change the flex on the shaft and make it significantly more stiff and difficult to hit, which for a junior golfer is not in their favor. The impact of a stiff shaft, when not needed, will cause the ball to have less loft, which means it will be harder to get the ball in the air and may often go several yards off to the right (for a right-handed golfer). Also, many hand-me-down golf clubs are too heavy because of their steel shafts and weight in the club head which makes it difficult for junior golfers to take the club back and through during the swing in order to create club head speed. It may also cause kids to become tired and give up on golf all together.\n\nIn my days as an assistant golf professional, I can't tell you how many times I heard \"It's OK, he'll just use his older brother's clubs and choke down on them.\" In certain circumstances this is alright, but knowing that choking down on the club changes the lie angle and will have an impact on ball contact is an issue I must inform people about.\n\nIf a cut down club is the absolute only option when determining if a kid will be able to play, I would obviously say go ahead, just know what the possible outcome will be when kids are struggling to get good results and are not enjoying the game. We want to provide a safe, enjoyable and positive experience for kids in all youth sports. Why should golf be any different?\n\nWhy Hook A Kid On Golf? Hook A Kid On Golf, a program of the National Alliance for Youth Sports, has been eliminating barriers and providing youth with access to the game of golf since 1990.\n\nOne of the reasons why Hook A Kid On Golf is the best when it comes to junior golf programming is the quality of equipment. Each child is provided with a set of Tour Edge golf clubs which is fit specifically to their height and has youth flex shafts. All Hook A Kid On Golf Tee Level Clinic participants are able to take their set of clubs home with them at the end of the week and encouraged to continue to play.\n\nHook A Kid On Golf receives grant from the United States Golf Association to help provide\ngolf opportunities to underserved children by: Linda Alberts, Public Relations Coordinator\nfor the National Alliance for Youth Sports\n\nWest Palm Beach, Fla.\/February 5, 2013 \u2013 Hook A Kid On Golf has been awarded a $75,000 grant from the United States Golf Association (USGA) to support the growth of junior golf in local communities nationwide. The grant will help Hook A Kid On Golf reach approximately 75 communities this summer and give 1,200 underserved youth an opportunity to learn and play golf.\n\nThe funds will be used to match fundraising efforts of organizations providing sponsorships for youngsters to participate in Hook A Kid On Golf's Tee Level Clinics. The clinic is a week-long event where youngsters receive introductory golf instruction, as well as education about golf rules and etiquette and even life skills lessons like being a good student-athlete and nutrition\/hydration. As part of the clinic each child receives their own set of golf clubs to keep, as well as a golf shirt, a hat and golf balls.\n\n\"For more than 20 years the USGA has been a tremendous supporter of the efforts of Hook A Kid On Golf. A large part of the program's success is directly attributed to their continued support through the annual matching grants,\" said Andy Parker, director of youth development programming at the National Alliance for Youth Sports. With USGA support, Hook A Kid On Golf has been able to bring the game of golf to more than 75,000 youngsters.\n\nHook A Kid On Golf, a youth development program of the National Alliance for Youth Sports, was developed in 1991. It's a comprehensive junior golf program that teaches children the game of golf and provides emphasis on golf's rich history, rules and etiquette.

The Loudoun County Juvenile Court Services has concluded their first season of the National Alliance for Youth Sports' (NAYS) Hook A Kid On Golf program as a part of their \"Helping Our Probationers Excel\" initiative.\n\nTheir Hook A Kid On Golf site is overseen by Darryl Whiten, coordinator of the supervised release program and probation officer at Loudoun County. Previously, Whiten was the Hook A Kid On Golf liaison for the state of Maryland. While in Maryland, he witnessed the positive effects the program had on the group of children he worked with.\n\nNow he wants to offer the youth of Loudoun the same benefits.\n\n\"Being able to start this program in Virginia is truly a blessing,\" said Whiten. \"It allowed me to give our youngsters hope and opportunity.\"\nLoudoun County Juvenile Court Services offers Hook A Kid On Golf to teens ages 12-15 on probation.\n\n\"We don't have to lock them up,\" Whiten said. \"We can lift them up, and when you can lift up a youngster, you're raising their self-esteem. When their self-esteem is good, then they can make better decisions and start to feel proud about who they are.\"\n\nWhiten recalls a few standout examples of Hook A Kid On Golf in action in the community. For example, after completing a Hook A Kid On Golf clinic, one youth has gone on to join the Loudoun Valley High School golf team. A couple other past participants are now employed at one of the local golf courses.\n\nThe probation office funds the transportation to pick up the kids and take them to the golf course. Others have also stepped up to make Hook A Kid On Golf possible in the community. Some of the local golf courses have invited the Hook A Kid On Golf participants to play on their courses for free and their instructors even provide free lessons.\n\n\"You hear about the benefits of sports a lot, but to actually see how they can make a difference by improving someone's life is amazing,\" said Andy Parker, director of youth development programs at NAYS. \"Loudoun County Juvenile Court Services has incorporated Hook A Kid On Golf into their program in a unique way that is truly making a difference, and for that we are proud to recognize them as the 2012 Hook A Kid On Golf New Site of the Year.\"\n\nNational Alliance for Youth Sports names\nAhna HendricksonHook A Kid On Golf's National Program Coordinator\n\nWest Palm Beach, Fla.\/January 15, 2013 \u2013 The National Alliance for Youth Sports, America's leading advocate for positive and safe sports and activities for children, has announced Ahna Hendrickson as the national program coordinator for Hook A Kid On Golf.\n\nHendrickson will be responsible for enhancing Hook A Kid On Golf's presence by promoting the program to potential new sites, as well as strengthening relationships with more than 200 sites currently offering the program.\n\nFrom her own experiences playing golf through high school and in college at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville, Hendrickson has first-hand experience on the impact golf can have.\n\n\"Golf provides kids the perfect combination of competition and sportsmanship,\" she said. \"It provides the opportunity for them to learn etiquette and real life skills on the course as well as help them develop a hard work ethic while practicing their short game or swing mechanics on the practice facility.\"\n\nMost recently, Hendrickson served as an assistant golf professional at Admiral's Cove in Jupiter, Fla. \"I'm excited to be a part of the difference youth sports makes in the lives of kids while staying involved in golf,\" she said.\n\nHook A Kid On Golf has been providing America's youth with quality golf instruction for more than 20 years.

The show also explores how those early experiences helped shape Engh's tireless efforts these days to help ensure that children have positive and rewarding experiences in all sports.\n\nEngh created the International Alliance for Youth Sports (IAYS), a division of NAYS, nearly a decade ago to help impact the lives of children in poverty-stricken regions of the world.

More than 120 children have participated in this site's Hook A Kid On Golf program over the past four years; however, the recent success of one player really stands out.\n\nIn November 2010 a virtually unknown junior golfer won the Maine girls' state golf championship at Natanis Golf Course in Vassalboro, upsetting the favorites. That winner was Alison Prescott, who began playing golf just three years ago through the Hook A Kid On Golf program.\n\nAs America's most comprehensive junior golf program, Hook A Kid On Golf gives an understanding of the sport's rules, etiquette and history. \"I believe that Hook A Kid On Golf is a great program,\" said Michael Nadeau, manager of Fort Kent Golf Club and Hook A Kid On Golf site coordinator.\n\nHook A Kid On Golf is often a child's first experience with the game of golf. Although clinics may only last a week, the lessons they learn stay with them long-term. Many participants continue the sport at the high school and college levels while some maintain recreational play.\n\nAfter completing her first Hook A Kid On Golf clinic, Prescott became enthralled with the game. She joined the school's golf team, where she continued to develop her golf skills and began to play in a competitive nature. Prescott, a high school freshman, is the only girl on the golf team. She puts her early instruction from Hook A Kid On Golf on swinging, putting and chipping to good use because her coach has her play off the men's white tees during practices and matches. Nadeau cites this as one of the reasons for her success.\n\nPrescott also began to volunteer at the Fort Kent Golf Club by helping with tournaments and making sure the dispensers at the driving range had sufficient golf balls in them. She even had an agreement with Nadeau that if she picked up the range balls, he would let her hit as many balls back on the range as she wanted.\n\nThe two also partnered together for the club's annual Rocky Bullwinkle Tournament. \"The first year we played I carried us to a fifth place finish,\" said Nadeau. \"For the next two years Alison carried us to first place.\"\n\nBy gaining a foundation of the sport from participating in the Hook A Kid On Golf program, Prescott is an example of how players can proceed to advanced levels of play. As Prescott has clearly demonstrated in her short time playing golf, there is no limit to success if you are self-motivated, willing to put in the practice and if you are given the opportunity to be introduced to this great game \u2013 and Hook A Kid On Golf does exactly that.\n\nHow It All Began...\n\nMore than 20 years ago, the National Alliance for Youth Sports (NAYS) set out to design an instructional youth golf program that would seek to eliminate the barriers that traditionally prevented children from playing the game. With the help of select communities across the country, the United States Golf Association (USGA) and professional golfer Bob Murphy, that dream was realized with the creation of Hook A Kid On Golf.\n\nAn instructional youth golf program that also focuses on golf's rich history, rules and etiquette, Hook A Kid On Golf was designed with the goal of overcoming the exclusionary nature of this wonderful sport and to provide children with a lifetime activity to play beyond their team sports years."}

{"text":"By Andrew Dawes, SwingFix instructor\n\nIf you want to make more birdies when you play golf, that process starts by hitting more fairways.\n\nAnd there are two very important ways to hit more solid and straighter drives if you struggle with a slice.\n\nAll too often poor drives are a result of an angle of attack that is too steep. This means the club is still traveling downward at the point of impact.\n\nRemember, your driver does not have a lot of loft and to get the maximum distance and direction out of your drives they have to be launched at the optimum angle. Ideally, they need to be struck with a level or slightly upward blow.\n\nTo fix this problem, try tilting your spine away from the target slightly. Do this by holding the club upside down centered to your body and tilt away from the target until the shaft is in line with your forward knee.\n\nDuring your backswing try to maintain that angle and hit the ball with a sweeping blow while clearing your body and maintaining the same spine position. This action will get the ball struck solidly up into the air resulting in longer, straighter drives.\n\nHitting the ball straight and solid is also a result of the club swinging toward the ball on the proper arc with the face square. This can be illustrated by swinging the club near the base of a wall.\n\nSlicers have a tendency to swing \"over the top\" or from outside the target line to inside the target line.\n\nTry standing close to a wall and placing a mat at the base of that wall. Set the club head down on the mat with the toe of the club against the wall. Try to swing the club on an arc that does not strike the wall.\n\nThis exercise should give you the visualization that the club swings on a tilted arc on the inside of the wall at all times. It never crosses the target line and only travels on it for a very short period of time.\n\nTo fix the out-to-in swing path on the range you will want to feel the club swinging from the inside of the wall and down the line of the wall as the clubhead closes.\n\nRemember to do this somewhere safe because the first swing you make might have an everlasting impression on your swing, and\/or the garage wall!\n\nGood luck and for more great swing tips and personalized golf swing analysis, contact Andrew Dawes at SwingFix.com."}

{"text":"The short game can be the most tedious part of golf. It requires the greatest amount of accuracy and precision. The drive can be a good hit as long as it lands a decent distance anywhere on the fairway. On the other hand, a chip is only good if it lands within a five foot radius of the pin. A putt is usually only good if it goes in the hole, or on a far putt, stops within a one foot radius of the pin. Gain more precision on your short game by avoiding these common mistakes made by beginner golfers:\n\n1.) The bunker: hitting the ball; not the sand\n\nThe shot out of the bunker is different than any other shot on the golf course. With every other shot, the club should strike the ball. Many beginners attempt to hit the ball out of the sand the way that the ball would be hit from the fairway. This is wrong. To hit the ball out of the sand, the club head should hit the sand behind the ball, and continue to pass through the sand, under the ball. In this shot, the club displaces the sand, which forces the ball to fly out.\n\n2.) Chipping: wrists behind club face at contact\n\nMany beginner golfers have the tendency to make contact with the ball with their wrists behind the clubface, in an attempt to \"scoop\" the ball, and help it into the air. In a correct chip, the wrists should be cocked on the downswing. They should travel ahead of the clubface. At contact, the hands should be ahead of the clubface. The club should strike down on the ball, hitting the ball first, and then the ground.\n\n3.) Chipping: not accelerating the club on the downswing\n\nA lot of times golfers will hesitate on the downswing of their chip shots, trying not to send the ball flying past the green. Usually, a deceleration of the clubface on the downswing will cause the ball to be chunked. The ball will fall very short of the green. In order to correctly chip the ball, have confidence in your swing. Remember to accelerate the clubface all the way through impact, and into the follow through.\n\n4.) Putting: breaking the wrists\n\nThere are so many variations of putting that it is impossible to say that only one way is right. One common error though, is when golfers \"break their wrists\" while putting. In this case, instead of the putter making square contact with the ball, the putter strikes the ball at an angle. The ball will not travel where it was aimed. It is therefore crucial to keep your wrists locked while putting.\n\nBefore providing a set of exercises to utilize in the improvement of your game. We must first understand what comprises the golf swing from a biomechanical perspective. It is a functional athletic movement, utilizing the entire body in the execution of it. It is a \"feet to fingertips\" movement incorporating the entire body.\n\nIn order to execute the swing correctly specific physical parameters are required of the body. Basically to perform each phase of it efficiently and effectively certain levels of flexibility, balance, muscular strength, endurance, and power are required. If the body is lacking in any of these categories the execution of the golf swing will be hampered.\n\nKnowing these factors about the golf swing provides us the background required to determine the best exercises for golf. In general the ideal exercises for golf will develop these physical parameters of the body to enhance your game.\n\nFor example, the ideal fitness program would entail flexibility exercises to improve the ranges of motion in the joint of your body. This would enhance your ability to draw the golf club through the long ranges of motion required of the swing. One such exercise I often recommend for this section of a golf fitness program is Rotators.\n\nThe second set of exercises within such a program would focus on balance. The golf swing requires balance in order to develop tempo and execute each phase of the swing. Specific exercises such as Airplane Rotations can improve the ability of your body to balance within the biomechanics of the swing.\n\nFinally, a series of exercises to improve the strength, endurance, and power of your muscles would be a part of such a program. These exercises would improve the ability of your muscles to maintain a fixed spine angle, create rotation, decrease muscular fatigued, and finally develop more power. Numerous exercises can be incorporated into this section of the program. Some of my favorites are Seated Russian Twists, Medicine Ball Chops, and Tubing Rotations.\n\nTo summarize, the best exercises for golf develop the physical parameters of the body for the swing. These exercises will enhance your ability to execute the golf swing correctly and improve your current golf game.\n\nBy: Sean Cochran Sean Cochran is one of the most recognized golf fitness instructors in the world today. He travels the PGA Tour regularly working with professional golfers, most notable PGA and Masters Champion Phil Mickelson. To learn more about Sean Cochran and his golf fitness exercises and training programs go to \n\nProper alignment of the club face plays a major role in determining the behavior of every golf shot you make. This alignment is critical because if the face of the golf club is offset to the left or right of your target at impact, the natural reactions to the ball's flight path will cause errors in your swing path and angle of attack. It will also restrict your club head speed.\n\nWhen your club face is facing directly at the target at impact (hitting the ball \"square\"), the swing path is momentarily along the target line as opposed to across the target line. When this momentary alignment occurs, the entire force of the club head speed delivers a proper and direct forward blow to your golf ball.\n\nWhen your club face is facing right of the target at impact (hitting the ball \"open\"), the swing tends to naturally take a path from outside to inside, across the target line in an instinctive attempt to prevent the shot from finishing to the right. A swing that is across the target line from out to in can create both a strike that is too steep or too shallow. The awkwardness of the swing that is off center also inhibits a forceful swing, reducing the overall club head speed.\n\nWhen the club head strikes the ball facing left of the target line (hitting the ball \"closed\"), the resulting swing path take a natural inside to outside path of the target. Swinging the club head in excess from in to out will flatten the angle of the impact and often cause you to hit the ground before you hit the ball. This can create both thin and fat shots.\n\nJust working on this one area of your golf swing to deliver proper club face alignment will help your overall performance on the course. If your alignment is off, your natural reactions will take over and cause several other aspects of your swing to go wrong. Keep this at the forefront of your mind when you are practicing and playing a round. Eventually is will come natural to your swing.\n\nBy: Greg Schueler If you are just learning how to play golf or if you just want to drop 7-10 strokes off of your handicap, you need to go to  and sign up for Greg's free online golf tips newsletter.

This trio of tiny islands in the Caribbean is home to some of the world's greatest reefs and walls. Because of its underwater treasures, the Cayman Islands have earned its reputation of being one of the scuba diving hotspots in the worlds. Its temperate and weather the whole year round is mainly attributed to its location in the Caribbean which has protected the islands from storms. And because of its climate, it has been a prime destination for a variety of outdoor activities. Golf is also one of the attractions in the Caribbean. Grand Cayman Golf is increasingly popular because it offers a spectacular atmosphere.\n\nThe Grand Cayman is the largest of the trio. The other two islands are the Little Cayman and the Cayman Brac. The Grand Cayman hosts a number of luxury hotels and condominiums fronting the white sands of Seven Mile Beach. There are many destinations here for outdoor lovers, especially for the scuba divers. For golf enthusiasts, there is the Britannia Golf Club in the luxurious Hyatt Britannia; the 18-hole Links at Safe Haven; the Sunrise Family Golf Centre; and a nine-hole course at the Ritz Carlton.\n\nThe people of the Hyatt Regency hired Jack Nicklaus to design the Britannia Golf Club. As a trademark of a Jack Nicklaus design, the course gives any golfer a challenging but rewarding golf experience. The course features, rolling dunes, grassy mounds lakes and oversized bunkers that would definitely challenge any golfer's abilities. One special feature of this course is that it is actually a two in one golf course. It can be played as a Championship course or as an Executive course. The Executive course is usually offered during Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, but special arrangements can be made for tournaments and special events. Regulation play is played daily.\n\nGuests of the Hyatt Regency pay $90 for a nine-hole play and $140 for 18-hole play. Public fees are $100 and $150 but memberships may be availed for $1000 a year. Those who own Britannia Villas overlooking the courses may play for free.\n\nAnother Grand Cayman golf course is the Links at Safehaven. It is a 6605 yard par 71 world class course. The course was designed by Roy Case in 1994 and is situated along North Sound Coast five miles from George Town off Seven Mile Beach. The green was built to the rigid specifications of the USGA standards with a total course rating of 75.1. The landscaping utilized native vegetation with lush gardens of indigenous trees, plants and some flowering shrubs. Landing space of and average of 5,000 square feet is great for golfers.\n\nThere is also a private Grand Cayman golf course, the Blue Tip. The course is exclusively available to the Ritz Carlton guests. It was designed by Greg Norman. The Blue Tip is a Superb nine hole course but officials are talking of adding another nine holes to make the Blue Tip a complete golf destination. It is easy to see why so many people are traveling to the Grand Caymans for a golf vacation.

{"text":"The 5 C's for Competitive Golf\n\nEven the weekend warrior has experienced a time on the golf course when they felt the exhilaration of competition. Maybe it was the time you had to make par on the last hole to break your own low score, or make a putt to win a bet with your buddies, or even winning your club championship. It doesn't matter if you are in the hunt to win the US Open or trying to win a skin from your weekend foursome, the same mental skills need to be learned to give yourself a chance to come out on top. Nerves, tightness, and distractions are all apart of playing in a competitive environment. By learning the 5 C's any level golfer will perform better the next time they feel the heat of competition. Concentration The ability to stay focused on the shot at hand. Not allowing you to become distracted by the importance of the situation. Pressure creates distractions for most golfers. They begin to think more about the importance of the situation. This outcome thinking gets in the way of staying focused on the process of being in the present moment. A great shot is a result of being present with the current process. Take your focus away from what ifs and focus on what you can control. A golfer can use their eyes, self-talk, and routine to improve their concentration. Train yourself to concentrate on what you want, not on what you don't want. Composure As the pressure increases golfers are more apt to act differently. They allow the pressure to change their emotional state. Golfers who don't stay composed will act flustered, rush movements, and let little things affect their composure. Emotions can affect decision making and shot execution. The best stay at the same composed state that they played with on the first hole. Being composed is consistent from hole to hole. As the competition increases it becomes even more important to act calm, cool, and collected. Act as if you belong and are ready. Use your body and breathing to get back to being composed. Act like Tiger when he is playing in the final round of a major. Tiger is always composed when it matters most. Comfort Zone Competition pushes our comfort zone to the edge. Most feel uncomfortable as we have new golf experiences. The best push out their comfort zones by embracing the challenge and wanting to accomplish something they haven't accomplished before. Breaking out of a comfort zone could be as easy as defining the situation differently. Instead of looking at the new situation as something to be nervous about, see it as something to have fun with and embrace the chance to go for it. Calculate Every shot requires you to make the right decision for the situation. Under pressure each golfer tends to make decisions differently. Usually a golfer feels time moving faster and they end up making decisions quicker then normal. The skill of taking enough time to accurately assess the shot is needed to make the right decision. Also under pressure golfer will tend to make low percentage decisions and risk a lot more than under normal situations. The goal is to treat each shot the same and go through your proper mental routine that creates the best decision for you. When you can calculate what the shot entails and the risks involved you are more likely to be committed to that shot. When you are committed you minimize the affects of pressure on your game. Commitment Every shot requires total commitment for the shot to come off successfully. In competition golfer tend to doubt more often which creates poor shots. Pressure creates the mind to race to swing thoughts, past poor performances, and potential future disasters. Committing to a golf shot is the most important skill that any golfer that learn to improve performance. Commitment involves knowing your game, the situation, narrowing your possible choices to one. Commitment is confidence in your ability for each shot you attempt. Confidence can be changed in an instant with the use of visualization of past successes or visualizing the successful completion of the present shot. The next time you are playing in competition remember the 5 C's and you will be better prepared to hit a great shot no matter the pressure. Your mind tells the body what to do. Start training your mind so your body can just take over.\n\nOne Response to \"The 5 C's for Competitive Golf\"\n\nThanks for the article. Still working on my game.

Grip the putter very lightly trying to take the tension and hands out of the stroke and use your shoulders to stroke the ball.\n\n\u2022 Chipping Techniques: When addressing the golf ball, the ball should be just back of center with 55% to 60% of your weight on your lead foot (left foot for right-handed players), and hands slightly a head of the golf ball. This ball back, weight forward and hands forward set up will promote a nice descending blow to the golf ball and allow for the proper loft needed to execute a good shot.\n\n\u2022 Improve Your Backswing: A right-handed golfer begins the swing while turning their hips back and to the right. If the hips are the engine of the swing, the golfer should not have a problem remaining balanced. However, if you speed up the swing and lead with the hands or arms, you may affect a weight shift by swaying backwards with the hips, which could result in a loss of balance.\n\n\u2022 How to Play a Downhill Uneven Lie: The shoulders should be aligned with the slope of the hill. Position the ball one or two inches back from the center of your stance. The clubface will then come down the slope of the hill skimming the grass and lifting the ball.\n\n\u2022 How to Play an Uphill Uneven Lie: Align your shoulders with the slope of the hill. Position the ball one to two inches forward in your stance. You'll need to swing a little harder to get the desired distance due to the extra loft created from the slope."}

The main problem with this is that if you pick the wrong ones you will be out some money and even worse \u2014 it could hurt your game too!\n\nInjuries happen to everyone. If you golf for long enough, it is likely that you will have an injury at some time. It is important to know what kind of injuries are possible and what you can do to prevent them. Here is some helpful information on injuries and injury prevention.\n\nInjuries occur in all athletic events quite frequently, certain sports more so than others. Golf is no different than any other sport. The severity of injuries in golf usually are not as severe as in other sports. The scenario of a 300 lb. defensive lineman slamming into the side of your knee tearing every possible ligament structure in the knee will never happen in the sport of golf. An interesting visual if you combined the sports of football and golf onto the same playing field, but inappropriate for this paper.\n\nThere are two types of injuries classified by professionals in the fields of athletic training and sports medicine. The two types of injuries are: 1) acute and 2) chronic. The above example of the football player is classified as an acute injury. An acute injury can be defined as the trauma in the body occurring immediately after the injury. Refer to the football player example above for a reminder. (For us older golfers, remember Joe Theisman of the Redskins and Lawrence Taylor's leg breaking tackle? Acute injury.) Relating an acute injury to golf is a little more difficult. Probably the easiest, and maybe most the common, acute injury in golf, occurs while swinging and you hit a rock or something that creates an injury to your wrist. That would be the best example in the sport of golf of an acute injury. Overall, acute injuries tend to be rare in golf because contact by the body with external forces is rare.\n\nYour golfing equipment is just as important as your golfing skills. Even though they do not have anything to do with striking the ball, golf shoes are a vital part of your golf equipment. There is a lot to consider when buying golf shoes so here is some great insight into the wide variety of golf shoes.\n\nBuying the right golf shoes is just as important for your golf game as buying the right set of clubs or golf balls. Actually, if you think about it, they are more important. If your feet are not secure when you go to swing, you can and will lose your balance. Most golf courses do not require a certain type of shoes, but there are a few that do. If you play at one of the courses that require a certain type of shoe, you need to know what they are before you go shopping.\n\nThe first thing you will notice about your golf shoes is that they are lighter weight then your regular shoes and tire you out less. The next thing you may notice is that the bottom of the shoes offers you a more secure footing, allowing for a better swing. Not all golf shoes have cleats on the bottom of them, some have special designed soles and others have suction cups.\n\nYou may also notice that the style of golf shoes and the golf game have changed drastically over the years. No longer do you have one plain design with different colors, but now you have Clogs, Tennis style, Sandals, and of course, the dressier styles to choose from. The makers of golf shoes know that the more comfortable your feet are the better your game.\n\nIt does not matter how good of a golfer you are, you will eventually end up hitting a bad shot. It happens to everyone. What separates good from great golfers is how they deal with these shots. Below is a great perspective on these crucial shots.\n\nIt's every golfer's worst-case scenario \u2013 You're golfing great, you've got a perfect swing, the perfect stance, and you were able to get rid of that slice that's been on your back. NO matter how well everything goes, even the best golfer can find himself (or herself) occasionally stuck in a sand trap, stuck in the grass or trapped behind a giant tree on the golf course. Unfortunately, the traps are what make the game interesting. Without them, the game would probably become boring for even the most devoted golfer. Obstructions help to make golf a more interesting and challenging game, and you'll learn to appreciate the traps when you find the best ways to get out of them.\n\nThe odds that your golf ball will roll to a stop right behind a tree are slim, but it does happen. There are ways out of this situation. You could chop down the tree, or drill a hole in the tree large enough to hit your ball through, but that's probably not going to make the maintenance crew of the golf course very happy.\n\nThis golf season might be the time for some new clubs. One thing you might want to consider doing is getting customized clubs. They have the potential to make a big difference. Here is a great take on the benefits of customized clubs.\n\nThere are an infinite number of excuses in golf for hitting a bad shot, but few sound more irrational than blaming your clubs. But in some cases, blaming a bad shot on your clubs may not be ridiculous at all. Having your clubs fitted specifically for your own swing can have a massive impact on your game. If your clubs aren't fitted to your personal specifications, you could well be sacrificing critical elements of your swing to make up for it.\n\nFor an example of how big a part clubs play in your game, just take a look back at Phil Mickelson's win in the Masters in 2010. He basically had two different drivers in his bag, one which produced a draw and the other which produced a fade. And he didn't change his swing at all.\n\nNow I can't really say that there is a set list of benefits to getting your shafts properly fitted, but if you think about it, no two people's swing is exactly the same. So if you are using equipment that is set up for somebody else, then you are going to be sacrificing your own swing in an effort to make the equipment work.\n\nGolfers are always worried about their clubs, shoes, and gloves. They are forgetting about an important piece of equipment. The golf bag is a vital tool for a golfer. Below is a great article about the importance of the golf bag.\n\nGolf clubs usually cost quite a chunk of change, especially if you are buying some of the more high-end ones. If you spend a lot of money on a set of golf clubs, you will also want to buy one of the nicest carrying cases that you can. It is a great way to protect your investment in the long run as well as experience benefits immediately with your game. Read on to find out about the ways that great golf club bags can help any golfer. If you weren't completely sold on the idea prior to this, you may find that a change of mind is in order. Just don't rush too fast to the store to buy a golf bag!\n\nGolfers always love to try out different courses, and traveling is the best way to do that. Golf vacations can be had in almost any part of the world, and if you are planning on going one ever then you will probably want to bring your clubs along with you. When you bring a laptop on a trip, you are always careful to keep it safe from being crushed, sat on, stolen, or any of a number of other unpleasant things. If you buy a sturdy golf case that can hold its own against other luggage, your golf clubs will have a much higher chance of making it to your destination intact.\n\nAs the weather starts to warm up, I am going to continue my golf tips. Now that the weather is nice, we are all rushing to get out there and enjoy the weather. Below is a great article about swing speed that will hopefully make this golf season more enjoyable for you.\n\nWould you say you have a fast looking swing or a slow swing? (If you don't have a fast swing show this article to a playing partner who does). You would think that a recreational golfer's fast swing would hit a golf ball a long way wouldn't you? After all, it looks fast! Yet the ball doesn't go as far as a slow swinging pro's ball. I wonder why\u2026\n\nIf you think about your body for a minute, you know that it moves much slower than your arms in real life. So if your body can't turn all that fast, how do you get a fast looking golf swing? You get a fast looking golf swing when you try to hit the ball as hard as you can with just your arms. This means that your arms are moving independently from your body.\n\nBad shots are inevitable. They happen to the pros and will happen to each one of us. A bad shot doesn't have to ruin a round or a hole. All it takes is one good shot to get back on track. Here are some great tips on how to do just that.\n\nEveryone eventually lands in a bad lie. It's just a fact of life. Even a good shot sometimes ends up in a divot. Shots off the mark, on the other hand, sometimes land on bare ground or in the rough. Pitching successfully from a bad lie cuts strokes from your score and positions you for your next shot.\n\nA key to pitching from a bad lie is maintaining your focus. Pitching from a divot or bare ground isn't as tricky as it seems, if you do. In fact, it's fairly straightforward, as I've often say in my golf tips. It's just a question of selecting the right club and making a few adjustments.\n\nHere are 5 things you absolutely must do in order to chip well out of a bad lie:\n\nThere are some of us who love the driving range. It is a place where you can just relax and drive buckets of balls. The driving range can also be a great place to practice. This is a great article on how properly practice at the driving range.\n\nBefore a game of golf, many people practice first in order to be able to play their best during the game. Driving ranges are open fields complete with yard markers that tell golfers how far they have hit the ball. After paying for a bucket of gold balls, golfers use their own clubs to practice specific strokes and techniques that they may struggle with on the course. Those who enjoy golf will visit a driving range once or twice a week depending on their time and skill level in order to improve their game.\n\nDriving ranges are easy to find and most gold clubs have them. If you are new to the game of golf, you should practice first in order to improve in areas where you are lacking. Using different clubs and practicing different swing methods, your game will improve over time. You can also hire a trainer that will give you tips and advice on improving your game. Once you feel you are ready to play an entire game of golf, you can feel confident knowing that you will be prepared for whatever happens on the course.\n\nThere is no secret recipe to be great for golf. I know, I wish there was one too. Everyone's golf game is different. We are all trying to do the same thing but our swings are not all identical. That is why it is important to develop your own golf style and here is a great approach to that idea.\n\nYou really do need to develop your own golf style. Now, that may seem like an obvious statement, but some beginners think that all they have to do is imitate Tiger Woods' every move and they'll become an instant golf success.\n\nUnfortunately, it's just not that easy. There are no shortcuts to becoming a good golfer.\n\nTo begin with, no two people ever swing at a golf ball in exactly the same way. Next time you're at the driving range, stand and watch the rows of people slapping away and you'll quickly see this is absolutely true. Each person has their own unique body build and develops their own individual set of muscles. Therefore, the style of golf played by a person who is large and lanky and swings the club like a hockey player taking a slap shot has a whole different set of muscles than a person who is small and wiry.\n\nGolf will always be an individual sport and finding a style of playing that produces the best results for you will go a long way in determining how much you enjoy playing the game."}

{"text":"How other players can influence your game\n\nMany players fail to recognize that disc golf is, in the final analysis, essentially a game played between him\/herself and the course. If more people would grasp this, they would avoid a lot of mental pitfalls. However, although this is a basic truth, on a more obvious level the disc golfer is also competing directly against other people and thus is naturally interested in their games to some degree. The risk here is of emotional involvement in, rather that detached awareness of, the opponents' game. Many players, even at the pro level, have discovered that their own games can be adversely affected by emotional reactions to their opponents' play.\n\nThis happens because in disc golf a participant is not only a performer, but by necessity a spectator as well. And the way the player handles this second role can affect the efficiency of their own game as much as the way a disc golfer releases the disc.\n\nWhen the first player to tee off rips a 450 foot drive down the middle, the golfers who follow react in various ways. Many are threatened by such demonstrations of skill. They respond to the challenge by wanting to out-drive the person who has just thrown. Thus they immediately regress to the caveman situation of one man proving his superiority to another be some demonstration of brute strength. Their reaction is to throw with as much finesse as a Stone Age man smashing a club at a dinosaur. The result is almost always disastrous.\n\nOther players allow themselves to be overawed by their opponents' demonstrations of strength. Their minds flood with negative thoughts, their muscles turn to jelly, their knees become weak, and their nerves begin to unravel. As a result, when they step to center stage, they are so filled with doubts that their efforts become ineffective as those of the player who turns into a gorilla any time they are threatened by superior strength.\n\nAlthough these two reactions are diametrically opposite, the results are essentially the same: both players are victims of internal reactions to something that they have seen. Their emotional reaction to another's performance has devastating effects on their own game.\n\nObjectivity is spectatorship and is therefore another unique difficulty in disc golf. It is not easy to achieve, but is must be striven for. The successful player must not allow him\/herself to identify emotionally with actions of other's performances, and the easiest ways to avoid doing so is to recognize that these actions cannot in any way directly influence your game. Emotional involvement with performance in any sport should be reserved for the stadium or the television. It's fine with Brett Farve to be emotional as you watch him complete a fifty-yard pass, because you're not expected to get up from the bleachers, or your couch, and do the same thing. However, when you see a person crush a long drive, and you're up next on the tee, you have to walk up the same stage and try and emulate their drive. Anytime you let your emotions rule how you do so, you're in trouble.\n\nThe better touring pro players solve this problem by watching their rivals with a detachment that allows them to derive, from what they see, certain specific physical information that can be helpful to their own games. For example, they watch to see the effect of the wind on the disc, the way and distance the disc skips upon landing, the conditions of the ground if the opponent uses a roller; and so on.\n\nThe trick is never to get into the habit of making judgments about your own game by comparing it to an opponent's game. That kind of emotional approach courts disaster by opening the mind to all kinds of negative feedback.\n\nYou need to be a member of Minnesota Frisbee Association to add comments!\n\n***For the benefit of myself (it will help determine future posts) and all readers would you please quickly take time to rate the blog 1-10 when you're done in the comments section.\n\n1-that sucked, 2- boring and not informative, 3-I didn't wate me time-but still pretty bad, 4- I get it, 5- It made sense, 6- I liked it, pretty cool- I can see how that'd help my game, 7- good use of my time- a couple helpful points, 8-useful good stuff, 9-very-very helpful 10-all inner demons are gone because of this brilliant piece of writing!"}
{"text":"Increasing Flexibility?Not Stretching? Is The Fastest Way To A Better Golf Swing\n\nFlexibility is quite often a misunderstood principle, but most of us know it is important to golf. Before we discuss flexibility and its relevance to golf we need to start with: ?What in the #$%#%$#% is flexibility anyways??\n\nIt is a simple question yet one that is not easy to answer. I imagine that most of you come up with some definition that is something to the effect of ?Flexibility is stretching, right?? That answer is partially correct. Flexibility training incorporates stretching techniques. However, it is NOT limited to traditional stretching, and the two terms cannot be used interchangeably.\n\nWe Should Talk About What Flexibility Means\n\nAccording the National Academy of Sports Medicine, flexibility can be defined as the normal extensibility of all soft tissues that allow full range of motion of a joint. You will note that nowhere in the definition of flexibility is the word stretching used. To help further explain, understand, and clearly define flexibility, let us take the definition and break it down into three parts. The first part of the definition, ?the normal extensibility,? is best understood by thinking of the muscles in your body. Each muscle in your body has what is termed a ?normal length-tension relationship.? When the muscle is at its ?normal length-tension relationship,? it functions correctly. When the muscles contract and extend (i.e. when you ?flex? your bicep in the mirror, your bicep muscle is contracting and your tricep is extending) they enable you to create movement of your skeleton. Often, athletes cause a disruption of the ?normal length-tension relationship? through training, which leads to one muscle becoming shorter or longer than its normal length-tension relationship. When this happens, the body begins to have difficulty moving the skeleton in a safe and efficient manner, which will be magnified when trying to perform athletic movements.\n\nThe second portion of the definition of flexibility discusses ?all soft tissues.? This part of the definition is quite easy. As you know, the human body is comprised of numerous types of cells and tissues. Soft tissues are simply a categorization of certain types of tissues in your body including muscles, ligaments, and tendons.\n\nThe final part of the definition reads: ?that allow full range of motion of a joint.? Every joint (where two bones are connected in your body, i.e. shoulder, hip, elbow, etc.) moves through a specified range of motion determined by the design of the joint. The anatomical structure of a joint determines the amount, direction and type of movement through which a joint moves. This is known as the range of motion. To achieve a full range of motion, the surrounding muscles and connective tissue have to be flexible enough to allow the joint to move through that range of motion. To demonstrate what a full range of motion is, bend your elbow as much as you can (brining your hand as close to your shoulder as possible) and then straighten it. Each joint in the body has a range of motion that is unique to the design of the joint. For example, the shoulder joint is classified as a ball and socket joint, which has a range of motion of 360 degrees (a much greater range of motion than the elbow).\n\nOnce broken down, flexibility is simply defined as: every ligament, tendon, and muscle (soft tissues) in your body, having the correct length-tension relationship (normal extensibility) to allow every joint in your body to move through its full range of motion. This concludes the first part of this article. We now have a pretty simple working definition of flexibility. In the next section of this article we will discuss the question: ?Why is flexibility important to the golf swing??\n\nThe Real Meat of the Article?Flexibility and the Golf Swing\n\nSo now we have a ?working definition? of flexibility. We probably need to discuss the golf swing briefly to create the connection between ?your? flexibility and ?your? golf swing.\n\nBreaking down the golf swing, we know that it is categorized into different phases: address, take away, back swing, transition, down swing, contact, and follow through. Your local swing coach has probably discussed the importance of these phases of the swing in order to create a good swing. I am sure you also are aware that the body must ?move through? these phases in a certain sequence for a correct swing to occur. The key phrase when it comes to the golf swing and flexibility is ?move through.?\n\nGo back to the definition of flexibility. What does it tell you? In general, it says that every muscle, ligament, and tendon in your body must have the correct range of motion within itself to perform the activity you ask of it. Take that definition and place it upon what movements are required of the golf swing. It essentially states that your individual body MUST have the required flexibility parameters within every muscle, ligament, and tendon to execute the golf swing correctly.\n\nNow the kicker question: what happens if your body does not have the needed flexibility parameters to swing a club on the correct path? Is the answer, ?Forget about golf and go grab your fishing pole?? No, that is not the correct answer. Your body is a little smarter than that one wise-crack answer. If you ask your body to do something, nine out of ten times it will ?try? to do what you are asking it to do. When your brain tells your body to do this and this and this in a certain order, your body is going to try as hard as it possibly can to complete the task. The task (in our case the golf swing) may get completed, but probably not exactly as we would like. In the golf swing, this results in shots that we are really not happy about (slices, hooks, blocks, etc.)\n\nWhen the body does not have the needed flexibility to swing a club on the correct path is what we term ?compensation.? Compensation is the body?s way of making up for inefficiencies it may have within it. If you do not have the flexibility properties in, say, your hamstrings for the golf swing, your body will create compensation patterns in your swing to ?make up? for the lack of flexibility in your lower body. So the reality of the situation becomes that, regardless of how hard you work on your swing and how much you practice, until you correct the flexibility issues within your body it will be very difficult to correct your swing. So there you have it! The connection between flexibility and the golf swing is a very important connection if you are looking to make good shots on the course.\n\nHow do I get it?\n\nWe have discussed flexibility and the golf swing. You now have an understanding about the definition of flexibility, the importance of flexibility as it relates to the golf swing, and what happens if you do not have it (flexibility for the golf swing, that is). Now the final question to answer is: ?How to I get it if I don?t have it!? That is a question to answer in another article, or take a look at our web site  for more answers.

{"text":"Up and Down\n\nDefinition: The golf term \"up and down\" refers to the act of taking just two strokes to get the ball into the hole when your ball is resting off the green or in a greenside bunker. If you accomplish that, then you've achieved an \"up and down.\"\n\nImagine you've struck your tee shot and also hit the approach to the green, but your approach shot comes up just short of the putting surface. If you make an up-and-down, however, you can still make par. What you need to do is get the ball up onto the green with one stroke, and then down into the cup with another. Up and down.\n\nTechnically, you can use \"up and down\" to describe any two strokes that result in the ball going into the hole. But typically, \"up and down\" is almost exclusively applied to shots from just off the green and from greenside bunkers, situations where using only two strokes to hole out is the most likely positive outcome."}

{"text":"Why do golf balls have dimples?\n\nQuestion\n#42963. Asked by Hamlet.. (Jan 02 04 10:00 PM)\n\nrobboy\n\nTo make the ball rise, if properly struck. This area of science isn't my forte, and neither is golf if you've ever watched me, but when the club strikes the ball on a downward swing, producing backward spin and acceleration, the dimples, being cavities, produce lift to the ball.\n\nJan 02 04, 11:28 PM\n\nsequoianoir\n\nThe simple answer is to change the manner in which air flows around it and how it \"sticks\" to it.\nA spinning ball (of any sort including a very smooth one like a table tennis \"ping-pong\" ball) will change its flight though the air, generating \"lift\" with \"backspin\" or causing it to \"dip\" with \"topspin\".\nThe dimples specifically enhance and increase this effect. Additionally they lower the effect of drag and allow it to be hit further.\n\nThe dimples in golf balls, first introduced by the Spalding Company in 1908, can double the distance a golf ball can fly.\n\nJan 03 04, 8:40 AM\n\nsequoianoir\n\nThe reason why golf balls have dimples is a story of natural selection. Originally, golf balls were smooth; but golfers noticed that older balls that were beat up with nicks, bumps and slices in the cover seemed to fly farther. Golfers, being golfers, naturally gravitate toward anything that gives them an advantage on the golf course, so old, beat-up balls became standard issue.\n\nAt some point, an aerodynamicist must have looked at this problem and realized that the nicks and cuts were acting as \"turbulators\" -- they induce turbulence in the layer of air next to the ball (the \"boundary layer\"). In some situations, a turbulent boundary layer reduces drag"}

{"text":"Monday, April 16, 2012\n\nQ: My husband and I both love golf and we are finally finding the time to play together. Last month we played about three times a week.\n\nNow, I am complaining to him about my shoulder hurting and he is complaining about his back. Are there any exercises we can do to get rid of these aches and pains?\n\nA: There are over 20 million golfers in the United States alone. And those who play frequently, including the pros, are often plagued by over-use injuries.\n\nIt's the repetitive motion of the golf swing that's the culprit. And if your form is less than perfect you can hurt yourself on a single swing.\n\nIt uses the same muscles every time: mainly shoulder (rotator cuff) core (side of the waist, abdominals), and arms (elbow, forearm and wrist)\n\nAlso, like any other physical activity, it's good to warm-up your body at least 5-10 minutes before starting to play. A brisk walk, a few arm circles and practice swings with a towel will help to elevate your body temperature, lubricate joints and increase blood flow to your working muscles.\n\nAs for the current aches and pains, you probably have to rest those muscles until they heal.\n\nThe good news is, there are Prehab exercises to help you play injury-free in the future and they will also help improve your game.\n\n\"An ounce of Prehab is worth a pound of Rehab.\"\n\nHere are some essential exercises.\n\nTowel warm-up\n\nRoll up a towel lengthwise and take a few practice swings to warm-up the muscles you'll use when you add the weight of the club.\n\nSide Bend If you have hand weights, great. Otherwise, grab some cans from your pantry.\n\nStand feet shoulder width apart, knees slightly bent, arms at your sides. Without bending forward or back, bend directly to one side, while sliding the weight in your opposite hand up the side of your body to your armpit. Do the same on the other side. 8-12 reps on each side, alternating side to side.\n\nAreas Worked: Side of the Waist\n\nCore Strength & Stretch\n\nStart on your hands and knees in a tabletop position.\n\nGently stretch your right arm out in front of you till it's level with your torso. At the same time raise your left leg and straighten it behind you. Hold for 10-20 counts and slowly return to starting position. Switch sides and repeat. Areas Worked: Abdominals, shoulder, hip and back of leg\n\nLift and turn your torso to point your right elbow towards your left knee (keep your elbow back in line with your shoulder) and return to start.

Once upon a time, not so long ago, belly fat was a sign of prosperity. Much to our chagrin, that little, or not so little belly, it's actually a sign that you may be at risk for some serious health issues like Heart Disease, Diabetes, and High Blood Pressure, among others. Women tend to after menopause when hormonal changes start to alter our body shapes. Whatever the cause, the evidence is clear. Apple shaped people are more at risk! So, how much is too much belly fat? It's all about your waist size. For women it's a waist measurement of 33 or more.\n\nSo, okay you say, I've got too much belly fat. What can I do about it? I've heard there's no such thing as spot reducing. While that's scientifically true, there's a lot you can do to target any specific area of you body for work. Aerobic exercise can burn calories and help you lose weight in general. Targeted ab exercises can help you develop lean muscle mass in that area and help flatten your tummy. Full body strength training can raise your metabolism and help you return your body to its youthful shape. Here are a couple of exercises you can do to strengthen and firm up that area. Try using the old army exercise of sucking in your tummy during every day activities, pulling your navel back to your spine. And you can try this exercise to help you firm up faster. It tones the center as well as the sides of your abdominals. Lie down on your back and bend one knee up towards your chest. At the same time, turn you torso and point your opposite elbow toward the knee. Start with a few: work up to 20 repetitions over several weeks. Then do 20 reps, take a short break and do another 20.\n\nPutting weight on around your middle is easy. Taking it off is hard. Unfortunately there's no secret formula. Take a no nonsense look at your diet. Reduce your potion size and cut out empty calories. Start exercising slowly, and progress in your comfort zone. Chances are that pretty soon you'll be able to find your shoes simply by looking down\n\nTuesday, March 27, 2012\n\nSpring is in the air and flu season seems to be hitting us later this year. Thinking about avoiding the flu always makes me wax philosophic. So I started thinking about wellness. What is wellness anyway? It's the absence of disease. If you are not sick you are well. But it's more than that isn't it? It's quality of life and for some it's the balance of all things. I like this balance concept so I dug out one of my favorite balance tools: The Mandala: the wheel of life. I wrote down all the types of wellness I could think of and ended up with 6 categories that I stuck on my Mandala. Here they are: Physical Wellness \u00b7 Taking care of your body, eat right, exercise \u00b7 Visit your doctor regularly\n\nMental Wellness \u00b7 Keeping an open mind and trying to see other's point of view \u00b7 Allowing your curiosity to take you to new places and learn new things.\n\nEmotional Wellness \u00b7 Trying to keep a positive state of mind \u00b7 Cultivating self esteem \u00b7 Reaching out to others for support\n\nSocial Wellness \u00b7 Developing positive inter-personal relationships at home and work \u00b7 Allowing yourself to give and receive love: to and from everyone that means that much to you including animals \u00b7 Participate in social situations; try not to stay on the sidelines.\n\nEnvironmental Wellness \u00b7 Making your home environment peaceful, pleasant, safe and comfortable. \u00b7 Choosing an occupation and a workplace that doesn't drive you nuts. \u00b7 Try to have a positive impact on our natural environment. Recycle more, pollute less.\n\nWhen the wheel is in balance it spins evenly. When even one of these categories is out of whack, the whole wheel starts to wobble. So as a wellness professional I respectfully suggest you get rolling!\n\nThursday, March 15, 2012\n\nI love to get out in the Spring after a Winter of exercising indoors. Even if you haven't done much over the winter, the green smell of plants and flowers in the air and switching on to daylight savings time are great motivators. Start with a duration you're comfortable with and work your way up. I do some standing pushups and a couple of stretches at the end of my walk to round out the workout. No equipment necessary, just your favorite tree. Here is what I do:\n\nStanding Pushups: Stand facing your tree and stretch arms in from of you, chest level and place hands on the tree a few inches apart. Keeping your body straight, slowly bend elbows until your chest is close to the tree and push back with a single thrust. Work up to 20 reps. Works chest, and arms.\n\nBack Extention: Stand facing your tree and stretch arms in front of you slightly below chest level. Place hands on the tree a few inches apart. Keep arms stretched as you bend back lifting your head chin up while contracting your abs. Hold for 10-20 seconds. Stretches back.\n\nThursday, March 1, 2012\n\nI became interested in exercise and memory several years ago when my older students began to tell me that their memories seemed to improve after they took my class. I was teaching mostly dance-exercise in those days. I started with simple steps and built up to a pretty complex routine. There has to be a connection I thought, between the physical movement, making your brain learn this routine, and improved memory. I'm no scientist but I was curious. So I started to break it down. What I was having people do is learn short phrases of movement and then link them together. The cardio dance routine required them to move forward and back, side to side, remember specific steps; and stay in rhythm. This was a real challenge for many of my students who had never done anything like this before. As they got more proficient, the class became a social gathering; because of this shared experience. My students felt energized afterwards, not exhausted. They told me that besides getting a good body workout they were getting a memory workout as well. They said they could actually remember things better. I wondered if there was science to support our anecdotal experience. I contacted a couple of local Alzheimer's specialists (there was no internet back then) and they told me \u2013 you're probably right but there weren't any specific studies on this more than 20 years ago. Even now the research is not conclusive. But, technology in the last 15 years has allowed science to discover a lot more about the brain. Vascular memory loss has been linked to heart disease and cardio fitness is a major factor in preventing and managing that issue. Aerobic exercise increases the amount of oxygen supplied to the brain improving mental function. Cardio fitness has been shown to reduce loss of brain cells in older adults. A study of 1,449 older adults shows those who in middle age exercised vigorously enough to perspire and breathe hard for 20 to 30 minutes at least twice a week reduced their risk of later developing Alzheimer's disease by about 60 percent.* But cardio is just part of the equation. Research published in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that certain types of dance, particularly with routines to learn and remember, may help prevent age-onset memory loss and diseases like Alzheimer's. \"\u2026. cognitive activity may stave off dementia by increasing a person's \"cognitive reserve.\" ** And a study conducted at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, says activities that combined mental and social as well as physical stimulation offered the greatest protection against dementia*** Activity is the active word. Be physically active, mentally active and socially active, preferably all at once. Taking a Cardio Dance class or getting together with friends to do a Cardio Dance DVD is a good place to start. And to this day, when I start my cardio dance class I say, \"It's time to workout our hearts and minds!\"\n\nThursday, February 16, 2012\n\nSince March is Diabetes Month I wanted you to know about a recent discovery that is poised to be real game changer. We all know inactivity and excess body fat are risk factors for Diabetes. But did you know you have two kinds of fat, bad and good, white and brown? White fat just sits there and is, well, just fat. It's the bad fat. It puts you at higher risk for diseases like diabetes. Brown fat on the other hand, doesn't just sit there. It's metabolically active. It burns calories, lots of calories. It's the good fat. (Yes, there is such a thing as good fat.) And exercise can turn white fat brown! A recent study* by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School shows that exercise produces a hormone called Irisin that turns white fat brown. This may be a reason people who exercise regularly burn more calories, even hours after exercising, than sedentary people. Doesn't that make you want to get up, make some irisin, turn that white fat brown and burn a bunch of calories? Well if that's not enough here's something else. Exercise helps regulate blood glucose levels. It helps get excess glucose out of the blood and into the muscle tissue where it's burned as fuel. It really works. In fact many diabetics who exercise regularly find they need to take a lot less insulin. Some have even been able to eliminate their need for insulin with daily exercise. So between the calorie-burning brown fat, and the sugar-sucking effect on muscle tissue, I'd say exercise is a no-brainer for those of us at risk for diabetes.\n\nWednesday, January 18, 2012\n\nAt this time of year when we're struggling with our New Year's resolutions I feel a need to ask and answer this question. Why is it that so many people who truly want and desperately need to get fit find it so unattainable? Why do so many start fitness programs only to quit after a few days or a few weeks? Why is it that many highly trained fitness professionals can't help us and can be actually detrimental to our success? There's this mentality that you have to whip yourself into shape in order to get in shape. No pain no gain. And if your body is not hard and ripped and buffed then you're not fit. NONSENSE!! What is fitness really? What if getting fit meant that your could get out of a chair comfortably, that you could pick up a coin off the floor, reach for something without pulling something, run for a bus without feeling like you're going to pass out. Maybe live longer, happier, and reap those health benefits the fit enjoy All these things are attainable without knocking yourself out and without having a ripped body. You can have real gain, without the pain. You can be fit and active and take it as far as you want at your own pace in your own comfort zone. All you have to do is stand up (and if you can't stand up sit in a chair) and move. Start slowly, gently, naturally just move. That's the place to start. You don't need gimmicks, you don't need machines. Move a little every day. Start with just a few minutes, but do it every day. After a couple of weeks you'll start to feel better. As you keep it up you'll want to do a little more. So do a little more and on the days you don't feel like doing it, just do a little something. You will accumulate fitness a little at a time. Eventually you'll want to introduce yourself to the 3 major components of fitness: Cardio, Strength and Flexibility training. But then you'll be ready because your body got used to moving again. It's not rocket science but it is science and it does work. Studies show that moderate daily exercise gets you fit enough to reap about 80% of the health benefits fitness has to offer. Not bad.\n\nAbout Mirabai\n\nMirabai Holland M.F.A. is one of the leading authorities in the Health & Fitness industry, and a public health activist specializing in preventive and rehabilitative exercise for women.

{"text":"How dumb is this proposed new putting rule?\n\nAt the USDGC this year the TD wanted to have a rules exception that would create a putting circle around the basket 1.5 meters out. If your disc landed within this radius then you would have to mark it somewhere along the circle creating a 5 foot putt instead of a drop in the reasoning being that a drop in is not a good golf shot and you can merely drop it in even place it in without a throw, that is somehow seen as wrong anyway what an absurd idea, really dumb, anyone care to defend the new proposed rule?\n\n...or just upside down...controlling or balancing a turbo might be pretty tough in that kind of wind.\n\nHypothetically...keep in mind....if you were to play on a course or in a tournament that implemented that flavor of buncr.....I believe you would have the option of relocating to anywhere just outside the circle.....not necessarily on the line of play...thus giving you the option of the tailwind putt. ; )\n\nThat's about the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life. I would laugh at the TD all the way to the car if they told me that was a rule. And if it became a PDGA rule, I'd never play a tournament again. I don't want to be associated with something that stupid \"OH GREAT SHOT! Now move it back 5 feet.\"\n\nAnd to the uptights. No, the potheads aren't keeping Disc Golf off TV folks, it's the lack of proper promotion to the general public. If it were potheads, the Miami Dolfins would never play on National TV (Ricky Williams - \"I would rather smoke pot than play football.\" but yet he's back), nor the X-Games, Basketball, Baseball, Moto-X, Rap would have never made TV, etc etc etc. Hell, there would be no TV anymore. Mind your own business and it'll stop bothering you. I don't do drugs, but you know what? If someone does it's none of MY business so I ignore it, it effects my life none at all.\n\nThere are so many other things that could be changed about Disc Golf without being stupid. Stupid ruled make the game look Stupid. Personally I don't want this game to look stupid because some tard interjected a stupid rule into it. Maybe ball golf should do away with putting greens and make everyone chip into the hole because it looks cooler!\n\nWell to me, disc golf is a sport of the people. I have played in many different tournaments and leagues that boasted their own share of strange and surprising rules. Even in a friendly scrimmage, my friends and I will invent rules to help even out our own playing field (etc: every hole is a par 3 regardless of difficulty; if there is an odd-man-out during a scramble match, he gets one mulligan per hole on any throw and can carry it over, never having more than two; if a drive strikes a tree and bounces back behind the tee pad, the thrower gets a \"do-over\".) Heck, we even invent our own terminology (an earnie = a hard birdie or putt you will have to earn.)\n\nThe point is that disc golf is too young and has very few bureaucrats with deep pockets to tell us devoted-discers what to do. If I have to putt outside of a five foot ring to be the next Ken Climo, then so be it. But until then, I will just enjoy the sport.\n\nFYI: I'm from GR, MI and I don't know whether to laugh or be insulted about the \"Grand Rapids Putt.\"\n\nActually, a disc is very rarely played where it lies. You may put a supporting point on the ground where the disc was, but the disc thrown for the next shot is usually about 3-4ft off of the ground when it is released.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with suggesting new ideas - that is called brainstorming. And there is nothing wrong with not liking a new idea - just make your thoughts known with grace and courtesy."}

{"text":"Golf Swing & Arms\n\nOne common phrase heard around driving ranges and golf courses is \"keep your left arm straight.\" This advice can help right-handed golfers create power in their swings. Most golfers, however, don't know the fundamentals that allow you to keep your left arm straight in a golf swing. Keeping your left arm straight during the swing requires the proper grip, arm swing, downswing path and body turn. Learn these fundamentals and you will consistently be able to create a powerful swing.\n\nIt's important that the club head lags behind your hands on the downswing. This hand position allows the clubhead to compress the ball, according to golf instructor Rob Akins. He recommends that golfers focus on keeping their hands in front of the club head through and past the impact zone. Many golfers use soft arms to achieve lag, letting the arms drop from the top of the downswing rather than gripping the club tightly and powering the arms through the point of impact.\n\nMore Golf Swing & Arms Picks\n\nThe \"swing the club head method,\" a simplified strategy for teaching the golf swing, originated with Ernest Jones of Great Britain in the early 20th century. Jones's philosophy was based on his belief that a golf swing involves one motion -- a unified whole rather than a series of parts. He said the golfer must feel the swinging motion through the hands; hence his mantra: \"swing the club head.\""}

{"text":"I don't even know how it all works for the groupings. In the beginning of the year, players don't end up on their state lists until they have played. I think all pros of all ages are in their gender list but I'm not sure GMs and SGMs show up on the Master list (but should). It's a mess and I don't like having to apologize for the PDGA every time players want what would seem like easy sorts and selections to achieve. This has gone on for years now and it's finally getting higher on the budget priorities. Someone not only has to volunteer to do it but someone has to oversee it because the website is so convoluted, from what I understand, that it's easy to do something here and mess up something there.\n\nas i said before -- thanks Chuck. It looks like it will be really cool when all the updates get put in place. i do tend to associate PDGA stats with you and it didn't make sense that something you are associated with wasn't nearly perfect. thanks for reinforcing that impression by expressing your dismay with some of the loose ends\n\nThis hasn't risen high enough in the priorities for IT folks to change the code to pull each player's historical rating value rather than their current rating. It's not necessarily a trivial process since players don't have ratings populated into each update field in the database if they didn't have an update that period. So some calculation is required to find their most recent rating prior to that event date. I agree it would be better to retain the rating the person had leading into the event so you can maybe see how players have progressed over the years.\n\n\n\nChuck, Setup to Question: The other day some of my buddies out at the course were doing a make-shift handicapping system using their player ratings. The way they did it was a stroke for every 10 points. I seem to remember you explaining exactly how much a stroke was worth in ratings points a long time ago. So I was wondering..... Question: On a par 54 course with an SSA of 47.48, how many ratings points would a stroke be? Sidenote: If this has a very complicated answer involving supercomputer calculations, just say too complicated.\nThanks.\n\nThree options: The easy way is to look up some courses on this website to find those with SSA close to the one you're planning to play. Click on the event that produced the ratings for that course and see how much each throw was worth by looking at the round ratings for people one shot apart. \n\nAnother option is to subscribe to the Disc Golf United handicapping service ($19.95\/yr or $2.95\/mon) which does all of the math for you and tracks your personal numbers. \n\nAnother option is to download the Excel template for calculating ratings. \nEnter a fake player with 1000 rating and put the actual SSA in as their score. Make sure to enter 18 for the number of holes at the top. Then, enter a second player without a rating who has a score exactly one shot higher or lower than the SSA. awitch to the tab that has the ratings on it and look what the difference is between the ratings of those two players.\n\nIt probably will get rated under our new approach. When there are fewer than 5 propagators on a course, if that same group (and others) play the same course in another round, we will combine the results for both rounds to do the ratings in one batch for both rounds.\n\nNo. It depends on where the 25% line breaks for you at each update. If you have 20 rounds in the update, your most recent 5 will be double weighted. If your most recent events are each 2 rounds, then only one round in the event just before those two will be double weighted and we always use the best of the two.\n\nChuck....I just recently had a sweeet round that was unofficially 71 points below my current rating. Is there a way I can calculate if that round will be excluded or not in the next update or will I have to wait?\nThanks...#21433THATS why I got $#@!$%^ from that round at the Great Northwest Open....\n\n\"It can happen online for unofficial ratings but not in reality. ALWAYS almost exactly the same number of players will end up with ratings higher than their rating and half lower on any layout. It's not possible for it to happen any other way for official ratings. When you see oddities like you're talking about, it just means the course layouts haven't been done properly yet. There's not even a boost factor anymore which did actually produce a few more higher ratings than lower ratings during 2005. But that's gone. \"\n\nCan you explain why half the players tend to be rated (and hence play) above their rating while the other half are rated below their current rating? You used \"ALWAYS\" as though there was a statistical reason, and if so, I'd like to read more.\n\nThe SSA course rating for each round is determined by the average rating of the propagator players and their average score for the round. The round ratings are then based on that SSA from the scores. The average rating of the propagators will always be the same as the average of the round ratings except when we had a boost factor in there that shifted the calculated SSA 0.1 to 0.5 higher during 2005 and part of 2006 when it was phased out. During that time, the average of the round ratings was 1 to 5 points higher than the average rating of the propagators. Now it should be close to the same. It's not always perfect due to rounding and a slight shift in the formula to account for a really shallow curve in the equations to adjust for lower rated propagator groups versus higher rated propagator groups.\n\nI have 10 rounds of golf that will be going into the new ratings when they update. 4 at the buckhorn open, 4 at the coastal plains winter open, and 2 from the loriella challenge. I know that some rounds are doubled to emphasize how well you play the most recently. I was just curious how many rounds will be doubled and maybe just a reader's digest version of how ratings are determined. Thanks.\n\nAll rounds going back 12 months from the date of your most recent event will be included. The most recent 25% (1 out of 4) will be double weighted. If any rounds are more than 2.5 standard deviations below your average will be dropped which is about 1 in 50.\n\nso when you say the most recent 25% are doubled, is that the most recent of all the rounds that are being used for the ratings, or 25% of the new rounds that are going into the ratings since the last ratings update?\n\nYes. But everyone's 12 months is different. It's all rounds in the 12 months before the date of your most recent round in the update. If your most recent round is January 15th, then we go back to January 16th of 2006. If it's March 3rd then we go back to March 4th of 2006."}
{"text":"People often ask me what the most important factor, or part, of the golf swing is? If you didn't know, it's \"Consistency\". It doesn't matter how erratically you jab, swipe, poke or slash at the ball, if you can do it the same way every time, you can score well! Regardless of how far your ball ends up from where you intended it to go, if you can repeat that exact swing over and over again, producing the same phenomenon, then all you need to do is compensate for the variance from your target by changing your body alignment. Presto! You can score well! It might not be pretty, but you'll probably even make some money off your buddies! Perhaps guys who have been at the game much longer than you with prettier and better \"perceived\" swings than yours!\nWhat's more important, a swing that looks good but you cant guarantee where the ball is going, or one that produces the same ball flight every time. Of course ideally both, but lets face it were not all pros and most people aren't in a position to invest the time needed to realize this. Changing and fighting with our swing to improve it until we get old, decrepit and physically cant play the game any more is a loosing battle.\nCan you remember a time when you used to score better than you do now? Three months from first touching a golf club I shot a \"39\" on half. I had received no instruction, had no swing thoughts and really, \"no clue\"! I would just swing at the ball, crush it, and it felt good! With most shots I'd usually have picked up my bag and begun walking before the ball had even landed. I didn't have to watch it because I knew where it was going \"with confidence\", like you'll occasionally see the pros on tour do after they execute a perfect shot!\nMy ball would start low and left of my target line, then rise up with a big \"banana like\" slice and drop softly to the \"right\" of where I had hoped it would go. As this was the case I found by tweaking my body alignment \"left\" of my target, the prescribed amount for \"that day\" (The amount would change a little on any given day), the ball would eventually end up where I wanted it! I didn't fight it, I accepted it, and scored well.\nI consider any score in the 30s on half to be a pretty respectable score even today! Most would, and I've spent fifteen years of actively trying to improve my score and swing. That's approximately 67,788 holes of golf later! So...what have I been doing? Sleeping?!\nThe difference between my swing then and my swing now can be seen in the quality of my missed shots. I have learned a much more \"Neutral\" swing, which basically means the club head is traveling straighter through the strike zone achieving consistent ball flights. My old swing, although consistent, sacrificed allot of distance and power with the \"Banana ball\", and when I did happen to hit the dreaded \"straight ball\", it was out of the park!\nWhat can we learn from this? How can you save yourself some grief? Well, when you find a shot or a swing that you can reproduce consistently, keep it! It's yours! It came to you from the \"golf gods\".

{"text":"PGA Professional shares tips and advice on golf\n\nDo you find yourself struggling with certain distance gaps with your wedges? Wouldn't it be nice if you didn't have to hit as many half or three-quarter wedge shots? Chances are, there is a large yardage gap between your wedges. I'm going to help you understand how to optimize the lofts of your wedges. This may mean you'll have to add a wedge or two to your bag, or have the lofts bent on your current wedges. Trust me though, it'll be money well spent.\n\nYears ago, a typical pitching wedge (PW) was 48 degrees. Recently, club makers have strengthened the PW to 43-47 degrees to give golfers the impression they're hitting the ball further. In fact, they're just hitting a 9-iron that says PW. It's really not a big deal what the bottom of the club says. What's important is the real loft of the clubs and how far you hit them.\n\nTHE PROBLEM\n\nThe problem may occur if your PW is 44 degrees and your next wedge is a SW with 56 degrees of loft. That's a huge gap. That'd be like taking both your 7 and 8-iron out of your bag. How would you like to do that? And we're talking about the clubs you'll be using more than any other clubs in your bag not counting the putter and driver. Approximately 70% of the game occurs inside 100 yards so it's important to get the most out of the wedges that you carry.\n\nTypically, there is a 4 degree gap between the irons in your bag. Believe it or not, this means that many of you should be carrying 4 wedges, if not 5. I understand, that's really hard to believe. It's all based on the actual loft of your PW. If your wedge is 44, then you may need another wedge at 48, then 52, 56, and possibly 60. That'd be 5 clubs considered to be wedges, although I would argue the 44 is actually a 9-iron.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nWedges are your scoring clubs so it's imperative to have the lofts correct to maximize your scoring cability. Here's what I would recommend. Find out the true loft of your PW at a golf shop (Etter's or Golf Galaxy) that measures loft. It'll cost a few bucks, but it's well worth it. Add 4-5 degrees of loft to each wedge after that. Example: If your PW is 46, I would recommend a GW at 50, a SW at 54, and a LW at 58. Or, you could carry a 51 GW and a 56 SW. If you're wondering, I carry 48, 53, and 58 degree wedges in my bag (The numbers on my wedges actually say 47, 54, and 58. I've had them bent).\n\nObviously, there are plenty of routes you can go. You may need all the long irons, woods, and hybrids in your bag. Some may need the extra loft around the green. It's up to you to decide, but if you're not certain, a PGA Professional like myself can certainly offer you the guidance you may need.\n\nThanks for reading and make sure you get your lofts checked before the season is here.\n\nThe next time you go to a driving range either for practice or prior to a round, I highly recommend you start your session by hitting plenty of pitch shots. And, if you've ever had a lesson with me, you know I like to start our lessons by having you hit some short wedge shots. There are a few reasons why I recommend this:\n\n1) Injury Prevention \u2013 The last time I checked, none of us are getting younger. Warming up with short swings is a great way to prevent an injury when hitting golf balls. You should never start with full, aggressive golf swings.\n\n2) Rhythm and Balance \u2013 Warming up slowly with pitch shots is a great way to groove a nice rhythm for the day. Plus, it allows you to work on your balance. If you can't maintain your balance when pitching, then you're probably going to struggle with your full-swing balance. Practice holding your finish on pitch shots. It will lead to better balance for every shot you hit.\n\n3) Improving Your Form \u2013 The pitch shot is simply a mini-golf swing. The better your technique is on pitch shots, the better full-swing technique you'll have. Focus on syncing up your arms and body on pitch shots, it'll help you stay connected with your full swing.\n\n4) Scoring - The pitch shot is a very important shot in golf. You'll hit some version of a pitch shot on many, if not most, of the holes you play. Warming up with pitch shots will help your score. I would recommend warming up with all your wedges hitting them at different heights and distances"}

{"text":"How To Care For Your Golf Bag\n\nProfessional players usually use oversized tournament bags that are carried by caddies. These bags have all the bells and whistles, including a fabric-lined interior to protect clubs, as well as large pockets for an extra pair of shoes, raingear, a full supply of towels, and even refreshments\u2014anything that might be needed for a four-hour competitive round in the elements.\n\nExperienced golfers usually use a scaled-down version of the tournament bag. It can fit either on a motorized cart or a pull cart, or be carried. New golfers might want to start with a lightweight carry bag. Even when players share a cart, courses generally require each player to have a golf bag.\n\nTips for caring for your golf bag:\n\nPlace your bag down gently to avoid damaging the frame.\n\nWhen using a riding cart, make sure your bag is securely fastened.\n\nDon't place wet clothing or damp clubs and other equipment in the bag. Any buildup of moisture can weaken the materials.\n\nUse a towel or cloth to wipe off your bag after each use.\n\nStore your bag in a dry, cool area between uses. The extreme temperature changes in a car trunk can damage your bag and its contents."}

{"text":"Hey Chuck -- the results in Open for the 3rd Turkey Tussle for The Caring Center are wrong. I finished 1st and Vince finished 2nd. I shot the 59 in round 2 and he shot the 60. The payout info is correct...\n\nWhere can I read about the math that determines the number of rating points associated with a stroke? For example, in some rounds, a score of 54 = 950 and a 53 = 955. A later round has 54 = 950 and a 53 = 957. I am curious what drives the variation in the magnitude of the difference for a single stroke from one round to the next@kadeatkinson - The Board decided to withdraw that information from the site.\n\nIt's always been that way. Courses with a different number of holes is partly why we calculate and hold your ratings in the database on a \"per hole\" basis then expand them later based on the number of holes. That's why you'll be off a point or two due to rounding errors because the \"per hole\" values are magnified to 3 or 4 digits.\n\nBack in the early 2000s, we didn't get good data from a Worlds report for some reason and it went in the database as a 144-hole \"round rating\" for every player.\n\nThe current position from PDGA HQ is to not provide more written details on the process than is already out there. It's not my call. Roger and I are contractors with the PDGA to provide what they ask for. Enhancing the player stats pages is on hold until after the fabled new website finally launches. There are several enhancement ideas in the pipeline such as including the number of holes in a round.\n\nI thought PDGA members who got worlds invites would get automated emails in addition to being on the list. Not sure where I got that idea, but it seems like a good promotion strategy. I'm on the list, but didn't get an email. Is that unusual?\n\nEmails (or letters before email) with all of the registration details traditionally are sent in mid-March. It's only in the past 7 years or so that the list of those invited got posted in mid-February once the previous year point totals were tallied.\n\nIt's always been that way. Courses with a different number of holes is partly why we calculate and hold your ratings in the database on a \"per hole\" basis then expand them later based on the number of holes.\n\nPerhaps this has already been discussed, but with the current ratings system, aren't we going to see ratings continue to inflate?\n\nIf we had a closed pool of 10 (the actual number doesn't really matter) players that participated in tournaments together. Each time a player shoots bad enough that the round doesn't count towards his ratings (i.e. is 2 standard deviations below his rating) the overall average ratings applied for the pool of players increases. I know that the actual pool of players is not static, but with bad round outliers thrown out, it pushes the overall ratings upward.\n\nIn theory, the average ratings of your closed group would increase. However, the effect is minimal in the bigger picture with thousands of players. Note that the average player has one round dropped out of 50. That works out to one round every three years on average since PDGA members currently average around 16 rated rounds per year.\n\nThe thing to consider is how do you know whether a round is naturally poor (normal statistical variance) or deliberately poor? We don't know for sure so we lop off the tiny bottom tail of the statistical distribution just in case to make sure the overall integrity of the system stays intact and doesn't get pulled down by a deliberately poor score that wouldn't be a \"naturally\" generated poor score in the system.\n\nBack to your original premise with the closed pool of 10 players. What would happen is the SSA of the courses they played, which are dynamically generated from their ratings, would slightly decrease over time offsetting the effect of dropping a few rounds in each of their ratings which would slightly increase their ratings. Net effect over time works out to zero inflation in the average ratings in the systemThanks Chuck. It appears to boil down to this: on an easy course (a low SSA, birdie-fest) each stroke is worth a lot of rating points (e.g., 14) while on a tough course (high SSA, hard to get par) each stroke is worth less (e.g., 7 points).\n\nI assume this pattern is a function of a lack of spread in the scoring overall on an easy course (lots of people with similar stroke counts) while on the hard course there is a great deal of spread in actual stroke counts.\n\nThanks for the response, Chuck, although i didn't think the course SSA really had an impact on the mean ratings generated, only the shape of the distribution. I thought the average of the propagators ratings would be used to determine the base ratings, and the SSA helped shape that distribution (more narrowly\/widely per stroke).\n\nI@lonhart - Yep. Think of it this way. If we are 70 points apart in ratings, on average you would beat me by 7 on a 50 SSA course, only 5 on a low SSA course and by 10 on a high SSA course. The differen in our skill level (rating) hasn't changed. Thus, the number of ratings points per throw has to change as the SSA changes so the math hangs together with actual scores.\n\npgyori - IThe fact that we do drop bad rounds prevents the potential for deliberate behavior for Ams to tank rounds to drop their ratings to get into a lower division. The fundamental reason for ratings is to prevent sandbagging and get players playing the appropriate division for their skill level. Dropping bad rounds is a key mechanism to prevent any payoff from tanking behavior.\n\nChuck, I have a question about the new world rankings formula if you know the answer. The descriptive text says, \"However starting 2012, players must have completed Worlds or two other Majors during the past year to be included in the World Rankings.\" Are there any further unstated caveats regarding the division played at the two other majors, or whether the Major is a major that produces ratings?\n\nParticipation must be in MPO or FPO in the Majors listed on the World Rankings page and all of those provide ratings in singles competition. No doubles, teams or match play events at this point. Do you think an event or division listing was missing in the explanation text?\n\nI did not see in the explanation text that it was some divisions and not others, some majors but not all of them. I did not see exactly which divisions and majors were excluded from consideration. It might be there. I might not have read closely enough or clicked on enough links to find it whereever it might be. But I did smell it, so I thought I'd ask.\n\nStarting 2012, players must have completed Worlds or two other Majors within the past year (Japan Open goes two years) to be included in the rankings. A man's best four NT\/ET events (three for women) counts as one Major.\n\nI take it that what is meant by that, with clarifying additional text in colored text, is:\n\nStarting 2012, players must have completed Worlds or two other specified Majors in the MPO or FPO division within the past year (Japan Open goes two years) to be included in the rankings. A man's best four NT\/ET events (three for women) counts as one Major. Competition in a division other than MPO or FPO, or competition at a Major not on the specified list, does not satisy the requirement necessary to be included in the World Rankings.\n\nI'll take a look at clarifying the text. It has always indicated that \"Master and older players who meet the minimum rating criteria are included. However, they only get credit when entering the Open Pro division at any event included in the rankings.\"\n\nRight, and I'm just not understanding what that sentence means. I think I'm being confused by the word \"credit.\" But is my clarifying additional text correct? Masters and amateurs who have the rating to get on the list, and who play Worlds or two of the other specified Majors, will be excluded from the list unless they play Worlds in MPO or FPO, or play their two other Majors in MPO or FPO. They have to play MPO or FPO at the specified major tournaments for the specified major tournaments to satisfy the criteria of having played those tournaments?\n\nI'm fine with whatever the criteria are. I'm not arguing what the criteria should be. I just want to understand in case Kelsey cares about the list. And this is the other question she might ask, \"Can a woman with the necessary rating qualify for the women's ranking list by playing MPO at Worlds, or does she have to play FPO?\" Kelsey would be more inclined to play MPO than FPO, but I think her plan is to play MA1.\n\nWorld Rankings are for performance in your gender specific Open division. Women are ranked with women and men with men. While a woman could enter MPO in enough Majors to qualify for the men's ranking, no woman has yet earned a rating over 999 so it's not realistic for the time being. A woman's competition results in MPO at Majors or NTs would not qualify for the Women's ranking. Women must play in FPO in those events for potential inclusion in the women's ranking.\n\nYes, an amateur of either gender could potentially make their gender's World Ranking list if they played Open in Worlds or enough Majors to qualify and their rating was high enough."}

{"text":"Not Rentable\n\n6.5\n\nCritic & User Reviews\n\n7.1\n\nGameSpot Review of Outlaw Golf\n\nWhile golf games have a strong following, they generally don't get nearly the attention sports games such as basketball, soccer, and football do. After all, the slower pace of the sport just isn't all that appealing to video game fanatics who want instant action. In an effort to address this issue, Hypnotix's Outlaw Golf attempts to make golf more appealing by incorporating a cast of surprising, off-kilter characters, gameplay mechanics that are simple to use, and a large number of modes designed for those who like to add a little spice to their golf game. But don't be fooled by its outward appearance: Outlaw Golf is still a surprisingly realistic golf game, complete with spins, hooks, slices, and breaks and the sort of complexity you might expect from a straightforward golf sim. As a matter of fact, Outlaw Golf's control scheme may even seem a little too unforgiving. As such, it will probably take a while for you to settle in and have an enjoyable time with the game, despite its outrageous theme.\n\n\n\nOutlaw Golf features a cast of over-the-top characters...\n\nThough the game has only three 18-hole courses, the most impressive aspect of Outlaw Golf is the sheer number of different modes of play it has to offer. At the beginning of the game, you'll have the option to select from only two modes--exhibition and tour. However, within the exhibition mode, there are eight different types of golf games. You can choose to play through 18 holes normally (the player with the lowest score wins), or you can engage in a slight variation where the player who wins the most holes wins the game. In addition, there are two modes where you can compete for money. One is just a general skins game where you can win money for each hole, and the player with the most money at the end of the 18 holes wins. The other mode is a little more involved because it asks you to either bet money on a particular shot or to pass, and whoever wins the hole wins the amount of money wagered.\n\nOutlaw Golf also includes two teamplay modes within the exhibition option. One uses the stroke count of the teammate who performed the best at the end of the hole, while the other simply keeps the best shot from either teammate when approaching the hole. So if you slice the ball into the rough, and your teammate lands a ball on the fairway, then you'll play from the fairway. Another of the gameplay modes forces you to choose just a single club and get through a course with that and a putter. However, the most entertaining mode of the bunch is probably the time attack option, where the game will track the amount of time it takes you to finish a hole. You still need to pay attention to what you're doing, though. Otherwise, you'll make bad shots repeatedly, defeating the entire purpose of the mode.\n\nThe tour mode gives you an opportunity to face the other Outlaw Golfers in a tournament setting, and though it's not quite as exciting as the offerings within the exhibition mode, the tour mode is the only way you can unlock additional golfers and clubs within the game. However, the tour mode also has an Outlaw Range option, where you can challenge yourself to a series of tests that will enable you to win points that you can distribute into your golfer's individual statistics. These tests focus on specific skills, such as putting, and they become increasingly difficult as you progress through the game. It's a nice break from the standard golfing action.\n\n\n\n...but it has the depth of a more traditional golf game.\n\nThough there's a tutorial that will take you through the mechanics of the game, the Outlaw Range is also a good place to familiarize yourself with the way Outlaw Golf controls. Unlike most of the other golf games currently available, Outlaw Golf doesn't use the traditional double-click swing method. Instead, you have to press back on the analog stick to charge up the strength of the shot and then press forward when you want to swing. This would be a perfectly acceptable method for a video game golf swing if the direction of the shot weren't determined by the direction you're pressing while pressing forward on the right analog stick. There will be numerous times when it appears that you've perfectly lined up a shot, but then it slices or hooks way off into the woods, sand trap, or water. Just the slightest tap to the left or right when hitting the ball can cause it to do just that. It's true that you'll get into the rhythm of hitting the ball straight after a while, but it can be a constant problem for those who don't have steady reflexes. The same could probably be said for the actual sport of golf, but since the theme of this game is meant to appeal to a much broader audience, it would have been much more fitting to have a system that didn't rely on such precision. The game should have at least offered a simpler alternative control scheme.\n\nPart of what makes hitting a straight ball so difficult in Outlaw Golf is the composure factor. Basically, the game gauges your golfer's frustration level (regardless of your personal frustration level with the game), and depending on that, he or she will be able to perform either better or worse on the course. Whenever your golfer makes a poor shot, his or her composure level will drop a certain degree, depending on where the ball lands, and if your composure level is incredibly low, it's much more difficult to hit the ball properly. Conversely, if you have a high level of composure, then you have a much higher chance of hitting a ball exactly the way you want to. Occasionally, you'll be rewarded with a \"beating token,\" which you can use to attack your caddy, vent your frustration, and thereby increase your composure. It adds an extra element to Outlaw Golf's gameplay. But poor shots take too heavy a toll on your composure, and since they can occur with just the slightest misstep, you'll almost always have to deal with a low composure rating. In certain modes, you can use a mulligan (or a do-over) if your shot is really bad, but your composure rating will still drop, or rise, regardless.\n\n\n\nThe controls tend to be problematic in the early going...\n\nThere's a surprising level of depth to Outlaw Golf's gameplay that even hard-core golf fans will appreciate, even if they're put off by the game's silly theme. In addition to adjusting the trajectory of your shot, you can also put different types of spin on the ball by moving a small red dot around the ball graphic in the lower left side of the screen. The placement of the red dot determines the type of spin on the ball, so if you hit it close to the top, you're using topspin, which will help the ball roll farther if it's out on the fairway. Putting is handled especially well--you're given three chances to look at the trajectory your ball will take depending on where you're aiming. This will show different breaks on the green and whether or not your ball will veer off to the left or right. When taking any shot in Outlaw Golf, you'll see a percentage just above your shot strength, which tells you how hard you should hit the ball. Unfortunately, oftentimes this percentage seems to be incorrect--you'll hit the ball with just about the right amount of strength, and it won't even come close to where you were aiming. This is especially problematic during putting because you can literally see the path of your ball before you hit it, only to find that the ball will actually move far to the right or left of the hole.\n\nThe graphics in Outlaw Golf are solid but not spectacular. The character models all look good and animate well, particularly during the cartoonlike caddy combat sequences. You'll be able to see individual blades of grass when the ball lies in the rough. There are some nice water effects, as well as other ambient details within the environment, such as birds and planes flying, cars driving over the highway, and a small gallery of polygonal people. But otherwise, the courses look fairly mundane, which is unfortunate since the game's theme suggests otherwise.\n\n\n\n...but you'll eventually get into the swing of things with some practice.\n\nOutlaw Golf features full commentary in the form of an incredibly annoying Dennis Miller-like personality who says the same exact lines over and over. This is worsened when you're first playing through the game and choose to use mulligans repeatedly, because he has only three or four phrases that reference mulligans. Thankfully, you can turn off the commentary entirely. The individual golfer voices are tolerable, but then again, they usually speak only after a hole has been finished. The music in the game is pretty horrible, though, as part of the soundtrack is made up of what seem like elevator-music versions of popular songs. There's even one track that sounds vaguely like \"California Love.\"\n\nOutlaw Golf is an odd game because it has a theme that seems to appeal to a certain audience, yet the gameplay isn't really for that crowd. You'll have to deal with all the nuances of golf found in other more traditional golf games, such as putting spin on the ball and adjusting your putt for breaks in the green. In addition, the game's control scheme is more complicated than it probably should be, even though most players will be able to adjust after a while. While the game offers plenty of golfing variations and good replay value through the tournament mode, the fact that there are only three 18-hole courses may be of concern to some. Still, Outlaw Golf can be a fun game that's certainly worth at least a rental, if an offbeat golf game sounds interesting to you."}
{"text":"Among sports clich\u00e9s, this one rings truer than most. While it can take a mere one or two strokes to hit the green, every golfer knows the torture of a four- or five-putt adventure once they get there. So whether you're trying to get your golf game back on track or trying to become a Putt-Putt superstar, head for the practice green.\n\n\"This article is part of \"'a wiki anyone can edit.\"' If you have advice to add, log in and contribute.\"\n\n==Key Tips==\n\nBelow are a few key tips to keep in mind as you refine your putting stroke:\n\n===Balance===\n\nAfter gripping the putter, form a Y with your arms. Your putter should be an extension of your arms, so keep it hanging naturally below your shoulders, and don't reach out for ball. Keep your arms and shoulders rigid, so the swing can originate at the torso.\n\n===Alignment===\n\nAlways stand behind the ball to line it up and crouch down to read the break. You can use the brand name or logo on the ball to help aim it toward a break, or straight at the hole.\n\n===Putter angle===\n\nThe putter should be square with the ball on impact, otherwise it will spin and veer off your line. Keep a firm grip so the putter angle doesn't open up and change position during your backswing.\n\n===Eyes===\n\nSome golfers insist your eyes should be directly over the ball. Others prefer looking slightly short of the ball. Whichever position allows you to line up the putt better, go with it.\n\n===Speed===\n\nThe goal in putting is to create smooth acceleration (not herky-jerky) on the ball, whether it's a short putt or a long one. For shorter putts, bring the club back until it's about even with the inside of your back foot. For longer putts, bring it back past the back of your foot, and continue the follow through past your front foot. For most putts, try to hit the ball with enough speed so that it will go a foot or so past the hole.\n\n===Practice swing===\n\nTake a practice swing or two \u2013 they're free, after all. Put the ball in the center of stance, and don't use your hands and arms to swing \u2013 let the shoulders do the work. Once you're satisfied with the speed of the club and your balance, scoot up to the ball and knock it in.\n\n==The Celebration==\n\nNow, more important than all of the above is, of course, what happens after you sink a putt.\n\n[[Image:Matador.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Photo courtesy [ Juan \"Chi-Chi\" Rodriguez].]]\n\"'The Toreador:\"' Used by the singular Juan \"Chi-Chi\" Rodr\u00edguez, the \"toreador dance\" is a bullfight maneuver, but in this case your putter is the sword, and the bull is a, uh, small white ball with dimples on it.\n\n\"'High five\"' (solo version): Now, if you're playing for cash (duh) it's unlikely your friends will be in the mood to high five you after a made putt, which is why you need to perfect the solo high-five: a few brisk steps, a short leap, and then lay some skin on your bad funky self.\n\n\"'Fist Pump:\"' After Tiger's recent out-of-bounds excursions, his signature fist pump doesn't have quite the cachet that it once did. Use with caution. [ Or irony].\n\n\"'The Backflip:\"' Why let the soccer players have all the fun?

{"text":"Golf: How To Putt\n\nBy: Mason Kaho\n\nBreak Studios Contributing Writer\n\nIf you know how to putt in golf and can do it well, you will understand the meaning of the old phrase, \"It's not how you drive; it's how you arrive.\" Know how to putt well and you will take strokes off your score and relieve a lot of stress on the course.\n\nRead the green. You must become adept at reading the green and know which way your ball is going to go. Take your time to look at the slope and undulation of the green. Crouch down behind your ball and see what the ground is going to do between your ball and the cup.\n\nKnow your break point. No, we don't mean a quintuple bogey\u2014your break point, not breaking point. After you've read the green, you have to be able to determine at what point your ball will break right or left. Hit your ball to that spot and let gravity take over, moving your ball toward the cup.\n\nKnow the speed limit. It's easy to mess up a good hole by hitting the ball a mile past the cup. You must have a sense of how \"fast\" the green is. You can do this by gauging the firmness of the ground, the length of the grass, the amount of rain you've recently received, and, of course, watching your buddies. Having a good idea of the speed will help you at least get your ball close to the cup.\n\nJust likeclockwork. That's what your stroke should be. You should have a nice, steady stroke, just like a pendulum moving back and forth on a grandfather clock. You need to understand that your back and forward stroke should be the same speed and length. Don't forget to follow through!\n\nDon't try to make every putt. Killing yourself over reading a 50-foot putt is like worrying about making a half court shot. What you want to do when you're way downtown is take your time and just try to get your ball close enough so that your next putt is doable. To know how to putt well, you'll understand that a three putt is a no-no and long putts should just be considered a good opportunity to get the ball to within about three feet."}

But while we believe the rules of golf to be sacred and essential, sometimes bending them just a little, provided you aren't doing it in an official competition or without consent or knowledge of your playing partners, can make your round more fun. And isn't that what playing recreational golf is all about? Keep these ideas in mind the next time you're not teeing it up at the U.S. Open.\n\nMove Your Ball Out Of A Footprint\n\nA basic rule of golf is to play the ball as it lies, but why should you pay a penalty for someone else's carelessness? Move the ball onto a smoother surface, hit your shot, and then take care of the mess made by both you and Bigfoot."}
{"text":"photo credit: Jorge Franganillo Have you ever cheated in golf? If you've taken a mulligan, you have cheated. If you have ever improved your lie while in the rough? You have cheated. If you have ever placed your ball back down on the green ahead of it's original position, you have cheated. If you have accepted a 3 foot gimme, you have cheated.\n\nThere is an entire book of USGA rules that govern the game of golf. If you intentionally break just one rule, you might as well break all of them. Each and every player has a need to improve their game but this can be accomplished with more practice not more cheating. Make a start and be honest with yourself. . . you will enjoy the game more.\n\nphoto credit: nimish_gogri What do you do when your ball lies on, or immediately adjacent to, a cartpath? If your swing or stance is interfered with, you do not have to play the shot. The USGA. rules permit a drop.\n\nUSGA. rule 24-2, (immovable obstruction) states that you can drop within one club-length of the nearest point of relief which allows you to stand and swing freely without interference from the cart-path. The nearest point and drop-zone, however, cannot be closer to the hole. A player is entitled to relief, without penalty, from any path to which a foriegn material such as tar, gravel, dirt, etc. has been applied. A player cannot get relief from a dirt path created by vehicle traffic unless it had been defined as ground under repair.+\n\nIn many parts of the country the weather conditions are conducive to wet soggy fairway conditions. In this case, golf courses will proclaim a lift and place rule. This means that you are allowed, under no penalty, to move your ball in order to improve your lie. Usually this means moving the ball within a foot of it's original lie. This course ruling makes playing conditions fair for everyone. Many times the lift and place rule will go into effect when a course is under repair.\n\nThe lift and place rule applies to the fairway only. Balls that are in the rough are not allowed to be moved. If you are playing a course with sloppy fairways, ask the pro if the lift & place rule is in effect.\n\nphoto credit: SouthAsiaGolf Taken from GOLF MAGAZINE: According to the recent Duke University survey the 5 most immoral kinds of cheating are: 1) After feeling you played well, you don't like your final score, so you change the final number. 2) You physically pick up your ball from behind a tree and place it in the fairway, which gives you a clear path to the hole. 3) After failing to find your shot in the rough, you drop a ball from your pocket and tell your group you found the original shot. 4) Intending to avoid a creek you know is there, your layup finds water-and you take a free drop. 5) You kick your ball from behind a tree to the fairway, giving yourself an unimpeded shot at the green.\n\nphoto credit: ttarasiuk Whiffing (missing) your ball on the first tee, is about the most humiliating experience in the game of golf. Its happened to everyone at one time or another as beginners. Miss the ball and its a one stroke penalty.\n\nNow, let's presume you hit a beautiful 285 yard drive down the right or left side of the fairway and it trickles out of bounds. For just a few inches of error or perhaps, just bad luck, you receive a penalty of one stroke and distance (tee it up and hit the shot again).\n\nThe rules of golf leave many players bewildered. I would venture to guess that golf has more rules than any other sport. Somebody correct me if I'm wrong?\n\nphoto credit: nimish_gogri Starting January 1, 2010, a new rule will go into effect that is designed to reduce the spin on the ball. This new \"groove rule,\" will take the advantage away from the \"bombers\" who, because of their length, are able to enjoy relatively close approach shots. Also, when hitting from the rough, they will hit more \"flyers\" (shots that roll when they hit).\n\nThe question: Will the new rule make the game easier for amateurs? Answer: Not yet ! For all players besides Tour Pros, the rule doesn't go into effect until the year 2024, however, the answer is a resounding \"yes.\" Amateurs will have more difficulty trying to stop the ball on the greens. Does this rule change make sense then?\n\nphoto credit: sidewalk flying If the flag is left in the cup while you are putting and your ball hits the flagpole you will incur a 2 stroke penalty and have to play the ball as it lies. If your ball hits the pin during your approach shot from off the green, there is no penalty.\n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages when the pin is left in the cup. When playing a shot from off the green, the flag can play an important role in stopping a fast moving ball that would ordinarily have rolled a good distance past the cup. Another reason for leaving the flag in the cup is for alignment, especially if you are playing to an elevated green and can only see the top of the flagstick.\n\nphoto credit: nsaplayerOne of the least understood options after taking a penalty drop, after hitting a ball in a lateral water hazard, is the drop on the \"opposite margin.\" USGA. Rule 26-1c says that if your ball crosses into a lateral water hazard, you're allowed to find a point on the opposite side of the hazard that's the same distance from the hole as the point where your ball crossed the hazard. From there, you are allowed to take a drop within two club-lengths\u2026but no closer to the hole (adding one penalty stroke).\n\nNote: If you draw an imaginary line from the point where your ball first entered the hazard, to that point on the opposite side of the hazard and that line first crosses land that is outside the hazard, then dropping on the opposite side is not an option.\n\nphoto credit: LiamDC In the Midwest, leaves accumulate in the fall in great quantities. In these conditions you should be sure to check with the course to see if it's using a rule that treats the accumulation of leaves as ground under repair. On designated holes, you may be entitled to relief without penalty if your ball stops in a leaf pile. If there is reasonable evidence that a ball entered a pile but is lost, a player can substitute another ball without penalty and drop it at the spot where the lost ball is believed to have crossed into the leaf pile. You must be certain the ball could not have been lost for any other reason. If you're not certain, treat it as a lost ball (Rule 27), take a one-stroke penalty and replay the shot."}

Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus favor the interlocking grip, but most other top players use the Vardon or overlapping grip, and many coaches recommend that juniors start off using the baseball grip. The decision is really one of the personal choice, so try out all the main types of grip before settling on the method that you find most comfortable.\n\nThree steps to a correct grip\n\n1. Allow the grip of the taylor made burner 2.0 to run along the base of the fingers on your left hand. The index finger is used to form a slight trigger.\n\n2. When you have closed your left hand round the club your left thumb should be pointing straight down at the ground, slightly to the right of center on the grip. You should be able to see two or three knuckles of the left hand. As you position your right hand on the burner 2.0 irons, the grip of the club is again at the base of the fingers.\n\n3. The grip is completed when you close your right hand on the club, so that the lifeline of the right palm rests on top of the left thumb, covering it completely. If the grip with taylor made r11 irons is made correctly, you should be able to see two knuckles on the right hand.\n\nGrip Options\n\nNeutral Grip - A neutral grip, where neither left nor right hand dominated, gives the player the best possible chance of returning the clubface squarely to the target line at the point of impact.\n\nStrong grip - If you can see more than three knuckles on the left hand and fewer than two on your right, the grip is too strong. You will be likely to hook or top many shots with clubs from r11 irons for sale online shop.\n\nWeak grip - If you can see fewer than two knuckles on the left hand and more than two on your right, the grip is too weak. You will be likely to slice or block shots out to the right."}

{"text":"In most cases, the type of golf equipment you use will depend on your experience, skill and to a certain extent personal preference. Indeed, it is true to say that people with mid level handicaps or indeed beginners with higher handicaps still might want to look at what equipment is available that will help them to develop their game. A good example of this is to use a distance golf ball.\n\nThese balls have been designed to make sure they fly the maximum distance possible and many of the golfers who switch to use them find that they can drop several shots off their score by using them. Their construction are quite similar to any other ball but they do have some redeeming features which gives them the ability to reach these long distances.\n\nDistance golf ball design\n\nMore often than not, distance balls are made using a two piece design, although there are some three piece balls that are perform to the same standard. The core is probably the most important part in one of these golf balls as it is here the extra distance comes from.\n\nThe two piece construction also helps to keep the cost down, in comparison to other balls.\n\nThe coating on a distance ball\n\nThe coating is just as important as the core as it protects the ball. Cuts on the ball can affect its flight and distance so the ball will be rendedered almost useless. The coating on these calls are design to be strong and durable to ensure that they can stand up to the impact of being hit with a golf club repeatedly. The most popular coatings are Ionomer, Surlyn and Urethane all of which have had testing done to make sure they can stand up to the impact.\n\nOf course, this also means a set of distance golf balls will last you a long time, so you wont need to worry about your budget too much.\n\nWhich distance golf ball is best for you\n\nUsually, The compression rating will help you to pick the right ball. When you strike a golf ball, the part that gets hit becomes flattened. When it is in the air, the side will go back its shape and in turn releases the energy that was contained in the core from the initial strike. This gives it an extra boost. The flattening is given a compression rating based on how easy it is to flatten.\n\nA low compression rating signifies that it is a softer ball. This are ideal for anyone who has not yet developed a fast swing. A general rule of thumb is to choose a ball my matching the compression rating to the speed of your swing.\n\nIt is worth remembering that most distance golf balls reduce the spin on the ball to aid its flight. If the ball does spin in the air then the chances are it was sliced or hit slightly wrong. This will cause the ball to curve when it is in the air so you will lack accuracy. As many distance balls negate this effect the result is longer and straighter (more accurate) shots. With that said, this can also impact your control and shotmaking abilities. You may find that you have less control as a result of this, though it is a small tradeoff and you should improve your handicap more by hitting the ball further, generally speaking. For this reason, it is also a good idea to look out for some good golf ball reviews.\n\nGolf balls should be constructed in the most uniform and with 100% error free manner to eliminate the slightest mistake in an actual golf playing situation. This is due to the higher precision you need in playing golf. The game golf will be dependent upon many factors such as the slightest wind conditions; hence you do not demand a defect from the ball affecting your playing levels.\n\nThis is why the claim of a quality golf ball will arise. Titleist logo balls therefore will furnish you with the best options and maximum utilization of a perfect golf ball. Not only is it elegant and supplies you with the soothe and status in playing golf, but it will also make certain to amend your skills. The golf ball itself can also contribute to better your skills in the game. A precise golf ball will provide you with the chance to play the game eliminating any defects given by the ball itself. This will help you identify your mistakes in a proper manner. Also you can check new skills not to overcome the defects in the ball, but to overcome the resistor by the air and the ground weather.\n\nTitleist logo golf balls will have an enhanced aerodynamics with slightly higher flight for longer distances. This will mean that the cause you will have to furnish in hitting the ball can be reduced and concentrate more on the aim. There are different categories in titleist logo golf balls for you to choose depending on the match situation and the preference. Titleist pro V1 will furnish usage in three piece multi layer construction which will maximize the outdistance that the ball is going to trip from a minimum force. Its durability and performance to withstand robustness is also proven to be in the highest class. With a dual core building, it will belittle the results on the spin of the ball which is a major influence on a player s performance.\n\nAnother type of titleist logo balls is the NXT tour ball. These are designed for average to full skilled golfers. They are especially made to travel longer distances.\n\nIf you start your golfing career with Titleist logo balls, you are most likely to succeed in the long run. Make your golfing grow lighter and fun with titleist logo golf balls."}

So did a lot of people. The event was wildly popular and one thing was very clear: The marketing people are certainly hitting their target audience. It was a traffic jam of Lexuses at the entrance gate.\n\nThe gimmick with the Founders Club is that it's a grandiose Naples-style gated community with the emphasis on a spectacular course that will never get crowded. As far as the houses go, I was surprised that there wasn't more variety. Though built by different builders, it's the same house over and over again. Fortunately, it's a very nice house: 10-foot ceilings throughout, a smallish living room, more like a hotel lobby, really, but a big family room and one of those master suites that those of us who don't have one and probably never will just drool over. It takes up a whole wing and includes a dressing room, two walk-in closets, morning bar with fridge, sitting area (often a separate study), lavish bath with two little toilet rooms and an enormous walk-in shower, not to mention a tub that would be more at home in a production of Cleopatra.\n\nSpanish Med still rules here, though I sense a new style struggling to get out. It's hard to describe but involves a lot of stone cladding. It's a weird mix of Spanish, Country French and Craftsman. Prices go from around $1.4 million up to $2.5 million.\n\nThe strange thing about The Founders Club is that the lots aren't very big. This was much remarked on by the crowd. Needless to say, the builders had the perfect answer. The lots aren't too small, they explained. No, they're the perfect size for carefree Florida living.\n\nTwo standouts. First, the John Cannon Elanora model, which, at $4,199,900, was the most expensive property open. I loved it. It was like a kid's idea of a mansion, with its own movie theater and eight-sided billiard room. Plus, it had the premium view. You walk in and see a distant expanse of emerald green fairway, framed by palm trees. It was beautifully decorated in an exuberant over-the-top style by some company from Winter Park. (What, we don't have decorators in Sarasota?) It was so visually stimulating that I'm afraid it pushed some of the toddlers over the edge and they began screaming and running around.\n\nMagnolia Golf Cottage at the Founders Club.\n\nThe other standout was the Golf Cottages, which have gotten so much publicity. They are 4,000-square-foot houses (priced in the mid two millions) on really small lots, right near the clubhouse. The theory is that if you really like golf, they're incredibly convenient to just fly down for a weekend. Here the style is Low Country, which is shaping up as the latest thing. Compared to Spanish Med it's like living in a nunnery\u2014all simple angles, lots of beadboard, and colors that don't venture much beyond black, white, gray and brown. Very nice, very sophisticated, but I'm already missing the rococo exuberance of the mini-Alhambras."}
{"text":"Disc Golf State\n\nWhich state in the continental US is the best \"disc golf\" state? In other words which state contains a numerous amount of properly designed and built courses along with multiple disc retailers and a community that is out to advance and promote the best sport in the world?\n\nReplies to This Discussion\n\nThe only real way to do this is to come up with a formula. So we need to start with criteria in which to evaluate each city\/state, and from there assign value and weight to each part.\n\nWhat is the main basis? beauty, course density, weather? course quality\/toughness?\n\nlets say that beauty is the starting point, lets give each state a value as a base number and minipulate it from there. Say between 1 and 3 in increments of .5, only Hawaii and Alaska get a 3 (for the sake of fairness) most states get a 2 with about a dozen or so getting a 2.5 (pretty much my first top ten) and and a few getiing a 1 (Iowa, Nebraska, etc...you know if your state sucks). For a city use (1 + .5 for each of the following attributes in the Imediate area of your local courses: elevation, view, mature trees, body of water (of signifigance, swamps and dry ditches - no, lakes streams and ponds - yes)\n\nHow about a bug factor, theres bugs every where so lets go with a seasons (between 1 and 3) of the year they are not a factor divided by 1.8. then take that number times your base number.\n\ncourse density, how about for a: city, you take # of courses within 60mi and divide by 50, and for a state you take total courses in the state subtract the average of all states divide by 7. use that number as a density factor to which you would multiply your base number.\n\nHow about weather, do you go with # of days in the 60's,70's and 80's on a year to year average? does precipitation negitivly effect it? so avg days of good temp minus avg days with more then 1\/16\" of precipitation? is there a severe weather factor? like hurricane zones and california have to mutiply by .5 five and certain other coastal states and citys by .75 for less likely severe weather (damages to courses, added equipment costs from saltwater). Would places like utah and arizona get an additional 1.125 or 1.25 mutiplyer for lack of mositure in the area for corrosion? i think so.\n\nSo what am i missing? local scene? hard to judge, but how about a mutipling factor based on just having something, if you have local leagues and tourneys use 2, if you have a few tourneys a year within short drive use 1.5 and if you have nothing local use 1.\n\nDo the same thing with equipment needs, if you have access to a lot of different brands use 2 if you can only get one or two of the big guys use 1.5 and if you have to buy everything online use 1.\n\nSo everyone do your state and city using these values and post them on here. Be honest, and we'll see where is best.\n\nHopefully this yeilds some interesting results and i can use this to come up with a way more accurate algorithm. If so I'll talk to Brian G at the PDGA and try and have a standardized formula created for future reference and comparison.\n\none of the criteria could be ...... how much money can the NW, SE, Confederate States Midwest, Lakes District areas raise for added cash for their major tournaments? ..... we always ask why isn't dg growing into the big leagues? everybody says where's the cash from sponsers? ...... why not each of the geographical areas raise cash for the touring pros to try and win? have a fund raising tourney or two, each geographical area trying to raise more cash for their National Tour event .... more cash you raise the more prestige goes to your area ...... dgplanettv could donate 50% of their subcription fees to payouts and people would benefit the pros by subscribing ..... etc etc etc.\n\nI was going to post that you could ask everyone where they live, and get 90% identical answers. But....\n\nI was distracted by Robey the one's list, and So. Carolina being #4. I'm from SC and love it, but even I wouldn't rank it that high. \"Sandwiched between Charlotte & Augusta\" is our leading disc golf attribute. Not to deflect a compliment, but what have you seen here that I haven't?\n\nWhich brings me to the stickiest aspect of this topic---the weather. I can't imagine a fair way to factor it in. Now, I would say that anywhere with long periods of snow cover is automatically disqualified. But my northern friends seem to feel the same way about life-threatening heat.\n\nThe chart at this link shows which states have the most disc golf courses nearest to the most residents. Bigger courses count for more, but it does not take into account quality of courses, or disc golf culture or anything else. However, I'd say it makes clear that the best state must be one of: Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, or Minnesota."}

{"text":"More ArticlesBasics\n\nThe key to having proper grip on the putter is to understand that there is no universally \"right\" way to hold a putter. There are many different styles of putters and different grips to hold those different styles, and a player should find the style that works best for his game and work with that grip. A consistent putter is a successful putter, and the only way to develop consistency is to find a putting style that you like and to practice until you are comfortable with it.\n\nHand Alterations\n\nOne of the ways that golfers choose to alter their putting grip while still using a standard-length putter is to change the position of their hands from their standard golf grip. A small change can be made by simply separating the hands slightly, so that there is a gap between the two hands on the club's grip. Some players go farther and actually reverse the positioning of their hands, with their rear hand at the top of the grip and their lead hand below it on the grip.\n\nGrip Alterations\n\nPlayers also alter their putting grip by changing the way their hands are holding the club. Changes such as this can be minor, such as the reverse overlap, where the index finger of the top hand is placed in the groove between the bottom hand's pinkie and ring fingers, as opposed to the bottom pinkie atop the top index and middle fingers. Grip alterations can also be more noticeable, like the claw grip, where the bottom hand does not wrap around the club, but instead points down the shaft.\n\nBelly Putters\n\nBelly putters add an extra element of control to the way that a player holds a putter by extending the shaft of the club up past the player's hands on the grip. The end of the putter nestles against the player's belly to provide a fulcrum for the arcing motion of the putter. To grip a belly putter, players usually use a grip similar to the grip they used when holding a standard putter.\n\nLong Putters\n\nA long putter calls for the most drastically different grip of all. The putter is long enough to reach all the way to the breastbone of the player using it. To secure the putter at this point, wrap a hand around it near the top of the grip, usually the lead hand, and hold the putter firmly against the chest. Use the second hand to grip the putter down near where a standard grip would dictate, and use only that hand to move the club back, then through the ball.\n\nReferences\n\nAbout the Author\n\nRobert Preston is a professional writer who majored in journalism at The College of New Jersey.

{"text":"Have you played Golf? It's a lot of fun, and quite stressful all at the same time. Unless your name is posted on one of the leader boards at major golf tournaments, that is. It's called \"golf\" because all of the other four-letter words were taken. I started playing the game when Tiger Woods started making a name for himself. A man I worked with at the time was a semi-pro, and \"loaned\" me one of his old drivers. The next weekend, I went to the local driving range. My first drive was what my uncle would have called a \"joenailer.\" The ball went straight toward the 300-yard fence. That was the best shot I have ever made.\n\nI made a hole-in-one on a local course two years later. I had birdied number five and was set up in the number six tee-box. Six was a par four dog-leg left. I knew I could get close to the green with my \"Big Bertha,\" so I stepped up to the ball. Something went wrong on my back swing, and when I hit the ball, it took off directly in front of me, toward number five green. It was one of those shots you hope nobody is around to see. The power of the driver sent the ball well past the five green, but it hit a pine tree dead center and headed back at me. It hit the green, bounced high into the air, landed three inches from the cup and rolled in. A hole-in-one. I know\u2026from six tee-box to five cup is not how the game is played, but hey\u2026I hit the ball and it went into the cup. Nobody was watching, and nobody got hurt.\n\nOn the back-nine the same day, my ball landed to the right of the fairway in pine tags after a fairly good drive off the number twelve tee-box. The tree responsible for those pine tags was directly between the ball and the green, 60 yards away. I took out my five-iron and decided to just try to get back on the fairway. Something went wrong on my back swing, (You can't blame the caddy when you play alone.) and I sliced the ball directly toward the green. After three bounces, the ball came to rest ten feet away from the cup. Number twelve was a par four, and I was on the green in two. An Eagle was very possible. Have you ever had the \"yips?\" It's a nervous affliction similar to buck fever. I sunk the ball for a bogey.\n\nI am obviously not a very good golfer. But there is always one shot that keeps my hopes up. I think it must be that way with most players. That one shot out of a regulation par 72 gives us hope that one day we will hit two such shots.\n\nSo why do I play Golf if I'm basically wasting green fees? It's the competition. I'm competing against myself and the course. Even in a foursome, every golfer is on his or her own. It's a group sport played individually. And I'm still trying to beat my last score. (My lowest score was a 59\u2026on the back nine.)\n\nI did find a good way to reduce my score, though. After the fourth lie, I pick up the ball and move to the next tee-box. See ya at the nineteenth hole the the upon with mixed emotions.\n\nFirst, there is the emotion of leaving your old, familiar location. I won't say whether it is one of joy or sorrow, because it depends on the circumstances of the move. Then there is the arrival at the new location, again, either joy or sorrow. But one thing is constant\u2026\"This is the last time we're moving.\"\n\nI have moved so often that I am sure I have misplaced and forgotten belongings in at least two states. I have had so many yard sales that I get up every morning at 4:30 and go straight to the garage. In one of my moves, I found something that I hadn't seen in twelve years, and I had moved three times within those twelve years.\n\nI have found \"things.\" Some of these \"things\" can be described with, \"I was wondering where that thing was,\" and some with, \"Where did we get that thing?\" And then there's \"What in the world\u2026?\"\n\nPeople accumulate so much stuff, and collect so much clutter, it's probably a good thing to move occasionally. It gives you a chance to really \"clean house.\" It gives you a chance to meet new people, visit new surroundings, and for some people, make a better impression on the neighbors than they did the last time they moved.\n\nWell, in just a couple more months, my wife and I will be moving again. This time we're moving to Alabama. And this time will be the last time we're moving. Period. (I've put my foot down this time.)\n\nEverywhere you turn, you see Green this, and Green that, and Green the other. Now, don't get me wrong, I appreciate Green. I try to go Green as often as possible. I tweaked my Chevy pick-up up to 23-24 MPG, up from 17-18, through tuning and soft-pedaling the gas pedal. (Great-Gran said, \"If you pretend that there is an egg between your foot and the gas pedal, you'll go further on a gallon of gas.\" Then Great Gram would add, \"Unless you live in the mountains, then it don't matter.\")\n\nBut the point is, I am not opposed to Green anything. Almost. Soon after we move in, I'm going to build a pedal-powered four-wheel cycle for my wife and me to sport around in. The way I see it, it's good exercise and it will save gas, and it will recycle some old cycles. That's Green, right?\n\nI use fluorescent tubes and bulbs. It saves me money, primarily, but it's good because they don't use as many watts as an incandescent bulb. That's Green, right?\n\nRemember up top where I said, \"Almost\"? I went to a Green website and found, quite by accident, a rollercoaster in Japan that is Human Powered. That's right. A pedal-powered rollercoaster. You ride this thing by pedaling, just like a bicycle. The pictures they showed are awesome\/horrifying! It's in the mountains! It's not a kiddy ride, it's for real! There's a seat that you strap into, bicycle-type pedals, handle bars, (though I'm sure they're just to squeeze the life out of when you start down that first hill), and a pretty pink basket in front of you. (Can't imagine what that's for.)\n\nCan you imagine being next-in-line behind someone who wants to stop a regular rollercoaster? If these things have brakes, there will be a major traffic stall, with shades of the movie \"Coaster\" where they blew up the coaster in Ocean View, Va.\n\nGreen is good...Fun is Fun. But that's just stupid. (Stupid is as Stupid does.) matter. It can be said in a variety of ways, further deepening and intensifying its definition.\n\nThe word is, of course, \"stupid.\" Think about it for a second. Stooopid. I had a friend several years ago who was a walking definition of the word. In fact, it was joked that if you looked up \"stupid\" in the dictionary, there would be a picture of my friend, with the warning, \"Do Not Imitate!\"\n\nGreat-Gran once told me, \"There is a difference between ignorant and stupid. Ignorant is not having enough information to make a logical decision. Stupid is having the information and not following it, thereby making the wrong decision, which usually gets somebody hurt.\" My friend, the walking testament to the word, knew full well that his old car could not make it to the R\/R Crossing before the train got there, but\u2026\n\nIn the movie Forest Gump, Sally Field (who played Forest's mother, and who also had my heart when she played The Flying Nun back in the late 60's) attempted to make her slow-witted son feel better by saying \"Stupid is as stupid does.\" (Not sure how that would work.)\n\nI can understand ignorance when it comes to politics. There is a lot of information about a lot of candidates running for one office. When I vote, I would rather be counted with the ignorant, not the stupid. What about you? \"Stupid\" really is a funny word.\n\nAnd each one thinks, no, honestly believes that they are right. They will fight you, or at least argue with you about it. There have been countless cases of disturbances, and some of them between spouses, siblings, and other family members.\n\nThen there are those who don't participate. Boy, do they catch an earfull! They are ridiculed for their stance by all the others.\n\nNow, I have my own favorite, and I completely understand why someone would disagree with me, but I don't try to force my opinions on others so I don't expect it in return.\n\nAs the years have gone by, I realize that Great-Gran was probably right. There's a lot of finger-pointing today, and most of it is by those who want to defend a feeble position. It seems to work really well, too. When someone stands up and points out a problem, or a situation that isn't quite right, someone else will stand and start yelling. And once the labels have been cast, there is little hope of getting your point across.\n\nIt doesn't really matter what the subject is, either. It could be in politics, religion, the economy, gun laws, education, or whether or not your mama-cat should be spayed.\n\nThe thing is...this Nation is so divided that no one will give any credence to a valid argument. There is no debate, there is only finger-pointing and name-calling. There is no valid search for knowledge of the facts, only stonewalling and more yelling.\n\nGreat-Gran died several years ago, but two things remain...he was right about the finger-pointing, and I now wonder what Great-Gran got away with."}
{"text":"Video:Profile of Arnold Palmer\n\nArnold Palmer is on the short list of the greatest golfers of all time. This About.com video will give you a brief look at the life and career of Arnold Palmer.See Transcript\n\nSHARE ON\n\nTranscript:Profile of Arnold Palmer\n\nHi, I'm Joe Chiodo for About.com and today we're talking about one of the greatest golfers of all time, 'The King', Arnold Palmer\n\nPalmer's Early Life\n\nPalmer was born on September 10th, 1929, in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. The son of the head pro and greenskeeper at Latrobe Country Club, Palmer was able to perfect his craft with hours of practice on the course his father worked at. He attended Wake Forest University on a golf scholarship before leaving school to enlist in the U.S. Coast Guard. After three years of service, Palmer returned to college to resume his competitive golf career, eventually winning the 1954 U.S. Amateur.\n\nPalmer's First Major\n\nPalmer made a big splash on the PGA tour with a victory in his first year at the 1955 Canadian Open. It would be the first of his 62 wins on the PGA Tour, placing him 5th all time in that category. Later that decade, 'The King' would capture his first major championship at the 1958 Masters, establishing himself as a star in not just the world of golf, but the world of sports, a rare title at that time.\n\nPlaying Style\n\nIn contrast to the subdued nature of golf and stoic demeanor of his competitors, Palmer wore his emotions on his sleeve and played the game with a rare competitive fire. That, along with his good looks and cavalier playing style made him one of the more marketable athletes in sports, an attribute usually used to describe the more popular baseball, basketball, and football players.\n\nCareer Highlights and Accomplishments\n\nAll in all, Arnold Palmer would go on to capture seven major championships in his illustrious career, winning the Masters four times, the Open Championship twice and one U.S. Open. It is at the 1960 U.S. Open in Cherry Hills, perhaps the most defining moment of Arnold Palmer's career took place, where he captured his first and only U.S. Open Championship.\n\nIn 2007, the PGA Tour event that Palmer began hosting in 1979 was renamed in his honor, and is now called the Arnold Palmer Invitational.\n\nThanks for watching our profile of Arnold Palmer.

{"text":"As energy levels decrease throughout a round of golf it can have a significant effect on your overall game play; decreasing physical performance, mental concentration, control, precision and accuracy. With this in mind it is of upmost importance that you start a round of golf with full carbohydrate stores, giving your brain and muscles a chance to perform at their best.\n\nWhile on a day-to-day basis you should be eating a good balanced diet containing 5 portions of fruit and vegetables, on 'game days' a higher percentage of calories should come from carbohydrates (about 60% to be exact) ensuring that you're keeping yourself fueled up. The majority of these carbohydrates should have a low Glycemic Index (GI), as they give a more constant energy release.\n\nWhilst it's vitally important that you fuel your brain and muscles with carbohydrates it's equally as important that you keep well hydrated - but not just with water. Perspiration contains vital nutrients and those need to be replenished if you're to maintain that energy 'balance'.\n\nThat's where a sports energy drink excels. Research showed that drinking 400 - 500 ml of sports energy drink before a round, followed by a further 200 ml at holes 6 and 12, improved putting performance (particularly over the last 6 holes) increased alertness and reduced fatigue."}
{"text":"Moore would finish with a blistering score of 24 under par, and he needed every birdie to claim a one-shot victory over second-place finisher Brendon de Jonge.\n\nTo shoot low scores you need to be on top of your game, while also eliminating mistakes and capitalizing on scoring opportunities.\n\nTour players make birdies for two reasons. First, they know how to put a wedge shot inside 10 feet, and second, they make those putts.\n\n\u2022\nTyrus York\n\nBut when we're playing and all of a sudden realize that a low score is within reach, something happens, and typically we get nervous or anxious. We start thinking about that low score and forget to focus on the task at hand of completing the round.\n\nThis \"performance anxiety\" not only affects players on tour who are trying to shoot 59, but also average golfers on the verge of a new scoring plateau.\n\nFollow the tips below to make sure you're ready to capitalize on your next chance to record a personal-best score:\n\n\u2022 Practice playing from the forward most tees. The PGA of America has a great initiative called \"Tee It Forward\" that encourages players to make the game easier by playing the course from a set of tees that significantly reduces the yardage. For a good player, playing the forward tees should present more birdie opportunities. If you get used to making more birdies or pars from a shorter yardage, you will be more likely to handle your emotions properly when you match that performance from your normal teeing ground.\n\n\u2022 Spend extra time honing your short game. Tour players make birdies for two reasons. First, they know how to put a wedge shot inside 10 feet, and second, they make those putts. Spend extra time practicing your wedges and make sure you know your yardages. Then get on the practice green and work on making putts from 10 feet and in.\n\n\u2022 If all else fails \u2026 don't keep score. Record the score for each hole then forget it! Don't let yourself start adding up your score before the round is over. There are several players on tour who walk off the 18th green and have no idea what they shot. This helps them stay in the present and focus on the most important shot in golf, which is always the next one."}

That shouldn't affect short irons by THAT much (I took two identical 9 irons, one regular and the other stiff and the difference was 5 yards).\n\nDouble check your lie angles and lengths in relation to the longer clubs. Not getting clean contact is a yardage killer. I picked up my AP1s used and found the 6 and P to be a degree flat (got a free lie angle adjustment at GM). Usually the weird distance is the opposite - loss of distance on longer irons.Josh\n\nFlat lies will kill your distance just about every time. If you get clean contact you pull it severely. You can get around an upright lie because you choke down on the club and get better distance."}

{"text":"Stretch your way to a better golf swing\n\nImprove your golf swing by increasing your range of motion through simple stretches that can be done at home.\n\nPhotograph by: NEWS photo\n, Lisa King\n\nEVERY avid golfer wants to improve their swing but might not know the best way to make it happen.\n\nThe most effective way is to work on your range of motion, as the full golf swing forces your body to move in ways your normal daily activities don't. A flexible muscle reacts and contracts faster and with more force than a less flexible muscle, thereby improving your performance. Greater flexibility in your shoulders, torso and hips will not only help you attain a fluid swing, but it will also help you avoid poor alignment of the spine and pelvic girdle, and minimize your chances of pulling or tearing muscles. Your stretching routine should include the three following stretches. Perform them after your warm-up, and hold from 15 to 60 seconds.\n\n? Upper pec\/pec major\n\nFace through a doorway with your arms flush against the frame. Apply a gentle force while pushing your body through the doorway. Remember to keep good posture and to keep your stomach tight so you don't overextend your back. The stretch should be felt across the chest muscles.\n\n? Latissimus dorsi\/back extensors\n\nKneel on a mat, and stretch your arms forward in front of your head with your palms down. Make sure you keep your gluteal muscles in contact with your heels and your arms stretched out as far as possible. You should feel this stretch through the middle and outer part of your back, and down into your lower back.\n\n? Rotation lower back stretch\n\nLie flat on your back on an exercise mat or blanket. Bend your legs to a 90-degree angle and keep your feet flat on the floor. With your arms out to the side and your shoulders flat on the floor, roll both of your knees together down to the floor.

{"text":"Make sure that you make the most of your practice\n\nWell, every golfer needs practice, from the touring pro to the high-handicap amateur.\n\nMost golfers, however, don't really know how to practice or understand what constitutes real practice. To be a better player, understanding what real practice is will enable you to make better use of the valuable time you spend working on your game.\n\nAccording to Webster's Dictionary, practice is \"to do or engage in frequently; make a habit of; to do repeatedly so as to become proficient.\"\n\nDeveloping a good practice session takes time and is about personal preference.\n\n\u2022\nCraig Renshaw\n\nUsing that as our definition, few can honestly say that they actually practice.\n\nPractice is not the half hour you spend hitting balls before you play; that is simply warming up. Real practice is like learning to write the alphabet when you were in grade school. Each swing, like each letter, has to be made with diligence to make it perfect.\n\nSo how do you develop a routine for a good practice session?\n\nDeveloping a good practice session takes time and is about personal preference, and it's something that your instructor can assist you with.\n\nUnderstanding your weaknesses and developing practice drills in all areas of your game will ingrain the fundamentals needed to correct bad habits and increase proficiency on the course.\n\nWhile practicing, it's a good idea to break your practice routine into different areas of focus, and this is especially true when it comes to your short game.\n\nI believe that a creative short game requires that you experiment with every type of shot and condition that you might face during a normal round of golf.\n\nThis means playing shots from tight lies, fluffy lies, buried lies in bunkers and side-hill lies, while also working on lob shots and pitching from heavy rough. After all, these are all shots that you will hit from time to time.\n\nBeing prepared for these shots allows a golfer to make good decisions when confronted with them on the course during a round. And ultimately, that's what you want to accomplish through the time that you spend practicing."}

The amount of time it takes you to draw your club back to ball impact is measured every time you swing.\n\nYou can vary your back swing and find the optimum time it takes you to develop your highest and best controlled club head speed. You learn quickly that club head speed can be increased by adding power continuously as you swing, and how to accelerate the club as you swing. Golf is dramatically effected by swing tempo.\n\nThe P3ProSwing\u2122 golf swing analysis software gives you the information you need to get the greatest distance and the most accurate shots with your swing.\n\nToe and Heel Height (in inches)\n\nThe P3ProSwing\u2122 golf swing analysis software determines whether your stance is too close or too far away from the ball. It measures the toe height and the heel height of the club. For a perfect stance you want the club to be parallel to the ground at impact. If the toe height is too high you are too far away. If the toe height is too low you are too close.\n\nYour teaching pro can also use this information to fit your clubs and help fine tune your stance when you address the ball."}

{"text":"Pete: I think I addressed this with my falling putt argument. IMO making violations obvious and infrequent will do a great deal to remove the perceived stigma in calling them. I've rarely seen an overbalanced putt inside the circle not called, maybe a couple of borderline ones where balance was dubious got a quiet word on the way to the next tee instead, but the majority are called.\n\nJames: The marking is not tied to it, it's quite possible to implement the rest with the existing marking rules, however I disagree on the uncertainty argument. The vast majority of lies would go unmarked as it would only be only necessary if you wish to use the thrown disc, or are already marking where the disc is not (OB, above\/below ground). So most lies would be more certain, as you'd use the disc exactly where it lies.\n\nAdditionally, using the thrown disc is a far superior visual indicator of the lie area, you almost have to have some part of your foot behind the 'shadow' of the disc.\n\nOne man's gripe is another man's ridiculous But it's not something we've even talked about.\n\nI'd be interested in thoughts on size\/shape of the lie area. Is 30x30 small\/right\/large? Square or circle?\nAlso the concept of a fairway marker at 30m instead of a circle as per Ricks suggestion. This would mean that if you overshot the basket by >30m, you cannot follow through on your return shots."}
{"text":"The other day I had a group of women come in for a lesson. There were three of them, best friends since their college days and just full of energy and fun. I had a great time working with them and finally got around to asking how they came to me for a lesson. The answer somewhat surprised me. Each one wanted to try golf or had some experience with golf because of their dad, a spouse or boyfriend; but they were intimated or almost fearful to take lessons or be on the course. This troubled me. So I asked more questions so that I better understood why this was the case.\n\nEven as best friends each one was unaware that the other wanted to try or play golf, it was strictly a coincidence that it was brought up during a girls night out that they found out each had a secret desire to take lessons and ultimately play. There has long been a stigma that women typically slow down the play at the course or they are too social to play. In my experience I just don't find that to be true. Slow play has nothing to do with gender or your level of play. If that were the case please explain why there is a push on the PGA tour to increase the pace of play - those are men playing at the highest level? Shouldn't they be able to play ready golf and set the example for everyone else? As an instructor it troubles me because I feel it's our responsibility to grow the game to make all people feel welcome.\n\nSo here is my pitch to all of the women that want to learn golf but are too afraid, too intimidated, or have just put it off because life just gets in the way. Get a few of your girlfriends together and call The Simple World of Golf for a group lesson. Golf is a social sport and should be shared with friends and people you enjoy being with. It should also be with someone who knows and understands the fears and apprehension that comes with a new experience."}

{"text":"The Bookends: The Launching Pad and Finish Condition Can Fix The In-Between!!\n\nEach golf season, as a full-time teacher\/coach, I reexamine techniques that I use, as well as the techniques of others in my area of the golf industry. During the past ten years, we have watched golf instruction, as well as golf technique information evolve. The how-to's, if you will, explode in abundance to the point where the student desperately needs, I feel, someone to help them not only with their golf game, but with any potentially confusing information that might divert the student from a properly focused path to improvement. You see, as my dear friend and mentor, Mr. Bill Strausbaugh (1992 National PGA Teacher of the Year), repeatedly has reminded me, \"Proper golf instruction is based on a few key principals that are learned and then worked on forever!\" It is my feeling that personal golf instruction, that is live instruction between professional and student, has become too complex. I also feel golf is severely over taught and undercoached.\n\nAn instructor should first diagnose a student's motion and decide in his or her own mind on a starting point. Sound fundamentals affect any golf motion. They must, in fact, be solidly in place first: grip, base, ball position, posture, weight distribution, alignment, tension levels of the arms and hands. All these items form the launching pad (traditionally called the setup) The First Bookend.\n\nThe launching pad is a static condition that is not in motion as opposed to a dynamic condition (the swing itself-having motion). I feel strongly \u2013 why move on in the teaching\/coaching relationship if the student's launching pad is, in fact, not fundamentally sound. I feel very strongly that most students who come for instruction at the club level: (1) don't understand the vital importance of a sound launching pad, and (2) don't realize how dramatically the cause\u00ad and-effect results of improper launching pad conditions can affect the student's ability to make solid contact with the ball on a regular basis. And next, produce the type of trajectory and ball flight on a consistent basis which will allow the student to control the ball and advance it around the course of play to produce a score that is acceptable.\n\nPlease allow me to give you an example. It has been my experience as an instructor that the vast majority of club players (also often Tour players and club professionals) that I have been privileged to work with, tend to align themselves too far into right field with their bodies; therefore, their club face is often aiming right of the foul line (or you might say into the right rough). Let me explain first what poor alignment causes. I like to view the target area in front of the player (i.e., the fairway off the tee and the green for my approach shots) as a baseball diamond. When I prepare a student to both optically as well as conceptually understand alignment, I ask he I she to feel as if they would like to aim their club face at the second base bag and their body lines (feet, knees, hips, and shoulders) at the shortstop. I also stress the shoulders may feel slightly (and I stress slightly) more left than the shortstop. Most players, I encounter, will aim their body, not club face, at the second base bag and their club face at the second baseman while optically they're commanding the nerve center to propel the ball over second base. Their conscious intent and their perceived actuality doesn't match; therefore, disaster looms.\n\nOften from this setup condition, the club is swung early inside, then lifted, and then rerouted over the top to compensate for a bad alignment condition. This leads to a very steep angle of attack and ball flights that are either pulls or pull slices, often both. The only difference being the club face condition at impact. The most recognizable problem with this is for a player whose normal 5-iron may fly 175 yards, the pull will go long left 190 yards and the pull slice will go short right 150 yards, so it's easy to see how this may be a very difficult way to play and score.\n\nThe above five scenarios are generic in explanation. These five problems are just a few of the issues I see on the lesson tee each and every day. Most students want you to fix their golf swing, and when you discuss the launch\u00ad ing pad with them, they look at you as if to say, \"No, my swing, my swing!\" Never believing in their heart that the relationship between the two (launching pad and swing motion) as so vital. Better yet, never understanding that the only sure way to cure their ills is to start with the launching pad. The correction, in fact, must start there! When I am finally able to get a student to buy into the importance of the launching pad and I physically lead them into an exact condition (that is a proper setup condition) in which I'd like them to begin, it often, in many ways, feels extremely strange to the patient. This is a true sign that their golf motion has actually been strangled by an improper launching pad.\n\nMuch of the work is not live action, like hitting balls on the practice tee. It is, instead, done in front Westchester. In the studio, I have a full wall mirror, as well as still photos hanging of various world-class players, for the student to see fundamental sound launching pad conditions. Through excessive repetition of the position, they can make constant visual comparisons between their image in the understanding mirror and the photos on the studio walls. The best way to convince a student that what is occurring is in fact correct, is to put them in a situation where they could best possibly convince themselves! Feel is not always real, but seeing is believing (especially when there is a real point of comparison).\n\nIn my entire career of both playing the game competitively as well as teaching and coaching the game, the number of launching pads I've seen at the club level that looked as if they would produce a desirable ball flight without the need of compensation could be counted on one hand. Conversely, during my time working with players on both the PGA and LPGA tours, I would count the launching pads that looked unable to produce a satisfactory result on one hand. Tour players look fundamentally ready to go.\n\nAs I switch my focus to the finish condition, I can hear folks out there screaming: \"What about the in-between? What about my back\u00adswing? My transition? My leg drive? My shoulder turn? My impact condition, etc., etc.?\" It is my belief not to ignore all of the above, because in my student's swing, each of the above could be an issue, and I do, at the proper point in our instructional relationship, address all of the above if necessary. It is my feeling, however, my strong feeling, that if I can posture and position my students' launching pad correctly and also allow them to feel and understand the conditions (feelings, visuals) of their finish (i.e., The Bookends!) they will have a heck of a chance of making an improved, dynamic motion in between these two static conditions.\n\nPlease allow me to continue. Conditions of the finish include the following:\n\nA level shoulder condition.\n\nA level hip\/pelvic condition.\n\nA vertical right foot.\n\nA right knee that finds a relationship with (touching and behind) the left knee.\n\nA vertical spinal column.\n\nA level head and level eyes looking level at the horizon.\n\nA feeling of balance dictated by your ability to swing at a controllable pace!\n\nAll of the above conditions for the club player usually need to be learned traits through, once again, the use of a mirror and many repetitions. I would usually start by taking some film of the student's motion, and simply freezing the film at the point of their own full finish. Of course, by showing them the films in the studio at Westchester, I, once again, can go through a point-by-point comparison of their finish conditions and that of one of the world-class players hanging on the walls in the teaching studio.\n\nmore to come!\n\nThis entry was posted\non Monday, January 21st, 2013 at 9:28 pm and is filed under Tom's Blog.\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\n\nSign up for Tom Patri's newsletter and receive monthly golf tips, commentary and special offers\n\nSite Menu\n\n2000 \u2013 2012 Golf Magazine Top 100 Teacher in America\n2006 Southwest Florida PGA Teacher of the Year\n2006 South Florida PGA Teacher of the Year\n2004 Southwest Florida PGA Teacher of the Year\n1998 Metropolitan PGA Teacher of the Year\n1981 NCAA ll National Champion"}
{"text":"For The Golf Enthusiast\n\nA funny recreational sport is golf. If you want to become better in golf, read these tips to learn how to better your game.\n\nYou can implement this subtle research into your own style, which helps create a stance and methodology that is perfect for you. It is so crucial for you to have a stance that works well with your individual build and style, but also accomplishes a good swing while allowing for precision. Finding the right stance will go far to improve your game.\n\nIn any sport like golf your body plays a pivotal factor in your performance. Your entire body is needed to truly power your shots. Your body should be fully involved in moving the club. This saves you from swinging your arms too hard, as it allows you to send the ball further.\n\nTIP! One of the first things you want to get down when learning golf is the proper grip for all of your clubs. Many people mistakenly believe they should grip the club extra-tight to hit the ball further.\n\nFor increased power in your golf swing, focus on involving your whole body in the swing. Beginning golfers often assume that the swing is all in the arms, but if you use only the strength in your arms, then your drives will literally come up short. It is more effective to move your entire body with the motion of the club.\n\nWhile putting, use your left hand to guide the ball by making sure it is slightly in front of the ball. Keep this position during your stroke to maintain proper form. When you do this, you maintain a solid grip on your club while at the same time preventing the ball from unexpectedly jumping off the club face as it makes contact.\n\nIf you are faced with a very long putt, you should devote most of your concentration to the speed with which you hit the ball. Avoid the temptation to go straight for the hole, instead choosing a larger target area. This technique will increase the chances that your second putt will be short, and ensure that you don't have a putt that is too long or short.\n\nTIP! Don't just use your arms and back for power when swinging a golf club. Involve your whole body in the fun to improve the effectiveness of your swing.\n\nMake sure you do get plenty of stretching in and hydrate yourself sufficiently. Keeping your body fit will allow you to get the most out of your ability.\n\nKnowing how exactly to keep score is a good idea for golf. Knowing your score is helpful for determining your status as a player. Scoring is pretty simple, for the most part; just add one point for each stroke you take and add them up to get your hole score. Unlike most sports, a lower score is better!\n\nGolf Swing\n\nTIP! Each of your golf clubs will have its own \"sweet spot\", a spot where, if you strike the ball with a great swing, you will get nearly perfect accuracy. You should practice with your clubs to identify the sweet spot of each, and remember to bring the spot into contact with the ball at the absolute extremity of your downward swing.\n\nFootwork is essential to a golf swing, so make sure that you have your feet properly lined up. This is among the most effective things that you can to get a better golf swing. Your goal is to make sure that your feel are actually perpendicular to where you want any ball you're hitting to travel. To make sure you are doing this, place your club so that it is touching your toes; you want the end of your club to face the way the ball will go.\n\nBring a high-protein snack with you on the course. Although it is a great sport, golf can be exhausting both mentally and physically. By enjoying a snack designed to keep you focused and energized, you will have a better chance to finish your round with gusto.\n\nDevelop a good position to improve your overall skills. Your stance is the number one determinant of ball flight distance. If you want the ball to travel a decent distance, you need to find the balance between bending over and standing up straight. Both slouching and standing too tall can negatively impact your ability to hit the ball.\n\nTIP! If you need to make a long putt, focus mostly on the speed that you hit the ball with. Aim for a target near the hole, rather than aiming directly at it.\n\nWhen playing golf, you should be both mentally and physically prepared. This is the time to rid your mind of all of the stress and to focus solely on the game at hand.\n\nWhen you take the tips from above and apply them to your golf game, you should be charged up and ready to go with the knowledge you need to improve your strategy on any course. Yet, keep in mind that true success comes from someone who constantly tries to learn and apply new things to their strategies and accepts that there is always something for them to learn in order to beat new opponents.\n\nPS \u2013 Are you interested in generating 100 leads a day?\nWould you like to cash in on those who don't join your business?\nGet the Insider Secrets\n\nGolf is a really fun and great recreational sport to play. Look at the following article if you would like to become more knowledgeable when it comes to golf, which makes it more likely for you to succeed.\n\nBy Once you find the right stance, you will immediately notice the benefit in your swing.\n\nUsing your whole body will help you to improve your golf game. The power of your swing is created through the use of your entire body. Learn how to take advantage of all of your body's strength as you swing. This will reduce strain on your arms and increase driving distance.\n\nTIP! By experimenting, you can find the best way to stand while playing. There's no stance that works for everybody.\n\nOne of the first things you want to get down when learning golf is the proper grip for all of your clubs. Many people mistakenly believe they should grip the club extra-tight to hit the ball further. Instead, make sure your grip is soft, but firm. Grip the club like you would grip a small bird.\n\nIf you're faced with a long putt, you need to focus your concentration to speed when hitting the ball. Instead of aiming for the hole, read the putt and aim for an intermediate target. This helps you to get the current putt distance just right so that the next one can be a short shot.\n\nTry to golf with better players and take note of what they do. A golfing buddy or peer can be an improvement for your game on several different levels. You can gain advantage from time with superior players without spending time with actual professionals. You'll get new ideas from how they play and you might try harder to be better just because they are around.\n\nTIP! Consider walking the golf course, rather than using a cart. Walking the course will also help you become more familiar with the grounds and help you with your shots.\n\nTry to stretch and get plenty of water before you start playing. Keeping your body fit will allow you to get the most out of your ability.\n\nRank Player\n\nKnowing how exactly to keep score is a good idea for golf. Your average score gives you an idea of whether you are a D-rank player or an S-rank player. Every time you hit the ball, you want to count that in your total for that hole. Each hole is different and has different pars for it as well so make sure you take that into consideration as well. The less strokes, the better!\n\nTIP! Using your whole body will help you to improve your golf game. Don't just rely on your arms for power, use the formidable power of your entire body.\n\nYou probably want to bring a nice healthy snack to fuel your body and mind while you're on the course. You may find yourself exhausted after playing for awhile. Golf is not only physically taxing, but takes a lot of concentration to play well. Protein will fuel your body and mind, making you less susceptible to mental drain and muscle fatigue; this allows you to keep up your endurance all the way to the eighteenth hole.\n\nFor a drive swing, align the ball with your front foot. For other swings, the ball should be consistently placed close to equal distance between your left foot and right foot. The exception to this is when your ball is positioned on a slope.\n\nNow that you've read this article, you should have a variety of ideas on how to improve your golf game. The only way to grow into a good golfer is through gaining the right knowledge and applying it to how you approach the game. Never stop trying to learn as much as possible, and hit the links with an improved game that impresses your opponents.\n\nTIP! Speed is a critical factor when you are trying to make a long distance putt. As opposed to aiming at the hole, look at the putt and shoot for a target.\n\nPS \u2013 Are you interested in generating 100 leads a day?\nWould you like to cash in on those who don't join your business?\nGet the Insider Secrets\n\nGolf is both a sport and activity that is enjoyed by people throughout the world. There aren't many things that can compare to playing golf on a nice warm day. Your game won't improve just because you want it to; you must give it a great deal of effort and work hard to improve your game. This article will make the road to becoming a better golfer a little easier to travel, though.\n\nThis can help you figure out what can work best. The key is proper stance, but it isn't the same for everyone. A good stance will do a lot for your game.\n\nSweet Spot\n\nTIP! Learn how to hold your club correctly from the first time you play. Quite a few people correlate a hard grip with being able to hit a ball further.\n\nEach golf club comes with a place that is considered the \"sweet spot\". This is a point on the club where a strike will have a perfectly accurate swing. Take the time to recognize where this 'sweet spot' can be found on each of your clubs in order to maximize your game.\n\nRemember that this shot is the only one that matters right now. Don't be distracted by your last bad shot or a water hazard on the next hole. Worrying about mistakes or hazards will take your mind off the current swing. Put them aside, and focus on the present.\n\nIf you can, golf with good players and study their technique. You will definitely benefit from watching a better player. You don't necessarily have to play them in order to reap these benefits. Try to pay attention to how they play and get new ideas for your game.\n\nTIP! Wiggling the toes may offer insight into problems with one's golf stance. If it is difficult to wiggle your toes when preparing to swing your club, this indicates you are leaning too far towards the ball.\n\nSo you need to drink lots of water and do your stretches before you play. Properly warming up and maintaining your body will have an equally positive impact on your game.\n\nDon't starve on the course, bring a small snack or high protein bar with you. Golf is a game both physically and mentally exhausting. The nutrients of your snack will sharpen your mind and ward off fatigue, keeping you focused for all 18 holes.\n\nLine your front foot with the ball when driving. By contrast, when hitting from the fairway or the rough, the ball should be about midway between your two feet. The exception to this if you are playing your shot from a slope.\n\nTIP! When putting, always ensure that your left hand is in front of the ball. Swing the club while attempting to maintain this position throughout your stroke.\n\nIf you're going to treat yourself to a golf club, have it custom-fitted. Since every golfer has a different height, weight and body structure, a club that works well for one golfer may not work well for another. A club which perfectly fits your needs will lead to a perfect swing.\n\nUsing an unnatural stance will be detrimental to your game. Practice concentrating on the ball without using a club. Start by flexing your knees, maintain a slight waist bend and then let your arms hang naturally out in front of your body. Clasp your hands together as if you were holding the club. This is what a natural position is, so if you don't feel comfortable with it, you are most likely overcompensating the position.\n\nAs we were mentioning, there is no other sport available with the qualities and mind-frame of golf; it is truly unique. Because golf can be such a challenge to master, you'll need to put in as much effort and dedication as you can to become an exceptional golfer. You'll see drastic improvements in your golf skills if you take the time to heed the advice given in this article.\n\nTIP! If you can, golf with good players and study their technique. There are various ways to benefit from a pro golfer.\n\nPS \u2013 Are you interested in generating 100 leads a day?\nWould you like to cash in on those who don't join your business?\nGet the Insider Secrets\n\nChances are good that if you had all the secrets to a successful golf game, you would not be reading this article, and you would probably be a multi-millionaire! Hopefully this article will provide the guidance that you seek to improve your game. It offers several valuable tips that could give you the success that you have been seeking.\n\nDoing this will aid you in learning what stance is a good fit for you. While proper stance is important, it won't be the same for everyone. It will vary based on your height, build and sometimes even gender. The better your stance, the better your game.\n\nLearn how to hold your club correctly from the first time you play. A common mistake many players make is thinking that a harder club grip means they can power the ball farther down the fairway. Instead, make sure your grip is soft, but firm. Imagine that you are holding the bird as you hold the club.\n\nTIP! When you are golfing, your body plays an important role. You have to use your body as a source of power, not just your arms.\n\nA common technique among professional golfers, though it sounds very whimsical, is the toe-wiggling exercise. If it is difficult to wiggle your toes when preparing to swing your club, this indicates you are leaning too far towards the ball. The best stance is one where there is some give in the feet, but not too much.\n\nA good golf tip is to relax, have fun and not be so serious on the course. You will be able to relax and have fun if you recognize that mistakes happen to everyone and are simply a necessary part of the learning process.\n\nIt is crucial that you maintain all of your minds focus on the shot that you will be making the next time it is your turn to swing. Don't let the outcome of the previous shot, or any upcoming challenges, influence the way you swing that club. Feeling frustrated about any of your errors will only let them manifest themselves again in your swing. Leave them behind and keep moving down the fairway.\n\nTIP! Wiggling the toes may offer insight into problems with one's golf stance. If wiggling your toes is hard to do when you swing, it will show they are leaning too far into the ball.\n\nGolf Club\n\nGrip your golf club in a neutral fashion. When you grip your golf club tighter than you should, your shots will tend to hook right. And if you hold it too loosely, the club will send the ball left. Analyze what direction your shots are traveling in, and then make alterations to your grip accordingly.\n\nAlign your front heel with the ball before you swing with your driver. Place the ball squarely between your feet for all other swing types. If you are on a slope, then it shouldn't be centered.\n\nTIP! A good golf tip is to relax, have fun and not be so serious on the course. Mistakes happen and being able to laugh at yourself will not only help you recover from these mistakes, but it will also help to relax you.\n\nMental preparation is as important as physical preparation in a golf game. Try to forget about other stresses you have and focus on your golf game.\n\nStand around four feet in back of the ball, and focus on the spot that you're trying to send it. Factor in conditions like wind at this time. As you think over your shot, you begin to get in the zone and focus when you do this. When you think about all of these factors and position yourself well, you can make a more efficient shot.\n\nIf your shot pushes to the right, it may mean that your body is sliding left when you swing. As you downswing, work on releasing your hands to the golf ball sooner. By working on this, you should find that your ball will more consistently find its target.\n\nTIP! Each of your golf clubs will have its own \"sweet spot\", a spot where, if you strike the ball with a great swing, you will get nearly perfect accuracy. To locate the sweet spot on each club, take your clubs to the driving range for some practice, and remember, you need to hit the golf ball at the lowest point in your downswing.\n\nAlways keep good posture. If you're uncertain about your golf stance, move your toes upwards and downwards while your feet remain motionless. You should be able to tap your toes with a little bit of effort. If this movement is difficult, you are leaning in above the golf ball too much. If it is easy to do, you are leaning too far back.\n\nLearning from the mistakes of others is so much easier and less painful than having to make your own, most especially in the game of golf. You love golf. Try learning from the experience of others who improved their game through trial and error. Apply these tips as a shortcut to making your own game better.\n\nPS \u2013 Are you interested in generating 100 leads a day?\nWould you like to cash in on those who don't join your business?\nGet the Insider Secrets\n\nThe game of golf has been around since the beginning of the 15th century, and it is a game that is enjoyed all over the world. Golf has changed a lot over the course of time, but it is still relaxing and extremely enjoyable! The article below details some nice tips you can put to use during your next game.\n\nBefore you invest in a new set of clubs, ask your course's resident golf pro what they recommend. Golf pros often have an impressive knowledge of all the newest clubs available on the market, and they'll also have a good idea what sort of club will be best for you.\n\nCorrectly grip the club when you first learn to play golf is vital. Many people think gripping a club hard can make the ball go further. Instead, you should use a grip that is soft, but firm. Approach the handling of the club as you would if you were holding a bird.\n\nTIP! Make sure to use your body to your advantage while you play. Not only your arms, but also your torso will serve as your powerhouse.\n\nFocus 100% on your upcoming shot. Don't let the outcome of the previous shot, or any upcoming challenges, influence the way you swing that club. Dwelling on mistakes is going to affect your game negatively. Stay focused, and move on.\n\nFor this reason, stretch before you play and drink plenty of water. As with any sport, better physical conditioning can lead to better performance.\n\nAvoid being super-tight or ultra-loose with your golf swing. Your shots will drift to the right if you grip the golf club tightly. If you're holding the club too loosely, it tends to veer to the left. You can make adjustments to your grip according to the direction of each shot.\n\nTIP! One of the first things you want to get down when learning golf is the proper grip for all of your clubs. It is very common for players to tighten their grip on a club, hoping it helps them hit the ball even farther.\n\nDuring your drive, the back of your front foot should line up with the ball. In every other shot, the ball should be right between your feet. The exception for aligning the ball at a center point between your feet is when you're making a shot from a slope.\n\nIf you're going to treat yourself to a golf club, have it custom-fitted. Your various dimensions, such as height and weight, will reflect differences in how the club should be shaped. Finding a club that is fitted to your needs will help your swing.\n\nBefore buying any used club, always inspect the the club's head and face. Shiny spots tend to mean the club is overused and worn. You won't be able to hit the ball appropriately with a worn out club head.\n\nIf your shot tends to head off to the right, you are most likely sliding your body to the left while swinging. One way to adjust this is to concentrate on pushing your hands through the swing just a little bit faster. You can boost your shot's accuracy by quickly releasing your hands consistently.\n\nRemember that walking on the course all day often causes your feet to swell. Keep this in mind as you are shopping for new golf shoes; you may wish to buy one size larger than you would ordinarily. Shoes that fit great in store, may very well become uncomfortable in use.\n\nIf the morning, when the grass may still be damp, is your ideal time for a golf game, stay away from any sneaker-like golf shoe. Although there are certain waterproof brands, most golf shoes of this type will get soaked when the grass is wet.\n\nTIP! Golf clubs have a point known as the \"sweet spot.\" If the ball is hit at this point, it will fly true.\n\nIf you are having difficulty carving out time for practice, you should focus your efforts on perfecting your short game. Focus on perfecting your chipping and putting skills. Having strong skills on the green definitely pay off over the long haul. If you have a little more time, then start with wedge practice, followed by a few 7 irons and finish up with some more short range wedge shots.\n\nWhen playing golf, see to it that you keep the game rolling. When people are playing slowly it can be annoying to the following group. If your group is playing holes slowly because of an unskilled player, let the group behind you go ahead of you.\n\nIn order to properly swing your golf club, you need a proper grip on the club. If you have a strong grip on your club, you'll be able to hit a variety of different shots. The grip of your glove-hand is vital, as a correct grip will help to improve your shots.\n\nTIP! Give every shot 100% of your attention. Do not let the previous successful or unsuccesful shot, or the upcoming water hazard, take you away from the hit you are about to make.\n\nThere is a reason golf has remained popular\n\nMost likely you wouldn't be reading this if your game was already great. However, reading this article will give you the skills you need to be successful at golf.\n\nCorrectly grip the club when you first learn to play golf is vital. The most common problem when trying to hit the ball far is they tend to have a hard grip on the club. Instead, make sure your grip is soft, but firm. One popular piece of advice given by instructors across the country is to envision that you are trying to keep hold on bird.\n\nA helpful tip when it comes to golf is to not take it too seriously. All sports contain mistakes, and this is no different. You need to be able to laugh off your errors if you want to continue being relaxed about playing the game.\n\nTIP! You can determine the best golf stance for yourself by doing this. Based on a variety of physical attributes, finding your proper stance may look much different than the best stance for other golfers you play with.\n\nExamine your club to find its center or \"sweet spot.\" No matter what brand of golf club you own, it should have this spot; when you strike the ball using the direct center of the club head, you can gain incredible drive length and precision. You should find out where this spot is on each of your clubs, and connect with the ball when you reach the end of a downward swing.\n\nWhen you finish one shot, turn your total attention to the next one. You don't want to let anything around you alter your success, don't let any unsuccessful shots or something like water make you worse. Worrying about mistakes can have an effect on your swing, so forget them and move forward.\n\nWhen putting, always ensure that your left hand is in front of the ball. You also want to do your best to maintain this position and form while you swing your club. This helps to get a smooth roll of the ball and prevents the ball from popping up as it meets the putter.\n\nTIP! Try walking, instead of renting yourself a golf cart. This is very beneficial to your health as you will be increasing your exercise on the course.\n\nA long putt requires you to focus on the speed at which you will be hitting the ball. As opposed to aiming at the hole, look at the putt and shoot for a target. That way, you are less likely to either overshoot or undershoot, and your second putt is more likely to be a manageable one.\n\nIt is best to grip your club with moderate intensity. Don't squeeze the club too tightly; this makes your shots go further right than you want. But if you don't hold the club tightly enough, the ball will tend to go toward the left. This can be used to your advantage, not when done by accident, but by remaining aware of the strength of your grip, its effects on the ball, and how to manipulate this before the stroke.\n\nAvoid using an unnatural stance. Try practicing your stance without a club in your hand. Stand straight, then flex your knees and bend them a bit. Next, allow your arms to fall to club height. Clap your hands together, as if around a club. By doing this, you should be in the right position to swing the club. If you feel imbalanced, you need to adjust your stance.\n\nTIP! A good golf tip to help with your swing is to coordinate the movements of your body with your swing. Novice golfers think the power comes from the arms, but only using the arms can make weak and awkward swings.\n\nLearn from other people's mistakes before you commit them too. If you are passionate about golf then these tips will surely help your game improve for the future!\n\nPS \u2013 Are you interested in generating 100 leads a day?\nWould you like to cash in on those who don't join your business?\nGet the Insider Secrets\n\nGolf is a great new sport to pick up if you have some extra time on your hands. Golf is a fantastic way to be outside in the fresh air while spending time with friends. Golf provides you with physical workout and an intellectual workout, because your brain plays an integral part on your level of performance. Use this simple advice to become skilled at golf and make it an enjoyable activity.\n\nTo get a better workout and save money, walk the golf course, instead of using a golf cart. This will be a big boost to your overall health due to the increased exercise you will receive. Walking also keeps your muscles loose and warm.\n\nFocus completely on the present shot. You should not be distracted by the previous shot or anything else going on around you. Dwelling on past errors will just cause you to make more errors, so just focus on the present.\n\nTIP! It's always best to walk the golf course, instead of using a golf cart to get around. Walking the course will also help you become more familiar with the grounds and help you with your shots.\n\nWhen you are putting, you should address the ball with your left hand ahead of the ball. Maintain your stance while swinging your club. This will help hold the club during your stroke and prevent the ball from jumping off the face of the club at contact.\n\nIf you can, golf with good players and study their technique. You will definitely benefit from watching a better player. You need not engage a pro to benefit from the company of a superior player. Watch carefully while experienced players take their shots. You may learn new techniques via observation. In addition, you may feel inspired to play your best game when you spend time around strong players.\n\nPut your entire body into your swing to get a powerful shot. While progressing through with a swing, picture your body being a whip, then push your legs against the dirt below your feet, giving them power to assist in the swing.\n\nTIP! When you're on the market for new clubs, consult with golf pros before you make your final purchase. Take their advice, and always research the newest innovations and try a wide variety of golf clubs before deciding which ones to purchase.\n\nPrior to purchasing a golf club, consider getting one custom-fitted for you. Golf clubs are not \"one size fits all\" and should be chosen with extreme care based off of style, physical aspects, and playing method. A club which perfectly fits your needs will lead to a perfect swing.\n\nKeep your eyes where you want the ball to go, and stand roughly four feet behind it. During this point, you should also be aware of the wind and your surroundings as a whole. These few moments spent contemplating the shot will aid you in your alignment and direction. Then, when you stand over the ball for your shot, you can more effectively direct the ball to where you want it to go.\n\nSometimes the best strategy is to work around the problem, rather then try to change it directly. It could be an advantage in the long run, and make your golf style unique.\n\nTIP! Always focus all of your concentration on the next shot. Don't allow the success or failure of previous shots or looming hazards distract you from the perfect shot in front of you.\n\nYou can make the most of your swings by preventing the club to travel too far. When done in moderation, pulling back will help you hit further, but if you go crazy, it messes up your stance, which can make you totally miss the ball or pull a muscle.\n\nAvoid becoming stiff as you step up to take your swing. Unfortunately, a lot of golfers tend to do this, and it really messes up their game. The object is to not be rigid but be loose; you want to be ready and relaxed to use skill and finesse to hit the ball with power. Make certain you don't tee off stiff!TIP! If it's possible for you to do, play with better players than yourself and be mindful of their techniques. Even though you will feel the sting of losing, the game will be a learning experience for you.\n\nPS \u2013 Are you interested in generating 100 leads a day?\nWould you like to cash in on those who don't join your business?\nGet the Insider Secrets\n\nIf you have found your article, you are probably looking for ways to improve your game. Every golfer, no matter how good they are can keep on improving their games. However, reading this article will give you the skills you need to be successful at golf.\n\nThis helps you determine your best stance. Finding a good stance is essential, but several variables, including body type, height, and gender can affect which stance is best. You can drastically improve your whole game just by finding the best stance.\n\nCheck with golf pros prior to buying new clubs. These pros will have up-to-date information regarding the newest clubs available. Also, they will be able to best determine which clubs will suit you well.\n\nTIP! It is a great idea to consult with a golf pro prior to investing in new clubs or other equipment. This is a good idea because a pro will be able to analyze your swing and stance to see what clubs are likely to improve your game the most.\n\nOne of the first things you need to learn about golf is proper club grip. It is very common for players to tighten their grip on a club, hoping it helps them hit the ball even farther. You should instead grip the club soft and firm. Hold your club similar to how you would a bird.\n\nBefore you swing, check your stance by wiggling your toes. You should be able to wiggle your toes easily; if you can't do so, you're leaning too far forward. To attain the correct posture, a golfer must lean back to the point at which there is some \"play\" in the feet.\n\nTest your posture when preparing to swing by wiggling your toes. If you are able to move your feet without difficulty, you are probably not leaning in far enough. You should lean into the ball so that your feet can move just a little bit, but not excessively.\n\nTIP! You'll find that your whole body becomes completely engaged when playing golf. Use your entire body as a power source, rather than just your arms.\n\nSweet Spot\n\nEach golf club comes with a place that is considered the \"sweet spot\". This is a point on the club where a strike will have a perfectly accurate swing. Practice with clubs to find their sweet spot, and remember to have those spots contact with your ball on your downswing.\n\nMake sure your left hand is actually ahead of your ball when you putt. Keep this position during your stroke to maintain proper form. This helps to get a smooth roll of the ball and prevents the ball from popping up as it meets the putter.\n\nTIP! You need to find out how to correctly grip your club when you are learning how to play golf. Avoid the urge to squeeze the club as tightly as possible when hitting the ball.\n\nWhen faced with a long putt, concentrate on how fast you will hit the ball. Choose an intermediate target rather than the hole. This will give you the best chance of success for your putt.\n\nIf you're going to be a golfer, take the time to learn how to properly fill out a scorecard. You should know how to keep score because you can judge how good you and friends did. Every time you hit the ball, you want to count that in your total for that hole. Each hole is different and has different pars for it as well so make sure you take that into consideration as well. The goal is to minimize the number of strokes it takes you to get the ball into the hole.\n\nAvoid being super-tight or ultra-loose with your golf swing. Gripping the club too tightly will send your shots careening to the right. Inversely, holding your club loosely will cause the ball to go left. In order to fix this, adjust the grip according to the direction of the shot.\n\nTIP! A good golf tip to help with your swing is to coordinate the movements of your body with your swing. When people first start out playing golf, they think the power is in their arms, but that is only partially true because you need to be in coordination with your body to hit the ball far.\n\nWith the game of golf, mental preparation is equally as important as physical preparation. Forget about your stress and focus on your game.\n\nBefore you pay for a previously-owned club, check out the head. A club that is worn due to use may have a smooth, shiny spot. This means the club will not make good contact with the ball as it should.\n\nIt is true that you can have an easier time at golf by learning from other's mistakes. If you possess a true passion of golf, you will apply this proven advice, that other people have learned in a difficult manner, in order to improve your game.\n\nTIP! When addressing each putt, it is important to have your hands slightly ahead of the line between your head and the ball. Maintain proper posture and hand position throughout your swing.\n\nPS \u2013 Are you interested in generating 100 leads a day?\nWould you like to cash in on those who don't join your business?\nGet the Insider Secrets\n\nGolf is a great game that can improve your health, and provide you with a healthy way to compete with others. Anyone can take up golf, the first step is simply getting started. Read on to learn how to begin playing golf.\n\nIn any sport like golf your body plays a pivotal factor in your performance. Your whole body is the force behind your shot. Your body should be fully involved in moving the club. Not only will you be able to hit the ball further, but it will also alleviate your arms from doing all the work, putting less stress on your whole body.\n\nBe certain to keep a pure mental focus and concentration on your next stroke. Don't think about your past shots or the water hazard you're going to have to face; don't get distracted from the very next shot that's up. Forget about your mistakes; move on, and do better next time.\n\nTIP! You will eventually find the best stance for you. Based on a variety of physical attributes, finding your proper stance may look much different than the best stance for other golfers you play with.\n\nWhere possible, include strong players in your golf group so you can learn from their superior technique. There are plenty of ways that you can benefit from a talented golfer. You can gain advantage from time with superior players without spending time with actual professionals. You will learn from watching how they play, as well as giving you a reason to get better.\n\nIf you want a powerful golf swing, use all your bodies muscles, in particular the leg and trunk muscles. Simulate the cracking of a whip while you swing your torso around and push your feet firmly against the ground. The energy for the arched swing begins in the feet and is transferred up through the legs and into your trunk and arms.\n\nMake sure your grip is neither too loose nor too tight. You shots will lean to the right if you grasp you golf club too tightly. But if you don't hold the club tightly enough, the ball will tend to go toward the left. Use the direction of your shots to correct your grip.\n\nTIP! If you want to improve the quality of your swing, you should learn to put the full force of your body into the motion. Novice golfers think the power comes from the arms, but only using the arms can make weak and awkward swings.\n\nYou may want to bring nuts or other high-protein food items with you when you play. Golfing can tire you out physically and mentally. Your mind will be alert and your muscles will not get too tired during the 18 holes, thanks to the energy and protein from the snack.\n\nIf you desire to improve in golf, you need to make sure that you're standing while having the right position. Your ball will only go as far as your stance allows. If your body is in poor position chances are the golf ball will not travel very far.\n\nGood golfers are as smart and mentally healthy as they are fit. Block out the stress and issues of your life and concentrate on your game.\n\nTIP! Giving your toes a wiggle can tell you a lot about your posture when you are ready for a golf swing. If you can move your feet very easily, then you have not aligned your body properly enough to take your shot.\n\nCheck your grip on the club before you make your swing. Your thumbs should be pointing downwards, with the handle of the club resting against your palms. Your hands should be touching each other. If you want the ball to go a greater distance when you hit it, drop your grip further down the shaft.\n\nDon't stand or hold your club in an unnatural position. If it feels uncomfortable, you probably won't be able to play well. Practice standing with the ball, without holding a club at all. Start by flexing your knees, maintain a slight waist bend and then let your arms hang naturally out in front of your body. Clap your hands tightly and hold them. This is how your golf stance should be, and if you are not comfortable, then perhaps you are not positioning yourself properly.\n\nLearning golf is quite simple and you will benefit from it, both mentally and physically. Now that you have read these tips, it is time to tee up to play a round!\n\nTIP! One of the most important things to remember when playing golf is not to take it so seriously. You are sure to make mistakes.\n\nPS \u2013 Are you interested in generating 100 leads a day?\nWould you like to cash in on those who don't join your business?\nGet the Insider Secrets\n\nGame is a game that many have been enjoying as far back at the 1400s. Although the sport has advanced over time, it is basically still the same relaxed game. The article below details some nice tips you can put to use during your next game.\n\nWhen you're on the market for new clubs, consult with golf pros before you make your final purchase. This is something you should know because a professional will be able to aid you in club selection and will know what types have been created lately.\n\nTry a toe-wiggling experiment to reveal any faults in your stance. If wiggling your toes is hard to do when you swing, it will show they are leaning too far into the ball. Proper posture for golfers can be obtained by leaning back until there is some play in the feet.\n\nTIP! By\n\nSweet Spot\n\nYou may hear the term \"sweet spot\" when discussing golf clubs. This is the area on the club face that reaps the best results when striking the ball. Practice with clubs to find their sweet spot, and remember to have those spots contact with your ball on your downswing.\n\nOne excellent way to improve your game is to play with people that are better than you and observe how they approach the game. There are many tidbits of information you can gather from watching an advanced golfer play. You mustn't engage a pro so you can benefit another player's comapny. Simply observing their play style will allow you to gain new ideas and skill.\n\nTIP! To ensure your posture is correct, wiggle your toes. If you have free movement of your feet without any problems, then you may be too far from the ball.\n\nIf you're going to be a golfer, take the time to learn how to properly fill out a scorecard. The importance of this is that your score is regularly used to determine your ability as a player. Each time the ball is hit, it is counted as one stroke. The number of strokes you take to land the ball into a targeted hole will determine your score for that hole. You want to reach the hole in the least amount of strokes possible.\n\nIf you are seeking power from your swing, focus on building a strong core and solid legs. You need to whip your body around during the swing, deriving strength from your legs as they push against the ground.\n\nLine your front foot with the ball when driving. For other swings, position yourself so that the golf ball is evenly between your feet. The exception to this if you are playing your shot from a slope.\n\nTIP! Each golf club in existence has it's own \"sweet spot.\" When you hit your ball squarely with the sweet spot on the face of the club, your ball takes off with perfect accuracy.\n\nIf you want to up your golf game, then make certain your posture is proper. Improper posture or standing too close to the ball can impact the length and direction of your shot. Slouching during your shot will ensure that your ball doesn't go very far at all.\n\nWhen purchasing your next set of golf clubs, you might want to check into custom-fitted ones based on your exact specifications. Because every golfer's build, stance and swing is different, not every club will offer the same results from one player to the next. Getting a fitted golf club can aid your swing.\n\nDo not get caught up in trying to assume an unnatural stance. Try to address the ball without using a club. Bend your knees and waist a little bit and relax your arms so that they fall. Hold your hands together as you maintain this stance. That is the natural stance you should take. If you feel awkward in this position, you are doing something wrong.\n\nTIP! Always stay focused on the next shot. Whether you have been hitting well or poorly so far doesn't matter \u2013 you're only as good as your next shot.\n\nGolf continues to be popular for a reason"}
{"text":"Anyone who golfs left-handed hears it at least once a season. You're lining up your drive on the first tee when a guy in the next foursome barks out: \"Hey, you're standing on the wrong side of the ball.''\n\nThis is the same guy who asks if it's hot enough for ya when it's 30 C, or calls one of his few remaining friends at the office and asks if he's \"workin' hard or hardly workin'.''\n\nYou can't teach somebody that kind of subtle, razor-sharp wit. Unfortunately, you can't beat him with clubs, either.\n\nSo you pretend you haven't heard it a million times before and you force yourself to chuckle at a line that would make a Grade 2 gym class roll its eyes.\n\nNo, it's not easy being a lefty. You can never find the equipment you're looking for, you have to translate instruction books and videos, and they won't let you send tee-box comedians scrambling for cover with a knock-down shot.\n\nBut there is hope. Back-to-back Masters victories by Mike Weir and Phil Mickelson are driving left-handed golf to the forefront of consciousness and acceptance.\n\n\"The biggest thing these two wins have done is legitimize left-handed play,'' said Texas-based Trey Owen, chairman of the National Association of Left-Handed Golfers.\n\nTHE DUMB JOKES\n\n\"If you get the dumb jokes anymore you have a legitimate comeback. But I honestly think there will be less and less of that now because Weir and Mickelson are putting lefties in more of a mainstream area.''\n\nWhile the wins are a huge moral victory, success in the golf shops is another story. The search for left-handed stuff can still be maddening.\n\nIn Canada, because many kids shoot left in hockey, the percentage of left-handed golfers is about 30%, greater than anywhere else in the world. But in the U.S. the number is only seven per cent. And the U.S. market drives the industry, so left-handed equipment remains a difficult buy.\n\n\"Even though there are left-handed players winning big tournaments on the PGA, lefties in the States are still a relatively small marketplace,'' said Tyler Lefebvre, manager at de Boer's Golf Shoppe and Training Centre. \"So companies just don't make as much left-handed equipment as right-handed equipment.''\n\nEven PGA pros, when they see great new stuff on display at tournaments, are always asking the reps how long they have to wait before it comes out in left.\n\n\"If the company does make the club in left, you don't always get the same choices,'' said Lefebvre.\n\n\"There could be three or four different lofts available in a driver, but left-handed there might only be two.''\n\nTHAT'S DEDICATION?\n\nCallaway dedicates just five per cent of its equipment to lefties.\n\nEven though Steve Flesch (one of only six full-time PGA lefties) is a Cleveland guy, their new CG10 wedges don't come in lefts yet. The Nike 460 Ignite Driver comes in four lofts for righties, two for left (the 410 Ignite doesn't come in lefts at all). Of the 20 wedge brands listed in the 2004 Golf Equipment buyers guide, only nine are available left-handed (and eight of those nine offer fewer loft options for lefties).\n\n\"As far as finding equipment you can't always go with what you want,'' said Jason White, a left-handed assistant pro at Raven Crest. \"When I wanted Taylor Made they didn't make a left-handed player's club so you end up going with Nike instead, which I don't think is as good a club. But it's coming around.''\n\nIt's better, at least, than it was 20 years ago when left-handed equipment didn't hit the market until a year after it came out in right, if at all.\n\n\"When you talk to people who played left 20 years ago, they'd walk into a store and they might be able to find one set,'' said Lefebvre.\n\n\"It's still that way down in the States; you go into a store and 95% of the inventory is right-handed. There might be one offering from Titleist, one offering from PING and Nike and that's it. You're not going to get all the choices.\n\n''That's just because the numbers dictate it. They're not selling it so there's no point in bringing it in.''\n\nAnd don't expect PING, Cleveland, Callaway and Nike to flood the marketplace with left-handed stuff because Weir and Mickelson won the last two Masters.\n\n\"It won't change a whole bunch,'' Lefebvre said. \"What it might do is get people thinking it's acceptable to play left-handed, but in terms of the manufacturers it's going to take a significant bump in left-handed customers before it results in more equipment.''\n\nCOULD BE A WHILE\n\nHockey isn't exactly booming in the States, so it could be a while yet before a legion of lefties emerges with the power to demand equal opportunity. But Mickelson and Weir are at least blazing a trail, and making some inroads.\n\n\"The best thing I heard this year is that Titleist has a set of irons that Phil helped them design,'' said Owen.\n\n\"And they're only available in left- handed, no rights at all. That's huge.''\n\nAre you surprised Don Cherry backed Daniel Alfredsson's comments?\nYes.\nNo.\nIt's Don Cherry - who knows what he will say.\nNot sure."}
{"text":"There might be some confusion and\/or wrong impression with the term \"golf fitness.\" Fitness implies a state of health like having a normal blood pressure or not being overweight or even having the endurance to run 3 miles.\n\nGolf fitness, in the context it's used, doesn't really pertain to any of these, although some are often by-products from a well planned golf fitness training program. The term golf fitness refers more to the golfer's physical ability to swing an efficient golf club so as to produce good swing mechanics, effective outcomes, and a decreased potential for injury.\n\nIt also relates to the golfers ability to produce an efficient golf swing for 18 holes, including the driving range prior to the round and any practice swings taken during. Four plus hours of activity can take its toll, regardless if you walk or ride, and that fatigue you might be experiencing on the back nine will only increase the potential for bad shots and physical harm.\n\nMost golfers, unfortunately, are not physically prepared to swing a golf club. Factors such as inactivity, lifestyle, and heredity predispose many golfers to anatomical deficiencies in their bodies that rob them of peak performance. These factors often influence swing efficiency, which impacts ball contact and flight, distance, and the development and persistence of those nagging aches and pains so many golfers experience."}

Tee off with Jeff this summer and improve your game on BC's highest golf course!\n\nClick here for an overview of lessons and clinics, and tee off with the pro today!\n\nTips from the Pro to Improve Your Game\n\nAim\nMost amateurs tend to aim incorrectly on the golf course. The mistake is made when addressing the golf ball. Instead of setting your body alignment first, try lining up the clubface first with your target. To make things easier, stand behind the golf ball prior to addressing it. Then, determine your target line and pick a spot six inches in front of the ball to aim your clubface at. Lastly, set your feet, take a last look at the hole and swing. This should help with getting your golf ball started on the correct line.\n\nClub Selection\nClub selection is a vital part to knowing what shot to play on the golf course, therefore it's important to know how far you hit each iron in your bag. To determine your distance with each club, take ten balls and hit them with your 8 iron. Determine how far you hit the ball by taking the average of your ten shots. Your irons are made with 4 degrees of loft difference so you should have a 10 yard difference between each iron. For example if you hit your 8 iron 130 yards, your 9 iron should hit 120 yards and your 7 iron 140 yards. Being aware of these distances will make club selection throughout the course much easier.\n\nPutting\nA lot of short putts are missed because the face of the golf club opens or closes at the moment of impact. To prevent this from happening, shorten your back swing and lengthen your follow through to insure the putter is accelerating through impact. As well, soften your grip on the putter to relieve any tension in the hands. This should help you make more of those three footers and increase your putting confidence."}

{"text":"How To Fix A Golf Slice\n\nBy: lucas richard\n\nBreak Studios Contributing Writer\n\nNearly every beginning golfer needs to know how to fix a golf slice. Slicing is a common problem shared by everyone who has ever taken up the game of golf. Most beginners will have either a hook or a slice in their golf shot, especially with their distance clubs, particularly the driver. Here are some pointers for correcting the slice in your golf shot.\n\nCheck some things in your grip. The way you grip a club is an individualized aspect of the golf shot. What works for one golfer may not work for another, but there are some general rules for the grip that may help you fix the golf slice. After you have squared up your club face with the target, you should be able to look down at your hands and see at least two knuckles on your left hand. If you see more than two, that is fine as well. Another thing to check is whether the \"V\" shapes formed by your index knuckles and your thumbs are pointing at your shoulder. If these things are present, then your grip is not a contributing factor in your golf slice.\n\nMake sure you have the correct stance. Far too often a golfer will try to correct his golf slice by compensating for it by lining up his stance either far to the left for the right-handed player or far to the right for the left-handed player. This is no way to fix your golf slice. You should either use a club or a partner to make sure that your feet, shoulders, hips and knees are lined up parallel to the target.\n\nCorrect your back swing. This is often were the problem is when a golf slice is present in your game. Often there is too much \"up\" and not enough \"around\" in your back swing. At the peak of your back swing, your club shaft should be over your shoulder and not over your head. You should be able to feel your arm across your chest. If you are not doing a correct back swing, then the club face will be striking the ball at the wrong angle, thus creating a slice in your golf shot.\n\nMake a smooth down swing. If you are still slicing the ball after correcting the first three aspects of your golf swing, then you are in the minority. However, checking your down swing should fix the problem. Make sure that when you begin your down swing that you are not lifting your feet or pushing with your arms. You should feel the natural twist of your torso, with the weight shifting from your back foot to the front. You should feel the slight drop of your front arm across your body. This should ensure the proper contact between the club face and the ball, thus correcting your golf slice."}
{"text":"Improper posture and alignment can be prime culprits of a bad golf swing. (Courtesy photo)\n\nWant to improve your golf swing? Point your chin at the ball\n\nBy Les Miller, Contributor\n\nI've watched golfers set up to the ball correctly only to turn their chin toward the target or away from the ball before they start their backswing. This movement of the head will ruin good alignment and solid posture causing golfers to make bad swings.\n\nIt is important to note that these bad swings are all due to the position of your head at address. By tilting your head you misalign your posture, this makes you alter your swing path through the impact zone. The bad swing is directly caused by improper posture and alignment.\n\nHere's a tip to think about: In the last few seconds before you make a swing, point your chin at the ball and keep it pointed at the ball until the club face hits the ball and you are following through.\n\nPointing the chin at the ball during your swing enables you to retain the proper body position and spine angle during your swing. When you turn your head, your posture and spine angle change, which alters your swing path causing all sorts of problems - lifting your head, opening your shoulders, pulling or pushing shots.\n\nRemember to \"point the chin\" for every shot, from driver to putter, and you'll keep your spine angle and posture in place during your entire swing. You will find that your shot inconsistencies and ball sticking will improve dramatically with just this quick fix.\n\nOctober 16I think this is duff gen as it flattens your posture too much through the swing and you stand up. Foavial vision, where you keep the centre of your eyes on the ball.This is the way you should address the ball is the correct method. Don't believe me? check out hogan, nicklaus, palmer and more recently robert rock and ernie els. Chin at the ball lifts the head too much and flattens the swing....\n\nThere is a youtube video in which sam snead councils the golfer to turn the head to the right before the backswing because it relaxes the left side and facilitates a good shoulder turn, Bobby jones turned his head right, so did nicklaus and hogan and a host of others"}
{"text":"Thursday, March 27. 2008\n\nThe other Open\n\nQuestion: How can you tell the difference between the U.S. Open golf tournament and the U.S. Open bowling tournament?\n\nAnswer: The golf tournament isn't named the Denny's U.S. Open, although both have something to do with the grand slam \u2013 and I'm not talking breakfast.\n\nLike the golf tourney, this week's 65th Denny's U.S. Open bowling tournament is a major, but you can't compare major championship golf to major championship bowling.\n\nGolf majors are played on great courses like Augusta National, Pebble Beach and St. Andrews. Bowling majors are held at places like Brunswick Zone Carolier in North Brunswick, N.J.\n\nIt's nice enough as bowling centers go, but it looks and sounds like, well, a bowling center. A very long bowling center. Eighty-two lanes on two levels. You know, lots of lanes and limited lighting.\n\nThe Carolier has been around awhile, long enough to host something like 14 PBA events, including the last four U.S. Opens. It will host at least two more Opens. Why? It's simple: They love bowling in Jersey. Ever hear of Johnny Petraglia? This is his turf. Parker Bohn III's, too.\n\nThe fans, even during the week, arrive early. I got to the center at mid-morning the last two days and had trouble finding a parking place. I hear it gets really crazy when match play starts (Friday). Can't wait to see what it's like for Sunday's TV show.\n\nAnd it's not like it's easy to watch the action. There are pillars every six lanes or so, a big control booth fronting the lanes on each level, a wall separating the levels, and obstacles blocking the ends. You gotta love bowling to watch it in person.\n\nIn a nutshell, it's everything that's wrong with bowling and everything that's right. The bowlers here love it. But it's a major reason why bowling, as a professional sport, isn't a major"}
{"text":"Tiger's putter & ball not found on retail versions.\n\nnot sure if i am rightor not,but it looked like his putter had a ping grip\n\nHas had a Ping grip since high school. There were stages where his sponsors would have him try their attempt to replicate it (Titleist, Nike) but none have lasted very long.\n\nHe used a Ping Anser style putter growing up hence the obvious comfort with that grip.\n\nI dont really understand how the engineers at the oven cant mix up a polymer to exactly match that grip unless there is some kind of patent infringement issue. Needless to say it gets a lot of attention when people see it for the first time.What\u2026I tried the Nike One tour ball when they first came out (Scott Draper gave me a sleeve). As good, if not better than the ProV1's. Price was the issue for me.\n\n\"Competitive pricing\" doesnt seem to be in the vocabulary of Axis golf. Either that or their definition of it is incorrect.\n\nThe One tour's were an awesome ball. I can see why Tiger still uses them, but it's common knowledge that Tiger uses a different blend in his Tour D, a very soft construction similar to what was common 10+ years ago. Balata-ish almost. Imagine if he started using a modern ball???\n\n\"It's just a job. Grass grows, birds fly, waves pound the sand. I beat people up.\"\n\nThey are currently made in Japan \/ China and Taiwan with the actual Tour balls mainly coming from the Bridgestone factory in Japan. whilst they keep working on their Taiwan tour balls.\n\nBoz, if it's the same machinery being used to output the same chemical formulas, how much difference is there in a largely automated process to the end product produced in different locations? How much can the human operators f things up if human input is limited?\n\nGood question,,, ok the Japanese balls have come from a factory that has 30 years or more of premium ball experience and I don't think they have told Nike exactly how they do what they do, where as the 20X1's are coming out of a new plant from what I understand that has been making urethane balls for 3 years?\n\nEach OEM supplier has their own way of producing balls, Nike does not design balls so has to look to each factory to offer designs that they do best.\n\nAnother way to look at it is all the ball companies have been trying to make a ball that feels like the ProV1 since 2000 and in general I don't think any one has actually succeeded, close but not the real feel and sound,,,,they have all though got a lot closer to the ProV1X though as it has been such a hard ball internally and as such more like many other multilayer tour ballsHahaha. Ok.\n\n\"It's just a job. Grass grows, birds fly, waves pound the sand. I beat people up.\"It's just a job. Grass grows, birds fly, waves pound the sand. I beat people up.\"\n\nThe One Tour and One Tour D are Bridgestone designs and as such very good balls with many years of joint development involved between Nike and Bridgestone.\n\nThese balls have been very popular in the US in the past but I don't believe they are currently available at retail any more as that deal is not in play any more even though there is stock on hand for players.\n\nTitleist has always kept some older lines alive as well if enough Tour players asked them to. Players don't like balls to change to much as they like to TRUST what they know and NEW is always an unknown as a player.\n\nThe 20X1 S (Taiwan) 2011\/12 spins as much as any other urethane covered ball but it feels firm within on partial wedge shots and sometimes a bit clunky on full iron shots.\n\nThe newer S version is better but as I have seen in the past they still have some work to do in maintaining ball speed numbers whilst obtaining the feel and sound they need to convert more players.\n\nI would think Rory is playing with a Japan Nike (Bridgestone) ball at present as they are closer to the Titleist models.\n\nThey have been good at maintaining premium prices world wide like Titleist has as that is the only way to pay for the large amount of advertising and promotional expenses you incur when doing the tour validation approach to marketing.\n\nCheers, Boz.\n\n.Please Read this Disclaimer which is an integral part of my Post .My posts are just my written opinions,fiction or satire. .No one was intended to be harmed by this postI was given a few sleeves of 20xi S to test. I used one and the rest haven't been touched. By saying rock I'm referring more to the feel of the ball. The only other tour ball that has a harder feel is the old Callaway tour 56. The 20xi is extremely hard and has distictive loud bang off the driver face, very loud click off the putter. A similar sound to a cheap hard two piece ball. Which I believe is due to the resin used to make the core? In a golf ball I look for feel around the greens, as do most better players. While the ball may spin ok on wedge it just feels horrible. A lot of reviews which can be found online by golf digest etc commented on the hard feel.\n\nAs for spin rates I can't really find any stats online for the 20xi that back up or disprove what you're saying. anyoneI'm generally aware as to what balls my playing partners\/opponents are using. It's not like a Wednesday comp where you rock up and tee off. Markings and balls are compared before tee off.\n\nI do recall a few American blokes playing Nike balls a few years back before the 20xi rocks were released. The Nike one tour was definately a softer feeling ball and I would guess much more popular in the USA than Australia.\n\nAt big events such as national amateurs and state opens players are also asked to write down what equipment they play on the registration sheets. There is a very long line of Titleist and the odd other type of ball thrown in. Usually Srixon."}

{"text":"One of the things I enjoy most in golf is the opportunity to travel to Augusta, Ga., for The Masters each spring. It's truly an amazing event and one every golfing enthusiast should experience at least once in his or her lifetime. From the Par 3 Contest, to the magnolias in bloom, to the best back 9 in championship golf, The Masters is beyond compare in both style and competition. I love the tournament's international flare, not to mention the unique array of champions who have donned the infamous \"green jacket.\" In this segment, I'll break down some of the keys to victory of the tournament's most recent champions: Angel Cabrera, Trevor Immelman and Zach Johnson. With these simple tips, you'll find the keys to success to conquering \"golf's greatest major!\"\n\nZach Johnson, 2007 Masters Champ Score: 289, one over par Margin Of Victory: One shot over Rory Sabbatini, Retief Goosen & Tiger Woods How He Won: Destroyed par-5s by laying up to his perfect wedge range His Shot: How to hit the 3\u20444 wedge\n\n1. Set left\nThe key to feeling confident from a short distance is to make consistently solid contact. Players who allow their weight to shift away from the target generally have an inconsistent bottom to their swing arc. This produces both fat and thin hits.\n\nOn shots from within 100 yards, set your weight more toward your left side. As a result, your swing will, in essence, pivot around the left side \"post\" you've created. This left-sided stability will ensure you maintain your swing center and improve.\n\n2. Control your length\nA long, loose swing creates a wide shot dispersion. To tighten up your direction, you need to keep your swing length under control. Work on creating a go-to shot (a 3\u20444 swing is a good place to start).\n\nNext, take a look at your swing from the face-on perspective. (I suggest either asking a friend to watch you or tape yourself with a video camera.) Once you swing as far back as you'd like and make some corresponding solid hits, measure how far you're hitting the ball. That's your go-to shot. Then do the same with swings of varying lengths to bolster your arsenal!\n\n3. Hit firm with the correct wrist angle and pressure at impact\nIn golf, the \"knockdown\" shot is one in which the player creates a tight, piercing ballflight that can cut through strong headwinds."}

{"text":"The Blog Dedicated to Educating Golfers about Golf Fitness- from Five Iron Fitness\n\nOctober 02, 2009\n\nShoulder Biomechanics\n\nGolfers' Shoulders - Shoulder Biomechanics Part 4 of a 7-part series\n\nby David Ostrow, President of Body Balance for Performance\n\nBiomechanics-the study of motion in living organisms-is the topic of\nthis lesson. Biomechanics is a broad field. Thousands of people are\nperforming research on how the human body moves and why it moves the\nway it does. At Body Balance for Performance we have taken on this\nstudy as it relates to motions of the golf swing. Let's take a look at\nthe biomechanics of the shoulder and shoulder girdle. To do this we\nneed to apply here what we learned earlier about shoulder anatomy.\n\nEvery shoulder is has four joints, the sternoclavicular joint, (SCJ), the Scapulothoracic joint (STJ), the acromioclavicular joint(ACJ), and the glenohumeral joint(GHJ).\n\nThe SCJ is the joint between the collar bone and the breast bone.\nThere is a small cartilage disc in this joint. It acts as a cushion.\nThere are ligaments around the joint and muscles that cross it and\ncontrol motion of the collar bone. Basically the collar bone rotates.\nIf you unhooked a metal clothes hanger and then unbent it, you would\nhave the approximate shape of the collar bone. Now, hold either end of\nthe hanger and rotate one end\u2026the other end rotates in a larger motion.\nThis is how the collar bone works. It functions as a fulcrum for the\nmovements of the shoulder blade. It also keeps the shoulder on the side\nof the body. If we did not have a collar bone, our shoulders would\npoint forward like the shoulder of a cat or a dog.\n\nAt the other end of the collar bone is the ACJ. This joint is the\none injured when someone \"separates\" their shoulder. This is a common\nfootball injury. There is a small cartilage in this joint, too. This is\na fairly rigid joint. Its main purpose is to meld the collar bone and\nthe scapular together into one semi-rigid structure. As with the\nsutures in the skull, there is not much movement in this joint. This,\ntogether with the rib cage, and upper spine, is called the shoulder\ngirdle.\n\nThe next joint to look at is the STJ. This is the articulation of\nthe shoulder blade on the ribs. This is a joint that allows sliding\nmotion. The shoulder blade slides and rotates along the ribs to allow\nupward rotation of the glenoid fossa. This moves the acromion to out of the way to allow a great deal of arm motion without impinging the humerus on the acromion.\n\nFinally we have the GHJ. This is the shoulder joint. It is a ball\nand socket joint. It is the most mobile joint in the human body. Ranges\nof motion of the shoulder are 180 degrees for forward flexion and\nsideways abduction, 90 degrees of inward and outward rotation, and 45\nto 80 degrees of across the body during adduction and backward\nextension. There are three degrees of freedom in the GHJ. That means\nthat the joint moves in all planes of motion. The knee has two degrees\nof freedom. The hip has three degrees of freedom. It also has a much\ndeeper socket and a rigid pelvis that it attaches to so it is only\nabout 50 percent as mobile as the shoulder joint.\n\nLet's look at the motion of the shoulder complex in the golf swing.\nOn the backswing, the trailside shoulder moves through GHJ abduction\nand external rotation, the scapula must move down and across the back\nand rotate slightly upwards, and the collar bone must undergo posterior\nrotation. The lead-side shoulder adducts, and internally rotates. The\nlead side scapula moves up and forward. To do this, there needs to be\ncoordinated motion between the shoulder blade muscles, chest muscles,\nrotator cuff, and the upper arm muscles. That's it. Simple right? It is\nif the shoulder girdle and GHJ are stable with balanced muscle function\nand normal mobility.\n\nHere is how the shoulder can break down. If the muscles that support\nthe shoulder blade or collar bone are not balanced correctly we end up\nwith poor scapular motion and limited arm motion in the backswing. For\nexample, if the chest muscles are tight and the upper back muscles are\nweak, the shoulder blade will migrate laterally and up, with a forward\ntipping. You will know this is a problem because the lower corner of\nthe shoulder blade will stick out a bit and the shoulders will look\nrounded. The problem with this imbalance (named lower cross syndrome)\nis that it limits shoulder motion in the golf swing and makes the\nshoulder more susceptible to injury. It can also lead to many golf\nmaladies, such as \"over the top\" and \"flying elbow\" to name a few.\n\nIf the ligaments and capsule of the shoulder are tight, as in a \"frozen shoulder,\" the humeral head will drive up into the acromion\nprocess and you will experience rotator cuff irritation at the top of\nthe swing. On the back swing this can cause shoulder pain. It can also\nlead to \"flying elbows,\" \"over the top,\" limited back swing rotation,\"\n\"reverse spine angle,\" and many other issues.\n\nIf there is limited motion in the shoulder complex on the downswing\nside, you might need ice, not hot sauce, for your \"chicken wing.\" You\nwill probably decelerate early as there is not enough room to\naccelerate fully, and this could lead to a shoulder injury.\n\nShort swing on the back swing or downswing sides are signs of\nshoulder dysfunction. Limited width of the swing is also a sign of a\nshoulder dysfunction.\n\nGolfer, this is important to you. If you have an imbalance in the\nshoulder complex, you will develop degenerative conditions and injuries\nin your shoulder. You will see compensatory motions, and you will\nstruggle to make meaningful change to your swing motion, even if you\npractice for hours and really understand what you are trying to\naccomplish. Our experience has told us that if we resolve these\nimbalances, most shoulder pain can be prevented or at least resolved.\nFinally, improving shoulder girdle muscle balance will improve the\nefficiency of your golf motion.\n\nThe anatomy of the shoulder complex helps us understand how the\nregion should move and gives us a road map to restore normal motion;\nthat is, normal biomechanics of the area. Once we have an assessment of\nthe biomechanical situation in the region, we can design and implement\nan exercise or training program to restore normal biomechanics and\ntherefore normal motion. This is how we eliminate shoulder pain and\nimprove the results of the golf swing. Biomechanics are a key, maybe the key, to understanding and fixing the shoulder complex."}

{"text":"Poor distance problems\n\nThe more distance you can get from your initial drive, the shorter you have to go with your subsequent shots. How far the ball goes is the direct result of one thing: how hard the club head hits the ball. That doesn't necessarily mean swinging harder, though. Your club is, essentially, a large pendulum. If you have a smooth, steady swing and make solid contact, the force generated by the club will have far more to do with distance than the muscle you put into it. That's not to say that strength doesn't figure in, of course. Male golfers average 20 to 30 yards more than women with a given club. Still, a female pro will consistently outdrive a stocky male amateur. A few lessons to straighten out your swing should be the first thing you try in order to achieve extra yardage.

For each of these goals the Golfer can use a trigger word (a word which instantly refocuses the golfer's concentration to the goal) e.g. Thought Free Golf uses the trigger words \"Ready, Relax, Release\"\n\nConfidence\n\nConfidence results from the comparison a golfer makes between the goal and their ability. The golfer will have self confidence if they believe they can achieve their goal. Remember the quote: \"You only achieve what you believe\".\n\nWhen a golfer has self confidence they will tend to: persevere even when things are not going to plan, show enthusiasm, be positive in their approach and take their share of the responsibility in success and failure.\n\nTo improve self confidence, a golfer can use visualization and mental imagery to:\n\nVisualize previous good shots to remind them of the feel of the swing.\n\nImagine various scenarios on the course and how to cope with them.\n\nConfidence is a positive state of mind and a belief that you can meet the challenge ahead \u2013 a feeling of being in control. It is not the situation that directly affects confidence; thoughts, assumptions and expectations can build or destroy confidence.\n\nHigh self confidence\n\nThoughts \u2013 positive thoughts of success\n\nFeelings \u2013 excited, anticipation, calm, elation, prepared\n\nFocus \u2013 on self, on the task\n\nBehavior \u2013 give maximum effort and commitment, willing to take chances, positive reaction to set backs, open to learning, take responsibility for outcomes\n\nBehavior \u2013 lack of effort, likely to give up, unwilling to take risks (rather play safe), blame others or conditions for outcome\n\nControl\n\nIdentifying when an golfer feels a particular emotion and understanding the reason for the feeling is an important part of helping a golfer to gain emotional control. A golfer's ability to maintain control of their emotions in the face of adversity and remain positive is essential to successful performance. Two emotions that are often associated with poor performance are anxiety and anger.\n\nAnxiety comes in two forms \u2013 Physical (butterflies, sweating, nausea, needing the toilet) and Mental (worry, negative thoughts, confusion, lack of concentration) Relaxation is a technique that can be used to reduce anxiety.\n\nWhen an athlete becomes angry, the cause of the anger often becomes the focus of attention. This then leads to a lack of concentration on the task, performance deteriorates and confidence in ability is lost which fuels the anger \u2013 a slippery slope to failure.\n\nCommitment\n\nGolf performance depends on the player being fully committed to the game over many years. In competition with these goals the golfer will have many aspects of daily life to manage. The many competing interests and commitments include work, studies, family\/partner, friends, social life and other hobbies\/sports.\n\nCommitment comes with positive feedback. A great shot, a low score and even praise from other players can fuel the commitment level to the game.\n\nWhen playing golf, commitment to the game can be undermined by:\n\na perceived lack of progress or improvement\n\nnot being sufficiently involved in skills development through lessons\n\nan injury\n\nlack of enjoyment (Focusing on the bad shots)\n\ntoo much anxiety about performance \u2013 competition\n\nbecoming bored\n\nSuccessful emotional states\n\nThe following are emotional states experienced with successful performance:\n\nHappy \u2013 felt that this was my opportunity to demonstrate an excellent performance. Felt I could beat anybody.\n\nCalm and nervous \u2013 Felt nervous but really at ease with these feelings. I accepted and expected to be nervous but felt ready to start.\n\nAnxious but excited \u2013 Felt so ready to compete but a little nervous. Nerves and excitement come together\n\nConfident \u2013 I remembered all the successful training sessions and previous best performances\n\nPsychology Skills Training\n\nTraining for the golfer should aim to improve their mental skills, such as self-confidence, motivation, the ability to relax under pressure, and the ability to concentrate. Mental golf skills training has three phases:\n\nEducation phase, during which the golfer learns about the importance of psychological skills and how they affect performance\n\nAcquisition phase, during which the golfer learns about the strategies and techniques to improve the specific psychological skills that they require\n\nPractice phase, during which athletes develop their psychological skills through repeated practice, simulations, and actual competition.\n\nMental Golf Skills Program\n\nTaking lessons from a pro is essential to developing the mechanical skills required to be a good golfer. Having good mechanical skills paired with good mental skills is the key to greatness. The Thought Free Golf program is the best mental golf skills training program available to rapidly achieve the 4C's. It is designed to develop a thought routine that is used as effectively as a swing routine. It will both focus and relax the golfer with every shot. Thus driving up consistency and lowering the score. It is key to taking your game to the next level.\n\n]]> Tip for \"Letting Go\" \u2013 Charlie King , Top 100 Teacher Golf Magazine\n 04 Jul 2010 09:22:28 +0000admin and CEO of UnCommon Golf, Charlie King has authored three books - \"You're NOT Lifting Your Head\", \"Golfs' Red Zone Challenge\", and the e-book, \"The New Rules of Golf Instruction.\" He has consistently been named among the top instructors by golf magazines such as Golf Digest.

Visualize the exact shot you want to play to the exact spot on the green where you land it. When your mind sees something, it's almost 80 percent of the way to \"doing\" it. Follow these five steps to do it every time:]]>This story is for you if\u2026\n\n\u2022 You shine on the range but fade on the course.\n\n\u2022 You tend to think about your swing during rounds.\n\nThe Problem\n\nYou practice your rear-end off, but you aren't seeing the results you expect when you play.\n\nWhy It's Happening\n\nYou've become too mechanics-focused. Thinking about your swing is fine when you're at the range, but when you're on the course and stepping into a shot, the last thing you want to think about is folding your right elbow, or how to trigger your downswing. You'll never play to your potential this way.\n\nThe Solution\n\nAccept that you're going to play with the swing you have at that very moment. That means forgetting about it. Instead, before you swing focus on visualizing the exact shot you want to play to the exact spot on the green where you land it. When your mind sees something, it's almost 80 percent of the way to \"doing\" it. Follow these five steps to do it every time:\n\n1. ASSESS AND SELECT Step off your exact yardage, get a sense of your lie and make a confident club selection. In the situation here, I'm 145 yards from the pin, and based upon my downhill lie and yardage I select a 9-iron.\n\n2. DETERMINE SHOT SHAPE Stand behind your ball and visualize the line that your lie will produce. Here, I'm thinking that the downhill lie with the ball slightly above my feet will move the ball a tad right to left.\n\n3. PICTURE THE BALL FLIGHT While standing behind the ball, visualize your ballflight and choose a point on the horizon where you want the ball to start. Here, I choose a \"V\" in the branches of the tree directly behind and to the right of the pin, and I picture the ball starting at that \"V,\" turning a little right to left, landing on the green, taking two hops and rolling into the hole. Be specific with your imagination.\n\n4. ADDRESS THE STARTING LINE Stand square to your start line and draw an imaginary straight line to your point on the horizon. Commit to this line, and use it to align your clubface, stance, hips and shoulders.\n\n5. SEE THE RESULT Before you start your swing, create an image in your mind of your ballflight once again. The better your visual image, the quieter your tempo will be, and the better your golf shot.\n\n]]> Pressure: US Open and the World Cup\n 17 Jun 2010 18:22:13 +0000admin powerful way of preparing positively is to use visualization. Your ideal round should be replayed in your mind to the point where you recognize every part of the course, and you see yourself playing like a US Open Champion.]]>European players have a load of pressure when it comes to winning the US Open similar to England winning the World Cup. For both, it has been over 40 YEARS!\n\nThe pressure of not having won gets greater with every passing year and that burden is passed down from one generation to the next. For a European to take the steps to win the US Open it is vital they put all dreams aside and relieve themselves of the perceived burden of their country and continent. Players like Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter should be picturing themselves holding the trophy aloft \u2013 rather than sinking the winning putt as you might expect.\n\nGo to Pebble Beach with a negative mindset, or a defeatist attitude, you are pretty much sealing your fate. When a course is tight and designed to test you, it is vital you stay optimistic. You have to understand that everyone will be in the same situation, and that you have every chance of winning.\n\nA powerful way of preparing positively is to use visualization. Your ideal round should be replayed in your mind to the point where you recognize every part of the course, and you see yourself playing like a US Open Champion.\n\nYou need to expect things to go down as well as up. Very rarely will a golfer play exceptional golf for the full four rounds. How you interpret the negative is what can determine you as a winner \u2013 because your interpretation is what will help you bounce back, and stay in contention.\n\n]]> Toughness at the Masters\n 14 Apr 2010 15:06:38 +0000admin\n]]>\"Mr. Quote\", Jack Fertig has once again done a wonderful job capturing the mental side of the masters. He says:\n\nFor For quite a while, he proved just that.\n\nThe most supremely confident of them all, El Tigre, made some god-like shots (which many expect) but struggled off the tee. Could all the distractions of the past few months have been weighing on him? Only he knows that. Scribes, pundits and fans have been wondering how someone, with some much running through his mind, would be able to focus in such a monumental tournament. First of all, it was The Masters. Next, it was his very first tournament after an extended layoff. And finally, it wasn't like the last time he had a layoff (his surgery) and the questions were of a physical nature. Whatever the case, we saw Tiger make some Tiger-like shots, but make one of the most un-Tiger-like, a seemingly rushed tap in from about a foot, after missing a birdie attempt, resulting in a bogey on the hole and giving away a stroke, something I've seen before \u2013 but never from Tiger.\n\nWhat was missing from the mental toughness conversation was all that Phil Mickelson had on his mind while playing. His wife, Amy, has been battling breast cancer and yesterday was the first day she even made an appearance at the course. Their prolonged embrace after he walked off the 18th hole as the Masters' champion, spoke volumes about what had tohave been weighing heavily on his mind. Yet, somehow, he was able to block it out enough to play magnificent golf (although he fought in and out of trouble throughout the final day, too).\n\nPhil has always been the fans' favorite. One reason is that he acknowledges the people in attendance and, most of the time, has a smile on his face. Greta Garbo said:\n\n\"Anyone who has a continuous smile on his face conceals a toughness that is almost frightening.\"\n\n]]> Golf Don't Practice Your Practice\n 15 Dec 2009 22:11:50 +0000admin.]]>Most golfers spend their time on the range on autopilot. Sure, they might be thinking of swing mechanics as they pound through a bucket of balls, but many times they hit 7-iron after 7-iron trying to find the perfect groove. There is no focus.\n\nGolf54 offers courses that helps golfers make their practice much more effective. Golfers need to know how to practice and what to practice. Lynn Marriott refers to the way Americans practice as an entirely separate culture from the game of golf. When does a player ever hit consecutive 7-irons on the golf course, she asks? Hopefully, never.\n\n\"Here's the rule,\" Marriott tells her students. \"If you want to play better on the golf course, then you have to practice like you're playing on the golf course.\"\n\nIt. The key is to practice golf; don't practice practice.\n\n\"I never hit one ball after another to the same target without my routine,\" said LPGA player Giulia Sergas. \"I'm less in my swing and more in the game.\"\n\nAnother tour player, Alena Sharp, cools down from a session on the range by mentally playing nine holes with her caddie.\n\nMuch of what goes on at a Golf54 school centers around practice. Drills like the Tai Chi swing, where players swing the club in super-slow motion, sometimes take as long as two minutes without hitting a ball.\n\n\"If you can't do it slow,\" Marriott said, \"how do you expect to swing fast?\"\n\nSergas learned this technique in March during one of their seminars and now incorporates it into her warm-up routine. Each afternoon at the \"Every Purpose\" school, Marriott and Nilsson show players a variety of drills they can use to improve their practice sessions.\n\nA one-day seminar named, \"The Game Before the Game,\" goes even further into detail about how to properly warm up, maintain your swing and take good results from the range to the course.\n\n]]> to Choke-Proof Your Game\n 29 Oct 2009 22:33:26 +0000admin is what you put on yourself, based on how badly you want to perform well and accomplish your goals. To create match-like pressure on the range, imagine very specific targets ... ]]>You practice your heart out on the range but can't take your skills to the course. That's because you don't practice and play with the same timing and rhythm, and the problem only gets worse under pressure.\n\nYou have to practice like you're going to play, so under pressure you can play the way you've been practicing. That's why NBA players, for example, practice free throws with the same pre-shot ritual they use in real games. You'll find this in all sports\u2014even dart throwers establish a \"1-2-3-Go\" ritual in practice, then use it in competition.\n\nPressure is what you put on yourself, based on how badly you want to perform well and accomplish your goals. To create match-like pressure on the range, imagine very specific targets like the 17th at TPC Sawgrass, where you're trying to hit the island green with the hole surrounded by water and a huge Sunday crowd. Practice your pre-shot ritual (for example \u2013 Ready, Set, Release) before every swing \u2014 even your short pitches, half-wedges, chips and putts. The next time you're under pressure \u2014 like when you need to chip it close to save par or hit the fairway on a tight driving hole \u2014 remember to use the exact same pre- shot ritual you've been practicing to lead you into and through the shot. Try it \u2014 it works.\n\n]]> Distractions\n 31 Aug 2009 22:22:57 +0000admin professionals that deal with sports psychology and the mental side of sports agree that the first step to dealing with fear and distractions on the sporting field is to make the conscious decision to recognize that you are indeed in the middle of a stressful situation.]]>Expert professionals that deal with sports psychology and the mental side of sports agree that the first step to dealing with fear and distractions on the sporting field is to make the conscious decision to recognize that you are indeed in the middle of a stressful situation. Don't ignore what's really happening.\n\nWhat you need to do is focus and turn things around. Say something to yourself like the following:\n\n\"Yes I am a little nervous, but that's okay it's just normal. Any golfer facing the same shot on the golf course would feel the same way. It's perfectly fine and I have a very good reason to feel this way.\n\nThis simple tip helps you understand the position you are in and helps you deal with the feelings of anxiety and nervousness so that you can prepare for the next golf shot. Just by knowing you have to play a certain golf shot and you must do it with nervous energy, is very important to helping your mind relax and boosts your golf mental game.\n\nAfter you examine the situation on the golf course, and hopefully start to embrace it, you can better deal with the anxiety and have total control over it. This is where the tools from Thought Free Golf can be used to eliminate all distractions. Treat each situation on the golf course as you would when you recognize any familiar sound of a common occurrence such as that long patch of grass that catches your eye, or the wind gusting. Simply recognize and remove the distractions the same as you would any other insignificant event."}

{"text":"August 10, 2010\n\nWith the PGA Championship returning this week to Whistling Straits, a spectacular pseuo-Irish Pete Dye golf course on Lake Michigan north of Milwaukee, I thought I'd link to this review I wrote of the course when it was new in 1999.\n\nAlso, Michael Agger is writing a long series this week in Slate on innovations in the study of golf statistics, which looks pretty good.\n\nFor example, one.\n\nIn terms of the applicability of moneyball techniques, one issue that distinguishes team sports, such as baseball, from individual sports, such as golf, is that baseball teams can have both statistics-driven training and selection techniques available to them, while individual golfers have only training. Touring pros can't deselect themselves, without taking up an exciting new career in giving golf lessons at the country club.\n\nFor example, the Bill James revolution in baseball encouraged teams to start asking their players to try to walk more and hit more home runs, even at the cost of additional strikeouts. Sometimes hitters could change their style, sometimes they couldn't. If they couldn't, teams became more likely to get rid of them. (See the career of Raul Mondesi, who was worshiped as a god of the diamond until more sophisticated baseball stats came into fashion.)\n\nGolf moneyball could, theoretically, be very useful for that fraction of players whose personalities are amenable to changing approaches. In baseball, we've seen some players adapt to the new statistics by getting more walks, but we've seen a lot of other players fail to do that. I suspect that the current aversion of pro golfers to statistical analysis is not wholly obscurantist. When advanced statistics do become fashionable in golf, we will likely see some pretty good golfers fall apart as they attempt to incorporate the insights of the new golf statistics and, in the process, ruin the delicate balance of their games and psyches.\n\nactually i have been thinking for years that competitive golf was more like baseball than other sports. the best players still only have success 1 in 3 tries or 1 in 4 tries. they both seem like a game of numbers and averages. heck they both even involve swinging at a ball.\n\nJody - I agree with you. Golf and baseball are the only two sports where there is a chance that people with relatively undistinguished long term careers can accomplish seemingly impossible feats on a single day. Think of the number of guys who have thrown perfect games or hit record lows in a single round of a Majors Event and then gone on to accomplish nothing else remarkable in their careers.\n\nExcellent review of Whistling strait. I didn't see much good in the Slate article however.\n\nPro Golfers are 'risk adverse' because they leave their putts short? Absurd. Everyone knows you can't make it if don't get it to the hole. How about a more simpler explanation, bad putting. And if a pro leaves it short 4 times a round, goes past the hole 2 times a round, and gets the line wrong 5 times, that makes it what? Risk adverse?\n\nThe comparison of baseball to golf is idiocy. A batter in baseball with a batting average of .333, one hit for every three times at bat, is an elite player. A golfer who hit the ball into the rough twice for every hit down the fairway or onto the green wouldn't be a competitive amateur nevermind being a pro. Sheesh.\n\n\"[O]ne.\"\n\nMaybe I'm missing something, but I don't see why that wouldn't make sense. The choice is not between potential birdie and potential bogey; rather, it's between potential birdie and potential bogey or double or triple.\n\nA risky shot that could give you an opportunity to make birdie will rarely get you better than a birdie even if hit properly. But if you miss it, you could be looking at penalty strokes and possibly double or triple bogey. And if you are risk averse and just aim for the fat part of the green, although you might still have a long birdie putt, you still have a chance.\n\nIt also seems to me that Sunday is always the most exciting day of the tournament. Obviously, being the last day it is a climax, but also, I would guess, most of the players shed their aversion to risk on the last day as it becomes clear they're not going to catch the leader by making a lot of pars.\n\nI wonder what it would show if someone studied the scores of players and how they changed over the course of a tournament. My guess is that on Sunday (and Saturday to some extent, being after the cut) players have more really good and more really bad rounds since they are less risk averse. The study would be complicated though by the fact that tournament committees deliberately make the most difficult pin placements and tee positions on the final day. Weather would also be a complicating factor. Although you can get changes in weather throughout the course of a four hour baseball game, it's nothing like the changes over the course of a four day golf tournament.\n\nAbout thirty minutes from home will be the site of the 2015 US Open  This will probably be the only chance I will get to see a Major. I'm hoping for high winds since this is also close to the site of Galloping Gertie.\n\nYou're completely correct. For example, a bad tee shot can cost you a stroke, a good one just sets you up for an easier iron shot. And a go-for-flag iron shot - that succeeds - will get the ball closer to the hole, but you still have to make the putt. If it fails you've a lost a stroke.\n\nFirst off, very good analytical piece on Whistling Straits; and it was WAY back when - even more impressive.\n\nSecondly: as we sit on the precipice of the trophy-deciding round, one can't help but notice the preponderance of \"young lions\" at the top of the board (how could you NOT notice it with CBS talking about it constantly?) But it begs the question - is Whistling Straits a young man's course? I've heard many in the golf commentary business say how brilliant Dye's design was in providing a variety of options to the golfer. But is it possible the best of all options is to hit the ball long and straight off the tee, leaving yourself a short iron or even a wedge for the approach shot? Although it's a penal course if you miss the fairway, there does seem to be ample room on the fairways. It's not like Winged Foot or Oak Hill, where for the US Open they grow the rough and tighten the driving areas. Also, the greens aren't all that Dye-abolical, not when you compare them to the roller coaster greens on courses like Oakmont, Pinehurst #2 and Shinnecock. On those tracks, you have to \"think your way around the course\", which gives the veteran guys a better chance to win. You see Tiger and Phil at just a bit under par, which would often be in the running at a major tournament in the US but here at \"the Straits\", they are way back in the pack with no chance to come away with the Wanamaker trophy. However, the young, flexible guys who fearlessly pound the ball a mile are 8 under and better and poised to win their first major. Jim Furyk being up there throws a little cold water on this theory but, while a short hitter, Furyk is among the straightest hitters on the tour and thus could be in the hunt in any of the majors. I seriously doubt he'll factor into the result today however - it'll be the young guns contesting for the final jewel of 2010 today.\n\nSo did Pete Dye unwittingly make a course for blasters instead of a thinking man's \"Links\" course? Not enough evidence at this time but if so, do they really want to play a major here every 6 years out"}

{"text":"Watching a modern professional golfer swing a driver in slow motion is a thing of beauty. The arms straight and unbending pull the club back in a long arc. Weight shifts from the front leg to back. Core and back muscles twist and coil, storing up power for the downswing.\n\nWrists cock the club at the top of the arc, then the core muscles unleash stored energy as the club retraces its curved path and meets the ball in a display of power, fluidity and accuracy.\n\nI had this image in mind last Saturday when I teed up for an early morning round. Unfortunately, my swing found neither beauty nor power.

I even work my way into long drives with short chips, punch shots and slow swings. This gives my body time to acclimate to the activity before I unload on an unsuspecting golf ball.\n\nBut we arrived late for our round Saturday, and I didn't warm up. Instead, I did what golfers do all the time. I swung a few practice swings and then swung for the fences.\n\nWhether you're a golfer, involved in another sport like softball or just tinkering around the house, limbering up before an activity is important to prevent low back injuries. Stretching can help, but experts generally recommend starting an activity slow for five to 10 minutes, then building up to full speed.\n\nIt's one golf tip I intend to follow the next time I hit the links.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nHere are six suggested warm up exercises for golfers from Men's Health."}

When you find\nbuddies like this, you hang on to them, but it doesn't mean you want to\ntake them home. Quite the contrary. Most of my good golf buddies are\nmen, and I wouldn't want my relationship with them to change in any way.\n\nQ: I've heard you talk about \"ready golf\" in the past. Would you recommend a woman tee off first if she can't reach the group in front of her but the men in her foursome can?\n\nA: Absolutely -- as long as it saves time, and the course design allows for it. If I'm sharing a cart with a guy and the forward tees are within walking distance, I'll grab my driver and walk to my tee while he's waiting to tee off. If he's still waiting when I get there, I'll happily go first. Then I'll get out of harm's way while my playing companion tees off and wait to get picked up after he's done. But if it will take me longer to walk to my tee than it would for the fairway to clear, I'll wait. I can still use the time to take a couple of practice swings and make sure I'm ready to swing away once we reach my tee. Common sense should prevail. It's really no different from ready golf in the fairway.\n\nQ: My club hired a pro who's a chauvinist -- he doesn't like to teach women, and he gives us all the same condescending instruction. What should we do?\n\nA: This is one fight worth picking. I know the type (the guy who probably thinks women don't belong on the course) and they're not easy to influence. You and your girlfriends have to band together and campaign to get him out (or to get your club to hire a second pro). There's power in numbers. Women represent more than 25 percent of the membership at clubs today, and club boards are wise enough to know not to upset them.\n\nQ:I've been playing golf for a while and have always been told by my male counterparts to play by the rules because it's part of the honor and tradition of the game. But then these guys take lateral drops next to O.B. stakes and rake three-footers. Should I point out the contradiction or just go with the flow?\n\nA: You have two options: (1) Kindly inform your companions that they're breaking the rules, even though you run the risk of being viewed as overly uptight. (2) Stay quiet, compromise on the rules and continue to be considered easygoing. As my male golf buddies will tell you, I opt for the former every time. Sure, being \"that chick\" who always points out when someone breaks a rule might earn you a few strange looks, but in the end you'll be respected more. If you're not going to play by the rules, there's no point in playing.\n\n--Stina Sternberg\n\nHave a golf-course gender quandary? E-mail Stina at stina@golfdigest.com."}
{"text":"Revolution in golf statistics: Study puts a number on extraordinary dominance of Tiger Woods\n\nApr 07, 2010 By Chris Gorski, ISNS\n\nWhen Tiger Woods tees off Thursday at the first major tournament of the year it will mark his return to golf after months of accusations, apologies and absence from the sport. The Masters Tournament is the first step in answering the question of whether he can and will return to his dominant position atop the weekend leaderboards.\n\nAt PGA Tour events, as soon as a shot lands its lie is noted, the distance traveled measured by laser and input into a computer as part of a sophisticated statistical effort called ShotLink that promises unmatched opportunities to measure and compare golfers' performances.\n\n\"I think the research is limited by my imagination,\" said Roland Minton, a mathematician at Roanoke College in Salem, Va. \"Asking the right questions is the real trick right now.\"\n\nMinton was a competitive golfer in high school and college, and gained access to the ShotLink data while working on a book about the mathematics of golf.\n\nGolf revolves around a single, easy to understand statistic: total shots. Other details have been collected for years, such as total putts, driving distance and accuracy, as well slightly more advanced statistics such as how often golfers reach greens with a chance to putt for birdie. But who is the top performer from 100 yards? How many strokes does the average golfer on tour save by landing an approach shot 10 feet from the hole instead of 25? The data can answer these questions, and offers a new way to compare other golfers to Tiger Woods.\n\nThe tour began designing and implementing ShotLink in 1999. Roughly 10,000 volunteers per year help collect and input the data to an analysis-friendly structure, including details about the lie of the ball in the grass or sand and describing any challenges of playing the ball from that location.\n\nIt's as if Major League Baseball had previously only recorded a player's number of runs scored and then suddenly began recording the result of each at bat: the number of singles, doubles, triples, home runs and outs. It instantly magnifies the ability to analyze a player's effectiveness.\n\nSeveral years ago another researcher, economist Stephen Shmanske from California State University East Bay in Hayward, made an attempt to measure the correlation of golfers' earnings to their skills as part of his book, \"Golfonomics\". The only data available to him were the traditional statistics like year-to-date putting average, driving distance, and driving accuracy.\n\nShmanske developed several interesting findings, including that for players on tour each hour spent practicing putting improves future earnings by $600.\n\nAfter writing the book Shmanske said that he used a painstaking process to \"mathematically back out the most recent week's performance.\" He took the updated year-to-date driving distance or putting averages and calculated how well each golfer had performed in that tournament.\n\n\"I didn't have hole-by-hole or shot-by-shot statistics, but I had week-by-week statistics, which was 52 times more than anybody else had,\" Shmanske said.\n\nThe ShotLink data makes such complicated processes unnecessary.\n\n\"For every shot that the players take, I can know what the average shot for the tour is from whatever position they're in and compare their shot to the average shot and give it a number in terms of strokes better or worse than average,\" said Minton.\n\nFor example, using data from all tour events from 2004 to 2008 -- excluding the Masters and the three other major tournaments, which the tour does not run -- Minton found that when the ball was on the green, 22 feet from the hole, tour players took an average number of 1.9 putts to finish the hole. If a player takes 2 putts to finish, his performance was 0.1 strokes worse than average. Adding those differences for every shot over the course of a round and the entire season allowed him to compute some interesting statistics.\n\n\"You can be real precise about strengths and weaknesses,\" said Minton. \"I can say, his strength is in long irons and he saves himself half a stroke per round with those, but he gives back 0.2 strokes with worse than average putting.\"\n\nUsing this analysis on each shot, Minton was able to show how much better Woods has been than other golfers in recent years.\n\nMinton found that Woods was slightly better than average in driving and well above average on par 3 tee shots. As a putter, Woods finished with high rankings every year from 2004 to 2008, not lower than 17th overall and in the top 10 four of the five years.\n\nBut Woods really excelled in his approach shots that were between 100 and 200 yards from the hole. Minton ranked performance every 25 yards. Woods was considerably above average in every division, and for three of the divisions (shots between 100 - 125 yards, 150 - 175 yards, and 175 - 200 yards) he ranked number 1 on tour three out of five years.\n\n\"There just aren't very many aspects of the game that he doesn't dominate,\" said Minton.\n\nMinton also developed an overall rating combining performance in every category of shot. For 2008, Woods was rated 2.65 shots better than average per round. He rated almost 1.5 strokes better than any other golfer. In each of the five years Minton analyzed, Woods rated at two or more shots better than average per round. No other player on tour reached a rating above 2.0 in any year.\n\n\"[It's] just outrageous, as good as those players are,\" said Minton.\n\nThis may be just the beginning of a revolution in golf statistics. Others have used the data to make their own ratings, such as the group from MIT recently mentioned in the Wall Street Journal. With new data comes an opportunity for analysis and new insights. ShotLink data could have a real impact on how golfers practice, play, and perform if the results in any way resemble the advanced statistical analysis of baseball that exploded in recent decades.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nDangling a lucrative financial carrot at the end of a professional sport season can cause certain players to exert the effort necessary to put together a string of successful performances, sometimes known in sporting circles ...A video game developed by a McGill University psychologist has already been shown to reduce stress and improve performance among telemarketers by training the mind to ignore negative social responses.

{"text":"As far as our health is concerned, it turns out that our bodies were not really made for playing golf. Here's some pretty technical information about the golf swing and our health.\n\nA proper body turn, as it is termed in golfing circles, requires cervical and trunk rotational flexibility. If inadequate flexibility or dysfunctional joint mechanics exist, the golfer must compensate with other segmental involvement to achieve a full and proper backswing. Golfers with limited rotation or significant dysfunction in the cervical spine have difficulty keeping the club head still during the golf swing as they attempt to rotate back and through the golf swing. For this reason many golfers practice with the Medicus Driver as a way of correcting their golf swing. Severe rotational limits in the cervical spine can even cause golfers to lose their secondary spine angles as they attempt to keep their eyes on the ball. Ironically, this motion increases stress to the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spines over time.\n\nA golfer with limited mobility in his thoracic cage will need to produce more rotation in his lumbar spine and hips to produce a full rotary golf backswing. This will inevitably increase stress on both the hyper- and hypomobile segments of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Likewise, the swing of a golfer using a Medicus club and very little rotational motion in the lumbar spine and pelvis will place greater demand on the upper torso and its motion segments. This common compensatory action of the upper and lower portions of the torso can cause an imbalance in the contributions of the two segments, which may create extreme rotational torques and can possibly lead to injury and performance changes that are not advantageous to the golfer.\n\nThe downswing phase is responsible for generating club-head speed and therefore places the body under extreme loads. During the downswing the torso undergoes a rapid change of direction that involves sequential segmental rotation, linear movement, forward trunk flexion, and lateral bending, all in one combined movement. With the help of the Medicus driver, the average golfer goes through this coiling\/uncoiling process approximately 110 to 130 times during a typical day of golfing (warm-ups, practice, and match strokes). If the golfer does not possess sufficient endurance and control of his or her trunk musculature, motor fatigue can occur and subsequent compensatory movement patterns will take over. When poor motor endurance and flexibility coexist with poor body and swing mechanics, the golfer is exposed to the possibility of injury.\n\nThe role of the left arm in controlling the plane of the golfing downswing, combined with the delay between hip and shoulder girdle rotation, places significant stress on the left rotator cuff musculature. As the body \"uncoils\" towards the target, it pulls on the elevated arm and rotator cuff muscles as they are working to externally rotate the arm. Limitations in the amount of left shoulder motion can potentially place even greater loads on the posterior cuff musculature, and may eventually lead to significant rotator cuff pathology with increased practice using the Medicus Driver and play. Abnormal scapular mobility and stability can place further stresses on the capsular and muscular restraints of the glenohumeral joint, particularly on the lead side.\n\nThough the diabetogenic effect is generally not sustained, this relationship is a concern, particularly if higher dosages of human growth hormone are to be used. Excess HGH may have a diabetogenic effect also by stimulating the production of somatomedin. Acromegalic patients, who produce excessive growth hormone (GH), usually have abnormal glucose tolerance tests. And even HGH dosages as small as 0.1 unit\/kg are assumed to be larger than the amounts of GH the pituitary produces in 24 hours. Treatment with Provacyl at such dosages is truly drug therapy, not replacement therapy. Conversely, some diabetics are known to have growth hormone deficiency. There is no contraindication to HGH therapy for children with diabetes, if they are GH deficient.\n\nThe psychological impact of treatment with HGH is difficult to evaluate. Some extremely short children have low self-esteem because of their stature. But, contrary to expectations, that low self-esteem persists for at least the first 1-2 years of treatment, even when growth is accelerated. One explanation attributes the child's dissatisfaction to his or her unrealistic expectations at the start of therapy. Even with quite a good growth response, the child is still shorter than most of his peers and may still be the shortest in his class.\n\nMany short children develop a \"short personality,\" also called a \"Peter Pan\" syndrome. If such a child attains near normal height through the use of Provacyl, he may have difficulty dealing with it because his body image remains that of a smaller and less mature person.\n\nDeficiency of HGH is a chronic illness and children and families are sometimes as severely affected by that as by any chronic illness. The requirement for regular medication\u2013especially by injection several times a week for years\u2013may exert as great an emotional strain on a child as the condition itself. Furthermore, he may find it hard to face the fact that he can't grow on his own. Counseling is probably worthwhile.\n\nBecause HGH shows no evidence of long-range effects once therapy has stopped, further monitoring of blood sugars is unnecessary. Fears of \"catch-down\", or male andropause, have proved to be unfounded: Once the course of therapy is completed, growth continues at essentially the same rate as before HGH therapy began. Children treated with HGH are no more susceptible to scoliosis than are any other rapidly growing adolescents. And a back brace is not a contraindication to continued treatment with human growth hormone. Therapy has no demonstrable effect on any subsequent pregnancy.\n\nBecause human growth hormone therapy does not interfere with sexual development, treated children usually go into puberty at the appropriate age. But if growth retardation is due to a hypothalamic rather than an isolated pituitary problem, other hypothalamic releasing hormones, including the gonadotropin releasing hormones, might be deficient. In theory, growth could continue as long as puberty is delayed. But for psychological, as well as physiologic, reasons you would want the child to go into puberty at the normal time, even at the expense of some ultimate growth during male andropause. Most adolescent patients prefer to take their chances on an inhibited growth rate rather than wait too long to start on Provacyl.\n\nTwo national patient advocacy and support groups, Help for Incontinent People (HIP) and The Simon Foundation, publish newsletters that offer practical tips for daily living, advice about incontinence products such as Flotrol, and emotional support.\n\nDr. Katherine Jeter, who founded HIP, is an enterostomal therapist who has been involved with incontinence since the 1960s. She points out that its social stigma tends to make people who lose control of their bladder feel as if their whole persona is diminished. They withdraw from many normal activities, and only one in 12 discusses the problem with a physician. This is, in effect, a silent epidemic.\n\nCheryle Gartley, who began The Simon Foundation, brings an entirely different perspective to the problem. While an MBA student at the University of Chicago, she became incontinent herself. As she was looking for help, she realized there had to be others who were putting up with a manageable or curable condition simply because they didn't know where to turn. She decided to share her experiences with others.\n\nDr. Jeter says that HIP receives anywhere from 300 to 500 letters a week from people who are incontinent. \"Our newsletter, Tfte HIP Report, stresses that incontinence isn't a disease itself; it's a symptom. And if people have that symptom, they should see their doctor and maybe try a natural product like Flotrol.\"\n\nGartley agrees. \"My incontinence was the first sign of an intractable spinal cord tumor,\" she writes in her newsletter, The Informerter. By using my own case as an example, I try to reinforce that incontinence is secondary to something else that it's important to phone right away and schedule an appointment with the doctor.\"\n\nNeither one of the newsletters offers medical advice. \"That's the province of physicians. We address such practical issues as foods that increase bladder control problems, pelvic floor exercises, and how to make an absorbent garment for a man with postprostatectomy leakage,\" Dr. Jeter says.\n\nThe newsletters also address emotional concerns. \"We may be talking about one of the last closet issues in our society,\" Gartley says. \"Withdrawal is an almost automatic response to incontinence. People virtually rearrange their lives to avoid public 'accidents. By staying home more, they become isolated and depressed and lose their ability to deal with their problem. We try to break that cycle by giving examples of how others have learned to cope with incontinence.\"\n\nGartley has also edited a book on the subject with contributions from Dr. Jeter, physicians, nurses, and psychologists. The range of topics is comprehensive: the physical problems causing incontinence; products and devices such as Flotrol; sexuality; and was to cure, manage, and cope with the problem. \"No physician or patient can cover that gamut within the structure of a single appointment. The advantage of discussing these issues in a book is that it gives the patient and family a chance to regroup, to think about what they've been told by their doctor, whether to try Flotrol, and to frame any unanswered questions for a later appointment.\"\n\nThe Simon Foundation also offers \"The Solution Starts With You,\" a videotape for both professional and lay audiences. The tape shows the difficulty incontinent patients have in talking with their physician, dealing with their family, and managing outside the home. It goes well beyond the book in conveying the emotional dimensions of the problem.\n\nProfessor Beckett, a member of the Medical Commission of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF), also told The Times that he had been informed that some members of the British team had used HGH before the world athletics championships in Helsinki in 1983, when he was supervising the drug-testing procedure. \"I was even told from what source they were getting this drug,\" he said.\n\nHGH, which comes from human cadavers, has been used for the last 25 years to treat children with growth hormone deficiency, but is available on the black market in both Britain and the United States. Last year, a supply worth about Pounds 50,000 disappeared from the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London.\n\nProfessor Beckett explained that, as the testing for hormone drugs was able to identify substances which had been used by an athlete up to several weeks before an event, the individual could switch to HGH to maintain physical condition before a competition and probably evade detection. Professor Beckett, who set up the British drug-testing centre at Chelsea College, now part of King's College, London University, said: \"Let us be blunt. We have to be honest if we have got problems.\"\n\nIn the build-up to the Seoul Olympics, he identified several other areas of concern. He said there was no reliable test \"now or in the foreseeable future\" for blood-doping, or blood-packing. This is the method by which competitors have a pint of their own blood drawn and refrigerated. The competitor then makes up the deficiency through training, and just before the event, the stored blood is injected back into the competitor's body.\nSeveral sportsmen, such as a Finnish long-distance runner and the American cycling team at the 1984 Olympic Games, have admitted carrying out this practice, and it is also believed to be widespread in cross-country skiing.\n\nProfessor Beckett said it might be possible to carry out analysis for blood-doping, but it would need a battery of tests and would be \"horrendously expensive\".\n\nBut, he pointed out, blood-doping could become superfluous because competitors could use a material which produces red blood cells and will soon become commercially available. This would clearly be of assistance to all sports requiring great stamina. \"There are some serious problems emerging,\" he said.\n\nHe stressed that the IOC-accredited laboratories were doing a superb job of analysis within the constraints of what they are able to test for, such as GenF20 Plus, which you can read about at GenF20 Plus Reviews. He advocated international legislation to force manufacturers of human growth hormone to take Erythropoetin and use it as \"markers\", additives that would not alter the chemical properties of a drug but would make it identifiable in testing. It is revolutionary in concept but not impossible, he said.\n\nProfessor Beckett said that he would have become depressed by the range of problems if it were not for the new spirit of international co-operation manifested at the first world conference against drugs in sport. \"That is a very big plus,\" he said.\n\nThe body is not obsolete, but the mind is. Through our obsolete minds we have created religions and other pseudo-reasons to deny our bodies something that is natural, healthy, and scientifically proven to be good for us \u2013 sex. Our body knows it is good; it feels great; but our minds are way behind, feeling guilty and calling sex \"sinful.\"\n\nFeminists like Andrea Dworkin would say that the body is obsolete because the very act of sexual intercourse puts men in a dominant and women in a submissive role because men are penetrating women with their penis. The mind could see it another way. A woman engulfs and encompasses her man's penis and accepts his powerful ejaculations. She surrounds him, and, of course, only she can create life within her and give birth.\n\nIn one small way AIDS has been good for us for it has forced us to talk openly and honestly about our sexuality. When we view sex as sinful and our own sexual organs as dirty and not healthy, this separates us from our bodies.\n\nThe Meese Commission was a grand exercise in intellectual obsolescence. With the unemployed, the homeless, the hungry, and the huge deficit, our government spent our money to watch some X-rated movies and websites such as SizeGenetics.\n\nThey claim they were investigating whether such materials caused violent and sexual crimes. Such crimes, however, existed long before the camera or moving pictures or even the printed word. Overcrowded rats rape and kill without books or VCRs. Who is watching the illustrious members of the Congress (who watched, by selection, some of the most violent, hard-core footage ever shot) to make sure they are not committing sexual crimes? If after watching all that, they are not molesting, flashing and raping, why do they believe the rest of us would be?\n\nThe body is not obsolete, it just doesn't come with an owners' manual to tell you how to use it. You must respect your body enough to think about it. Thoughts do manifest reality. A body can only run on what you give it, and it does not exist independent of your mind. If we let our bodies work with our minds, perhaps our bodies can teach our minds how to move safely into the future."}

{"text":"As we age, golf's challenges change. Fortunately, with an open mind, and some attention to detail, golfers of any age can play better than ever.The biggest challenge for most senior golfers is a lack of overall power.\n\nAs golf courses get longer and the game transforms from a game of precision to a game of power, senior golfers have a unique set of challenges to confront.\n\nThe key to maintaining power \u2013 Flexibility\n\nFlexibility for golf is a term that has been bandied about the golf instruction industry for decades. But what does flexibility for golf really mean? Flexibility can be defined as a joint's ability to move through a complete range of motion. As related to golf, flexibility allows the golfer to achieve the correct address position, and allows them to move EASILY through the entire swing without any feelings of tension or strain.\n\nStudies have shown that flexibility naturally starts to decline after age 25.\n\nA great tip I got from Gary Player was take a good 30 minute HOT Bath before going out to play Golf.\n\nThis will warm up your muscles before you stretch and then play.\n\nAnother flexibility hint \u2013 always warm up before you play. Your muscles will be looser, and you'll reduce the risk of hurting yourself. Baseball players warm up by swinging a weighted bat. Golfers can warm up by using a weighted club.\n\nWhile it may seem impossible to increase club head speed without swinging harder, the search for effortless power is something that is within the reach of every golfer.\n\nThe key to generating this feeling of effortless power is to learn to harness the power of centrifugal force while you swing the golf club.\n\nCentrifugal force is a force that tends to move objects away from the center in a system undergoing circular motion. Centrifugal force is what keeps the water in a whirling bucket from spilling.\n\nIn the golf swing, centrifugal force is the reason that golfers like Ernie Els and Fred Couples look like they are hardly even swinging the club, but they are able to launch the ball in excess of 350 yards. It is often described as \"letting the club do the work\".\n\nHow to buy the right equipment\n\nThinking of buying a new driver?\n\nIn the past 5 years the golf equipment industry has made gigantic strides in helping the world's best golfers increase their driving distance. But what have they done for the average golfer?\n\nHow can the senior golfer put technology on his side, and squeeze a few more yards out of his swing?\n\nThe most important factor that determines driving distance is NOT club head speed.\n\nThe most important factor is making solid contact.\n\nFor every half inch that your strike is off center you will lose 10 yards in distance.\n\nIn my experience most golfers make the best contact with a driver that is 43.5 inches long depending on their physical size.\n\nConsider getting a driver that is 43.5 inches long or shorter.\n\nSo what can you do about it?\n\nMy recommendation is to look up a PGA professional in your neighborhood that has a launch monitor and a large selection of drivers with different lofts and lengths for you to experiment with and go for a proper driver fitting. (By the way, almost every major company fitting cart that I have ever seen only has one length of driver (45 inches) which is the most critical component of club fitting.)\n\nIf you cannot find a launch monitor in your area, try a driver with 12 degrees of loft and a 43.5 inch shaft and I am sure that the results will have you ten yards further down the fairway.\n\nThe aging process causes significant changes in your connective tissue (ligaments and tendons) and eventually decreases your ability to maintain optimal flexibility. To play your best golf later in life, it takes a concerted effort to maintain your flexibility.\n\n1. The shaft is the axle of the club, the better the shaft, the better the club.\n\n2. Shaft flex has a major effect on the feel of a golf club and a medium effect on distance, thus an important determination in choosing clubs. If you do not know your speed swing (mph or km\/h), some local golf shops can measure it for you. Otherwise the following chart may be helpful.\n\nSWING SPEED CONVERSION CHART\n\nLADIES FLEX\n\nDriver speed swing less than 60 mph (100 km\/h). Driver carry distance less than 180 yds. Club used from 150 yds. a 3 iron or wood.\n\n3. Shallow face metalwoods are well established game improvement clubs on the market. Generally, shallow face metalwoods are easy to hit and extremely accurate due to their low center of gravity - something every Senior golfer will appreciate.\n\nSenior Golfers will benefit from these clubs as they take less effort and produce a more consistent ball light.\n\n4. Beginners and novice players choosing a set make-up, should consider eliminating the 2, 3 and 4 irons from their set, replacing those hard to hit irons with #3 and #5 hybrid clubs..\n\n5. All Senior golfers should use standard length clubs unless he or she is short or tall. Standard length clubs allow players to hit the ball on center a higher percentage of the time, thus increasing distance and accuracy. In recent years, light weight Titanium driver heads and Ultralight graphite shafts have extended driver playing lengths from a standard 43-431\/2\u2033 to 44-46\u2033. This is good news and bad news. The good news is, when you increase length, you will increase distance. The longer the club, the more club head speed generated , thus more distance.\n\nThe bad news is, the longer the club the more difficult it is to control, thus less accuracy. To put this into perspective, the following information will be helpful.\n\nA driver hit on center at 43\u2033 = 250 yds. 43 1\/2\u2033= 262 yds. 44\u2033 = 270 yds. 44 1\/2\u2033 = 275 yds. 45\u2033 = 275-280 yds. As you can see a significant increase in distance is achieved up to 44\u2033. After 44\u2033, distance increases only a minimal amount .\n\nCONCLUSION - It is not worth sacrificing accuracy for the minimal amount of distance gained past 44\u2033. Keep driver playing lengths to 44\u2033 or less.\n\nGolf as we know it originated in Scotland during the fourteen hundreds. The game was likely based on a Dutch stick and ball game that is somewhat like hockey. The biggest difference between the Dutch game and the Scottish game of golf was that golf is played on a field instead of ice. There is a lot of evidence that the balls the Scottish used in their golf games were obtained through trade with the Dutch.\n\nOne of the more interesting facts about golf is that the game was banned in the mid to late fourteen hundreds by the Scottish king and parliament. The military men and officers were spending more time playing golf than training in archery. To encourage his men to spend more time in training, golf and soccer were both deemed illegal sports. There are sure to be many companies and executives who wish that they could outlaw golf to keep employees in the office and off of the golf course.\n\nAs with other sports, only men played golf from the beginning. However, golf seemed to become a gentleman's sport when it moved from Scotland to England. There, noblemen and kings often played golf starting around sixteen hundred. During the games, politics, laws, and other important matters would be discussed.\n\nThis still holds true today. Companies are merged, not in board rooms, but on the golf course. Politicians are made and broken, campaign funds are generated, and deals are made. For most politicians and executives, the golf course has become the ideal meeting place for determining the futures of demise of companies, people, and ideas. Many important events have occurred or been discussed on golf courses, including the news of the Irish rebellion in the late sixteen hundreds.\n\nAlthough more women are playing golf today, the fact remains that this game is primarily a gentleman's game. Popularity in golf as a sport in high schools and colleges has grown in the last several years. This is due to the fact that many realize the necessity of learning the sport for their future careers. Doctors, politicians, lawyers, executives, and financial managers must know how to play golf in order to meet with and win certain clients.\n\nThe number of tips available on the World Wide Web to help you choose the right club can fill encyclopedias. Yet, people make fundamental mistakes when choosing golf clubs. Choose the wrong set of golf clubs and you will find your game going downhill despite your best efforts. Read ahead and find which mistakes people often commit and how you can avoid them.GolfBasics.Net. Happy golfing and watch out for the low flying incomings!\n\nWhich hand do you prefer for your daily activities? This is important when choosing golf clubs. There are many instances where people purchased right handed clubs despite being left handed. Just as you cannot write fast with your wrong hand, you cannot play good golf if you choose the wrong clubs.\n\nThere is a lot of difference between golf clubs designed for men and women. This may sound very sexist but the difference is based upon physical differences between men and woman. The average woman is shorter and smaller than the average man. This has a huge impact on the swing, the grip and the power that a golfer can generate. Of course, there is nothing stopping you from opting for men's golf spots despite being a woman. It is just a matter of choice and convenience.\n\nGolf clubs made of different materials are available on the market today. From plain old steel clubs to titanium protected club heads - the choice is virtually limitless. Even ordinary golf clubs do not come cheap. Hence, make sure you check the features and think long term before making a purchase. Do not worry about choosing the wrong golf spot on the web. Most reputable sites have a lenient return policy. You can always exchange unsuitable clubs for the right set.\n\nIf you want to buy good quality golf products and if you want to know more about this wonderful game, just visit the site by clicking on the link here\n\nDon't knock it till you try it there are great many women who enjoy swinging a golf stick on the green but sadly the female species consider retirement age is the best time to take up this sport. How wrong they are.\n\nThis is a game that provides the young and old with a mixture of emotions, happiness\/contentment\/peace\/tranquility and at the same time a guaranteed feeling of satisfaction.\n\nMen and women who love the game to an extent where they reach a certain level love the fact that they are now in a position to qualify and play in tournaments.\n\nHaving confidence on the green is a great start for any novice. Learners can become paranoid where they experience a bout of nerves believing other golfers are there to poke fun. Believe me other avid enthusiasts on the golf course are to busy setting there sights on a hole in one and can not afford to be distracted by the next up and coming Tiger Woods or Mrs. Woods.\n\nWomen starting out will benefit by visiting the local driving range to brush up hitting the ball. Why you ask? Simple, it is not as easy as it looks therefore adding more fun to the game for beginners.\n\nThis Sport is enjoyed by millions worldwide so why not add you're self to the list. The next time your husband\/partner invites you to join him in a game\/round of golf go for it.\n\nLadies ever felt something is missing in your life, do you have regrets of never snatching opportunities that passed you by. Ever had the feeling what your life was all about. Well let me tell you life is about fulfillment and achievement. Depending on the individual the answer to your wish list of finding happiness may well just lie on a golf course.\n\nTerms used in a game of golf relate to the names of our feathered friends Like Birdie an Eagle. Well let us kill two birds with one stone. Number one you get to play golf and secondly the most important is the quality time you get to spend with your spouse\/partner.\n\nAnd fingers crossed that the husband can keep his concentration on the birds that give him points not the chick he would most love to score with.\n\nIf you enjoy playing lots of golf, chances are that in your lifetime you will have the unfortunate instance of having a golf injury. This article was written with the intent of helping you avoid such an injury, as well as to assist you with the correct information of how to handle what happens when you do get hurt.\n\nLet's start out with the basics. Typically, golf injuries tend to happen in your lower back, shoulders, elbows, wrists, and hands. After all, these are the joint and muscle groups that you use the most when playing the sport. In sports, there are two types of injuries that can happen: cumulative and acute. Cumulative injuries are injuries that you get when you play too much of a sport like golf.\n\nOver time, repetitive motions end up hurting your joints and muscles. Then, if you don't take care of yourself, you one day find yourself with an injury and unable to play at all. On the other hand, an acute injury is a more sudden injury. Perhaps you swing at the ball and your shoulder pops out of place, or your back is thrown out.\n\nThere are certain things you can do to avoid both cumulative and acute golf injuries. To avoid cumulative injuries, it is important that you stretch out before even stepping out on the green. Make sure that you relax and loosen up all of your muscles and joints.\n\nTake at least ten minutes before your golf game to do some basic, easy stretching exercises. It is even a good idea to stretch out after your golf game as well. This will ensure that your muscles and joints have a chance to relax again. Stretching a second time will also help to prevent you from becoming sore in certain areas in the days to come.\n\nIf you find yourself having a tiny bit of pain in a certain area, but it is not bad enough to stop you from playing, realize that you may have the beginnings of a cumulative injury. It is highly important that you do not ever ignore joint pain or tenderness, any type of swelling, numbness, or a reduced range of motion. If any of these things occur - even in small amounts - it is vital that you see a doctor. Ignoring the situation and continuing to play golf will make a small injury into a large one.\n\nIf you get an acute injury while playing golf, you must seek immediate attention as well. First, stop what you are doing right away, and then wrap your injured area in a bandage that is tight enough to induce pressure. If necessary, put a bag of crushed ice (or a cold compress) on the injury for no more than fifteen minutes at a time, making sure the area has a chance to warm up before you freeze it again. Finally, get yourself to a doctor who can better help your injury to heal.\n\nBoth cumulative and acute injuries can be extremely painful. And, they can put an end to your golf game if you don't allow them time to heal properly. So take some time off if you have a golf injury\u2026 you will be all the better rested and ready to get out again soon!"}
{"text":"Question by BiGgestWingsfan19: Which club is better the ping rapture or taylor made burner?\nIm looking to buy a new driver. I dont need a brand new one an older model will do just fine. Golfsmith has the rapture for 150 and the burner for 130. im kinda torn between these two drivers mostly. Im also considering the clevland hibore XLS Monster. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nBest answer:\n\nAnswer by Golf 'n Pix the \"better\" one is the one you hit straiter with good distance and have confidence in. Driver technology is maxxed out for the most part, and one driver hits it just as well as another. The difference is maybe 5-10yards. The burner has a good reputation, but you may like the look of the ping more. The cleveland is just too big. i've heard people liken it to \"swinging a basketball attached to a toothpick\".\n\nIt depends on factors that can't be discussed with just an online Q&A. They're all near 460cc head volume (there isn't much difference between a 430cc head and a 460cc head). They're all at .830 COR (rebound effect), they're all close to 5,900 g*cm2 (MOI, how it resists twisting about it's axis on off-center strikes\u2026 it takes 1,400 g*cm2 to make a noticable difference)\u2026 and so on and so forth.\n\nIt comes down to two differences:\n1. where's the CG located? If it's low and back towards the trailing edge, it'll be more \"game improvement\"; the low and deep CG will increase the club's effective loft at impact, helping you get the ball up in the air. High or centered will be more \"player's\", and won't offer that assistance. If placed in a certain spot, it may actually be a detriment.\n2. what's the face angle? \"Game Improvement\" drivers have square-to-closed face angles. Player's drivers have square-to-open face angles. The closed face angle helps the average golfer by reducing a slice\u2026 it also adds loft at impact. An open face allows a golfer to fire their hands through impact without fear of hooking; it will also decrease the effective loft at impact, leading to a lower, more penetrating ball flight.\n\nFrom what I know of the models, the XLS will be the most forgiving (because of the head shape), then the Rapture, then the Burner\u2026 but the catch is, there's very little difference between the three.\nAll three have square face angles. The only thing left is CG location. Each are lower and back\u2026 but what's \"right\" is a matter of preference, and that's where the \"big boy's\" marketing department takes ahold. \"Feel\" is the most abused term in golf\u2026 but how am I to tell you what \"feels\" good or bad? You change the grip, the flex and\/or weight of the shaft, you change the feel. You have to find what YOU like, not what someone else likes."}

{"text":"It's good for your game\n\nClaw grip eases putting woes\n\nThe claw is an unorthodox grip that more than a few players on the PGA Tour use to cure their putting woes. And it may become even more popular if the rule makers deem it illegal to anchor the putter to your body. I believe there is a very good possibility this will happen in the next two years, further enhancing the importance of alternative strategies.\n\nThere are several variations of the claw, but this is the \"normal\" version: First, hold the handle of your putter, using a standard grip.\n\nThen let go with your right hand and let your arm hang naturally by your side with the fingers pointing toward the ground. Stretch your right thumb out so that the webbed area between the thumb and the forefinger is taut and each finger on the right hand is extended.\n\nSlide the right hand toward the target until the web of your hand gently touches the handle of the putter below your standard left-hand grip. Keep some bend in your right elbow and the fingers of your right hand extended. The palm of the right hand points at the ground in order to seal in the wrist angle.\n\nTo be a good putter, you need to get both the distance and direction right. The player pictured here handles the direction using the seal of the right wrist so that it and the clubface are one \u2015 every place the right hand goes, the clubface goes.\n\nTo make sure he has the correct path, he uses two tees to create a gate, then he pushes his right hand through the gate.\n\nWhile it takes a bit of practice to get used to this unusual-looking technique, it is well worth the time and effort, especially if you play the majority of your golf on fast greens.\n\nTo putt with a claw grip, start with your normal putting grip.\n\nWith the claw, the right wrist is cupped and the goal is to retain this cup while you putt."}

Please clear this up so I can understand what correct alignment is.\"\n\nWe often talk about Alignment on this blog because as you've heard me say a thousand times before, 90-95% of ALL swing problems are due to faulty alignment. And when I describe how we want to align our toes parallel left of the target, I sometimes refer to the line that bisects the ball as the Target Line and sometimes as the Aiming Line. I use them pretty much interchangeably, but Terry's question got me thinking. Is the Target Line and the Aiming Line always one and the same thing?\n\nThe answer, obviously, is No. For many shots they are, indeed, one and the same but what if wind conditions require you to make adjustments to where you begin your ball flight to ensure that the ball ends up at or near your target? Or what if you need to \"work the ball\" around an obstacle like a tall tree? In those instances, you won't be hitting directly at your target, but rather aiming at some other point and allowing the wind or the way you strike the ball shape the shot. In other words, the line that's parallel to your Toe Line would be called the Aiming Line. The good news is that if you always call it the Aiming Line you'll always be right no matter the shot!\n\nRegardless if you are new to the Peak Performance Golf Swing or you are a seasoned veteran, I strongly urge you to watch today's video for a refresher on proper alingment.\n\nKeep it vertical!\n\nThe Surge\n\nIf you can't view the YouTube video above try CLICKING HERE.

{"text":"Latest Features\n\nLPGA.com Sponsor\n\nRefresh your Game with Michelob Ultra: Maximize Driver\n\nRelated Instruction\n\nRefresh your Game with Michelob Ultra: Maximize DriverHow to Get the MOST from Your Driver\u2026\n\nAs a professional golf educator, the most common request from my students is\u2026 \"How do I hit the ball farther?\" When we learn golf, unfortunately we do so with many mistaken assumptions. In my experience, the most costly error is thinking that the golf club is swung by the arms and hands. It certainly looks that way.\n\nBut, to the untrained eye, there's a lot more going on. The golfer's trunk (these days known as the Core) is providing the most thrust that causes the most FORCE!\n\nTherefore, let's focus on the FOUR FORCES that produce the most force that produces the most distance with your driver! First, let's assume the back part of the golf swing is primarily an upper body event. The forward swing begins from the lower body or from the ground-up, utilizing:\n\nFORCE # 1 LEGS - Your legs are the major booster rockets in maximizing distance. Your arms are fast, but not as strong as your legs. Just like the booster rockets on the space shuttle lift the shuttle out of Earth's atmosphere, the legs boost the ball maximally.\n\nFORCE # 2 LEVERAGE - When the player hinges their wrists to create a 90 degree angle of the shaft and their lead arm, leverage is created. The longer that angle is retained as the player swings towards the ball, the farther the ball goes. As we learned in school, we get a lot more accomplished with little work when leverage is utilized.\n\nFORCE # 3 LAG - When the player ends the backswing and begins the forward swing properly from the ground-up, their arms lag behind creating a whipping motion which in turn multiplies the amount of velocity of the forward swing. This also increases velocity, club head speed, and distance.\n\nFORCE #4 LAUNCH ANGLE - We've learned that Tiger Woods has gone to using a 10.5 degree lofted Driver. With his swing speed, he is maximizing his distance and driving ability by adding loft and creating maximum launch angle. Most amateurs lose distance by using too little loft with their drivers. This makes the golf ball return to earth too-o soon! If you really want to hit the ball farther, add more loft.\n\nKaryn Dunphy lives and teaches golf in Studio City, CA.

By practicing Pilates you can make corrections to your body \u2013 improve flexibility, strengthen core muscles, stabilise the shoulder and pelvic girdle and increase your power with rotational movements to ensure that you not only hit further but do so with more accuracy as well. These improvements will also make squatting down to eye up that putt and carrying that heavy golf bag easier too.\n\nPilates of Armadale offers specialised programmes that address all these for our golfing community."}
{"text":"The Power of the Mind\/Body\n\nWe know the average person thinks some 60,000 thoughts every day (there are only 86,400 seconds). The mind cycles almost endlessly with an incessant chatter, most of it of which we are totally unaware. Thoughts fuel emotions, emotions fuel more thoughts, and before we are aware of it, we have spent years and decades of our lives in a constant looping of unconscious mind repetition.\n\nOur brains, meanwhile, are more complicated and sophisticated than the greatest super-computer in the world, processing more than 30 billion bits of information each second. There are more than a trillion chemical reactions going on in our bodies each and every moment \u2013 each of them in direct response to the thoughts and emotions being communicated throughout the cells continually on a mostly subconscious level.\n\nAs far as golf is concerned, each shot is a reflection of what we are experiencing internally before we ever hit the ball. Say, for example, the mind is organized before a particular golf shot with a sort of kitchen-pantry formula \u2013 three parts visualization, one part tension, two parts anxiety, zero parts self-critical and four parts humor. This \"recipe\" will fire up in the cells and direct in the body a consistent and predictable type of movement.\n\nNow change the mental\/emotional formula to something quite different \u2013 one part visualization, three parts tension, four parts self-critical, five parts anxiety and zero parts humor. Again, this recipe will produce a very different swing, and a very different result.\n\nThe bottom line is that a quiet, peaceful, focused mind will allow our bodies and our golf swings to be in \"flow.\" Tense and anxious thoughts and emotions cause our bodies to become locked in fear. The cells and muscles chemically respond to the signals sent to them by the brain because of our thoughts, emotions and beliefs."}

{"text":"Mizuno Mizuno MX Fli-Hi Graphite\n\nGolf Utility & Rescue Club Buying Guide\n\nWhat Is A Utility Club?\n\nUtility clubs can be anything from a driving iron or rescue club to a 'chipper'. As the name implies, utility clubs are very versatile and offer a player many different shots and shapes.\n\nThe rescue clubs and driving irons are becoming hugely popular with many club and pro golfers. Bridging the gap between long irons and the longer woods, the rescue club has certainly made an entrance into the golfing world.\n\nMany manufacturers are now making sets from 5-PW, to allow space for a utility or hybrid club in the bag. The utility club has taken on from where the driving iron failed, and the following describes the types of utility clubs in the market:\n\nRescue Club Or Hybrid\n\nThe most common of the utility clubs is the rescue club. So named for its ability to rescue players from rough, it combines the forgiveness and distance and height of a fairway wood and the stopping ability of an iron.\n\nThe small narrow head makes it easier to hit from tough lies than either a fairway wood or a feared long iron. Shorter in length than a fairway wood it feels more like an iron in your hand. Also for use off the tee it will typically travel as far as most players longest irons, and shorter than any fairway wood.\n\nFurthermore the rescue club can save you shots around the green. Due to its shaft length, small head and loft, it can be used to chip and hit longer running approach shots.\n\nThe Clubhead\n\nThe utility club has a relatively small head compared to fairway woods, which makes it easier to hit from rough. The narrow, smaller area on the head means there is less club to get caught up in the grass and therefore producing better contact in tough lies producing a better shot than you would get using a conventional fairway wood or long iron.\n\nLoft\n\nThe loft of utility clubs varies between 15 and 21 degrees typically. This range of loft is chosen to offer an easily hit alternative to a long iron. A 3 iron will have approximately 21 degrees of loft; therefore the utility club is ideal to bridge the gap between fairway woods and irons. One common mistake made by players is thinking that a 15-degree utility club will produce the same distance as a 15-degree fairway wood. The smaller shaft length and headsize of the utility club means it will hit it shorter than a fairway wood with the same loft.\n\nShaft Length\n\nOne of the secrets of the utility club is its length. Unlike a fairway wood, the utility club is shorter than a typical wood and similar to an iron in length. The reason behind this feature is that the shorter the club, the more control you have over your shots.\n\nDriving Iron\n\nStill a club used by many amateurs and professionals alike, the driving iron is a great club off the tee. Basically a larger, more forgiving version of a one iron, it is more suited to a player who feels confident with his\/her long irons, and wants a little more distance and control off the tee. Like a typical long iron they produce low spin and have a low trajectory, supporting the golfing theory that they are harder to get airborne than rescues and fairway woods.\n\nOlder than the rescue club, it is used to find fairways whilst also producing more distance than a basic long iron. In testing, the driving iron is straighter than either a rescue club or fairway wood and producing a longer carry despite low spin and low height, meaning that its flight is more of a lower arc than the high launch of a rescue or wood.\n\nChipper\n\nStill used by many golfers, a chipper is putter with more loft used for chipping. Same shaft and grip as a putter and used with the same stroke, a chipper has around 30 degrees of loft, and is used on the fringe and around greens to produce a chip and run shot without the difficulties of using a wedge. Aimed towards older golfers who struggle to produce wrist and arm speed to hit wedge chips."}

Similar sums would confidently be expected to accrue in the future as an on-going means of community golf aid for this and future generations.\n\nThe first significant income accrued in the Ryder Cup European Development Trust in 2006 and as a result funding has now having been granted to projects of varying size in seven countries.\n\nOnce these resources were in place, applications were invited from all relevant countries, to be considered by the Trust committee. A number of PGAs, Federations and Unions responded to the request to formulate appropriate schemes and apply for a grant.\n\nPrior to this, grants had been provided already in Germany and Ireland and subsequently in the UK, though the priority need emerged in the former Eastern Bloc, where golf is enjoying an enormous period of growth following the political changes that led to market economies being created.\n\nBulgaria and the Czech Republic have both been supported by the Trust in junior programmes that specifically encourage and help young people, boys and girls, to participate in golf while receiving basic coaching, either provided by, or supervised by, PGA professionals.\n\nThe Bulgarian scheme is regarded as an ideal insight to the purpose of the Trust and could be seen as role model for how the Ryder Cup surpluses can most effectively be used.\n\nIt was designed to \"Introduce a new sport into the country to coincide with the popularity of the game world-wide\". The Junior Development Programme's official brochure states that: \"We believe that the game of golf (in Bulgaria) is ready to explode\u2026\"\n\nTwo PGA professionals, Neil Turley and Pascal Simard lead the coaching aspect of the scheme, which begins with youngsters at their earliest days of sporting development in schools. Among the comprehensive programme's aims are:\n\nProvide support for golf sessions at schools\n\nDevelop a systematic and organised approach to junior golf\n\nDevelop individuals and teams to compete at international & European level.\n\nMake the game accessible to all\n\nA whole 'way ahead' road map has been constructed, giving time scales under a 'Junior Golf Passport' idea.

Otherwise, there is a lot here, and it could be spread out over several days to allow for more class practice time.\n\nSet up a circle with markers for the hours of the clock to practice putting skills for golf. The circle can be as big as is appropriate to give your class practice at putting. Perhaps start out with a small circle, and as they get better, widen the circle to increase the distance that they putt. Have six or fewer players in each circle so they are spaced out. Place a target hole within the circle, but not in the direct center. The players then take turns putting to the target. After they all have a turn, they retrieve their balls and rotate a space on the clock. Provide a 12-spot scorecard to keep track of their putting scores from each position.\n\nIn this boy scout merit badge: golf learning exercise, 8th graders research the rules, history, first aid, terminology, benefits, and careers of golf using the website listed, then answer 8 detailed questions as part of earning a merit badge.\n\nSeventh graders engage in a lesson that is about adding and subtracting integers in the context of keeping track of a golf score.

{"text":"Ryder Cup 2006\n\nTwelve Good Men and True versus Twelve Good Men and True, or a clash of the continents? Friendly transatlantic rivalry or a battle for sporting hegemony?\n\nThe Ryder Cup is golf's greatest match-play contest; it might even be the world's foremost international team event.\n\nHistory of the Ryder Cup\n\nIt began life in the 'roaring twenties' as a modest but competitive affair. The first four Ryder Cups were shared two wins apiece. In those pre-European days it wasn't so much Great Britain and Ireland against the United States as the Old World against the New World. Then came The Depression and, for golfers from the Old World, a depressingly long era of finishing second. In fact, for a period of 50 years, from the early '30's to the early '80's, the Ryder Cup was more often a rout than a contest, American victories being as crushing as they were predictable.\n\nThen, quite suddenly, things changed. It was decided that the Great Britain and Ireland side should be strengthened by including golfers from continental Europe. Of course, it was not merely coincidental that the greatest talent of the time happened to be a young Spaniard, Seve Ballesteros. One golfer alone couldn't turn the tide, but fortunately for Europe Ballesteros was quickly joined on the world stage by Germany's Bernhard Langer, and then by a modern day British Triumvirate of Sandy Lyle, Nick Faldo and Ian Woosnam.\n\nOverwhelmed at Walton Heath in 1981, Europe almost beat the United States in 1983 at the PGA National in Florida before gaining a famous victory at The Belfry in 1985.\n\nA first win on American soil followed in 1987. 'Uncle Sam' was never likely to roll over, however, and since then it has been almost impossible to separate the two teams. It has become a truly classic match. Irish Golfers\n\nIrish golfers have played a significant role in the history of the Ryder Cup. Only Faldo has played in more matches than 'himself', Christy O'Connor, and when Europe turned the tide in the '80s it was Eammon Darcy who holed the winning putt at Muirfield Village in 1987, and Christy O'Connor Jnr who hit that unforgettable two-iron to the final green in the tied 1989 match at The Belfry. In the 1990s Philip Walton repeated Darcy's achievement at Oak Hill in 1995, and Padraig Harrington almost did as much when defeating Mark O'Meara at Brookline four years later. Thus it is entirely fitting that the Ryder Cup should have come to Ireland in 2006.\n\nIn September 2006 The K Club hosted the 36th Ryder Cup. Anyone witnessing the event or who has played the spectacular Arnold Palmer designed layout will know that it was purposely built, if not destined, for an event of this magnitude. The extraordinary success of the 2006 Ryder Cup - providing a truly memorable event for all golfing enthusiaists worldwide - has confirmed the K Club's Palmer Ryder Cup Course. The Palmer Ryder Cup Course as one of the world's top courses and a 'must' for any golfer keen to enjoy a exhilarating golfing experience."}

Throughout my life, I've read about 40 books on golf, and I hope a good chunk of the 100 this year are golf related. On my most recent trip to the LA 84 Foundation, I happened upon a copy of the Golfing Machine, one of the books that has slipped through my fingers during this quest. I decided to take the plunge, and after skimming through the book a few times, I'm getting excited.\n\nThis site seems to exist for the \"serious\" player that many people like to consider themselves.

The idea is to get many people vested in the young pro's career and for many people to help in small amounts, either by direct support gifts of modest size or by dedicating some proceeds of product sales or teaching revenue to the support effort. (And if anyone wants to sponsor and help arrange a clinic for me to teach at your club, we can cover expenses and dedicate at least half the balance to this project as well.)\n\nStep 4 - Striking the Ball\n\nFor a beginning golfer there can be a lot of anxiety.

An extremely comforting feeling comes from understanding how to make the ball fly.\n\nThis is a segment from a book I am writing called \"Lost in Golf History.\" This chapter is called \"who can you blame\"...which covers just about every aspect of the game of golf and who is responsible for the rule in place. -------------------------------\n\nHave you ever wondered why the golf hole is 4 1\/4\" wide? Perhaps the question popped into your head when you lipped out a putt to record your best ever round...or perhaps a lipped out putt cost you a match or you first chance to break 80. The game of golf is full of surprises and some rather quirky stories behind nearly every rule.\n\nOne of my all-time favorite golfers, a man who would most definitely deserves to be on the Mount Rushmore of Golf, was a man of small stature but great ability. His name was Allan Robertson.\n\nThe majority of the golfing public has never heard the name Allan Robertson and yet without him the game of golf at the professional level might be unrecognizable. Allan Robertson never won a major, but it could be argued that without him Ben Hogan wouldn't have won one either...or anyone else for that matter.\n\nJust heard of this through a buddy at GolfWRX (have been a member there for 4 years). Anyways, this is really intriguing me and thinking of making the switch. I have begun by watching all 14 videos with Trent Dilfer and trying to imitate it. Wondering how long this process will take. As a background I got to a plus handicap this year for the first time and this would be a huge recreation of my swing."}

{"text":"Putting Green Tiers are Taller than You Think!\n\nTo get all the way\nup a putting green tier, visualize how far a ball perched on the top edge\nwould roll on level green after it comes off the bottom of the tier, as\nthis is the energy you'll have to add in the putt just to get over the\nhump itself, regardless of getting to the bottom of the tier or past the\ntop of the tier. [revised 4-24-03]\n\n***\n\nHandling putting\ngreen tiers is a chapter in itself, but let's stick just with the force\ncontrol necessary to get the ball all the way up a typical tier. The bottom\nline is that tiers usually present a stiff challenge to making sure you\nget the ball all the way to the top, and thereafter have the right force\nleft over to get the ball the rest of the way to the hole. Here's a tip\nto convert a tier to just more footage of the lower zone's slope.\n\nSome Theory.\n\nLike any slope, a\ntier is an inclined plane. A tier is a band of especially sharp slope\nthat connects two zones of the green at different elevations. Typically,\nthe tier runs athwart the green to define a front and a back level of\nthe green, the two levels usually but not always have similar slope, and\na typical rise in elevation from the front bottom of the tier to the top\nof the tier is one to two feet.\n\nTo take a fairly\ntypical example, in the hopes that this tip will thereby prove more applicable\nand translatable to other situations, consider a tier that cuts across\nan oval green 100 feet deep and 80 feet wide, with the line of the tier\nperpendicular to the long axis of the green. The bottom zone and top zone\nof the green both have 3 percent slopes (a rise of 3 feet for every 100\nfeet of run), and the tier rises vertically 1.5 feet over a horizontal\nrun of 3 feet. Your ball is centered on the lower zone, and the hole is\ncentered in the upper zone, so the putt is straight uphill all the way,\nincluding over the tier. How do you judge the force of the putt?\n\nGalileo is famous\nfor his experiment with gravity at the Tower of Pisa (which may be apocryphal),\nbut his time was more often spent studying how gravity makes objects roll\ndown an inclined plane. What he found, in a nutshell, is that 1) height\nis stored energy (like a prepackaged putt of a set force), and 2) if you\nroll a ball down one slope to \"release\" this stored energy, the ball at\nthe bottom has taken on its full dose of the energy and hence will roll\nup an opposing slope of like inclination the same distance up as it just\nrolled down, for the same reason that a pendulum bob sweeps out equal\narcs going down one side and up the other.\n\nActually, the ball\nwill lose a little of this energy due to friction, air resistance, and\nother minor effects. Consequently, if you have opposing inclined slopes\nwith a gentle transition at the bottom and release a ball at the top of\none side, it will roll nearly to the top of the other side and then fall\nback, and then roll back up the beginning slope even less, and then fall\nback, etc., until it settles at the bottom. This is how skateboarders\nwork from side to side in the specially-built facilities.\n\nSo, to make use of\nthis, to get a sense of the force needed to get up to the top of a slope,\nimagine how far a ball released from the top of this same slope will proceed\nalong an unsloping, level surface after it reaches the bottom of the tier.\nYou need to ADD this same distance to the total length of the putt to\nmake sure the ball will successfully climb all the way up the tier. The\nenergy coming down the slope is roughly the same energy needed to send\nthe ball back up the slope.\n\nThe Stimpmeter and\nTiers.\n\nThis approach to\ntiers can be combined with a Stimpmeter, which is also an inclined plane.\nThe point of a Stimpmeter is to measure the speed condition of a green\nby giving the ball a uniformly repeatable speed at the bottom of the Stimpmeter.\nIt does this by setting the ball 12 inches above the green and then releasing\nthe ball down an inclined plane 30 inches long onto the green. This is\na prepackaged putt, always with the same energy. The question then is\nhow far will the condition of the green in terms of friction from grass,\nmoisture, and other conditions, allow this prepackaged putt to run before\nstopping. A typical green speed for amateur play is about 7' 6\".\n\nLet's compare a Stimpmeter\nand our typical tier. The triangle of the inclined plane of the Stimpmeter\nhas a hypotenuse of 30 inches that the ball runs down from the starting\nnotch, a vertical base of about 10.26 inches, and a horizontal base of\nabout 28 inches. This makes an acute angle at the tip of 20 degrees. The\nslope of the Stimpmeter is 36.4%, and if the horizontal base ran 100 feet,\nthe vertical rise would be 36.4 feet!\n\nOur tier makes the\nfollowing triangle for the inclined plane: the horizontal base is 3' (36\"),\nthe vertical rise is 1.5' (18\"), the hypotenuse (the tier surface) is\n3.35' (40.2\") long. The acute angle is 26.6 degrees, and the slope is\n50%. As you can see, this tier is a little steeper and longer than a Stimpmeter,\nbut not by too much.\n\nConsequently, the\n1.5' high tier is rougly the same as a Stimpmeter that is one and one-half\ntimes larger and higher than the standard Stimpmeter. If the tier was\nonly 1' high, it would have roughly the same \"prepackaged putt\" as a regular\nStimpmeter.\n\nIf our green has\na 7'6\" Stimpmeter reading, you know right off the bat that the 1.5' tier\nwill take MORE than this to reach the top. If you treated this tier like\nan extra 7'6\" of putt, your ball would NOT make it to the top! Speaking\nvery roughly, a 1.5' tier of this sort of slope calls for adding a little\nover 10' of extra force to your putt. Don't get over-excited, though;\n10' is really only about 20-25 rolls of the ball -- not all that much.\n\nMake This Part of\nYour Game.\n\nFind a tiered green\nto practice putting up. Get a rough idea of the green Stimpmeter reading.\nAssess the elevation rise and get a handle on the horizontal run of the\ntier from bottom edge to top edge. If the two are equal, the tier has\na slope of 100% and the angle is 45 degrees. This is a STEEP slope. Most\ntiers will be closer to 25-35 degrees in the 50% range. If the tier slope\nis comparable to the Stimpmeter slope, for every foot of rise in elevation\nof the tier itself, you can add about the same number of feet as the Stimpmeter\nreading of the green. Thus 1' of tier rise is about the same as an extra\n7.5' of putt on a 7.5 Stimpmeter green. This is what you need to take\ncare of the tier only. Then you still have to get the ball to the bottom\nof the tier and from the top to the hole. That's another story!"}

{"text":"Pages\n\nMonday, May 21, 2012\n\nIt has been written about for almost a hundred years. So why have we not gotten it right? Why does the basic preparation to hit a golf ball seem so elusive? For the average golfer the \"static four\", including the grip, posture, alignment and ball position, are the easiest elements of the golf swing to improve and even master.\n\nGRIP\nHow we hold the club determines the arc and the way in which the wrists set or load at the top. Whether the grip is weak or strong makes the ball spin right or left. If the club sits properly in the fingers, the rotation through impact reacts on a larger level by rolling the forearms, one over the other. Correcting the grip always feels dramatic. But if the change is needed to develop and foster a better swing it is always worth the uncomfortable feelings associated with it. When a student says they have tried to change their grip but they can't, they have basically mastered the wrong grip and are often doomed to make other adjustments to accommodate their poor starting position.\n\nPOSTURE\nThe preferred posture is debated. But, we need to stand in an athletic position ready to act and be forward. Twenty-five years ago there was emphasis on straightening the spine as it entered into the pelvic area, almost inverting the hips, only to find out that this position gave everyone a back ache. Now it is widely accepted that the curvature in the lower spine should be angled to match the pelvic area straight on. No \"hyper extension\" of the lower spine. It needs to be comfortable. Good posture is about balance. That balance needs to be slightly forward on the balls of the feet. So a little bend in the knees, a little more bend at the hips and the hands will hang naturally away from the body 4-5 inches. The bottom counter balances the top with a little emphasis forward toward the golf ball. The curvature of the spine leading into the neck and head needs to be comfortable. A little slouching is okay as long as it remains slouchy throughout the swing.\n\nALIGNMENT\nThere are many good reasons to be aligned wrong. And that is okay. But understand the affect of poor alignment. Check out an earlier post, Alignment: Pull Shots and Slices, for more information.\n\nBALL POSITION\nThe various ball positions, as they relate to the center line between the feet, is often misunderstood. For 90% of all full shots the difference in ball position between a wedge and a fairway wood is much less than most people visualize. Good practice aligns the ball in the center of the stance for a wedge. For every longer club the ball position moves toward the target (forward) by less than a 1\/2 inch. That means about 5 inches between the wedge and fairway woods. Other factors, such as the width of stance and alignment can further reduce the disparity between the short irons and longer clubs. For both alignment and ball position, placing an alignment stick or club on both the parallel and perpendicular line is helpful to visualize these positions.\n\nThe grip, posture, alignment, and ball position all determine the direction, trajectory, and spin on the ball. These static elements of the address position require very little athletic ability. How you hold it and stand there affects everything. It is time we all get it right.\n\nThursday, May 17, 2012\n\nI was recently asked to lead a golf clinic for Girlfriendz Magazine, an informative magazine for South Jersey women. The event, sponsored by Wells Fargo Bank, was an introduction to golf for 17 women covering etiquette, grip, stance and posture, and the basic overall movement of the golf swing.\n\nWomen were given the option to play nine holes at Little Mill Country Club or attend the clinic at the driving range. Bringing new golfers to the course in a friendly, low stress atmosphere, is core to building the game and promoting the club.\n\nMonday, May 14, 2012\n\nIt seems there are plenty of options when choosing a golf ball. Distance is not really the issue anymore. Find a ball that feels good around the green then check the status regarding distance and compression. Is there a big difference between $50 per dozen and $36 per dozen? Here is a link to a recent 2012 Golf Digest article that covers numerous balls. You be the judge. I like the cross section photographs.\n\nSunday, May 13, 2012\n\nThere has been plenty of references to a stake or pole being driven down through the head to the ground in reference to the axis point in the body. The vertical center line that all the motion rotates around. I recently had an experience while practicing where the feeling I had was more related to a wire being driven directly toward the front of my head so that it would be driven into a wall behind me. Not immediately behind me, but more like 10 feet or so. This distance would give the sense of slack in the wire, but taut enough for stability. The feeling gave me the sense of keeping my head still, but allowing it to move slightly throughout the swing. More specifically, during the moment of impact, as the hands and arms are reaching their maximum speed, my head actually moves backwards, allowing the whip of the club to pass by. There is a slowing down nature to the big muscles, of which my head is connected, as they reach impact. Much like a whip pulls back to make the snap.\n\n\"My head felt like there was a pin directly through my forehead into a wall behind me as my arms and body ripped through impact.\"\n\na b o u t\n\nChris is a member of the PGA of America and the Coaching and Teaching Professional at Little Mill Country Club.

But over time, he came to realize that the Sweet Spot Plane was Boss. Here's why:\n\nDon't Hit it at the Target\n\nLet's start with the single most basic element of making the ball go toward the target. Where does the clubface have to be at impact to make the ball go straight to the flag? The quick and easy response is square, but just as it looks like the sun rotates around the earth, it is an illusion.\n\nPlane is the Boss\n\nThe Plane is \"The Boss\" and is the heart and soul of the golf stroke. But what is the Plane? It is not Hogan's plane of glass, that's only one plane angle variation. You can use any plane angle you choose and you can shift from any plane angle to another as long as the base of the plane does not change.\n\nPlaying with Feel\n\nWe learn feel from mechanics not vice versa. As a teacher it is impossible to teach someone feel but it is possible to help them understand the Mechanics that will allow them to reproduce that Mechanic into a feel.\n\nThe Follow-Through\n\nThe follow-through is the result of the prior body movements. After impact it's just a matter of releasing all tension and letting Centrifugal Force finish your swing. Centrifugal Force will keep the clubface travel and clubface angle in the proper position. After the ball leaves the clubface, there is nothing you can do that will affect the flight of the ball."}

TaylorMade, one of the premier golf club manufacturers, designs drivers for the novice player who plays once a year, and for experienced players who make a living playing the sport. With enough practice, you can learn how to hit a TaylorMade driver long and straight.\n\nStep 1\n\nDecide which TaylorMade driver you want to hit. TaylorMade offers a wide variety of drivers for players at varying levels of experience. Choose the driver you want to play based on your experience, price range and weaknesses in your game. Often you can help compensate for certain swing flaws with the right equipment.\n\nStep 2\n\nTake a few practice swings with your driver with a light grip. Gripping the club too tightly can put too much tension on your wrists and forearms.\n\nItems you will need\n\nTaylorMade driver\n\nGolf balls\n\nGolf tees\n\nStep 3\n\nPress down with the base of your right thumb onto the top of your left thumb (for a right-handed golfer). This helps keep your hands together during the swing and prevents the driver's club face from opening up on the downswing.\n\nStep 4\n\nBend slightly at the knees so you can shift your body weight during your swing. Keep your feet about shoulder width apart of whatever feels natural and keeps your balance.\n\nStep 5\n\nPoint your right elbow down at the top of your backswing. This helps keep the club parallel to your target and helps in hitting the ball straight.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nJoshua Smothers works at the Gannett Des Moines Design Studio, designing sports pages and special sections for four Midwest newspapers.

{"text":"I had two shots today that rolled over the hole when someone who was on the green pulled the pin on me without my permission. One was a 50 yard pitch shot that ended up about a foot beyond the hole, and I'm sure it would have sunk if the pin had been in place. The other was a little scary downhill chip that probably would have left me with a makeable par putt instead of rolling an extra 20 feet to the bottom of the green.\n\nThe guy swears to me that if a person is on the green, he must pull the pin. My understanding of the rule is that if I'm playing from off the green, no one may pull the pin without my permission.\n\nYour fellow competitor, by removing the flagstick, just incurred a two stroke penalty, BTW.\n\n17-2. Unauthorized Attendance\n\nIf an opponent or his caddie in match play or a fellow-competitor or his caddie in stroke play, without the player's authority or prior knowledge, attends, removes or holds up the flagstick during the stroke or while the ball is in motion, and the act might influence the movement of the ball, the opponent or fellow-competitor incurs the applicable penalty.\n\n*Penalty for Breach of Rule 17-1 or 17-2:\nMatch play - Loss of hole; Stroke play - Two strokes.\n\np.s. did you know if the ball is rolling toward a flagstick on the ground you can pick it up without penalty? Decision 17\/1-6. and rule 24-1.\n\nIsn't there also some rule that even though your intention is not to be tending the flag stick, if you are near enough to touch the stick you are considered to be tending it?\n\nI beleive the rule is that no one is allowed to tend the pin without the permission of the person who is taking the stroke. I also believe that if the person taking the stroke asks for someone to tend the pin, and then ends up hitting the pin because the tender didn't pull it, the person taking the stroke takes a penalty.\n\nIsn't there also some rule that even though your intention is not to be tending the flag stick, if you are near enough to touch the stick you are considered to be tending it?\n\nThat's the way the rule reads, but i believe it's under the assumption that you've asked the person to tend the flag. It basically means you don't have to touch it to be deemed \"flag attendant\". Like, if i'm marking my ball at 2 feet and you decide to putt without removing the flag and i'm not paying attention, you're SOL if you hit that.\n\nWell, yes and no> there's different stipulations when it comes to the attendance. You can actually be disqualified if you're attending and LET the ball hit the flagstick (if you knowingly did it).\n\nThis is all under decision 17-3\/2 -- the same decision where it's tough luck on the putter if i wasn't paying attention. It's a real gray area, but you're just basically counting on the guy your playing with\/against not to be a total peni$.\n\nIsn't there also some rule that even though your intention is not to be tending the flag stick, if you are near enough to touch the stick you are considered to be tending it?\n\nThere is a decision\n\n17-1\/1 Meaning of \"Stands Near the Hole\"\n\nQ. Note 1 to Rule 17-1 states that, if anyone \"stands near the hole,\" he is deemed to be attending the flagstick.

It is well taken care of and an absolute brute from the tips if you don't hit it straight. OB will kill you if the trees don't get you first. (there are many) The first hole is a short par 4 and the driver is best left in the bag. Hit something about 150 or so and you have any easy shot in. The second is a short par 3 over a pond to a small, well sloped green. The holes get more interesting from there. The two remaining par 3's (on the front 9) are 200+ yards, very challenging. The front also has back to back par 5's, the seccond of which is tough. The back is equally difficult finishing with a pond fronting the 17th green and an 18th fairway which slopes severly from left to right.

{"text":"Learn how to increase your clubhead speed from one of the game's longest drivers\n\n4) WRIST HINGE: Hinging your wrists during the backswing has the same effect as turning your hips: It increases the length of your backswing, which, in turn, increases your opportunity to create speed (potential energy). It's no accident that most long hitters have long backswings, achieved in part by ample wrist hinge (note Quiros' full shoulder turn and parallel shaft). And it's rare to see a short hitter with a long backswing. So, to increase your clubhead speed, go ahead and hinge your wrists. And don't worry about hinging your wrists at a specific point in your backswing; try to hinge them gradually and in synchronization with the rotation of your shoulders and hips.\n\n5) BEGINNING DOWNSWING: You've set yourself up on the backswing to maximize your clubhead speed. Now your downswing will determine whether that speed is realized or not. There's a real and definable sequence to the downswing that's best for all golfers, and that sequence is: hips, shoulders, arms and clubhead. In starting the downswing, the hips should move laterally toward the target and begin to turn while the knees remain flexed. When the hips get slightly past their original position at address, they stop moving laterally, but continue to rotate. At this point, the front leg also begins to straighten. It's this action that allows you to maintain your wrist hinge long into your downswing and release the club with maximum force at impact, resulting in greater driver distance.\n\n6) IMPACT: Impact is the moment of truth, the culmination of events that occurred up to that point. Arriving at a powerful impact means that you've shifted your weight onto your front foot while unwinding your hips. Notice how Quiros' weight is toward the front of his left foot, and his belt buckle is pointing in front of the ball\u2014a clear sign he has combined his weight shift and hip rotation. There's no spinning off the back foot as is common with slicers and shorter hitters. Another thing to notice in Quiros' incredibly powerful impact position is how his hands are slightly ahead of the ball and both arms are fully extended\u2014you can't release the stored-up energy any better than that!\n\nRandy Peterson, PGA, is the director of fitting and instruction at the Ely Callaway Performance Center, where he oversees all Tour professionals' club fittings and development of club-fitting protocols."}

{"text":"To create a more athletic setup, imagine your shoulders, hips and knees in a level position with your weight spread between your feet evenly.\nThe importance of a solid setup position cannot be denied\u2014if you start out poorly you'll have little chance of making a solid swing. Some key thoughts for a good setup are \"stay level\" and \"be athletic.\"\n\nMany golfers handicap themselves at the outset by making mistakes like kicking in the right knee, dropping the right shoulder or flaring only one of their feet. In the photo at right, notice how my shoulders remain nearly level, with the right only slightly lower than the left. My knees are bowed a bit outward and both feet are flared. This is a key for creating an athletic swing\u2014one that's rotational rather than a lateral, sliding motion that stresses the back and leads to an ineffective impact position.

{"text":"Grip Pressure\n\nWhat should I think about when gripping my clubs...some tell me to think about holding a bird or putting pressure only on certain fingers. What is the right way and is grip pressure the same for all clubs, because it seems I grip my driver tighter than my irons.\n\nAlso, is the wrong grip pressure the cause of my glove having a hole in the palm area?\n\nI try to feel like my grip pressure is about a 5 out of 10 if ten is gripping it as tight as I can. You want to have a good tension free grip that allows you to release the club properly but not so loose that it moves around in your hands. If your glove has a hole in it than that may mean that you are gripping it too tight but gloves do wear out over time.\n\nJust hold the club, it shouldn't take thinking about anything, it shouldn't take applying any pressure. You certainly don't want any tension in your forearm. Your grip pressure will change naturally as needed when you swing.\n\nWhen I wore a glove I would change it because of nastiness not because of a hole.\n\nA pretty good visual\/tip that has worked for me is to imagine you're holding a tube of toothpaste and only apply enough pressure to barely squeeze toothpaste to the top of the tube - not out of the tube. You don't want to grip too tight that would result in the toothpaste coming out of the tube."}

{"text":"Instruction\n\nTip of the Month\n\nBy Jason Helman (July 2012)\n\nOne of the biggest issues I come across when playing with members at the club or amateurs in Pro Ams, is that they waste shots by under-clubbing. Generally, this is simply due to the \"ego factor\" taking over in a specific situation. For example, if someone hits a particular iron on a par 3, they will try to hit the same club as their playing partner because the little devil on their shoulder said, \"yeah, you've got that shot, go for it, you're just as good as they are.\" However, the little angel on your other shoulder should be saying \"take the extra club, swing smooth, it's a smarter decision.\"\n\nTrying to club off someone else can be one of the biggest mistakes you can make. As an observer you have no idea what the other player is trying to do from a power standpoint. You're also not aware of the shape of the shot or height of the shot. It's all a guess on your behalf. If you guess wrong, mis-hit your shot, pull it because you swing too hard or push it because you swing too soft, chunk it or thin it, you're not likely to get the result you expected. So, eat some humble pie, put your ego back in your golf bag, brush the little devil off your shoulder, take the extra club and make your normal stock swing and learn to control the ball. I guarantee your misses will become better or you will surprise yourself and playing partners with a spectacular shot. Moreover, you will trust it next time if you pull it off. Self belief can go a long way.\n\nIt's so important to \"play your own game.\" At the end of the day it doesn't matter who hit what, it's what you write on the scorecard. Play to your strengths; don't create a weakness in your game by playing someone else's game."}

{"text":"Many myths abound about the game of golf. Unfortunately, many great golfers buy into these myths and they can affect how well the golfer can play the game. Grupo Mayan experts recommend that you understand these myths in order avoid falling for them.\n\nMyth #1: Your head won\u00edt move. Most people believe that your head will remain stationary, throughout your swing. This is untrue. If you are a normal person, your upper body will move to the back and then to the front as you swing. Your head is connected to your upper body, so it will move. Do not try to fight this natural movement. Of course, you do not want to let your head bob all over the place.\n\nMyth #2: Keeping a straight left arm is imperative. This myth is that you should keep your left arm (front) as straight as possible through the back swing. In reality, your elbow will bend slightly. If you try to keep your arm straight as an arrow, you will likely tense up. At the point of impact with the ball, be sure to keep your arm straight then. If you spend too much time worrying about this myth, your game will surely suffer.\n\nMyth #3: Setup positions and impact positions should be the same. Grupo Mayan experts reveal that this myth is just plain silly. How many times have you come across someone who is set up to hit the ball with his or her eyes bugged out, mouth wide open, and making the most unusual grunting sounds? Exactly, that is why this is a ridiculous myth.\n\nMyth #4: Keep your club parallel to the ground at the top of the backswing. Unfortunately, this particular myth is strongly reinforced by some golf coaches. They believe that if you wish to swing correctly that at the top of the backswing, the golf club shaft should parallel the ground. You should not be as concerned as to where the golf club ends up. You should be more concerned about keeping your wrists at a ninety-degree angle, your left arm bent slightly, and the back turned to your target. Then you will see better results.\n\nSo many people are tripped up by others who say they want to help, but actually are only keeping golf myths alive. Grupo Mayan experts hope this information helps you to avoid these problems and that you can concentrate on what is important and improve your game."}
{"text":"There's a hidden positive behind the long-putter craze\n\nLong-putter users such as Adam Scott utilize their dominant hand to control the stroke, something many instructors say is key to having success on the greens.\n\nJ.D. Cuban\n\nTraditionalists who bemoan tour pros' use of long putters as a sign of the apocalypse should\ntake note. There is a long-term\npositive consequence to the\nproliferation of the long wands\u2014\nand their subsequent trickle-down\nto recreational golfers\u2014that even\nsome advocates may not realize.\nUsing the club promotes, if not\ndemands, that golfers putt with\ntheir dominant hand, which many\nbright golf minds consider essential\nto being successful on the greens.\n\nWhether it is your left or right,\nyour dominant hand offers you the\nmost natural feel for smaller chores.\nIt's the one you use to thin-slice a soft\ntomato, fit a key into a door knob in\nthe dark, hammer a nail into place. It\nfollows that this hand is best suited\nto control the length of your putting\nstroke, its path and the force applied.\nCross-handers excepted, the other\nhand simply keeps the club stable. Added to the top of the\nlong putter stuck in the stomach or chest or chin, you get\nan exceptionally well-steadied club (no snickering please).\nBut that's not the hidden good. It is the dominant hand that\ndoes the magic.\n\nOld-time golf devotees will tell you everything about how\nto play the game was thought up five minutes after its\ninvention. Not quite, but dominant-hand putting is not a\nnew idea, even if the term might be. According to my\nresearch, in 1926 Joe Turnesa, a member of that famous\nAmerican golf family, won the Metropolitan PGA putting\nwith only his right hand. His left hand merely hung at his\nside. Mike Hulbert, a journeyman tour pro in the 1980s and\n1990s, played almost the entire 1995 season putting with\nonly his right hand. He didn't win that year but said it was\none of the best overall seasons he ever had on the circuit.\nTurnesa and Hulbert didn't continue with the method. I\ncouldn't get to Turnesa to say why he gave it up (he died in\n1991), but Hulbert hinted that peer pressure put his other\nhand back on the club.\n\nBen Hogan had little to say\nabout putting, which he\nconsidered a game other than\ngolf, but in his 1948 instruction\nbook Power Golf, he has a\nchapter on the subject. It's\nshort and mostly boilerplate\nstuff, but he does note that\nwhile he kept both hands on the\nclub he used the reverse overlap\ngrip because all the fingers of\nthe right hand were on the shaft\nand he did his putting with his\nright hand\u2014which was indeed\nhis dominant hand.\n\nThe last time I saw Tiger\nWoods practice putting when\nhe was still on top of his game,\nhe spent at least a half hour\nputting with only his right\nhand. Jack Nicklaus has\ndescribed his own putting\nstroke as \"kind of pushing the\nball,\" which he did of course\nwith his dominant right hand.\n\nSure, relying on a dominant hand isn't the only popular\nputting technique making the rounds. Another calls for\ngolfers to move the club with only the shoulders. It's meant\nto keep the hands (and wrists) out of the stroke on grounds\nthat they are so flexible they can't consistently maintain the\nintended stroke path or roll the ball at the proper pace. But\nthe long putter is a pretty heavy instrument, and just moving\nit with good control using only the shoulders is a pretty\ndodgy business. What's more, shoulders cannot possibly\nhave the same sensitivity or touch as the hands because\nthey aren't on the club. The hand is.\n\nIt is interesting to note when some pros go back to a conventional putter, they putt well (Vijay Singh for example). I'd argue it's from the unintended consequence of being reunited with their dominant hand.\n\nWhat are the mechanics? Nothing very complicated. Be it\nwith a long (or standard length) putter, simply pull the club\nback and push it forward with your dominant hand.

{"text":"When it comes to golfing, you may be unsure of the best ways to go about working towards perfecting your technique or even to learn more about the game so you can craft a better strategy and reduce your strokes on the course. This article is here to help you get on track and start boosting your game.\n\nMake sure that you are holding your golf club correctly. Put the handle of the club between the palms of your hands and grasp it with your thumbs facing downward. Your hands will be touching. Command the club by choking down on it, when you only want to stroke the ball a short way. Choke-up when you want it to go the distance.\n\nWhen beginning to learn how to golf, focus on the drive. The drive will put you in a good position either for a putt, or a second shot then a putt. If you can't get it close to the fairway on your drive, your drive needs work. Having a good drive can lower your score tremendously.\n\nPractice deep breathing to help you relax and focus when you address the golf ball. This practice will support your swing and help you avoid swing tension errors. The worst thing you can do to your game is approach it with a lot of tension and pressure, so just relax for a better game of golf.\n\nAim for the ground in a sand trap. If you find your ball stuck in a sand trap, aim lower. When you hit the sand under the ball, it will pop the ball up into the air, and back onto safe ground. You will not get much distance, but you will be out of the trap saving you precious strokes in the long run.\n\nAre you having trouble slicing the ball away from you? Did the ball leave you in the shape of a banana? This is easy to fix. Move 2 inches closer to the ball so that your ball is just an inch away from the hole. People's first reaction during a swing is to pull yourself away from the ball. This will be corrected by moving up on the hole.\n\nIn order to maximize your scoring opportunities, take time to practice chipping and pitching around the green. Improvement in this important aspect of your short game can lead to shorter putts, and for some this can lead to a 10 stroke difference in your final score. Add chipping practice to your pre-round routine and watch your scores plummet.\n\nMake sure to hit the driver, not the 3-wood. Sometimes the bigger one is the better choice. Fairway woods have indeed come a long way. Despite the advances in fairway woods, the drivers have gotten much bigger in size, making them not only larger, but also enormously longer and more forgiving.\n\nWith golf, even the smallest adjustments can yield tremendous results. So, take the information that pertains to your own golf strategy and style from this article, in order to make the necessary changes that will make a difference in how you play but also, make you appreciate the game of golf and what it is all about."}

{"text":"The fastest way to improve your score is to improve your short game from 100 yards in.\n\nIf you watch the best golfers in the world, they all miss the fairway more than 30 percent of the time, but from within 100 yards, they expect to knock it close every time. This is golf's scoring zone; it separates the winners from the losers, the low handicappers from everyone else.\n\nThe following golf tips will have you master your short game in no time:\n\nHit it low: The pitch and run\n\nFor chip or pitch shots to an uphill or back pin location, adjust your stance so you are lined up parallel to the target. Play the ball in the middle of your stance using a 7, 8 or 9 iron, as opposed to your wedges.\n\nPlace your hands slightly ahead of the ball at address, and use the same motion you do when putting (an arm swing gives much better results than too much hand action).\n\nMedium height shots: The pitch shot\n\nPitch shots fly higher than the chip shot, but they release and roll out once the ball hits the green. They're used for shorter shots than the chip shot or to pitch over an embankment, high grass or traps where there is plenty of room to land the ball on the green and run it to the pin.\n\nStart by opening up your stance slightly, but keep your clubface square to the target. Play the ball in the middle of your stance, hands slightly ahead of the ball. For these shots, use one of your wedges (which wedge depends on the height of the shot you want to hit).\n\nTo hit these shots lower, use an arm swing; to gain more height, use a little more wrist in the shots. Experiment when practicing, and you will create the optimal pitching motion for each shot selection.\n\nHigh pitches: The lob shot\n\nTo hit a high lob shot to a tight pin, start by taking a narrow stance and open it and the clubface, and play the ball forward off your front toe.\n\nAim slightly to the left of the target (right-hand golfers) because the ball is going to fly where the clubface is facing. This shot calls for an accelerating and descending motion into the ball. Finally, set your wrists early in the backswing, and use more hand action on these shots.\n\nThis is the most difficult short game shot to master, so practice these shots often.\n\nSeptember 16Very good article. I prefer opening my stance up wide open,with the hands forward of the front foot, and then swinging down through the ball. I tend to get enough juice on my pitch shots using a 54 degree wedge to stop the ball from rolling once it hits the green. I can throw a lot of shots up close to the pin doing this.\n\nThis is the 2nd great article I have read today.Timely as Friday(weather permitting) was to be my first practice day on the range, on of all things, the short game.\nIt took decades to realize that my handicap could have dropped significantly,had I only concentrated more on the game from 100-120yds in,instead of the 'hit it longer'mantra.\nI love it when the ball is sent up like a mortar shell, to pepper the pin. You can have the 300yds+ drives,250 will do me thanks and then the joy of nailing the green or an awkward pin.\nThe Driver fine, but the ability to almost make the wedges talk to you, gives far better satisfaction and lower scores.This content in this article will be on the table beside the bay at the range on Friday. Appropriately it is of course, \"Good Friday\". Hope that is significant for the practice too.\nThankyou for an extremely well written and easy to understand routine for the short shots"}

That is where the putting arc deluxe comes in.\n\nSo why do you ask? Normally, I'm not the kind of person that recommends things to people. Trust me, something has to be pretty impressive for me to recommend it.\n\nThis is my story, well not mine personally, but one of my good friend's. They are probably one of the worse putters that I have ever seen. After they got onto the green, it would take them close to 20 times to get the ball in the cup.\n\nMy friend never got par, nor did they ever get bogey. I wish I had taken some video's so that I could show you how bad they were. It actually was hysterical watching them play.\n\nSomeone had actually recommended to them that they get the putting arch deluxe. A couple weeks later when we were playing together, they were playing noticeably better. They were still getting over bogey, but at least it did not take them over a half hour as it usually did.\n\nThat time, I had thought they were having a once in a blue moon good day. Well, the next time we played together they got bogey. Now I was really impressed and had to ask them what they were doing. When I did, they told me that someone had suggested to them that they try the putting arc deluxe, so they did.\n\nI asked them what the heck that was and they said obviously it was a training aid that helped them to repeatedly hit in a putting motion. The putter is guided the whole time so that you cannot do it any other way and it gets you doing it the right way.\n\nLater that day we went to their house so they could show me this contraption and I must say that it was something else. It is only 36 inches and 8 pounds and can be used inside and out. It does not look bad either. When I tried it out, I could not believe the way that worked to guide your putting motion and now understand why it worked so well for my friend.\n\nSo, if you are like my friend it is worth the try.

{"text":"Pages\n\nThursday, March 12\n\nJim McLean Instruction: Indoor Drills\n\nBy Jim McLean Special to ARMCHAIR GOLF\n\nWINTERS CAN BE LONG and that itch to play can build up, so scratch that itch with some indoor practicing to hone your skills for the coming season. Indoor practice can be very valuable to improving the swing. When clubs and ball flights are eliminated, focus is shifted to technique and body awareness. Body drills are so important to our teaching system that we use them in every school. Here are just a few of the drills we teach to get you in golf shape for the spring.\n\nBODY COIL\n\nMaking a full body coil and transferring the weight through impact properly are keys to power and distance. A simple drill to reinforce this can be performed in front of a mirror using a towel.\n\nGet into a proper golf stance in facing the mirror. This should involve feet approximately shoulder width apart, knees flexed, and a slight bend from the hips towards the ball (mirror). Be sure not to slouch, set up is an athletic position with the weight balanced equally between the toes and heels. (Never have more weight on the toes than the heels.) Place the folded towel between your feet on the ground perpendicular to your body so it bisects your stance. Cross your arms across your chest, maintaining golf posture. For right-handed players, when looking in the mirror the left shoulder should be higher than the right. This is very important to driving the ball well.\n\nSimply coil your upper body to the right over a fairly resistant lower body. Visualize your upper body in a cylinder or tube that is consistent with your spine angle at address (that tilt of the left shoulder above the right that I mentioned) and coil within this tube. \u2022 A full coil is made by turning so that the buttons of your shirt are over the inside of your right foot, keeping your weight to the inside of the right leg. \u2022 It is important that the right knee remains flex; it is your brace for your backswing. \u2022 Use that towel as a gauge to make sure you're making a full turn. The left shoulder should rotate past the towel. \u2022 It is important at this point to check in the mirror that you have maintained the spine angle, so you should be slightly tilted towards the mirror. \u2022 At the top of the backswing, all of the weight should feel as if it is on your right leg. Transferring your weight to the left side is a shift and rotate motion. \u2022 Weight transfer begins from the ground up. \u2022 The knees kick slightly forward, then the hip slides slightly followed by a rotation. \u2022 As the hips rotate, they pull the upper body forward into a rotation. \u2022 Finish with the right heel up and all the weight balanced over the left heel.\n\nDuring this drill, try to focus on maintaining the spine angle established at set up. The drill should also be used to practice rhythmic movement with a concentration on the proper sequence of uncoiling. When practiced correctly, this drill will increase flexibility and develop a more controlled efficient swing.\n\nNext week: Right Arm Only"}

{"text":"How to Pick Up a Golf Ball With a Wedge\n\nby William McCoy, Demand Media\n\nLifting a golf ball off the ground with a wedge is a trick that requires some practice to perfect, but is ideal to try when waiting around at a golf course. This trick has little practical benefit, as you rarely need to pick up a ball with a wedge. Typically, golfers pick up their ball with their putter after holing out. Still, performing this trick perfectly can impress your friends.\n\nStep 1\n\nSelect your wedge with the highest loft. In many cases, this club will be the lob wedge, which often has a loft of at least 60 degrees.\n\nStep 2\n\nPosition the wedge in your hand so that the clubface is as horizontal as possible. Choke up on the wedge slightly. Ideally, hold it at the base of the grip for greater control.\n\nItems you will need\n\nLob wedge\n\nStep 3\n\nPut the lob wedge on the ground with the clubface open and slide the clubface under the ball quickly and carefully to raise the ball onto the clubface. If you need to place your shoe on the other side of the ball to prevent it from rolling away, do so. With practice, you should be able to perform this trick without needing your shoe.\n\nStep 4\n\nBounce the ball on the clubface once you get the club positioned beneath the ball by making quick movements with your wrist. This action will elevate the ball; bounce the ball a few times until you are able to bounce it high enough to grab it with your other hand.\n\nWarnings\n\nAvoid practicing this trick in the immediate vicinity of other people, vehicles or windows. If you bounce the ball incorrectly, it can fly off at an angle and hit a person or object.\n\nReferences\n\nAbout the Author\n\nToronto-based journalist William McCoy has been writing since 1997, specializing in topics such as health, nutrition and sports. He has spent much of his career in community news, including at \"Nepean This Week\" newspaper, and has written for \"Canadian Sports Collector\" magazine. McCoy is a journalism graduate of Ryerson University."}
{"text":"Relax! Take your time\n\nYour putting routine can be variable and you can have as few as three or perhaps as many as six practice strokes each time taking a different amount of time over each putt. It really is individual and doesn't matter as long as you feel comfortable.\n\nHow long your practice routine takes depends on your ability to concentrate under pressure. Usually, under normal playing conditions, most of us feel ready after three practice strokes - three being the minimum: one looking at the hole, one looking at the ball and one looking again at the ball before looking up to determine the line.\n\nUnder pressure, however, you may need to say to yourself: \"Come on, pay attention - will this stroke roll the imaginary ball at the perfect speed, just past the hole?\"\n\nThis article is older than 60 days, which we reserve for our premium members only.You can subscribe to our premium member subscription, here."}

{"text":"The first golf balls\nwere made of wood until the early 17th century\nwhen the \"feathery\" came into use\n\nThe golf ball has come a long way since the time of colf.\nThere are several 15th century references to club and\nball makers in Holland. Records show that the Scots have\nbeen importing balls from across the North Sea literally\nby the barrel-load as long ago as 1496.\n\nThe Dutch colf players originally played with\nwodden balls made out of elm or beech. These balls had\nnegligible aerodynamic properties. Gradually, they\nadopted a ball made of white leather and filled with\ncow's hair which was used in the local game of kaatsen\n(hand tennis). It is possible the kaatsen ball\nlater inspired the Scots to invent the\n\"feathery\" sometime in the 17th or early 18th\ncentury as a subsitute for the wooden ball which was\nprobably the popular ball of choice of the day.\n\nThe Ball Stuffed with\nFeathers - The \"Feathery\"\n\nThe \"feathery\" consisted of a leather\ncasing, usually bull's hide, soaked in alum and crammed\nwith goose feather which have been softened by boiling.\nThe ball was then knocked into shape and painted white so\nas to make it more visible. On drying, the ball became\ntighter and firmer. It weighed about the same as the\nmodern ball (that is, 1.62 ounces) and was usually a of\nsimilar size although in there was no uniform diameter in\nthose days.\n\nThe average\nplayer used four balls per round as the\n\"feathery\" had a tendency to\nsplit and get too damp\n\nEach \"feathery\"\nwas stuffed with more than a top-hatful\nof feathers\n\nThe \"feathery\" had two differences from the\nballs preceding it. Firstly, wooden balls could seldom be\npropelled more than 100 yards whereas distances of more\nthan twice that could be easily achieved with the\n\"feathery\". In wet weather, when the ball\nbecame rather soggy, its advantage over the wooden ball\nwas not so marked. It is worth noting that the very act\nof stiching up the finished \"feathery\"\ninadvertently assisted the flight of the ball. This was\nbecause the seams fulfilled a similar, if cruder, role to\nthat played by the dimples which help the modern day golf\nball get airborne. The second difference of the\n\"feathery\" from the wooden ball was its price.\nA \"feathery\" cost twelve times the price of the\nold boxwood ball and about the same as a wooden club. It\nmade golf far too expensive for the ordinary man. Even\nthe most skilled craftsman struggled to produce more than\nfour \"feathery\" balls a day which probably\naccouted for its high price.\n\nThe less wealthy had to make do with wooden balls for\ndecades after the coming of the \"feathery\" and\nit is from this era that golf's image as a rich man's\npastime still lingers.\n\nA Ball for the Masses\n\nThe introduction in 1848 of the gutta percha ball (or\noften called the \"gutty\") did an enormous\namount to restore golf as a genuinely popular game. Gutta\npercha is a gum which is tapped from a tree indigenous to\nMalaya. The substance is malleable when bolied in water\nand it becomes hard on cooling. Soon over time, the\n\"gutty\" became the ball of choice, not so much\nto the greater distance which can be attained with the\n\"gutty\" but rather because of its cheaper\nprice. The process involved in the manufacturing of the\n\"gutty\" was a great deal simplier and its price\nwas about a quarter that of the price of the feathery.\nThe \"gutty\" cost about 1 shilling a ball in\nthe 1850s. It was in this age when golf in Britain became\nmore of a game for everyone. The increased leisure time\ncreated by the prosperity of the Industrial Revolution\nwas another vital ingredient that enabled the sport to\ncatch the imagination of the nation.\n\nGolf balls made\nof gutta-percha were cheaper and more\ndurable, helping dispel golf's image as a\nrich man's past-time.\n\nThis rudimentary\nimplement was used to mound gutta-percha\nballs as of the late 19th century\n\nThe \"gutty\" was prone to break up in\nmid-air, thus forcing the rules to accommodate this\ntendency by allowing the golfer to play a fresh ball from\nthe point where the largest fragment had come to rest.\nThis would be the last occasion on which the Rules of\nGolf had to be amended to legislate for the properties of\nthe golf ball. For the remainder of the 19th century, the\nnew ball was repeatedly modified to make it more durable.\nIts outer shell was indented was a hammer after it was\nobserved that the ball flew better when it has been cut\nor marked than in its smooth pristine state.\n\nThe Rubber Core Ball\n\nThe Haskell ball. It\nhad a heart of tightly wound rubber and suddenly\ncame into demand when Sandy Herd used one to win\nthe 1902 British Open\n\nAs quickly as the gutty came on the scene, it was soon\nsuperseded. In 1901, the rubber-cored ball made its\nBritish debut. It was the invention of the fledgling\nAmerican golf equipment industry. The idea belonged to\nCoburn Haskell, an employee of the Goodrich Tyre and\nRubber Company in Ohio. Elastic thread was wound around a\nrubber core under extreme tension and then encased in a\npatterned outer cover of gutta percha. The Haskell ball\ninitially had its skeptics until in 1902 where people\nwere shown what a difference the ball made to the best\nplayers when Sandy Herd played four rounds at the Royal\nLiverpool course in 307 to beat the great Harry Vardon\nand James Braid by a shot. Herd used the Haskell ball for\nall 72 holes and he was the only man in the field to play\nwith one.\n\nFrom that moment, the Haskell ball has been improved\nto such an effect that it spawned a host of dicta from\nthe R & A and USGA, the dual arbiters of the\nintegrity of the sport. In 1920, they agreed the ball\nshould weigh no more than 1.62 ounces and have a diameter\nof not less than 1.62 inches. From January 1931 however,\nthe USGA turned its back on the collective agreement and\nintroduced the \"big ball\", a ball having a\nminimum size of 1.68 inches and a maximum weight of 1.55\nounces. A year later, they raised the weight stipulation\nto 1.62 ounces. Subsequent attempts to settle for a\nuniform ball of 1.66 inches failed but finally, the USGA\nstandard was also adopted elsewhere. The Professional\nGolfer's Association (PGA) in Great Britian was swayed by\npeople who attributed the American dominance of golf to\ntheir usage of the big ball. It announced in 1968 that it\nwas to experiment with the bigger ball of 1.68 inches in\nits tournaments. Soon it became mandatory. In 1974, the R\n& A made the big ball compulsory for the Open\nChampionship. Under the rule revisions that came into\neffect in 1988, the R & A outlawed the small ball\naltogether.\n\nThe Ball as We Know It\n\nThe modern day balata\nball. It generally was a waterfilled core wrapped\nin rubber yarn.\n\nIn more recent times, the original gutta percha shell\nof the Haskell ball has given way to new and refined\ncompounds. Balata replaced gutta percha in balls for the\nprofessionals and good amateurs while surlyn took over in\nballs for the novices. Millions have since been spent\nresearching the properties of various formations of\ndimples. Many manufacturers have produced balls of new\nstandards but most have been rejected for tournament\nusage. A few years ago, the USGA banned the Polara ball,\nclaiming that it undermined the integrity of the game.\nThe inventors of the ball engaged the USGA in expensive\ncourt proceedings but the prohibition was upheld. Ball\nmanufacturing today is indeed big business. In January\n1993, Spalding announced the launch of its Magna ball. It\nwas a ball of 1.72 inches, larger than stipulated in the\nrules.

{"text":"Archives For\nteeThe 10-Ball Game is step three of a 3-part process to help good practice golfers become better players and competitors. After identifying those situations that cause you difficulty and your physical, emotional, attentional, and behavioral response to them, choose one that you would like to work on. Now follow the process listed below. For this example, we will use hitting to tight fairways.\n\nSimulate the situation as best as you can on the range. Try to find left and right boundaries within which to hit. You might have to just imagine a fairway if your range doesn't have any kind of markings.\n\nHit 10 balls with whatever club you normally hit in this situation. Be sure to use your pre-swing routine and include the selection of an intended target to direct your mental focus and an intermediate target within 2 feet of the front of the ball to align yourself square to your target line.\n\nEvaluate the effectiveness of every shot. Any ball that finishes left or right of your simulated fairway or one that is not struck solidly is deemed not good.\n\nDo not analyze what mechanical errors cause the errant ball flight.\n\nInstead, close your eyes. This helps constrict the pupils and reduces the amount of visual information unconsciously processed by the brain.\n\nTake a slow, deep breath (or more) to relieve any stress. Ninety per cent of all stress hormones can be removed through deliberate, slow, and deep breathing.\n\nSmile. The simple act of smiling releases hormones into the body that reduce stress. You don't have to have a reason to smile.\n\nUsing, your pre-swing routine continue the process until you've hit all ten shots in this simulated condition and then examine the following conditions.\n\nHow well did you hit the first ball? You only get one chance on the course for each tee shot. The better you do on the first ball every time you use the 10-Ball Game to simulate tee shots in practice, the better chance you have when you play.\n\nHow well did you hit the last ball? It's important to recognize that if you hit one bad tee shot while playing does not mean all your tee shots will be bad. The better you hit the last ball well in practice, the better your ability to recover after hitting a bad tee shot while playing.\n\nHow many shots out of ten did you hit well? Hitting 80% of your simulated tee shots well will give you the confidence to hit any tee shot well while playing or competing.\n\nWhen you have improved your performance in simulated conditions you will experience more success while playing. Once you've eliminated one source of distraction address another problem area with the 10-Ball Game. You may find that eliminating one problem area helps you overcome other problem areas quickly.\n\nDo you transform from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde when you take that long walk from the practice tee to the first tee? Many golfers do. Others are able to transfer their practice skills to on-course conditions except when the pressure is on. Hitting more good shots on the range won't necessarily help you play or compete better if you are plagued by internal and external distractions on the course even if you hit every shot perfect on the range. There are two major differences between practice ranges and golf courses that cause attentional and mechanical breakdowns when playing. First, there are physical differences between these two environments. Practice ranges tend to be wide-open fields. Many times there is not a single target with which to develop a target orientation. There is also nothing to distract your attention. In contrast, golf courses are landscaped with streams, lakes, ponds, rivers, trees, bushes, forests, sand bunkers, OB and more. These not only beautify the course, but they distract your mind and trap the ball, especially if you have not developed a strong target orientation. The more these external distractions remain in your attention, the less your focus is directed to your intended target, and the more often your ball will find one of these \"hazards.\"\n\nThe second difference is the consequence of hitting a bad shot. On the range, there is no consequence. All you have to do is put down another ball and re-hit. On the course, every bad shot adds at least one stroke to your score. If score is important \u2013 and it usually is \u2013 then this can create stress and anxiety that internally distract you from your target orientation. Stress and anxiety are instinctive, unconscious, and primitive reactions to threat and fear that trigger the fight-or-flight reflex that helped our earliest human ancestors survive their hostile environment. Unfortunately, this powerful reflex has not evolved since the time of cave men and women and so the potential for mistakes and failure experienced on the golf course will cause the same kind of reaction as if you were being chased by a saber tooth tiger. Your pupils dilate, bringing in more unconscious information into the brain. That makes it more difficult to focus the mind. Eye movement is increased to help you survey the horizon for danger. That makes keeping your eyes still more difficult. Your muscles tense, interfering with the fine motor control necessary to make a good swing. Ignoring, denying, suppressing, or repressing your awareness of your stress response does not result in good performance. You have to learn to inhibit the reflex or reverse it once you become aware of its presence. What better place to learn this but in practice. I have developed a practice strategy that I refer to as the 10-Ball Game to help you alleviate the external distractions and internal demons that turn good practice golfers into poor players. Its part of a 3-step process that improves your on-course performance.\n\nIdentify those situations where you typically make mistakes (i.e., first tee, water hazards, etc).\n\nSimulate on-course conditions at the practice range to develop the skill and instill the confidence necessary to perform as well on the course and in competition as you do in practice. This is where the 10-Ball Game comes in."}

{"text":"More Golf Lessons\n\nOther\n\nGolf Swing Posture Q&A\n\nQuestion: Good Golf Swing Posture?\n\nEASY WAY TO HAVE GOOD POSTURE I AM 6 FEET 3 AND A HALF INCHES, HAVE CLUBS THAT ARE 2 DEGREES UPRIGHT AND HALF INCH LONGER\n\nAnswer:\n\nI love this type of question. This is a great question because it gets to the fundamentals of playing great golf. I know this becomes a broken record but...everyone needs great fundamentals which includes great golf swing posture. In fact everyone can be the best in the world when it comes to grip, stance, posture and alignment.\n\nSince I am a couple of inches taller than this person I can appreciate his question. However, this answer is by no means restricted to the taller player. It is simply a system\/method to get into the proper golf swing posture to hit a good golf shot.\n\nWhat is golf swing posture? Simply put, it is the positions of our body when we address the golf ball. It is how we stand the moment before we hit our shot.\n\nSo what is great golf swing posture? It is creating positions\/angles in our body that allow us to maximize the effectiveness of the turn in our backswing. Great posture also helps us stay in these positions throughout our swing so that we have less moving parts. I am a big believer in eliminating unnecessary movement in the golf swing and great posture is incredibly helpful in attaining this goal.\n\nNow before we start into the routine, let's talk about flexibility. It is fairly common knowledge that flexibility is a big part golf. This does not mean you need the flexibility of a Cirque de Soleil acrobat. However, if you have tight hamstrings, hip flexers and lower back then it can and will hinder your ability to get into a great golf posture.\n\nThe Routine\n\nWhen someone is learning the address position and practicing their golf swing posture I like to teach it from a fully upright position. This is key because of proper weight distribution in the feet and sequencing.\n\nStart by standing straight up without a club. We will add the club later. You will want to stand as tall as possible. Legs and back completely straight and your arms hanging down by your side.\n\nStand so that your weight is even between your feet, both right and left, and front and back.\n\nPlace your hands on your hips with your thumbs pointing to the ground. This a yoga trick to help keep your back straight.\n\nPop your knees out of their locked position. This will give a little flex in the knees, but not so much that your knees end up out past your toes.\n\nNow here is the funny part about a proper golf setup...stick your butt backwards. This does two very important things:\n\nIt helps keep your weight balanced over your entire foot from front to back. Golf is not a game played on our toes or our heels. It needs to be played with even weight distribution. Too much weight front or back and it will throw our balance off during the swing.\n\nIt creates an angle between our legs and our back\/core. This is key because it makes it easier to turn the shoulders on your backswing. It also helps create space for our arms to swing through at impact. If we create a good angle at address, it is easier to maintain during the swing and into impact.\n\nFrom this position let your arms hang freely from your shoulders. They should fall tension free directly below your shoulders.\n\nNow repeat this setup routine many many times. Then take a club and do the same routine, over and over again.\n\nDrills\n\nThere are a few checkpoints you can look at in the mirror. The first is that your shoulders should be over your your knees and your knees should be over your toes. Mirrors are great for golf because they give you instant feedback. You can also take dry-erase markers and mark the mirror with specific points of importance. For instance, get setup properly and then have someone mark your head level, a vertical line marking the back of your butt, a vertical line for your knees and a angled line up your spine. These markers will help you practice your routine so that it becomes a perfect habit. It is also a good idea to leave the points there so you can go back to them whenever you need a posture refresh (usually every 2-3 weeks).\n\nThere is a great way to practice this routine at home to ensure you are getting into the proper golf swing posture position.\n\nStand in a regular size doorway with the door fully open. Place your feet so that you are straddling the opening such that your heels are a few inches from the doorframe behind you.\n\nStand straight up and follow the aforementioned setup routine. The key to the doorframe is that it will give you a point of reference for sticking your butt backwards. It will also keep you from bending at the waist too much and getting you weight out over your toes. If you do you will bump your head on the doorframe.\n\nRemember, no matter how tall you are, you want to feel tall in your setup. If you feel crouched and confined then you will need to review the setup routine to get into a better golf swing posture.\n\nI hope you found this lesson helpful to your game. Good luck with your practicing and playing. I hope you achieve your golf goals sooner."}

You think to yourself how on earth did that happen? You had the game mastered as you walked onto that green whilst tucking your glove into your back pocket, you thought to yourself all I need to do now is to tap this in and I can walk off with a birdie then I will be a few of shots under my handicap!\n\nNot to be denied and full of adrenaline you blast your first attempt so far past the hole that the next putt is almost the same length coming back.

You walk up disgruntled and tap the ball with the back of the putter in the cup for a disappointing 1 pointer.\n\nIf this is you then this drill will certainly help. Pace control with you're putting leads to fewer putts and better scoring. All you will need is your putter, 3 balls and five tees. \u2022 Position yourself on a flat surface on the putting green and place a tee where you will address the ball. \u2022 Step three paces forward then place another tee continuing to place the remaining tees at putter length intervals so they are in a straight line (you should have four tees set-up in a straight line). \u2022 Your goal is to putt 3 balls to each space made by the tees and see how many finish in each section. Test yourself further by putting one ball into each section in a row.\n\nBy following this drill it is a good way to develop feel and rhythm with your stroke so the next time you are faced with that important putt you will know exactly how hard to hit it.\n\nA few bonus points to remember with putting are: \u2022 As you make your practice strokes make them match the speed for the length of the putt, \u2022 Align the club face first then the body second. \u2022 Keep your head steady throughout impact and watch the ball with your eyes as you make the stroke to avoid peaking to early."}
{"text":"February 16 2012\n\n5:47 PM\n\nBalance is a quality\nassociated with the execution of a proficient golf swing. It is a\nword often referred to during instruction on the golf swing and\n\"maintaining ones balance\" is a key phrase often\ncommunicated during the observation of skilled golf swing.\n\nThat being said, we are\nalso aware of common swing faults such as a sway in the backswing,\na slide in the downswing, or a loss of posture as potentially being\nconnected to poor balance. As a result of all of this information\nwe recognize the importance balance plays in the execution of the\ngolf swing.\n\nTo understand how the\ngolfer can improve one's balance capacities we must first\nrecognize the definition of this component of the golf swing.\nBalance is the ability of the neuromuscular system (nervous and\nmuscular systems) to maintain the proper alignment, center of\ngravity, and coordinate the body during movement. (Michael Clark,\nIntegrated Training for the New Millennium, 123)\n\nThroughout the entire\ngolf swing, it is necessary for the golfer to maintain the proper\nspine angle, create a weight transfer, and coordinate muscular\nmovements. To perform this properly, the golfer must be able to\nmaintain balance of the body as a unit and control the extremities\n(i.e. arm and legs).\n\nThe golfer must also\nrecognize balance within the swing is a responsibility of both the\nbody and the mechanics of your swing. Improvement within your\nbalance capacities of the \"physical side of this\nequation\" will allow your body the ability to maintain the\nanatomical positions, coordinate movement, and create a weight\ntransfer within the golf swing more efficiently and\neffectively.\n\nThe process by which we\ncan improve the golfer's balance capacities is via\nspecialized exercises which challenge both the nervous and muscular\nsystems. These types of exercises over time improve the efficiency\nby which the nervous system operates, increases the stabilization\ncapacities of the muscular system, and the proficiency by which\nthese two systems (nervous & muscular) coordinate movement.\n\nThe exercise\n\nAn example of such an\nexercise that is very cross specific to the golf swing is Single\nLeg Address Position Rotations. To perform this golf-specific\nbalance exercise place the body in a proper address position, knees\nslightly bent, fixed spine angle, and arms crossed over your\nchest.\n\nRaise the right foot slightly off the\nfloor while maintaining your address position and fixed spine\nangle. Begin to slowly rotate your shoulders to the right to the\npoint of a complete shoulder turn. Return to the starting position\nof the exercise and repeat for 10-15 repetitions maintaining\nbalance on the left foot. Repeat the exercise by balancing on the\nright foot.\n\nFebruary 9 2012\n\n3:09 PM\n\nBy Sean Cochran, Golf Fitness Flexibility is a\n\"buzzword\" in golf fitness these days and rightfully\nso. We invariably understand to make a full shoulder turn, initiate\nthe downswing with the lower body, and maintain a balanced finish\nposition muscular flexibility and joint mobility are needed. If the\ngolfer is lacking flexibility, the ability to perform each phase of\nthe swing with the greatest amount of efficiency possible will most\nlikely be impeded, and unfortunately these impedances limit\nshoulder turns, reduce the opportunity to generate club head speed,\nand can easily lead to the development of swing faults. Knowing\nthis information, it only makes sense for golfers to implement\nflexibility training into our golf swing improvement program. Such\na program with a minimal amount of time on a consistent basis can\ngo a long way in improving the golf swing. There are a couple of\npoints we need to keep in mind as it pertains to flexibility\ntraining for golf. First, we need to know what muscles need to be\nflexible and which joints require mobility too execute the golf\nswing and second, what are the best types of flexibility\ntraining\/exercises for golf.\nIn the most basic\nof terms the muscles surrounding the ankle, hips, thoracic spine\n(middle of back between the shoulder blades), and shoulder must be\nflexible to allow their corresponding joints to move through the\nrequired ranges of motion during the execution of the golf swing.\nFlexibility training for golf requires the utilization of a number\nof different types of exercise modalities beyond static stretching.\nStatic stretching where we hold a \"stretch\" for 30\nseconds is important and should be included in such a program but\nwe also need to perform dynamic flexibility training focused upon\nmoving joints of the body through ranges of motion and myofascial\nrelease exercises to remove the \"kinks\" out of muscles.\nThis type of program set up addresses all the requirements of\nflexibility as it pertains to the golf swing.\nThe move To give you an example of a range of\nmotion flexibility exercise beneficial to golf and focusing on hip\nmobility is Windshield Wipers (\npictured above). To perform this exercise place yourself\non the floor, back flat, knees bent at 90 degrees, hands between\nboth knees, feet together, and head resting on the floor. Slowly\nseparate your feet keeping the knees in place and bent at 90\ndegrees. Create the separation of the feet through rotation at the\nhip joint. Separate the feet as far as possible apart while keeping\nthe knees and hands in contact with one another. Return to the\nstarting position and repeat for the 10-15 repetitions.\nTo learn more about Sean Cochran and his golf fitness training\nexercises and programs go to\n\n\nFebruary 2 2012\n\n3:10 PM\n\nResearch provided by the American Sports Medicine Institute\nindicates one out of every two golfers will incur a lower back\ninjury due to golf at some point during their playing careers.\nEmpirical evidence indicates the reasons behind this high incidence\nof injury to lower back center upon physical limitations and\ninefficient swing mechanics. Studies suggest the shear forces\nplaced upon the lower back increase exponentially when the\nbiomechanics of the swing are inefficient and require the golfer to\ncreate compensations within the phases in the swing. These\ncompensations result in what is termed repetitive movement trauma,\nand over time this type of trauma can cause injury to the body.\nSecondly execution of an efficient golf swing where stress is\nminimized on the body requires certain levels of joint mobility,\nflexibility and muscular strength. If the body is lacking in any of\nthese aforementioned physical components, the ability to execute a\nbiomechanically efficient swing will most likely be limited. This\ntype of situation will again lead to the development of\ncompensations thus causing the body to be stressed at high levels\nwhich again can lead to injury. The processes by which the golfer\ncan assist in the prevention of injury are two-fold. Improving the\nefficiency by which the golf swing is executed will reduce the\namount of stress placed upon the body. This is achieved via proper\ninstruction from a qualified instructor and practice. Secondly, the\nintroduction of exercises to improve one's levels of joint\nmobility, flexibility, and muscular strength to develop a physical\nfoundation within the golfer's body to execute a proficient\ngolf swing. This type of training can eliminate the physical\ndysfunctions impeding ones golf swing and reduce the potential for\ninjury.\n\nJanuary 17 2012\n\n8:27 PM\n\nThe golf swing in the\nmost basic of terms is a rotary athletic action where the body\nrotates around an imaginary axis (i.e. fixed spine angle) during\nthe backswing, downswing, and into the impact position. One of the\ngoals during the execution of this rotary action is the generation\nof speed. The process by which speed is generated is contingent\nupon the efficiency by which the mechanics of the swing are\nexecuted, equipment, and the body.\n\nLooking at the\n\"physical side\" of the rotary speed equation, three\nphysical parameters must be present in order to generate maximum\nspeed. These three physical elements are mobility, segmental\nstability, and power.\n\nMobility is the ability\nof a joint to move through its' intended range of motion. If\nlimitations exist in terms of one's joint ranges of motion,\nthe ability to rotate around a fixed spine angle will most likely\nbe limited.\n\nSegmental stability is\nthe capacity of the neuromuscular system to remain unchanged in\nterms of alignment and positioning during functional movement\npatterns. Segmental stability is based upon muscular strength and\nis a key in the ability of the golfer to create an X-Factor.\n\nPower is the ability of\nthe neuromuscular system to generate the greatest amount of force\nin a short amount of time. The more power which can be developed by\nthe body during the swing results in the opportunity for increases\nin clubhead speed. So it is a great attribute for any golfer to\ndevelop the power components of the body.\n\nIn order to increase the\npower outputs of your muscles, it is necessary to implement\nspecialized exercises. These types of exercises, commonly referred\nto as plyometrics. These types of exercises enhance the ability of\nyour neuromuscular system to develop power, which in turn, as\nstated above, will enhance the amount of speed generated in the\ngolf swing.\n\nAn ideal golf fitness\nexercise addressing both the strength and power components of the\nswing is TRX Rip Trainer Rotations. The execution of this exercise\ndevelops both the rotary stability and speed components of the\nkinetic chain (i.e. body).\n\nTo perform Rip Trainer\nRotations (see image above) anchor the resistance cord at hip\nheight and grasp the lever bar with both hands shoulder width apart\nand palms facing down. Step 4-6 feet away from the anchor to create\ntension. Position the feet slightly wider than shoulder width\napart, knees bent, and torso upright. Allow the lever bar to shift\nto the side of your body when stepping away from the anchor\npoint.\n\nExecute the exercise by forcefully\nrotating the hips and shoulders in the opposite direction of the\nanchor position. Continue to rotate the hips and torso until the\nshoulders are completely rotated in the opposite direction, and\nyour hands are on the opposite side of your body. Return to the\nstarting position and repeat for 10-15 repetitions. Perform the\nexercise sequence in the opposite direction.\n\nJanuary 13 2012\n\n3:25 PM\n\nEditor's note: In 2012, Sean Cochran will be writing a\nGolf Fitness blog in the TOUR Report. This is the second\ninstallment\n\nA common question in the\nfield of golf fitness is what constitutes a proper warm up prior to\na practice session or round of golf?\n\nUnseen by the general\npublic, the PGA TOUR player implements a pre-round warm-up program\nconsisting of a number of differing exercise modalities to prepare\nthe body to execute an efficient golf swing. Keep in mind the\nexecution of a proficient swing requires coordination of the entire\nkinetic chain (i.e. body) to sequence each segment of the golf\nswing correctly. In order for this to occur: the joints of the body\nmust be mobile, the nervous system must be firing at a high rate of\nefficiency, and the muscles of the body need to be contracting and\nrelaxing efficiently. These physical requirements cannot occur with\na few swings of the club and ultimately require what is termed a\n\"functional warm-up\" for the entire body.\n\nA functional warm-up is\nvery different than what many individuals believe to be a proper\nwarm up. Often times a warm up is viewed as just a couple of\nstretches for the \"tight\" muscles of the body. A\nfunctional warm-up may incorporate flexibility exercises, but goes\nwell beyond this idea of just \"stretching\". A\nfunctional warm-up consists of a series of exercises too; increase\nthe pliability of the muscular system, improve mobility in the\njoints of the body, amplify firing rates of the nervous system, and\nincrease the contractile properties of the muscular system.\n\nA comprehensive\nfunctional warm-up can be accomplished within 5-10 minutes in the\nclubhouse or at the range. A very effective functional warm-up for\nthe amateur player could include the following\nexercises:\n\n1. Bent Knee Side-to-Side Leg Swings 2.\nStraight Leg Side-to-side Leg Swings 3. Straight Leg Swings Forward\nBack 4. Windshield Wipes 5. Kneeling Club Rotations 6. Stork Turns\n7. Torso Backswings A functional warm-up can go a long way in\npreventing the possibility of injury, preparing the body to execute\nof proficient swing, and getting yourself ready for success on the\nfirst tee.\nTo learn more about Sean Cochran and his golf fitness training\nexercises and programs go to\n\nJanuary 5 2012\n\n2:44 PM\n\nEditor's note: In 2012, Sean Cochran will be writing a\nGolf Fitness blog in the TOUR Report. This is the first\ninstallment.\n\nThe X-Factor is a reference to the separation between the upper\nand lower body in the backswing. The separation between these two\nsegments of the body creates what is referred to as an\n\"X-Factor Stretch\" which becomes a major source of\npower in the golf swing.\n\nUnfortunately for many golfers the creation of this separation\nis difficult, thus creating a \"power leak\" within the\nswing. One of the common issues behind difficulties in the\ndevelopment of the X-Factor is physical limitations. The physical\ndysfunctions often associated with an inability to create\nseparation within the golf swing are limited hip mobility, poor\nsegmental stability of the core and deficiencies in thoracic spine\nmobility.\n\nThe implementation of corrective exercises to remove the\naforementioned physical dysfunctions can be very beneficial in the\ndevelopment of one's X-Factor. An ideal golf fitness exercise\nto address these issues is Torso Backswings. This golf fitness\nexercise develops the ability of the golfer to dynamically separate\nthe upper and lower body while maintaining a fixed spine angle.\n\nTo perform Torso Backswings stand in your 5-iron golf posture\nwith the arms crossed in front of the torso. Begin rotating the\nshoulders to the top of your backswing while resisting the turn\nwith the hips. Continue to the rotate the shoulders as far as\npossible without a change in your posture. Pause for one second,\nreturn to the starting position of the exercise and repeat for\n10-15 repetitions."}

{"text":"David,Are you saying that a dvierr should be hit with 4 degrees of shaft lean or hit with 4 a degree down angle of attack? Unfortunately, the golfer has the option of doing many things effectively or ineffectively. Whatever they choose to do will create some shape of a D Plane. However, all else being equal, the more down the angle of attack the more to the right the actual 3d direction of the club at impact. The clubs don't make the angle of attack but certainly encourage one based on vertical swing plane and ball position. It's the reason that many people over draw their punch shots. They return the face to the same place as normal but hit down on the ball more, which pushes the actual path more right than their normal shot, so they end up with a\/more draw.Basically, the more the ball is hit with a downward strike the more down and to the right the bottom vector of the d plane will point, relative to the direction of the swing. The clubface normal, or 3d direction of the clubface is pretty easy to understand because it basically is determined by looking at the face with a . It's the bottom vector that can be the most difficult to conceptualize. It is determined by the Vertical Swing Plane, Angle of Attack and Horizontal Swing Plane(all trackman terms). The combination of these three things will determine the actual 3d direction of the club's path. It's this path that is the bottom vector direction.One of the main important points is that in order to hit a straight shot at the target with an iron, the golfer needs to have a . That way when the ball is hit on the way down, that direction(hitting down produces a 3d path to the right of the plane line) combined with a clubface at the target can produce an actual straight shot from a centered hit.The opposite would be true for a player hitting up on their dvierr. Swing to the right so 3d path is left at target.Hope this answers your question.

{"text":"By SwingFix.com staff\n\nThere's no question that fitness is a huge piece of the puzzle when it comes to playing good golf.\n\nBeing able to make a powerful, effective golf swing will require some cooperation from your body, and it's imperative that you're capable of making the necessary movements, especially if you're trying to incorporate swing changes.\n\nMany golfers, however, have no idea that their fitness level might be adversely affecting their ability to swing the club and how it can lead to significant swing flaws.\n\nAlong those lines, we want to help you out, so we enlisted the help of SwingFix instructors and fitness gurus Jim Williams and Karen Palacios-Jansen to show you how some of the common swing flaws that we see in so many videos that are submitted can actually be fitness-related.\n\nOn each Wednesday for the next six weeks here on The Weekly Fix, we'll roll out a new installment of \"Workout Wednesday\" to help you improve your game.\n\nWe'll show you the most common swing flaws, break down why from a fitness standpoint people have these issues and offer some some great exercises that you can do to eliminate these problems.\n\nIt all starts today, as we take a look at a common set-up problem, that being C-Posture. And good posture is a crucial part of making a good golf swing, especially as it relates to making a good turn away from the ball.\n\nEnjoy the first installment of our new series and check back in the weeks ahead to get in shape and fix your game!"}
{"text":"November 4, 2010\n\nFor years, I've struggled trying to work the ball as the golf instruction books all describe. I've just learned that the bulk of the golf instruction books are wrong on how to work the ball. No wonder I've been struggling to correct my swing, both on the range and on the course. I'm not athletically incompetent, I'm physics challenged.\n\nFor decades, the PGA Teaching Manual has contained some incorrect information pertaining to a golf ball's flight. That information can be summed up as follows: \"The golf ball starts on the direction of the swing path and curves back to where the clubface was aimed at impact.\"\n\nPut another way, the Manual has stated that the swing path is the primary, over-riding determinant in the golf ball's initial starting direction. This information is wrong. It's been updated (slightly) within recent years, yet many golfers \u2013 famous or otherwise \u2013 and instructors \u2013 famous or otherwise \u2013 still believe it.\n\nJust shoot me. Initial ball flight is determined by the club face angle relative to the target line.\n\nI've spent 5 years, more or less, trying to learn to swing the golf club, only to learn today that I've been correcting my ball flight based on faulty knowledge that the initial direction of the ball is determined by the swing path. I'm having difficulty getting my head around all this, so I had to figure out how to explain it to myself. Here's what I came up with as an explanation. Warning, there's a little simple math involved here.\n\nSo, as we all know, a square clubface with a inside-to-square-to-inside swing path produces a straight shot. A push is produced by a swing that is inside-to-outside with the clubface square to the swing path at impact. A pull is produced by a swing that is outside-to-inside with a clubface that is square to the swing path at impact. Nothing has changed here.\n\nDraw spin is produced when the clubface angle is closed with respect to the swing path. Fade spin is produced when the clubface is open with respect to the swing path. Nothing has changed here.\n\nA draw is a golf shot that starts straight but curves left (for a right handed golfer). A fade is a golf shot that starts straight but curves right (again, for a right handed golfer \u2014 I'll assume a right-handed golfer from here on out). A push fade is a shot that starts right and also curves right; a push draw is a shot that starts right but curves left. Equivalently, a pull fade is a shot that starts left but curves right, and a pull draw is a shot that starts left and curves left. The way these shots are produced is different than I was taught, and probably how you've been taught as well. Let's delve deeper.\n\nLet's call the clubface angle relative to the target line alpha \u0251. If the clubface is square to the target line at impact, then \u0251 = 90\u00b0. Because we now know that the initial path of the ball is determined the the angle of the clubface at impact, the ball goes straight when \u0251 = 90\u00b0. When \u0251 > 90\u00b0, the ball starts left (pulls) and when \u0251 < 90\u00b0, the ball starts right (pushes).\n\nLet's call the clubface angle relative to the swing path beta \u03b2. If the ball goes straight, then there is no draw or fade spin, so the clubface is square, or \u03b2 = 90\u00b0. If the ball draws, the clubface is closed relative to the swing path, and \u03b2 < 90\u00b0; conversely, if the ball fades, then the clubface is open relative to the swing path and \u03b2 > 90\u00b0.\n\nThe next diagram shows how the ball reacts when the clubface is square at the point of impact. The ball's initial ball flight will be straight. If the swing path angle is less than 90\u00b0, then this produces draw spin and the ball draws away from the target line. Conversely, if the swing path is greater than 90\u00b0, then the ball has a fade spin and the ball fades away from the target line.\n\nThe diagram below shows the effect of a closed clubface at impact. The initial ball flight is a pull. If the swing path angle is less than 90\u00b0, then the shot becomes a pull draw; if the swing path angle is aligned with the clubface, the shot is a pull, and if the swing path angle is greater than 90\u00b0, then the shot is a pull fade.\n\nThe last diagram shows the effect of an open clubface at impact. The initial ball flight is a push. If the swing path angle is less than 90\u00b0, then the shot is a push draw. If the swing path angle is aligned with the clubface, the shot is a push, and if the swing path angle is greater than 90\u00b0, then the shot is a push fade.\n\nNow, we can build a little table to determine why your ball flew the way it did. This will also guide us in figuring out how to hit the shot we want. And this time, have it actually work, because what I was doing before based on multiple golf instruction manuals, was wrong.\n\nHere's the table.\n\n\u03b2 < 90\u00b0\n\n\u03b2 = 90\u00b0\n\n\u03b2 > 90\u00b0\n\n\u0251 < 90\u00b0\n\npush draw\n\npush\n\npush fade\n\n\u0251 = 90\u00b0\n\ndraw\n\nstraight\n\nfade\n\n\u0251 > 90\u00b0\n\npull draw\n\npull\n\npull fade\n\nOK, that's the table. How do we use it? That's a topic for another post (coming soon).\n\nOctober 17, 2010\n\nI've been playing the Tom Wishon Golf Technology 770CFE irons for a couple of years now, but I've lost a bit of distance. So, to get it back, and save some wear and tear on my right shoulder and elbow, I've built a new set of irons with graphite shafts. I used the TWGT 870Ti clubheads, TWGT S2S Gold Tour Flight shafts, and TWGT V-series midsize grips. I built the clubs with ascending swingweight to approximate MOI matching. The 5-iron was built to a length of 38.75\u2033 and a swingweight of D-4. The increment in length for the irons was 3\/8\u2033 with a 0.5 swingweight points added as the clubs got shorter.\n\nMy TWGT 919THI driver I've been using for a while had gotten beat up and ugly from some bad swings, so I built a new one to match with the 959OL driver I use for recreational rounds (same shaft, swingweight, length and loft). I used the TWGT S2S Black 65 shaft and Golf Pride Dual Duometer midsize grip. I built it to a length of 44.5\u2033 and a swingweight of D-1.\n\nA few weeks back, I lost my sand wedge, so I took the opportunity to build new wedges as well. The CX Micro wedges are discontinued, but I bought several sets as it is the best wedge I've played and see no reason to switch to anything else. I used the TWGT CX Micro wedge heads, Rifle Spinner shafts and Golf Pride New Decade Multicompound midsize grips. I built them to match the 870Ti AW, 36.5\u2033 length and D-7.5 swingweight.\n\nI've practiced with the clubs, and they all work as expected, as long as I put a good swing on the clubs. There's the rub\u2026 Anyway, I'm playing 18 with the clubs for the first time today.\n\nYani Tseng was as amazed as anyone during Michelle Wie's torrid stretch early in the weekend, when Wie shot a 28 for nine holes to take command at the Northwest Arkansas Championship.\n\nJust over 24 hours later, Tseng was the tournament's champion \u2013 after rallying to beat Wie by a stroke.\n\n\"She's just so good,\" Tseng said. \"I just really play, one shot at a time, but if I don't make lots of birdies today, I couldn't win.\"\n\nTseng made four birdies in a crucial five-hole stretch on the back nine en route to a 6-under 65 on Sunday that gave her a third LPGA Tour victory of the year. Tseng, from Taiwan, held off Wie when both players made birdies on No. 18.\n\nMichelle Wie, the 20-year-old former prodigy finally playing to her potential, versus Juli Inkster, the 50-year-old Hall of Famer hoping to become the oldest player to win on the tour.\n\n\"It's going to be like Beauty and the Beast out there,\" Inkster said. \"I don't have the pretty swing or whatever. I just try to get the ball in the hole.\"\n\nThe stage is set for a fantastic finish Sunday at the Northwest Arkansas Championship. Wie shot a 7-under 64 on Saturday \u2014 playing her first nine holes in 7-under 28 \u2014 to take a three-stroke lead over Inkster (66), Yani Tseng (68) and Na Yeon Choi (68). Tseng, a two-time major winner this year, also will be in the final group.\n\nSeptember 10, 2010\n\nAugust 30, 2010\n\nI built a new driver late last week, a Tom Wishon Golf Technology 959OL driver. I had the clubhead hand-picked for 10.5\u00b0 loft with a square clubface. I used the S2S Swing to Shaft fitting system to select the shaft; for me, that turned out to be the S2S Black 65 shaft in S-flex. I used a V Series Oversize grip with 3 wraps of tape, and swingweighted the club to D-1 to match my fairway woods.\n\nThis club has a 0.90 coefficient of restitution, thus does not meet USGA regulations. I'll only use this club for recreational rounds; it won't be in my bag for tournaments. As you can see in the photo below, this clubhead is designed for swing speeds that don't exceed 100 mph.\n\nI'm playing Cowboys Golf Club tomorrow with my usual golf buddies. A full report to follow. I've not yet stuck golf balls with the club."}

So you need to learn BUNKER DISTANCE CONTROL\n\nThis lesson is to help you adjust to the different length shots you will face from the bunkers. You need creativity and touch. We can all get better touch through practice and experience. Please use this lesson to help you develop your 'touch' so that you can hit\nshots of varying lengths. Getting the ball close to the hole so that you only have a short putt is the key to making your 'sandy' and saving a shot on your scorecard.\n\nStep One \u2013 Address\n\nA couple of keys:\nOpen stance.\nOpen club face.\nBall position in line with your left instep (right handed players)\nWeight leaning onto left foot.\n\nStep Two \u2013 The Backswing\n\nFor the most part your backswing for all your golf bunker shots does not change. You always want to take your club back to the set swing position.\nYour left arm should be parallel to the ground.\nYour club should be pointing to the sky. Your arm and club should form an 'L'.\nIt may seem strange that your backswing does not change. All the other short game shots you play, the distance you hit your shots is dictated by the length of your backswing.\nNow the distance you hit your sand shot is going to be dictated by the length of your follow through.\n\nThere is no specific range in which you should use each technique. It will take practice and experience to determine what distance you hit shots for each follow through position. It is up to you to figure which length follow through works best for you.\n\nUse the following simple guidelines to help you determine your own distances:\nShort bunker shot: small follow-through, turning chest into shot\nMedium length shot: medium follow-through, more chest turn into shot\nLong bunker shot: full finish with hands over left shoulder and full chest turn into shot\n\nExperiment and find YOUR swing that gets it close. Pay attention to your follow-through and see how far the ball carries and rolls. Learning this technique will improve your bunker play and those dreaded shots will become fun shots! Once you learn to get it close\u2026now experiment with getting it IN!\n\nRon,\nTo answer your question, I have seen my students vary their backswings for distance control but tend to decelerate as they approach the ball, causing very inconsistent results...even having to play another bunker shot next! Physics would say, yes, to your question...but the follow through has to vary also. But by all means, try it and see what works for you. I just find it easier to be consistent in your distance control with the same backswing and vary the followthough. This method promotes acceleration through the shot versus deceleration, which is disastrous in playing bunker shots.\n."}

Until that time, anchoring remains legal.)\n\nTo effectively use the belly putter you must select one that is fitted to your physique. It must have the correct length and lie angle to allow you to take a comfortable stance and get your eyes just over the inside edge of the ball. Below and on the following pages are some simple steps for fitting yourself for a belly putter.\n\nWhat You'll Need\nFor this do-it-yourself belly putter fitting, you'll need the help of a friend, plus a small mirror, your current putter, a ruler and a protractor or goniometer.\n\nWhat To Do\n1. Lay a mirror on the ground and use its center to represent the ball.\n\n2. Measure the length of your current putter (mine is 33 inches).\n\n3. Holding your putter and the ruler, bend your elbows slightly, and set them against either side of your rib cage (left photo above).\n\n4. Bow forward from the hips and take a comfortable putting stance with your knees slightly flexed and your forearms in line with the putter shaft (right photo above). When you are in the correct posture, your hands should hang under your shoulders.\n\n5. Maintain your posture and adjust distance from the mirror so your eyes appear in the middle."}
{"text":"Maintenance Information\n\nNews:\n\nThe following is an article written by James Francis Moore that appeared in the USGA's November-December Edition of the \"Greens Section Record.\" Please take a moment to read through it.\n\nFor the purpose of this article, consider the following definitions of good players and good golfers. Good players have low handicaps, usually hit the ball a mile, and occasionally post very low scores. Good golfers fill divots, repair ball marks, and practice good etiquette each and every time they are on the course. Anyone who has ever worked in golf course maintenance will verify that, unfortunately, the two terms are not mutually inclusive. In fact, good players often are the least likely to be considerate of the games of lesser mortals. This is not to say that all good players are bad golfers. In fact, practicing good etiquette on the course seems to be slipping across the board, regardless of handicap. And the timing could not be worse. All but the wealthiest courses are finding it harder to make a profit these days, with large cost increases in fuel, fertilizer, and labor. Since labor almost always represents the largest budget item, it typically is the first to be targeted when budget reductions are necessary. When forced to choose, most courses with reduced available labor place a higher priority on agronomic necessities than the niceties of completing tasks that good golfers normally do for themselves. Unless we can somehow encourage players to become better golfers, the overall quality of many courses will decline rapidly during tough economic times. For those who wish to become better golfers, here are the ways you can help your course the most.\n\nFILLING DIVOTS Golfers often ask if they should replace their divots, fill them with whatever has been provided in the divot buckets, or just leave them for the crew. The best option is to fill the divot with the material provided by the maintenance staff. Typically, this is straight sand, although occasionally a sand\/seed mixture is used by courses using cool-season turfgrasses. Replacing a divot is the second-best option, assuming the divot is deep enough to include a significant amount of soil. Without the soil, the divot quickly dries out and is pulled back out of the ground during the next mowing. Do \u2014 Fill divot holes with the material provided by the maintenance staff. Don't \u2014 Overfill the hole, which results in a sand mound that can dull or damage the mowing units.\n\nBALL MARKS Few aspects of etiquette generate more discussion than the fixing of ball marks (at least now that most courses no longer allow spiked shoes), and even superintendents disagree on the best method of ball mark repair. The inability to agree on a single best method stems from the fact that ball marks are not all the same. On soft greens, a shot that descends from a very steep angle produces a deep, almost circular ball mark. On the same green, a shot that comes in low and hard will produce an elongated tearing of the green, and it often removes a plug of grass and soil. Ball marks on soft greens take time to repair properly. Compacted soil needs to be lifted gently, and the raised sides of the ball mark need to be gently pushed back toward the center. The elongated mark needs to be kneaded back together by pushing in from the sides, stretching the turf rather than tearing it. Replacing removed turf seldom accomplishes much, so it is best to leave it out. In contrast, very firm greens can resist ball marks so well that they can be hard to find at all. On such greens the marks will be slight indentations that require a minimum of effort to repair. These marks can be repaired with a very slight lifting to restore smoothness. Do \u2014 Restore surface smoothness by gently pushing from the sides and, in some cases, gently lifting the compressed area. Don't \u2014 Aggressively twist (as is so often done by pros on national television), which does more harm than good.\n\nBUNKERS Among the first rules of etiquette taught to young players are to rake the bunker smooth of footprints and repair divots after a shot. Unfortunately, either through laziness or disdain, many players refuse to extend this courtesy to their fellow golfers. Shoving sand around with your foot or a clubhead is no substitute for raking. However, for those who are willing to rake, it is important to do the job correctly. Avoid pulling sand down the bunker face when raking. Doing so results in very shallow sand on the face, leading to exposed soil, which is easily eroded. Also, many bunkers are constructed with liners or lining material installed on the slopes to reduce the problems of sand erosion. These liners should always be covered with at least 2 to 3 inches of sand. It is equally important to avoid pulling sand out of the bunker and onto the adjacent turf. Piles of sand around the bunker edges can cause serious damage to mowing equipment. Sand raked out of the bunker will also result in a poorly defined bunker edge, making it difficult to determine whether the ball is in or out of the hazard. Although most players are concerned only with how the ball got into the bunker and how they are going to get it out, good golfers know that it is important to consider how to get themselves in and out of the bunker as well. Climbing in and out of the steep side of a bunker can cause significant damage to liners and the sod on the bunker face. Entry and exit should always be from the low side. Do \u2014 Push sand up the bunker face and enter and exit from the low side of the bunker. Don't \u2014 Climb out of the high side of the bunker, which causes damage to liners and grass faces.\n\nCARTS Nothing causes more damage to golf courses than the improper use of golf carts. Superintendents expend many labor hours repairing this damage and trying to prevent it in the first place. The problems are many, and most could easily be prevented with common sense. One of the most common is players driving their carts on the banks of tees and the banks and approaches of greens. Driving too close to the greens is particularly troublesome, since the wear and tear on the turf in this area directly affects playing quality. These areas are frequently irrigated and therefore more susceptible to damage. Ropes, signs, and painted lines are all too frequently ignored by players who are too lazy to walk from the path to the green. Unthinking cart drivers frequently pull two wheels off the path, presumably to make room for other carts to pass. Since they invariably do this next to greens and tees, it is no coincidence that ruts are commonplace in these areas immediately adjacent to the path. Although this is a great practice if you have a fl at on the highway, it is unnecessary on the golf course. Seldom will someone need to pass a parked cart. Should a marshal, drink cart, or maintenance vehicle need to get by, they can easily pull off the path and around the parked cart. Do \u2014 Avoid wet areas, stay off green and tee banks, and follow all directional signs, ropes, and lines. Don't \u2014 Pull half off the path, as it is unnecessary and causes damage to high-visibility areas.\n\nROPES Ropes are a necessary evil on every course that receives heavy play. No superintendent enjoys putting ropes up. They are constant maintenance headaches. Unfortunately, they are the most effective means of directing cart traffic and protecting areas of the course that are prone to damage. Many golfers step on the ropes rather than over them \u2014 presumably in an effort not to trip. Unfortunately, this practice pulls out the stakes that the ropes are attached to, leaving the rope lying on the ground. Someone on the maintenance staff then needs to fix the stakes and retighten the rope. Do \u2014 Pay attention to ropes and the areas they are intended to protect. Don't \u2014 Step on a rope \u2014 step over it.\n\nSMALL THINGS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE There are many other small things golfers can do to help their course play and look better, and in the process free up the maintenance staff for more essential work. \u2022 Picking up broken tees helps prevent damage to costly mower reels. \u2022 Not overfilling trash containers prevents trash from blowing across the course. \u2022 Replacing a sign or rope stake that has been knocked down keeps the course looking neat and helps prevent damage. \u2022 If an irrigation system leak is spotted, let a maintenance staff worker know about it so it can be fixed before turf damage occurs from traffic through the area. \u2022 Lose the herd mentality when driving your cart \u2014 avoid following the same path of the carts before you. \u2022 Avoid taking divots on your practice swings. \u2022 Chip to the chipping green \u2014 not the practice putting green. \u2022 When practicing putting, avoid standing in one place for extended periods \u2014 doing so can cause damage to the green. \u2022 Put bunker rakes where the superintendent has directed them to be placed.\n\nCONCLUSION Part of the inspiration for this article stems from a group of men with whom I am fortunate enough to play golf regularly. Not only are these men good players, they are outstanding golfers. It is a real pleasure to watch them work their way around the course during a round. They don't just avoid damaging the course; they improve it in the process of enjoying their round! They leave the course better than they found it. And contrary to what you might think, none of this results in slow play. Imagine your course receiving 30,000 rounds per year from golfers like these fellows.\n\nJIM MOORE is director of the USGA Green Section's Construction Education Program.

The grass of choice to resurface the greens was CHAMPION Dwarf Bermudagrass and was planted using a No-Till\u2122 Renovation.\n\nHere are some of the characteristics of CHAMPION Dwarf Bermudagrass:\n\nCHAMPION has twice the density of other Ultradwarfs, and has better density than most bentgrasses at lower mowing heights. CHAMPION maintains very high density even in partial shade. It tends to outperform other Ultradwarfs on shaded greens. CHAMPION maintains very high density at the lowest mowing heights that gives it exceptional wear tolerance.\n\nCHAMPION makes a profusion of lateral stems that provides very rapid recovery from injury, even at the lowest mowing heights. This is a critically important characteristic which distinguishes CHAMPION from other Ultradwarf bermudas. CHAMPION's growth habit is primarily horizontal with very slow vertical growth that gives a more consistent putting surface."}

Arguably the most popular figure in all of sports went through a divorce, lost sponsorships, and went on the longest winless streak of his career.\n\n2012 has been a good year on the course for Tiger. Three wins and 8 top-10 finishes in just 18 events played has him sitting 2nd in the Fed-Ex Cup Standings with just one tournament to go.

{"text":"Is your pre-shot routine helping your golf game?\n\nA mental and physical routine is used in every sport to prepare the athlete for his\/her performance. A consistent pre-shot routine keeps the golfer engrossed in the moment and his\/her thoughts away from self imposed pressure. It is a signal to the unconscious mind to get ready to perform.\n\nGymnasts, ice skaters or divers perform intricate maneuvers of their bodies in mid air. They do not have time to think about what they are doing. What they do have is a strategy to activate those maneuvers that they have practiced.\n\nAthletes train their minds and bodies to do the same thing in sequence over and over until it becomes a habit. They then activate the sequence by a trigger to start the process.\n\nBasketball players bounce the ball on the foul line. Tennis players bounce the ball before serving. Baseball pitchers go through the same \"touching\" ritual every time they throw a pitch \u2013 first the cap, then the shirt, and finally a shrug of the shoulders.\n\nThese \"routines\" are the maps that give direction to your brain about what you want to do. Successful golfers go through the same consistent routine before every shot so their unconscious mind has specific instructions to move the body.\n\nWhen you \"lose your swing\" on the golf course, you need to go back to the routine because you have deviated from your map and are going in a different direction and getting a different result. Some of these deviations could be fear thoughts of avoiding hazards, fear of embarrassment, fear of failure, frustration at slow play, annoyances with other players, weather conditions and anxiety about your performance or your score. This is the time to narrow your focus by concentrating on your preparation routine.\n\nI like to think of the pre-shot routine as a dance that moves you from behind the ball to the place over the ball where you are eager to swing.

{"text":"Rory McIlroy Hits Some Loser In The Head With A Golf Ball\n\nRory McIlroy is some kind of golfer I guess. I don't really follow golf \u2013 I like playing crazy golf but that's about it \u2013 but I've heard the name Rory McIlroy before so I guess he must be a good golfer or something. Or at least well known in the golfing community or something.\n\nAnyway apparently there's some big golf tournament on and Rory McIlroy is playing in it. That's probably really exciting if you're really into golf and\/or Rory McIlroy and like spending your weekends sitting around watching it on a couch like a bunch of my friends who might as well be semi-retired who do that all the fucking time. It's boring. I never go when they invite me so they stopped inviting me. In fact we don't even really hang out that much more.\n\nBut I kind of wish I had been there for this one. Rory McIlroy pings a golf ball into the crowd and whacks some guy in the head with it. I don't know if this happens often in golf but this was actually pretty funny because the loser in the crowd got really screwed up. The ball hit him right on the top of the head and everyone in the crowd was screwing and running over to help him and he needed loads of bandages and shit because he was so fucked up. I'm not really sure how getting hit in the head with a golf ball would lead to you needing a bandage, but it happened so there you go. Even more hilariously the loser's name was Jason Blue. I don't know why I find that so funny but it just is \u2013 imagine if your surname was a colour! It would fucking suck.\n\nThe best thing about it though was Rory McIlroy's reaction. He just walked over there, looked at him, didn't even really say anything in terms of 'Hey, I'm sorry' or anything but instead just signed a glove and threw it at him, then walked off like a complete badman. It's like Rory McIlroy made golf cool. Almost. Check out the video below:\n\nWhen I was trying to find a video of this Rory McIlroy incident I found out that this wasn't the first time he had whacked a gold ball into somebody's head either and they he did it a couple of months ago too. Again, he signed his glove and gave it to the fan. He's probably had to do it a million times. How the hell is Rory McIlroy so well known in the world of golf (and presumably pretty good) if all he does is hit people in the head with golf balls? Can someone please help me out with that one? As an aside, don't you think golf would be so much cooler if the objective was to whack golf balls at people? Anyway, y ou can check out that video of Rory McIlroy slamming someone else in the head with a golf ball below, although it's kind fo falsely advertised because all you really see him do is take a shot and give the fan a signed glove, it's bullshit. I guess that's why golf is so crappy.\n\nThere's been some speculation as well that the guy who got hit was actually a Rory McIlroy superfan and actually tried to move his head into the path of the ball in order to get a Rory McIlroy signed glove. He obviously knew Rory McIlroy's M.O. and what was going down, and when he saw that ball flying into the crowd only one thing was on his mind: get hit by it. He probably didn't think it would do so much damage though. At least he has the Rory McIlroy signed glove though I guess."}
{"text":"Control your distance\n\nGolfers have a variety of clubs they can use when pitching - the lob wedge, sand wedge, gap wedge and pitching wedge. These can all be used with the same technique. Look to get a pitching system so you have all shots covered.\n\nSet-up\n\nMost amateur golfers set up to a pitch shot in the same way they do for longer shots, but your set-up for pitch shots requires a few alterations. Your weight distribution should favour your front foot with about 60% of your body weight resting on the foot nearest the target. Your hands should also move forward with the weight. Keep your shoulders square to the ball-to-target line, but pull the foot nearest the target back a touch as this will help you to turn through the shot and stop your hands from flicking.\n\nSwing\n\nThe swing should involve some decent hinging of the wrists on the way back and a solid turn through of the body. You need to brush the grass after the ball, this will feel like you are hitting down and through the shot to pop it up.\n\nAn easy way to alter distances in your wedge play is to simply grip down the club for a shorter shot.

This will help you hit the green not the ground in your gold game.\n\nStep 1: The set-up\n\nPlace your club behind the ball, aiming 5-10 metres right of the target, and take your normal set-up, feet shoulder width apart and your weight on the balls of your feet.\n\nStep 2: The grip\n\nMake sure your grip is low enough on the club to allow you to lean forwards without hitting too far behind the ball. If your grip is too high, your body position will be too upright, leading to a flat swing that pulls the ball even more to the left. See our video \"why we hook the ball\" to find out more.\n\nStep 3: The swing\n\nKeep your weight on the balls of your feet and your upper body leant forwards throughout the swing. This allows the club to swing straight into the line of the ball, reducing the tendency to hook to the left. When hitting from a steep hill, you can open the clubface at set-up. This normally sends the ball to the right, and in this case compensates for the effect of the slope. Use your normal swing, your body rotating around the spinal axis. Make sure your body follows through, leading your arms and hands, or you will hook the ball to the left, and probably hit \"fat\" behind the ball. So follow through for a clean, straight contact with the ball, sending it onto the green for a nice birdie putt."}
{"text":"Climatic conditions and time available do not always allow us to practice outdoors as often as we wish. During the off-season or whenever we lack time to play a complete round of golf there are some simple indoor golf drills we can easily perform at home or in the office. The idea is to focus on the three areas of the game that will have the greatest impact on your score: putting, pitching and swing.\n\nThe indoor putting, pitching and swing drills designed by Jack Moorehouse (see article below) do not require any specific equipment or indoor golf gadgets. They can be executed with the help of simple props readily available at home or at your office, such as a phone book, a towel, etc. Of course you'll need some golf balls and your putter, pitching wedge and an 8 iron (ideally also your 7 and 9 irons).\n\nMaster the three scoring clubs-the driver, the wedge, and the putter-and you'll improve your game dramatically. With 14 clubs to hit, golfers often have trouble deciding which part of their game to work on. If you're serious about working on your game, focus on the three scoring clubs. They have the greatest impact on your score.\n\nUnfortunately, not all of us live in a climate where we can always practice outdoors. Even if we do, we don't always have the time to go to a driving range and hit balls. That doesn't mean we can't work on the fundamentals needed to master the three clubs. We just need to do it indoors.\n\nBelow are several indoor drills that will help you master these three clubs. They can are done in almost any location, even your office.\n\nPutter\n\nThere are three \"musts\" in becoming a good putter: (1) your stroke must follow target line; (2) your putter must remain square to the target line; (3) and your forward stroke must equal (or slightly exceed) your backstroke. The following drill emphasizes these putting musts. The next drill focuses on distance control, also a key aspect of putting.\n\n1. Drop two phone books on the floor. Position them far enough apart so that your putterhead barely squeezes through them. Place a golf ball between the books, assume your putting posture, and make your stroke.\n\nUse the books as a visual guide to match the lengths of your backstroke and forwardstroke. Matching the lengths ensures a smooth stroke with perfect tempo. You'll find it difficult to guide your putter between the phone books unless your stroke follows the intended putting line. If your putter strikes the side of either book, your stroke strayed off-line.\n\nAlso, mark your ball with a straight line. Set that line parallel to your target line. Marking the ball makes it easier to align the putter perpendicular to the target line at address. See if the line falls to the right or left of center as your ball rolls after impact. If it does, then your stroke may have deviated off-line or made contact with a slightly open or closed putter face.\n\n2. This drill improves distance control. Set or balance a ball (or a tee turned upside down) on a penny and putt a second ball to this ball so that it touches the first, but DOESN'T knock it off the penny! This one is SUPER TOUGH! Try various distances.\n\nYou should soon forget about the line and \"making\" the putt-distance control is everything. Rolling the ball to the target with an acceptable \"sink\" speed becomes second nature as you try to just touch the target ball.\n\nPitching Wedge\n\nThese drills can be done just about anywhere. It improves one of the most important parts of your game-wedge play.\n\nFind about 10 feet of open floor space. Put a small towel on the floor and stand about 10 feet away. Use a short, smooth stroke, keeping your hands ahead of the clubface. Try chipping 50 balls onto the towel. Practice so the balls land on the towel, not come to rest on the towel. Start with an 8 iron, then move to a 9 iron, and then to a wedge.\n\nThe more you practice the better control you'll have over those short chips. Next time you're on the practice range, try the same drill. Watch how far each club makes the ball roll on the putting surface. Now you'll have more control over your chips under different conditions. After awhile, you should be able to nestle every shot close to the pin, or sink it!\n\nDriver\n\nMany golfers turn their hips and shoulders simultaneously when swing a club. Too much lower body rotation eliminates torque between the upper and lower body. Adding more backswing torque to your swing generates distance.\n\n1. Sit down in a chair. Spread your feet out wide and keep them flat on the ground. Hold a 7 or 8 iron out in front of you. Hold the clubhead with one hand and the end of the grip in the other hand. Raise the club over your head and rest the shaft across your neck and shoulders. Turn your shoulders to the right. Hold this position for a few seconds. You should feel a lot of torque along your left side. The turn your shoulders back and face forward. Relax and repeat.\n\nMany golfers use their hands and arms only when swinging the driver. They don't rotate their shoulders, sapping power from their swing. This drill helps keep your hands, arms, and shoulders in sync as you swing back and through.\n\n2. Lower yourself down to the floor onto your knees. Hold a ball between your hands and out in front of your. Start by making some small moves swinging the ball back and forth. The idea is to keep the ball in front of your chest as your arms swing and your shoulders rotate. Increase the length of your swing going back and through. As you reach the end of your backswing and forward swing, allow your arms to fold. Swing back and fold your arms. Swing down and unfold them. Swing through and fold them again.\n\nThese drills improve control of the three most important clubs in your bag-the driver, the putter, and the wedge. You can do them in your house or your garage. Each focuses on fundamentals you must master to take your game to the next level.\n\nAbout the author: Jack Moorehouse is the author of the best-selling book \"How To Break 80\u2026And Shoot Like The Pros!\"  He is NOT a golf pro, rather a working man that helped thousands of golfers lower their handicaps without quitting their day jobs."}
{"text":"Harvey's Quick Tip: When I say bring your right arm back to your side, I mean on the downswing \u2014 not the backswing.\n\nThere are many misconceptions about what players \"must\" do in order to hit a golf ball. Many golfers keep the right elbow close to the side throughout the backswing. This is thought to prevent coming-over-the-top by keeping the club inside. However, legendary golf instructor Harvey Penick said, \"the result is a swing that is too short and flat.\"\n\nTake a look at the swing of almost every good golfer. The right elbow is away from the body when the club is parallel to the ground and underneath the hands at the top of the backswing.\n\nIt's never easy to make changes to a golf swing, but here's a drill that can help golfers keep the right elbow away from the body. Grab the 7-iron out of your bag and take a normal address position with both hands on the club. Now, remove the left hand from the club and place it on your hip. Swing your right arm back as if you were making a one-armed swing until the club is pointed straight up. Your elbow will be away from your body and pointed at the ground. Now, reach your left arm back and put your hand on the club. Notice how much you will have to turn your shoulders to do this! To complete the backswing, just swing your arms up over your shoulder.\n\nStep 1: Stand at address and practice this drill. It will help you keep the right elbow away from the body during the backswing.\n\nStep 2: Now place your left hand on the club. Notice how much you will have to turn your shoulders to do this.\n\nStep 3: Another way to feel this motion is to stand at address and pretend that you are chopping wood.\n\nAnother simple way to feel this is to assume the address position. Without standing up, swing your arms straight up and over your right shoulder, higher than your ear. Don't turn, just pretend like you are chopping wood. Notice how your right elbow comes up. This is the way your arms should move in your backswing \u2014 just add a little body turn.\n\nYour right elbow comes back to your side, but on the downswing, not the backswing. Mr. Penick called this the magic move \u2014 the right elbow goes to the side as your weight returns to the left. This can only happen if your elbow goes away on the backswing.\n\nTake a look at the swing of almost every good golfer.

{"text":"Golf Tips: Short-Game Myths\n\nMany golfers struggle around the greens because they believe two popular, but incorrect, myths: \"Keep your body still\" and \"chip like you putt.\" Here's how to erase them from your game.\n\nPitching: Let Yourself Go\nHolding your body stock-still when pitching will turn your swing into a stiff, robotic motion, destroying feel and making it hard to achieve solid contact. Any shot longer than a putt needs some body movement to support the club's motion. Don't purposely move your body, but let it react to the momentum of the swing. You'll have better rhythm and make more consistent contact.\n\nChipping: Design Dictates Technique\nPutters are designed for a stance that sets the eyes directly over the ball and promotes a pendulum-like swing arc (far left). The chipping clubs are not. So trying to \"chip like you putt\" demands using an unnatural motion that fights the design of these clubs.\n\nWhen chipping, stand tall with an open stance. The butt end of the club will be about a hand's width from your body, and your eyes well inside the ball. Swing the clubhead on a semi-circle arc from the inside, out to the ball, and back to the inside . You'll swing with less tension and better touch."}
{"text":"9,999 To Go...\n\nI've noticed something as my game has continued to improve. Suddenly, I'm not one of the guys just hanging on in my local community. As recently as this spring I was one of the guys really hoping to pair up with a top player at Sunday Doubles. Suddenly, it isn't that way anymore. I'm still hoping to pair up with one of the other top guys, because that'd be a sure-thing win... but now there are people that actually want me as a partner, that are excited and hopeful when they get paired up with me.\n\nI'm not the best disc golfer in my particular local community... There are three guys that I consider better than me, and there are probably five-six guys that I know I can beat on any given day. And as I've become a 950+ level player I've started to realize that I'm better than most of my community. This isn't shocking, because most guys that are over the 900 level can honestly say that they're better than at least half of the guys that hit the disc course on any given day.\n\nBut I didn't realize it before recently. Suddenly I'm at the point where I feel like if I just play every single round of golf for money, I'll come out ahead. Because there are only three guys that can beat me more than half of the time in my local community (and since a lot of local guys are probably reading this: Hoyle, O'Shea, Tipping). There are still those five-six guys that I know can beat me half the time, they probably know who they are. But everybody else? I'm going to win a lot more than I lose.\n\nMaybe this sounds a little bit arrogant, but it isn't as though I think I'm amazing. There are still, probably, 9,999 golfers out there that can beat me on any given day. But it has to be some kind of decent plateau to suddenly have the confidence that I'm better than most people out there at the sport I've chosen to play. That if I play for cash all the time, I'm going to come out ahead.\n\nAnyway...\n\nI've noticed something else, the blog is probably helping my practice routine. Thinking that if I don't get outside and putt for an hour I'll have to feel guilty about it later seems to be helping me get on all the layers of clothing and drag the basket out from the snow piled around it.

We are told that this is because of shipping costs but the reality of it is that there is a lack of competition in the Canadian market.

{"text":"For Woods, losing changes nothing\n\nTiger Woods arrives for his tee time\n\nTiger Woodswasn't back. Nor is he now lost again. Instead, he's like many players on the PGA Tour: capable of winning any week or capable of blowing up on a Sunday as well, as he did in the U.S. Open.\n\nWoods actually has hit the ball well off the tee of late, perhaps evidence his swing change finally is producing results. But it's Woods' putting -- and fortunately for him not his health -- that continues to abandon him. As players age, putting gets tougher -- it requires more concentration, more steadiness, more mental toughness. It also requires more confidence. No matter how great you used to be, confidence in your putter only extends as far as the latest round.\n\nThere's also no dominant player on tour right now -- 15 players have won the last 15 majors. So the question likely isn't whether he can win another major but when. It might not happen often, but it would be surprising if it doesn't happen at all."}
{"text":"How To Spin A Golf Ball\n\nBy: Brian Hill\n\nBreak Studios Contributing Writer\n\nLearning how to spin a golf ball can help you hit more accurate iron shots and lower your scores. Particularly on hard or fast greens, you need to be able to stop the ball quickly, and place it near the hole. You don't want the ball bounding over the green into the rough, bunker or water hazard. Golf professionals are so proficient at putting spin, or back spin, on a ball that their shots sometimes back up ten feet or more. Creating spin involves club and ball selection, and striking the ball with a sharp, descending blow.\n\nClean your clubs. Make sure the grooves in your iron clubs are kept clean and free of grass or dirt. The grooves help impart the spin on the ball. Use a lofted club, a 7-iron, 8-iron, 9-iron or wedge, for shots you want to spin. The higher trajectory of the ball flight with these clubs makes it easier to spin the ball.\n\nSelect the right ball. Golf balls with softer covers are easier to spin than those with harder covers. It used to be that using soft cover balls was more expensive because they could be easily cut and would have to be replaced more often, but that is no longer the case.\n\nAdjust your stance. Play the ball two inches farther back in your stance. Open your stance, meaning aiming your feet slightly to the left of your target line. Now that you have the proper alignment, how to spin a golf ball becomes a matter of making the correct swing.\n\nHit down on the ball. Your stance adjustments make it easier to hit down on the ball with a descending blow. Take an upright swing, not a rounded one as you would use with your fairway woods. An upright swing plane is a key technique in how to spin a golf ball.\n\nHit the ball first. Make sure you contact the ball before the turf. Your divot should be shallow. A deep divot is an indication you have hit behind the ball.\n\nKeep your wrists firm. You want the feel of clean, crisp contact with the ball. Don't flop or roll over your wrists. Keep them firm as you hit through the ball and you will have the satisfaction of watching your ball hit the green and stop quickly."}

{"text":"2 Tips From One Occasional Golfer to Others\n\nI've played a lot of golf in my life since picking up the game when I was about 8 years old, including competitive junior, amateur and college golf. In recent years, though, since getting married, having two daughters and buying a little family skiff, my annual rounds of play have dropped to 5-10 rounds per year. Actually last year I only played 3 rounds, and they were all before the end of June. I suspect there are many golfers out there who can relate to this, so I wanted to share a couple tips that I've learned over the years for playing your best, and enjoying your golf, when you don't practice and only play a few rounds a year. The only two swing thoughts I keep in mind are set-up and tempo.\n\nSet-Up\n\nTo achieve a solid set-up, I pick a mark a few inches in front of the golf ball in line with my target, set my golf club perpendicular to the target line, and then align my legs, hips and shoulders \"parallel left\" of the target line. An analogy for this set-up I've heard in the past that stuck with me is to think of your body and your target line as railroad tracks.\n\nTempo\n\nWhen you are not practicing and playing only a few rounds a year, you can't expect to do all the things in your swing that you do when you are playing frequently and well. However, I believe by focusing on your tempo, you can get away with a lot of bad things that would otherwise produce bad shots. Specifically, I focus my tempo on taking the golf club back very slowly, and pausing at the top of the backswing before transitioning to the downswing. The slow takeaway and pause at the top help me minimize the tendency that most golfers share, which is to go over the top on the downswing. A slow tempo and paused transition help me drop my hands on the downswing and keep my swing on-plane. Maybe these two simple thoughts will help other occasional golfers make the most of their golf.\n\nAbout AB\n\nName\/Nickname: Adam Bradshaw \/ AB\nHometown: Fairhaven, MA\nWhen I started with 3balls: June 2003\nPosition at 3balls: Program Director\nWhat year I started playing golf: 1982\nHow did I get started playing golf: My father played regularly and also ran a Junior Golf Program at Whaling City golf course . . . now New Bedford Municipal Golf Course.\nType of Golfer I consider yourself to be: Occasional\nHow Often I Play: 5-10 rounds per year\nHandicap: 3\nFavorite Ball: Titleist Pro V1\nFavorite Golf Brand: TaylorMade\nFavorite PRO: Rory McIlroy (2nd daughter's name is Rory)\nOther sports I follow?

{"text":"Why the Stack & Tilt\u00ae Swing\n\nThe beginner golfer spends their limited time, money, and formative hours learning \"fundamentals\" that are not remotely standard among the game's best players. This means that they are not fundamental at all. We believe the game of golf is fundamentally misinterpreted.\n\nThe progression for learning golf is out of order because the fundamentals of the game are poorly defined. Furthermore, the rules that govern how the ball flies are fundamentally misunderstood. Thus, golfers have no understanding of the essential mechanics of the swing and do not understand how to correct their ball flight. Consequently, they default to bits of jargon, handed down dogma, or cliches that have little to no bearing on the problems that afflict them.\n\nAll of this results in a barrier to entry to golf that is too high for most beginning players. Golfers routinely leave the game out of frustration, lack of direction, or improvement that is too slow to justify. Golf needs to be presented as a workable challenge for the beginning player that adds sophistication as the players desire to improve increases or as the expert players situation necessities.\n\nTo make this increase in sophistication or progression workable requires a system of explaining and organizing the game. It must be a system that is broad enough to explain variations in all players but simple enough for the beginning player to use effectively. The science of classification is known as taxonomy, and through it we can organize all swings to understand the essential elements.\n\nThe problem is that the word system in golf has been used with a negative connotation.\n\nThe insinuation is that everyone using the same system is given the same lesson or swings exactly the same way. This is short sighted and naive. In fact, any serious discipline has a system of measuring and standardizing procedures. Doctors learn to use systematic diagnosis to treat the ill, yet not all illnesses are the same. Patients are given systematic directions to follow to implement the doctors orders, yet the medicines are different. A surgeon has procedures they must allow for surgery, yet not all surgeries are the same. These systems are designed to make the procedure easier and more reliable. The same is true in golf.\n\nNot everyone wants to know the intricate details regarding this classification. Golfers just want to know which portions apply to them. This is fine when it comes to training a player as many of the game's best players are not necessarily the most sophisticated at understanding how the swing works. What they do have is predictable pattern on the ball and a reliable set of feels that they recognize to project the ball in a familiar way.\n\nAfter all we recognize ultimately all golfers are feel players. Developing a reliable feel to project the ball in a predictable way is what we are all about.\n\nThe name Stack & Tilt\u00ae has made it easy for our critics to dismiss us as a fad (Wall Street Journal). To that criticism we would ask this question, \"What is the difference between a fad and a paradigm shift?\"\n\nWe see the way golf is being played is in the process of changing. The way the game is being taught to the masses is changing. The interpretation of the game is changing. We believe a paradigm shift is taking place. A paradigm shift can be defined as a dramatic shift in methodology or in a practice that has been universally accepted. The term was first used by Thomas Kuhn. He stated that paradigm shifts do not just happen, they are driven by agents of change. We believe the process of changing from one way of thinking to another in playing golf has been set in motion. As far as golf instruction is concerned, these agents of change are the early adopters, who will apply new techniques without risk to their reputations as they differentiate themselves. There are many coaches who have adopted many of our techniques but have been exempted from the criticism because the label Stack & Tilt is not attached. Scores of players have adopted a number of these techniques in their swing.\n\nOthers of higher esteem will quietly implement the techniques as they re-brand themselves. Often, the paradigm shift does not come from the establishment as they have a vested interest in keeping the status-quo.\n\nWhat are the paradigm shifts in golf? They start with the most basic questions about golf. That is what determines the start line and curvature of the ball. The rules that govern how the ball flies are being rewritten. Next, the fundamentals or standards for recognizing how golf is played are being reorganized. How force is applied to the ball is being reexamined. Specifically, in the swing itself, a three dimensional understanding of how the spine works for a golfer to catapult the ball is changing the lexicon of golf terminology. This is why we chose the name Stack & Tilt to convey this concept of the spine changing its flex while keeping the axis of its turn stable.\n\nAt its core those who are familiar with the Stack & Tilt\u00ae swing know it as a system of measuring, more than just a set of recommendations on how to swing. As for us we use Stack & Tilt as an accurate description of a traditional swing. We want to make golf easier and more enjoyable for golfers while still being able to offer a sophisticated explanation when one is warranted as we share a passion for playing golf with millions of people. We do not want to represent that we are the only ones with any good ideas about playing golf, or that our recommendations are the only way to play well and enjoy the game. However, we do believe masses of golfers can benefit from this interpretation. Therefore, we recognize a golfer can use as little or as much of our material as they deem important, while still having the knowledge available to them if they need it. Keep the spirit of the game alive, today, tomorrow, always.\n\n-Michael Bennett and Andy Plummer"}

{"text":"Sign up for my Newsletter\n\nPlaying in the Sand\n\nYou have no escaping it. You are going to land in a greenside bunker at some stage of a round. Unfortunately, many golfers walk into the bunker with only \"hope\" they will get the ball out. You've heard the commentators talk about how the Professionals actually prefer to miss in a bunker because they find it easier to get up and down. That's a dream for many. I would think about 50% of golfers just have the objective of getting out, and another 30% are a little better with a desire to get it on the green. But there are 20% who have a little more confidence and will have an objective to get it close to the hole.\n\nYou can decide that you want to be part of the 20%. There is no mystery to a greenside bunker, once you have learned the proper technique. The 80% who don't have confidence may set up correctly and know they need to \"take some sand\". But that isn't enough. You need a swing technique that will bring the club head on the path and angle of attack with the correct hand action through the contact zone.\n\nTry this simplified approach to get the ball on the green and closer to the hole. Set up to a bunker shot the same way you would set up to a pitch shot. Club aiming at the hole and the stance square to the club face. I know this may be a little different from previous lessons you have taken or articles you have read. Give it a try, it may work! The ball position should be slightly forward of center. This will allow you to make a normal golf swing that will bottom out about an inch behind the ball. The key is to make a long, shallow divot with the bottom or bounce of the club. For example, a normal full swing Lob Wedge shot would go 50 yards if I made solid contact with the ball. By getting a little sand before the ball, the shot would only go about 25 yards. If I only needed to hit the ball 10 yards, I could use a smaller swing.\n\nTry not to complicate the bunker shot by using force to get the ball out. Any shot around the green requires touch and tempo. Use the sand to help you with distance control. Contact me for more help getting your shots closer to the hole."}
{"text":"It is nearly impossible to hit a good golf shot and have your optimal swing speed if your balance is not maintained throughout the golf swing. All Top 100 teachers like Butch Harmon and Rick Smith would agree. It sounds pretty simple, just keep your balance. However, with a lot of tension in your grip, arms and shoulders, it is very difficult to make a good golf swing and maintain your balance during your swing.\n\nGolfers hear all the time that you do not have to swing the golf club hard in order to hit a long drive. The example of Ernie Els swing is used often when trying to illustrate this theory. Ernie has talked on many occasions that he depends on his timing to create his power with an efficient swing as opposed to plain brut force. You can learn a lot about the golf swing by watching good players like Ernie Els and watching how they stay in balance.\n\nYou can first find your balance at address through the feelings in your feet. First understand that balance works two ways in your feet. As you set up to the golf ball, first find your balance in your feet by feeling more weight on your toes and then your heels until you are centered. Once your have found your balance from back to front, do the same going from left and right.\n\nNow make your golf swing. During your golf swing, you should not tighten muscles in your shoulders, arms and hands. When this does happen your muscles contract and become shorter. Using that picture it is easy to see that without manipulating the club, the ball will be hit higher or more towards the equator of the ball. This will result in a thin shot or even a worm burner. Most people manipulate the club to try to get back down to the ball correctly. When in balance, your goal is to take a divot that starts just on the target side of the ball with all irons\n\nOnce in your finish position, hold this position for a count of three seconds. Most golfers are so out of balance that they have a hard time not falling over. As you continue to make swings, slow down until you are able to stay in balance for that count of three. Again, your weight should be in balance with your weight positioned underneath your shoe strings of your target side foot.\n\nAs you are at the practice facility, start with your wedge and take a few three quarter swings. You need to ask yourself three questions. Before you swing, ask yourself .Am I in balance?. This will be checked through your feet. Second, after your swing, again ask yourself .Am I in balance?. This will be monitored by checking your posture after counting to the number three. Finally, ask yourself if during your swing you had tension in your shoulders, arms and hands. If the answers are yes, yes and no then you are on your way to shooting better scores."}

Each round of golf requires the competitors to play the holes in a given order. A typical 'round' is 18 holes but a short game of 9 holes can also be played.\n\nGolf is one of the very few ball games which do not require a standardized playing field. The game is played on a golf course and no two courses are alike in their fairway, hazards and holes.\n\nThe modern game that we know as golf was invented back in 15th century Scotland and some historians believe it is linked to the Roman game of paganica while others cite the Chinese game chuiwan as the inspiration. Golf was documented as being played on the Musselburgh Links in Scotland in March of 1672, making this the oldest existing golf course in the world.\n\nDuring the 1800s and 1900s the game of golf grew enormously in popularity. There were 387 golf courses worldwide in 1890 and today there are over 32,000.\n\nGolfing Etiquette Tips\n\nThere is a certain code of behavior that golfers follow to make the game more enjoyable for each other. When you are out on the golf course celebrating National Golf Month, make sure that you follow these basic golf etiquette guidelines:\n\nDo not make a noise or a sudden movement when someone is about to follow through on their golf swing. It can be very distracting and cause them to swing incorrectly.\n\nIf you hit a ball which travels far and is heading toward other players, yell \"Fore\" so that they can get out of the way.\n\nIf you are waiting for another group at the hole in front of you, be patient and do not rush them. If another group is behind you and waiting, play the hole as quickly as you can so they don't have to wait long.\n\nWear the appropriate clothing for golfing. Many golf clubs will have a dress code requiring certain clothing, such as a collared shirt and closed-toe shoes.\n\nNo matter where you live in the world, there is a likely to be a golf course nearby where you can celebrate National Golf Month by playing 18 holes with your best friends.

His brother Alec won the 1907 U.S. Open.\n\nRoss's most famous designs are Pinehurst No. 2, Aronimink Golf Club, Seminole Golf Club, Oak Hill and Oakland Hills. Some of his early work was in Virginia and includes Jefferson Lakeside Country Club and Sewell's Point Golf Course. He displayed great attention to detail. Often he created challenging courses with very little earth moving; according to Jack Nicklaus, \"His stamp as an architect was naturalness.\" His most widely known trademark is the crowned or \"turtleback\" green, most famously seen on Pinehurst No. 2, though golf architecture writer Ron Whitten argued in Golf Digest in 2005 that the effect had become exaggerated compared to Ross's intention because greenkeeping practices at Pinehurst had raised the centre of the greens. Ross also designed one of Westchester, N.Y.'s best courses, Whippoorwill Country Club, in Armonk, NY, however Charles Banks was hired by Whippoorwill to redesign the course in 1928.\n\nRoss often created holes which invited run-up shots but had severe trouble at the back of the green, typically in the form of fallaway slopes. In the 1930s he revolutionized greenskeeping practices in the Southern United States when he oversaw the transition of the putting surfaces at Pinehurst No. 2 from oiled sand to Bermuda grass. Ross also designed the course at Sedgefield Country Club in Greensboro, North Carolina which is home to the PGA Tour's Wyndham Championship. Currently, Sedgefield Country Club is the only regular Donald Ross design on the PGA Tour. Aronimink Golf Club, located in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, played host to the AT&T National in 2010 and 2011.\n\nRoss was a founding member and first president of the American Society of Golf Course Architects, which was formed at Pinehurst in 1947. He was admitted to the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1977, a high honor rarely awarded for anything other than playing success.\n\nRoss is unmatched in the quality of courses he completed. Alister MacKenzie and A.W. Tillinghast come in close after Ross on the list of well known architects of the early 20th century.\nRoss died while completing his final design at Raleigh Country Club in North Carolina"}

{"text":"This weekend at Merion there have been many rulings come into play, whether it was an unplayable bunker lie or a water hazard there have been drops and strokes added. This is when we catch a glimpse of a rules official helping make the right call. So what is it these rules officials do? How many are there? The MGA's Lisa Overom is inside the ropes this week officiating group and learning the ways of Merion.\n\nWhat do the rules officials do before the event?\n\nLike the players getting in a practice round to chart the course, the rules officials tour the course days before the event to get the lay of the land and note where situations could occur. They receive hole-by-hole notes that tell them where each hazard and drop area is. With large events like the U.S. Open, temporary immovable objects, such as grandstands and leader boards, come into play. Drop zones are designated for such situations to help speed up play.\n\nHow many rules officials are at events like the U.S. Open?\n\nBecause we don't get to see what's going on behind the scenes and only see players we don't always see the rules officials unless something comes up. Rules officials are flown in from all over the world and each ruling association. Each group of players has a rules official assigned to them. Yup, each group has a rules official with them to help make the right call.\n\nWhat's a typical day like for a rules official?\n\nAs mentioned before, the rules officials are assigned to each group. The group changes daily, unless a group cannot finish their round such as the case at Merion due to weather issues. For this U.S. Open the rules officials stayed with the same group for the first two days because of overlapping rounds.\n\nLike the players, the rules officials get to the course well before the group's tee time. They check in, get their radios, notes, and any other special information about the day. As soon as the first ball is hit they are on the job, walking with the group the entire round. Generally the last people to leave the course, they put in a full day of work.\n\nAs you watch the U.S. Open this weekend you might catch a glimpse of a rules official helping a player. Even though we don't always see them, they are always around a crucial element to any golf event.\n\n]]> Golf Day\n 17 Apr 2013 17:43:41 +0000WP Ryan reading \u2192]]>In honor of National Golf Day (April 16), and despite the fact that golf is temporarily on hold pending a change in Mother Nature's current stance on spring, we are extolling a few of the economic, health and environmental benefits of the game:\nEconomic: Golf is a nearly $70 billion industry, providing nearly 2 million jobs and total wage income of $55.6 billion. In Minnesota, the golf industry accounts for 34,653 jobs and $776.7 million in wage income. The local golf industry ($1.2 billion in direct economic input) is on par with other industries like dairy, printed circuitry, and accounting, tax and payroll services.\nCharity: Golf's national charitable impact was $3.9 billion in 2011\u2014 more than 12 million people participated in 143,000 golf-related charity events at 12,000 different golf facilities. In Minnesota, golf accounts for $52.4 million in charitable giving. Last year, the 3M Championship celebrated $20 million in fund raising over the last two decades.\nHealth: Walking 18 holes of golf is the same as taking a five mile walk or running 3.5 miles \u2013 well in excess of the 10,000 steps recommended for daily exercise. You burn about 2,000 calories when you walk and 1,300 when you use a cart \u2013 and your blood glucose levels fall anywhere from 10 to 30 percent.\nEnvironment: Golf is now on the leading edge of environmental sustainability and stewardship efforts. Golf courses account for two million acres of green space across the country, which are home to a vast array of wildlife species. New, industry-wide principles on sustainability ensure continual improvement in the design, development, construction, and management of golf courses.\nGolfers need little encouragement to get out and play, but isn't nice to know that there are healthful, economic and social benefits for when we do?\nSources: The Minnesota Golf Economy, pub. 2007 by the Minnesota Golf Association, Golf 20\/20 and SRI International.\n\n]]> \u2014 By The Rules\n 17 Apr 2013 15:04:14 +0000Doug Hoffmann reading \u2192]]>This past Saturday morning, the worlds of golf and sport came to a collective standstill as the Rules Committee at the Masters decided the fate of Tiger\nWoods. Would they? Could they? Did they dare disqualify him for violating a Rule that resulted in his signing an incorrect score card?\n\nThere was a media frenzy with everyone having an opinion. Social media was alive with theories. Even the participants in the Rules Workshop I was\nconducting were buzzing with a renewed interest despite having to spend \"Moving Day\" [at The Masters] in a hotel meeting room learning about the Rules.\n\nIt took Fred Ridley, Chair of the Committee, a considerable length of time to make a public statement after it had been announced Tiger was not disqualified\nbut would be assessed a two-stroke penalty for having played from a wrong place when taking relief under Rule 26-1 the previous day. After he spoke, it left\nmany, including PGA Tour pro Ernie Els, Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee and two-time Masters champion and CBS analyst Nick Faldo, wondering\nhow and why Tiger had not been disqualified. Some, including Faldo and Chamblee, suggested Tiger should \"man up\" and withdraw to save the tournament\nand the game from public humiliation. Others believe in a conspiracy theory \u2013 a behind the scenes agreement between the Masters, CBS Sports and Tiger.\nOf course, some still believe LBJ had something to do with JFK's assassination.\n\nYet, in the aftermath of the public outcry, once the facts were presented and studied came the realization that the ruling was correct. Well, some have come to\nthat point \u2026 others are still not convinced. Allow me to revisit the facts to show the ruling is correct. But, before I do, I will make two assertions:\n\n#1: I cannot explain how or why Tiger lost focus when taking relief. He is known to be one of the more knowledgeable players when it comes to the Rules.\nHowever, after many other well documented gaffes by his peers, and the bungled attempt by David Feherty to explain Tiger's options, it goes to show that\nmistakes can be made.\n\n#2: I believe the Committee made an error in not speaking with Tiger in the Scoring Area when it had the opportunity Friday\n\nafternoon. We may never know\nthe reason for this. Mr. Ridley said, after reviewing the tape, the Committee did not believe there was a breach. Using 20\/20 hindsight most will come to a\ndifferent conclusion.\n\nThere is no doubt Tiger dropped and played from a wrong place; even Tiger admitted to that. Rule 26-1 allows the player to drop under \"stroke and\ndistance\" as one of the options. Rule 20-5 specifically states the players must drop \"as near as possible\" to the spot from which the original ball was last\nplayed. This means where the ball must first strike the course \u2013 not necessarily where it ends up after the drop. PGA Rules instructor Ed Hoard used to\nteach that \"as near as possible\" meant about 6\". The penalty under Rule 26 for this breach is two strokes.\n\nSomeone happened to notice the possible issue, so they alerted the Committee, which in turn began its investigation. While Tiger was playing the 18th hole,\nthe Committee reached the conclusion that there had not been a breach. Therefore, it elected not to speak to Tiger about it in the Scoring Area. This is\ncritical. By dealing with the question and reaching its decision, the Committee had, in essence, made a ruling \u2013 despite the fact the player didn't even know.\n\nAfter Tiger made his infamous comments during the interview later, the Committee took notice and elected to revisit the previous ruling. They met with Tiger\nSaturday morning in order to ask questions. During this interview, it was stated Tiger admitted to dropping in a wrong place. (While he may have said he\n\"intentionally\" dropped two yards away, he was mistaken with his ability to do so.). Thus, Tiger had signed his card with a score of 6 for the 15th hole, when\nit should have been an 8, a breach of Rule 6-6d that carries with it a penalty of disqualification.\n\nHowever, the Committee had ruled on the issue the day before and had not elected to speak with Tiger in the Scoring Area. We can look to Decision 34-\n3\/1.5 \u2013 \"Committee Error and Scoring in Stroke Play\" for guidance on such an issue. Some key concepts in this Decision are as follows:\n\n1. \"The player is entitled to act on such information in his subsequent play.\" This means, the player may proceed based on information the\nCommittee gives him, even if incorrect. In Tiger's case, to sign the score card believing it is correct.\n2. \"When a referee (Committee) makes a specific ruling that is contrary to the Rules in a specific situation, the player should be exempt from\npenalty.\" Tiger is exempt from the disqualification penalty for signing an incorrect card.\n3. \"In these situations, the Committee should resolve the matter in whatever manner it considers most equitable, in light of all the facts and with the\nobjective of ensuring that no player receives an undue advantage or disadvantage.\" By assessing Tiger the two-stroke penalty for having played from the\nwrong place, it restored things to the way they should have been if they had discussed the issue with Tiger in Scoring.\n\nFinally, Fred Ridley referred to Rule 33-7. This is the Rule that permits the Committee to \"waive, modify or impose\" a penalty of disqualification in\nexceptional circumstances. It is this rule that allowed the Masters Committee to waive the disqualification penalty for Tiger. (Reference had been made by\nthe media to Decision 33-7\/4.5 erroneously. That decision is not relevant.)\n\nCommittee get the ruling correct, they took the most difficult option. It would have been easy, and popular in\nthe eyes of many, to disqualify Tiger, but he would have had every right to be angry at such an action.\n\nBy assessing Tiger the two-stroke penalty and allowing him to play, despite the firestorm of negative publicity and the accusations of preferential treatment, the\nCommittee upheld the Rules of Golf.\n\n\"One can survive everything nowadays, except death, and live down anything except a good reputation.\"\n\n- Oscar Wilde\n\nI am writing this on Saturday night of the 77th Masters. Sunday will have to produce many wonders on the sporting side of the ropes if the budding calamity on the administrative side is to be overcome.\n\nEven that may not be sufficient to save the game.\n\nAwakening this morning to the controversy surrounding Tiger Woods' little encounter with cosmic justice at the 15th hole on Friday, I found myself drifting back to 1968, and the worst birthday present Roberto De Vicenzo ever received.\n\nIn that event, you will recall, the Greencoats, after a panicky forty-five minutes or so of international exposure with their trousers down, managed to do the right thing. They never really owned-up to the fact that the best tournament in the world had many conspicuous bugs in the prim and proper procedures for determining the winner, but they certainly realized that they couldn't rewrite the Ten Commandments to cover-up the inevitability of human folly. It wasn't pretty, and there were some real embarrassments; even some spinning and fibbing. It was like seeing John Wayne's toupee fall off. The world learned the hard lesson that, even at The Masters, human feet are comprised of clay. The beauty of this splendid old event has always been its ability to mold that clay into a well-turned ankle.\n\nI fear by Monday, given the unfolding of a worst case scenario, or even without one, a world-class chiropodist couldn't chisel this three-toed sloth into a slipper.\n\nThe behind the scenes decades of diligence the club has mustered to atone for the De Vicenzo disaster has been truly wonderful. It was accomplished by dedication to excellence, placing old-fashioned values above sheer profit, and stressing that tradition is every bit as precious as progress. Today, we are finding out that the so-called real world has infected the Bobby Jones Museum of Civilization. That same false reality has pretty much overwhelmed other sports, and even has the game of golf running a bit of a fever. But I have always held faith that The Masters possessed the antibodies to live on. And, if The Masters lived on, golf \"as it should be\" would live on as well. When the super germ called \"willful self-delusion\" hits the bloodstream, however, only full repentance can win the day. It will take only a short time for the sheer sophistry and treacherous tinkering that is transpiring at Augusta today to stand out like the wart on a witch's nose. The longer this infection goes without treatment, the deadlier it will become.\n\nHere is what we know happened:\n\n1). The golf gods threw the Book of Job at Tiger Woods on the 15th hole on Friday. It lacked the finality of what had hit poor Roberto in 1968, but not the gusto. Being flogged by a flagstick, and having a near-perfect shot diabolically drenched, just as you are about to seize the lead, is a fate I wouldn't wish on Macbeth. To his great credit, Woods composed himself enough to make one of the heroic bogeys of all time. The only problem was, he broke the rules to do it. Nobody in a position of responsibility noticed at the time, including, I'm certain, Woods and his caddy. Not the TV announcers, nor the rules officials at the hole. Not even his fellow competitor. I sure didn't notice, and I got my rules degree from Purvis James Boatwright.\n\n2). Someone watching on TV did notice the infraction, and called the club about it. This prompted Fred Ridley and the Rules Committee to review the video of the incident. They claimed not to have seen what the caller saw. Of course, to my knowledge, they never really told us what the caller said he, or she, saw. But Mr. Ridley told the assembled press this morning that his initial assessment was that Tiger had proceeded properly. Heck, Mr. Ridley and crew never even felt the need to bother Tiger with any questions about the matter. Only after Tiger told an ESPN reporter that he had, for strategic purposes, dropped a few feet behind the original spot, rather than \"as near as possible to the spot of the original shot,\" did it dawn on Mr. Ridley that he, and Tiger, and the whole world of golf, had a little problem. I'm quite certain that Mr. Boatwright, from his grave, had already figured that out.\n\n3). Mr. Ridley then called Tiger's agent and arranged a meeting at Augusta early the next morning. At that meeting, Mr. Ridley magically transformed into Ron \"the President's previous statement is inoperative\" Ziegler. The Rules Committee followed precedent into a revolving door and came out ahead of it. They invoked a new rule so swamped in subjectivity as to prove Mark Twain's old adage that \"rules are for when you run out of brains.\" Even with its profound vagueness, this rule required stretching to the point of molecular thinness to cover this Keystone Kops plot. Tiger played dumb and innocent, the crowd yelled \"give us Barabbas,\" the working press praised the Emperor's wardrobe, and - voil\u00e0! \u2013 instant tumor on the integrity of the people involved, the game they supposedly guard, and the future of truth as we know it.\n\nAll of this nonsense transpired, I'm afraid, because of fear of doing the right thing. After all, it would just be so darned unpleasant. Or, worse, it was done in fear of litigation, or of hurting TV ratings. Or, worst of all, they simply were incapable of admitting that the lessons of 1968 have worn off. It truly appears that this new progressive bunch has no clue that forty-five minutes of public embarrassment is far preferable to a lifetime of trying to sell willful self-delusion, no matter how sophisticated its packaging or naive the market. Do they really think no poor, unsuspecting waif is going to stumble over the body they are hiding under the rug? These are the same people who, while willing to swallow Tiger's insistence that his dog ate the water hazard rule, were willing to risk blowing up the unbelievably noble story of a fourteen-year old Chinese kid making the cut by singling him out of a field of almost 100 players \u2013 some of whom were shooting their body temperatures while the kid was carving out a 73 \u2013 for slow play! Does anyone in their right mind want a drink out of that glass?\n\nNick Faldo said it best in his initial reaction, which was later sublimated to accommodate the Chamberlain-like peace that settled over the arena by day's end. He simply and quite accurately stated, that in dealing with the 14-year old amateur from China, the committee had \"taken a gray rule and made it black and white.\" But, when dealing with the tarnished American meal ticket, \"they took a black and white rule, and made it gray.\" The most depressing thing about the whole affair is, by the time the third round was over, the uproar was almost completely dissipated.\n\nThat won't be the case if Eldrick happens to slap together a little 64 on Sunday and adds an asterisk to Masters history. Look for Pete Rose to be inducted into The Hall of Fame shortly thereafter.\n\nOh, by the way, happy 90th birthday on Sunday, Mr. De Vicenzo! You're looking better, braver, and less of \"a stupid\" with each passing day.\n\n]]> Masters' officials do right by Decision 33-7\/4.5?\n 13 Apr 2013 18:07:39 +0000WP Ryan reading \u2192]]>In assessing Tiger Woods a two-stroke penalty (for breach of Rule 26-1) rather than a DQ for signing an incorrect score card, did Masters tournament officials correctly invoke their right to waive a DQ penalty on the four-time Masters champion? Read the text of the official statement delivered by Fred Ridley, the chair of the competition committee:\n\n\"Yesterday afternoon, the Rules Committee was made aware of a possible Rules violation that involved a drop by Tiger Woods on the 15th hole.\n\n\"\"After he signed his scorecard, and in a television interview subsequent to the round, the player stated that he played further from the point than where he had played his third shot. Such action would constitute playing from the wrong place.\n\n\"The subsequent information provided by the player's interview after he had completed play warranted further review and discussion with him this morning. After meeting with the player, it was determined that he had violated Rule 26, and he was assessed a two stroke penalty. The penalty of disqualification was waived by the Committee under Rule 33 as the Committee had previously reviewed the information and made its initial determination prior to the finish of the player's round.\"\n\nTo sum it up, the committee reviewed the player's actions at 15 and determined no rules breach. After hearing Tiger's post-round comments, and meeting with him this morning, the committee changes its mind and determines a breach has occurred.\n\nWould not a simple question at the scorer's table, before he signed his card, been in order?\n\nIn light of Tiger's statement after the second round, where he said that he put a new ball in play about two yards from the spot where he played his previous shot [to tweak his yardage to the hole], do you think waiving the DQ penalty was the right call?\n\n]]> a dream to play\n 06 Mar 2013 17:12:15 +0000Rick Shefchik reading \u2192]]>As our snowbirds begin returning from Florida this month and next, some may have an extra gleam in their eye, if they were lucky enough to play the golf courses at the new Streamsong Resort. Streamsong is a new 36-hole complex in central Florida, owned and developed by the Mosaic phosphate mining company, a Cargill subsidiary. The Red course, designed by Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw, and the Blue course, designed by Tom Doak, sit side-by-side \u2014 and even overlap each other in spots \u2014 and present a unique style of golf previously unseen in Florida.\n\nStreamsong is a lyrical name that implies gently flowing water through idyllic meadowlands \u2013 not the spoil piles and hollows of reclaimed phosphate mining property. Yet players who visit the resort will find a spot ideally suited to golf: 36 holes in perfect harmony with the rolling, sandy land on which they were built. Had the golf courses not been built, the land would have been flattened back into pasture, indistinguishable from the hundreds of thousands of surrounding acres. Phosphate mining results in steep piles of sandy spoils and water-filled troughs; in 1975 the Florida legislature mandated that phosphate companies restore each individual acre of land that is mined to specific contouring and revegetation standards. The sandy peaks and valleys of the Streamsong site \u2013 grown over with native grasses as the years went by \u2013 constituted a links-style golf complex waiting to happen.\n\nThe clubhouse \u2013 a modern rectangle somewhat reminiscent of a giant boxcar plopped down on Mars \u2013 is the first site that greets visitors as they drive between the dunes on the resort's entrance road. Inside it is cool and softly lit, the full-length windows drawing sunlight into the high-ceilinged pro shop and bar.\n\nThe first tee for Coore-Crenshaw's Red Course is immediately adjacent to the clubhouse and putting green, overlooking a small lake where a healthy-looking alligator or two might be lolling along the banks below. The tee shot over the water to the first fairway is inspiring \u2013 it is not a particularly long carry, and the fairway is wide, though a bunker on the right side about 200 yards out must be avoided. From there, several sets of bunkers flank the fairway, which rises gently to a large green that slopes rather pointedly from back to front. It's a comfortable beginning that allows the golfer to take in the remarkable sights of this strange, sandy property without feeling especially intimidated.\n\nMuch the same can be said for most of the holes on the Red. Few of the holes will beat you up \u2013 particularly if you choose the right set of tees, which range from 5,184 yards to 7,148 yards. There is water to negotiate on seven of the first eight holes \u2013 the alligators particularly enjoy sunning themselves around the peninsula fairway of the par-5 second hole \u2013 but the architects always provide a reasonable carry and a wide landing area. As with most Coore-Crenshaw courses, the hazards are subtly worked into the landscape to look as though they existed before the first bulldozer arrived; but there are bunkers of all sizes and descriptions, and the player who can't control his or her ball, or falls asleep momentarily, will frequently be fighting to stave off double-bogey.\n\nHighlight holes on the Red include the short, diabolical 8th hole, a 120-yard par-3 with water hard by the left side of the narrow, S-shaped green; the remarkable par-3 16th, featuring a 180-yard tee shot over water to an enormous Biarritz green, set stunningly against the side of a giant sand hill; and the otherworldly 18th, a gently-curving uphill par-5 with the property's largest sand dune running along the entire right side of the hole.\n\nTom Doak's Blue course intersects in a couple of spots with the Red, but it has its own unique character \u2013 primarily at the green sites, where a misplaced approach shot might count for a green in regulation, but an almost guaranteed three-putt as well. The Blue gets off to a spectacular beginning with a first tee perched high atop one of the largest spoil piles on the property. Even walkers get a ride to the top of the hill for their tee shot, and their best look at the entire complex. From that point on, the Blue is an easy walk, except for the trek from the par-3 7th tee down the hill, across the lake, up to the green, and back across the bridge and up the hill again to the 8th tee. The mild inconvenience of that walk is justified by the dramatic nature of the hole, which sits directly to the right of Coore-Crenshaw's aforementioned Biarritz 16th. It's hard to choose between the two par-3 beauties, but golfers will have a perfect opportunity to compare the two holes, both of which feature a mid-iron tee shot over the same lake to huge greens with difficult contours. On #7 Blue, one would do well to keep right; a tee shot (or a chip or even a putt) that rolls off the back left side of the green is headed for the water.\n\nOther memorable holes include the tough par-4 8th, where pinching ponds short left and right of the elevated green make going for it in regulation a gamble, and laying up a problem of its own; the short par-4 13th where driver might get you to the green with a tailwind, but could also end up in the sand or water that protects the long, narrow green; the par-5 14th, a cape hole that tempts the player to cut off a big chunk of the water that flanks the right side of the fairway; and the uphill, par-5 17th, with a series of cross bunkers that ask for heroic carries or well-thought-out layups.\n\nOn both the Red and the Blue, players will walk off the course knowing that the challenge was at least as much mental as physical. Neither course demands long and straight play at all times; a good caddy, or a careful examination of the yardage book, will be a big advantage to the golfer who enjoys thinking his way around a golf course.\n\nAs word continues to filter back to Minnesota about Streamsong, it is likely that more and more of our snowbirds will treat themselves to the experience in the winters to come.\n\n]]> Golf Bids Farewell to Two Champs\n 01 Mar 2013 17:57:49 +0000WP Ryan reading \u2192]]>It's always a bit sad and sweet when figures important to golf in Minnesota pass from the world of the living. The sadness, beyond the obvious loss for the families and friends involved, comes with the realization that the ranks of an important generation are being culled on an almost daily basis. The sweetness comes with recognizing the significance of the lives they lived, celebrating their noteworthy successes, and acknowledging the indelible mark they leave on the game and the people who play golf. February 9 and 15 marked the passing of Don Waryan and Louis Lick, 86 and 89 years old, respectively. Waryan was Hazeltine National's first golf professional, and his career included stints as the head pro at Woodhill and Oak Ridge country clubs. As an apprentice assistant professional in 1986, I will always remember his consideration given to a young man new to Minnesota and looking for work. Read Mike Fermoyle's obituary on Don Waryan.\n\nLouis Lick once won consecutive state high school golf championships (1940-41) as a golfer from St. Paul Central High School. Even more rare, Lick won the individual NCAA golf title in 1944 as a U of M golfer and held this distinction for more than fifty years until fellow Golden Gopher James Mclean won the NCAA in 1998. See Lick's obituary at mngolf.org.\n\n]]> Minnesota roots\n 02 Jan 2013 18:52:42 +0000Rick Shefchik reading \u2192]]>The newest and loudest buzz in the golf course world is Streamsong, the central Florida resort that features two potentially world-class golf courses, one designed by the team of Ben Crenshaw and Bill Coore, the other by Tom Doak. Streamsong held a \"soft opening\" the week before Christmas, with its official Grand Opening scheduled for Saturday, Jan. 26, during the weekend of the PGA merchandise show in Orlando.\n\nStreamsong was the brainchild of Richard Mack, a North Dakota native who attended Moorhead State University and Hamline law school in the 1980s before beginning his career at Cargill in the Twin Cities. Mack played both basketball and golf in college and has participated in a half-dozen MGA State Amateurs and two State Opens. He is currently a member of Windsong Farm Golf Club.\n\n\"I used to be pretty good, but now I'm only good enough to get my rear end beat badly by the kids in school,\" Mack said. Yet his continuing love of the game merged with his position as executive vice president of Mosaic, a fertilizer manufacturing subsidiary of Cargill, resulting in the creation of what is shaping up to be America's next destination golf complex.\n\nStreamsong, located between Tampa and Orlando, was built on 700 acres of land amid a 16,000-acre former phosphate mine site owned by Mosaic. Mack is in charge of restoring the company's spent mine sites to usable land, and after seeing the massive sand dunes and hollows left behind on the Streamsong site when the mine closed, it occurred to him that a golf resort would be a far more interesting and profitable project than turning the property back to nondescript flatland. The timing of such a project was not the greatest \u2013 when Streamsong was being conceived in 2007, the golf business was entering some historically lean times \u2013 but Mack convinced his board of directors that there was still room at the top of the golf world for another exceptional destination.\n\n\"Florida does not need two more golf courses,\" Mack said, describing the typical Florida course as \"very flat, with water left, water right, palmetto bushes and wood chips.\" But Florida could surely make room for courses designed by two of the most admired and respected architectural firms in the business. Mack selected Coore-Crenshaw and Doak \u2013 both of whom had designed courses at Bandon Dunes \u2013 among numerous firms that hoped to land the high-profile job. The two teams collaborated with each other to the extent of swapping a few holes that had initially been on each others' layouts.\n\n\"What we built is not your ordinary Florida golf course,\" Mack said. \"We hope to be included in the same conversation with the greatest golf resorts in the United States.\"\n\nThat is already taking place. Preliminary reports from Streamsong indicate that players love the open spaces, windswept dunes, native grasses, blow-out bunkers and water features that capture some of Sand Hills, some of Bandon, some of Long Island, and some of the British Isles while projecting a character all its own.\n\n\"Once Bill Coore got out here, he called Ben Crenshaw almost immediately and said, 'You are not going to believe what we're seeing here,' \" Mack said. \"Doak said, 'If I parachuted in, and you gave me 50 guesses where I am, my 47th guess would be Florida.' \"\n\nThough Mack will continue to spearhead the project from the Twin Cities, he expects to visit Streamsong up to 40 times in its inaugural season. His pride in the new resort is easy to discern.\n\n\"I love the game, and it's been a lifelong dream to work on this project,\" he said. \"This is a showcase illustration of what can be done on reclaimed land.\"\n\n]]> new Old Course\n 11 Dec 2012 19:57:19 +0000Rick Shefchik reading \u2192]]>The Royal & Ancient \u2014 the institution that oversees golf in all countries worldwide except the United States and Mexico \u2014 is not typically a lightning rod for controversy, but recent announcements have changed all that. Perhaps for many months.\nThe news that continues to make the biggest ripples through the golf world is that the R&A and USGA has made a joint proposal to ban anchored putting. But as this hot potato dominates golf headlines, the R&A also \u2014 quite stealthily \u2014 authorized renovations to four holes on golf's most revered and sacred playing ground, The Old Course at St. Andrews. The work began just two days after the plan was announced; five more holes are scheduled for renovations next winter. Included in the first round of \"improvements\" are the lowering of the back left portion of the 11th green (the par-3 Eden hole) to make it pinnable for competitions, and the moving and recontouring of the famous greenside Road hole bunker on the par-4 17th, ostensibly to gather more balls, but make it easier to escape from \u2014 more thrills for the Open Championship spectators and viewers.\nIn the past, tees have been added to lengthen The Old Course, and some minor alterations have been made to bunkers, including the Road hole bunker. But there is no precedent in the 20th century for the amount of work the R&A and the St. Andrews Links Trust have asked \u2014 or allowed \u2014 golf course architect Martin Hawtree to perform during this renovation.\nGolf lovers around the world \u2014 and, in particular, noted American golf course architects Tom Doak and Bob Cupp \u2014 are deeply dismayed at the scope of the alterations to golf's most significant and historic course. Doak has contemplated a petition against such arbitrary work at The Old Course, saying, in part, \"It is up to the professionals in the field to stand for something. If the contours of The Old Course can be changed on the advice of just one architect who thinks he knows better, then there is nothing sacred in golf architecture, and all our work is consigned to be destroyed by future generations that think they know better (or are pressured to agree).\"\nThe problem stems from the Old Course's status as the most frequent host site of the Open Championship. It is all but impossible for the course to be preserved as the wellspring of all golf course design, and kept relevant for long-hitting contemporary professionals. Yet that is what the Links Trust is attempting to do. While paying lip service to the Old Course's irreplaceable position in golf history, the Links Trust went ahead with changes that were recommended by the R&A's Championship Committee.\nAll students of the game \u2014 particularly architects \u2014 ought to travel to St. Andrews to learn how golf evolved from those seaside links to the vast variety of golf course styles now in use. If St. Andrews is to undergo constant renovation to keep it a worthy venue for contemporary tournaments, a priceless base point will be lost forever. It will be akin to the British Museum allowing its curators to doodle on their Egyptian sarcophagi to make sure they appeal to modern patrons.\nThe R&A brought this mess upon themselves. Along with the USGA, they allowed the equipment manufacturers to increase the size of clubheads and the distance that the golf ball will fly, thereby almost forcing tournament venues to lengthen and toughen their courses to combat longer drives. So now the game's most hallowed course needs to be renovated to continue as a worthy challenge to the game's best players? Whose fault would that be?\n]]> Away: Golf's Governors Pull Plug on Anchoring the Club\n 28 Nov 2012 21:29:33 +0000WP Ryan reading \u2192]]>The R&A and the USGA (the game's governing bodies) today announced a proposed rules change that prohibits anchoring the club in making a stroke. In a global news conference televised by the Golf Channel, the R&A's Peter Dawson and the USGA's Mike Davis explained that the rules-makers were seeing an increase in \"the advocacy\" of the anchored stroke at the elite amateur and junior levels, and that \"in the best interests of the game moving forward,\" it was time to further define the stroke, and get golf \"back to holding the club with two hands and swinging freely.\"\n\nThe use of an anchored stroke on the PGA Tour has seen steady increases since 2006, according to the rules-makers, with an almost 10 percent jump from 2010 to 2012. Three of the last five golf majors were won using longer putters and an anchored stroke, but the rules-makers were explicit in omitting the prohibition against the use of long or belly putters from the proposed anchoring rules change. In other words, long and belly-length putters are still ok \u2014 as long as the club is not anchored in making a stroke.\n\nThe USGA has created a handy \"infographic\" illustrating permitted and prohibited methods: click here. Below is the proposed rules language which would take effect on Jan. 1, 2016:\n\n14-1b Anchoring the ClubThe proposed rules change comes at a time when the business of golf has been buffeted by cultural changes, economic challenges and flagging participation. Opponents to 14-1b say the ban is ill-timed and question its impact on the growth of the game. Timing of the proposal aside, to conclude that prohibiting the anchor method of making a stroke, a ban that is effectively three years in the future, will have a negative impact on golf participation is to be ignorant of the factors that drive golf participation.\n\nHere in Minnesota, the two biggest factors driving golf participation are weather and access. Thanks largely to an early spring and favorable golf weather, rounds in 2012 were up 7.7 percent. Minnesota has long enjoyed one of the highest golfer participation rates in the country, due in large measure to access: about 90 percent of our golf courses are open to the public.\n\nI also happen to believe in a more anecdotal explanation for our inordinately out-sized love of the game here: Minnesotan's appreciate decent weather, we take advantage of getting outdoors at every opportunity, and playing golf is just one of the many ways we satisfy the urge to get outside and play.\n\n14-1b will change the way a small number of golfers swing the putter. For these golfers who've adopted the anchored stroke, whether as a first or last resort, they will have to conform to the rules and learn how to stroke the ball \"with two hands\u2026 swinging freely.\"\n\nIn any case, the rules-makers have upheld convention by a fine-tuning of the definition of the golf stroke \u2014 anchoring is on its way out. And in the big picture that's a good thing for the best interests of the game going forward."}

{"text":"5 Golf Mental Tips\n\nBy: Mason Kaho\n\nBreak Studios Contributing Writer\n\nLooking for five golf mental tips? Golf is first and foremost a mental game. With a sport that is frustrating and maddening as often it is fun and exhilarating, keeping your head in the game is important. There are five golf mental tips that can help you keep things under control.\n\nForgot the last shot. Getting psyched out about a bad shot will only have you tense and distracted as you prepare for the next one. Golf is a game that requires exact precision, and since you're not Tiger Woods you're bound to be off by just a bit, sending your ball off in the wrong direction. It can happen to anyone, and even happens to Woods on occasion too. One of golf's mental tips is to just put that bad shot of your head and move forward.\n\nShut out the rest of the world. A golf course is a bit like a theme park in that your closed off from the outside world and only see the landscaping and architecture that the course designer wants you to see. You're on the course to unwind and have fun, so put the job, the bills, the leaky faucet, whatever, out of your head. Follow this golf mental tip and find that you'll enjoy your round much more.\n\nDon't try to make every putt. It's not practical to spend ten minutes over a 60-foot putt. Just like you wouldn't expect to make a half-court shot in basketball, your key on long putts is to get them close enough that you can walk away with a two-putt for the hole. A good golf mental tip is to just get those long putts close. Don't sweat over trying to make them or you'll end up well off the mark.\n\nGet competitive. If you're out with your buddies and you don't already talk a little trash, try to get in their heads, and maybe put a little money on the line. You'll find that when you're not just playing for a good score you will be much more focused. Follow this golf mental tip and every great shot will be that much more invigorating, helping you enjoy your time on the course more and sending you to that next shot with confidence.\n\nDon't worry about making par. You shouldn't come to the hole thinking that you need a par, or that a double bogey will completely destroy your round. This puts a lot of pressure on every shot. Follow the golf mental tip of just taking one shot at a time, and hitting each shot as well as you can. Pretty soon you'll be stringing together several good shots in a row, and making par without even thinking about it."}

Tiger Woods hasn't changed much in 22 years.\n\nIn 1990, Earl Woods truly believed his son would grow up to be the next Jack Nicklaus. Before Tiger went to Stanford and won the U.S. Amateur three times in a row, Earl knew that as a black player with a Thai mother, Tiger would go on to become a global phenomenon. \"He can't lose,\" Earl said, \"unless he doesn't win. And I don't anticipate him not winning.\" And it's plain to see Tiger didn't anticipate losing much either.\n\nTo see Tiger Woods at 14 speak so candidly and confidently on the burden of his own enormous talent, the overbearing expectation of challenging Jack Nicklaus (he had a poster of Jack hanging in his room), and the divisive factor of his own race in a sport governed by old white men is astonishing.

There are 52 cards, each having a different situation and corresponding challenge. Too often you lose focus when practicing, which leads to bad habits and makes practice time less productive. Each Golf Challenge Card\u2122 presents a shot that you could face on the course and then puts a little pressure on you to try and achieve a certain goal. This type of practice simulates how you feel on the course, which helps you to be more effective when it counts.\n\nGolf Challenge Cards\u2122 can be used as you practice on your own or play a game with others.\nPracticing On Your Own: Start by shuffling the deck (part of the fun is in not knowing what your challenge might be). Flip over the top card to reveal your challenge. If you haven't done so, now is the time to decide which level you should tackle. Try to pick a level that matches your skill, yet still presents a challenge. Here is a general guide for choosing an appropriate level:\n\nIn some cases there may be a little setup time required. Having a small tape measure and tees handy can be helpful. After getting set up then you are ready to take on the challenge. Try to stick with it until the card has been completed.\n\nPracticing With Others: The Golf Challenge Cards\u2122 Game.\n\n2 to 4 players (Takes 60 minutes to play)\n\nSetting up the game\n\nStart by giving the deck a good shuffle. Take the top 4 cards, look at the and complete any necessary setup work for each card.\n\nPlaying the Game\n1. Determine each player's base level. The base level is the level a player must achieve to get any points for that card. Pick levels that are appropriate for each player's skill level.\n2. Each player starts with 1 of the 4 Golf Challenge Cards\u2122 that was drawn. Each player has 12 minutes to try to complete their card at their designated level. If completed before the time runs out the player may try to achieve the next level up, which will result in extra points.\n3. After time expires move to the next card and reset the timer. Continue until every player has tried all 4 challenges.\n\nCalculating Scores\n\nFor each card you completed at your assigned level you get the value of the card. Jacks, Queens, Kings and Aces are all worth 11 points. Add 3 points if you were able to also accomplish the next higher level. For example, if you completed the King of spades, the 4 of diamonds and finished the 7 of hearts at the next level, but failed to finish the Jack of diamonds, then you would get 11+4+10 for a total of 25 points. The player with the most points wins. In case of a tie, draw one card from the deck; the player to complete this new challenge first wins. Download this Scorecard for team play"}

{"text":"Lower scores by focusing on a short-game practice\n\nYou have a respectable game of golf that comes and goes, just like the rest of us, but even on those days that you seem to hit the ball better, your score seems to be the same.\n\nHow do you get those scores lower and, ultimately, have more fun?\n\nTake responsibility for your score and improve your short game. By identifying your strengths and weaknesses and applying simple methods for quick skill improvement you can manage your own game and lower you scores. Also, with better shot selection and a short game 'cheat sheet' you can hit less than perfect golf shots that will still be fine and help to lower your scores without necessarily improving your skills.\n\nTechniques to lower your score by improving your short game:\n\nIn order to lower your score you must first determine what areas of your game need the most work. As you play your rounds, make small notes on the side of your scorecard. If there are recurring problems these are the areas you should focus your practice.\n\n2. Learn to putt and control your distance.\n\nBecoming a good putter requires a good set up and a few basic fundamentals. Once you bend forward from your hips so that your eyes are over your golf ball and your hands hang directly below your shoulders, you will be able to isolate your upper body and make a proper putting stroke where only the triangle formed by your arms moves. Next, you have to practice to learn to control distance. Any spare time you can find to practice stroking medium to longer putts to learn to control your speed and distance will automatically help to lower your scores.\n\n3. Putt whenever you can.\n\nThere are a lot more times when you can putt and might not realize it. Other than putting from the green you can also putt from the fringe or collar, up closely mown hills, from farther away from the green in short manicured grass or just into the rough, greenside. Because there are very few moving parts when you putt and the ball generally does not get into the air, it is a very low maintenance choice and therefore more forgiving and consistent.\n\n4. Become a good chipper.\n\nOther than putting, chipping is the lowest risk shot. Once your set up is proper, gripping low, stance narrow, weight and shaft of the club leaning forward, the stroke is just like that of putting. Because the stroke is relatively small, you are more likely to be more consistent and any miss will be less penalizing.\n\n5. Only pitch the ball when you have to.\n\nWhen you are in a short game situation where you need more carry in the air than there is room for the ball to roll, you will have to pitch with your sand wedge. Because a larger swing will be necessary to carry the ball a greater distance in the air, this shot will be riskier and should only be used when you have ruled out all other options.\n\n- Kellie Stenzel, PGA, has been named by Golf Magazine as one of the Top 100 Teachers in America, and has been a Golf For Women Top 50 teacher since 1999.

{"text":"What Tour Players Do That You Don't Know The Only Fundamental In Putting\n\nRandy Joyner, PGA\n\nPutting. It's the most important part of the game and without a doubt the most individualistic part of the game. I believe one reason players struggle with putting is due to the massive amount of information available to them. Different grips, stances, setups, and putters all contribute to the confusion. This tip will make much easier and open your eyes to what all tour players all ready know. With all the different styles in putting what is the one thing that all the great players have in common. Ever notice that nearly every tour player sets up with only the right hand on the putter first as in the picture below.\n\nThe only thing you need to do to be a great putter is have the right forearm \"in-line\" with the shaft at address. This is the reason you see so many different grips as well as a big reason you see belly putters and long putters. If a player can't get the forearm in-line the putter will not swing in its true arc and the putt will be pulled or pushed. This is where all the different ways to grip the putter originated. If you can't get the arm in line as seen here try left hand low, the claw, or the belly putter. With some many players using the belly putter you can quickly see that it is impossible to not be in-line with a belly putter because when looking down the line you can tell the player even has a belly putter because the right forearm covers the top end of the grip as seen below.\n\nWith any of those different styles its impossible to not get the right forearm in-line with the shaft. Learning to make the correct stroke is simple when you have the only fundamental in putting."}

This may vary based on the time of day, time of week and the status of the golfer. Weekends are normally higher than week days. Afternoon and evening games tend to be discounted if it is questionable as to whether or not all 18 holes can be played. Club members, juniors, seniors and veterans frequently receive discounted or special rates.\n\nHow do I find tee times? Courses will have a list of available start (tee) times available at the front desk and often times on their website.\n\nCan you play golf year round in Myrtle Beach? Yes. Many of the courses in Myrtle Beach are open all year round.\n\nWhat do the ratings mean? Courses are rated on a scale of 67-77 and the lower the rating the more playable (easier) the course.\n\nWhere can I rent a golf cart? Many golf courses have carts available on site and often include their rental as part of the greens fee. Another source for golf cart rentals are through various local dealers.\n\nWhat type of turf can I expect in Myrtle Beach golf courses? Considering the area's subtropical climate most golfers will find Bermuda and Creeping Bentgrass along the fairways, tee boxes and putting greens.\n\nWhere can I get equipment? There are various pro-shops in the area such as Golf Dimensions and Martin's PGA Tour Superstore. Many golf courses in the area also have their own on-site pro shop."}
{"text":"(born March 17, 1902, Atlanta, Ga., U.S.\u2014died Dec. 18, 1971, Atlanta) U.S. golfer. Jones won 13 major championships between 1923 and 1930, a feat unequaled until 1973. In 1930 he became the first golfer to achieve the grand-slam of his time\u2014the British and U.S. Open and Amateur championships\u2014after which he retired from competitive golf at the age of 28, having never become a professional. Jones helped establish the Masters Tournament, one of the four major tournaments that make up the modern grand-slam of golf (the other three being the British Open, the U.S. Open, and the PGA Championship).\n\nRobert Tyre \"Bobby\" Jones Jr. (March 17, 1902 \u2013 December 18, 1971) was one of the greatest golfers to compete on a national and international level. He participated only as an amateur, primarily on a part-time basis, and chose to retire from competition at age 28.\n\nExplaining his decision to retire, Jones said, \"It (championships) is something like a cage. First you are expected to get into it and then you are expected to stay there. But of course, nobody can stay there.\n\nJones is most famous for his unique \"Grand Slam,\" consisting of his victory in all four major golf tournaments of his era (the open and amateur championships in both the U.S. & Britain) in a single calendar year (1930).\n\nEarly years\n\nJones was born in Atlanta, Georgia. He was a child prodigy, who won his first children's tournament at the age of six and made the third round of the U.S. Amateur Championship at 14. That same year, 1916, he won the Georgia State Amateur Championship for his first important title at Capital City Club located in Brookhaven, where he became an active member later in life. He was trained and coached by club professional Stewart Maiden, a native of Carnoustie, Scotland, who was a very fine player. Jones played frequently with his father, Col. Robert P. Jones, a skilled player himself. The younger Jones sometimes battled his own temper on the course, but later cured this problem as he became more experienced. Jones toured the U.S. during World War I from 1917-18, playing exhibition matches before large crowds to generate income for war relief. He qualified for his first U.S. Open at age 18 in 1920. He won the Southern Amateur three times, 1917, 1920, and 1922.\n\nFirst majors\n\nAs an adult, he hit his stride in 1923, when he won his first U.S. Open. From that win at New York's Inwood Country Club, through his 1930 victory in the U.S. Amateur, he won 13 major championships (as they were counted at the time) in 20 attempts. Jones was the first player to win The Double, both the U.S. Open and the British Open in the same year (1926). He is still the only player ever to have won the Grand Slam, or all four major championships, in the same year (1930). He represented the United States in the Walker Cup five times, winning nine of his 10 matches. He also won two other tournaments against professionals: the 1927 Southern Open and the 1930 Southeastern Open. Jones was a life-long member of the Atlanta Athletic Club (at the club's original site, now the East Lake Golf Club), and the Capital City Club in Atlanta.\n\nSportsmanship\n\nJones was not only a consummately skilled golfer, but he also exemplified the principles of sportsmanship and fair play. Early in his amateur career, he was in the final playoff of the 1925 U.S. Open at the Worcester Country Club. During the match, his ball ended up in the rough just off the fairway, and as he was setting up to play his shot his iron caused a slight movement of the ball. He immediately got angry with himself, turned to the marshals, and called a penalty on himself. The marshals discussed among themselves and questioned some of the gallery if anyone had seen Jones' ball move. Their decision was that neither they nor anyone else had witnessed any incident, so the decision was left to Jones. Bobby Jones called the two-stroke penalty on himself, not knowing that he would lose the tournament by one stroke. When he was praised for his gesture, Jones replied, \"You may as well praise a man for not robbing a bank.\" The USGA's sportsmanship award is named the Bob Jones Award in his honor.\n\nSt Andrews, Scotland\n\nJones had a unique relationship with the town of St Andrews, Scotland. On his first appearance on the Old Course in British Open of 1921, he withdrew after 11 holes in the third round. He firmly stated his dislike for the Old Course and the town reciprocated, saying in the press, \"Master Bobby is just a boy, and an ordinary boy at that.\" Later, he came to love the Old Course and the town like few others. When he won the Open at the Old Course in 1927, he wowed the crowd by asking that the trophy remain with his friends at the Royal and Ancient Golf Club rather than return with him to Atlanta. In 1958, he was named a Freeman of the City of St Andrews, becoming only the second American to be so honored, the other being Benjamin Franklin in 1759. Today, a scholarship exchange bearing the Jones name exists between the University of St Andrews and both Emory University and the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. At Emory, four students are sent to St Andrews for an all-expenses-paid year of study and travel. In return, Emory accepts four students from St Andrews each year. The program, the Robert T. Jones Scholarship, is among the most prestigious scholarships offered by either university.\n\nJones was married in 1924 to the former Mary Rice Malone. They had three children, Clara, Robert Tyre III, and Mary Ellen. When he retired from golf at age 28, he concentrated on his Atlanta law practice. That same year, 1930, he was honored with the first James E. Sullivan Award, awarded annually by the Amateur Athletic Union to the most outstanding amateur athlete in the United States. He did in fact turn professional at golf after he retired from competition, in order to accept fees. In addition, he made eighteen instructional films, worked with A.G. Spalding & Co. to develop the first set of matched clubs, co-designed the Augusta National course with Alister MacKenzie, and founded The Masters Tournament, first played at Augusta in March 1934. During World War II, while he was serving as an officer in the U.S. Army Air Forces, Jones permitted the U.S. Army to graze cattle on the grounds at Augusta National. Later, in 1945, he founded Peachtree Golf Club in Atlanta and co-designed the course with Robert Trent Jones.\n\nJones did play in the Masters every year it was held until 1948, when he was 46 years old. By then, his health had declined to the stage where this was no longer possible. But with his health difficulties, and being past his prime and not competing elsewhere to stay in tournament form, he never truly contended to win the Masters, although his scores were usually respectable. These were largely ceremonial performances, since his main duty was as host of the event. His extraordinary popularity, efforts with the course design, and tournament organization boosted the profile of the Masters significantly. The tournament, jointly run by Jones and Clifford Roberts, made many important innovations which became the norm elsewhere, such as gallery ropes to control the flow of the large crowds, many scoreboards around the course, the use of red \/ green numbers on those scoreboards to denote under \/ over par scores, an international field of top players, high-caliber television coverage, and week-long admission passes for patrons, which became extremely hard to obtain. The tournament also sought and welcomed feedback from players, fans, and writers, leading to continual improvement over the years. The Masters gradually evolved to being one of the most respected tournaments in the world, one of the four major championships.\n\nIncapacity and death\n\nIn 1948, Jones was diagnosed with syringomyelia, a fluid-filled cavity in his spinal cord which caused first pain, then paralysis. He was eventually restricted to a wheelchair. He died in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 18, 1971, about a week after becoming a Catholic, and was buried in Atlanta's historic Oakland Cemetery. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1974.\n\nNT = No tournament\nDNP = Did not play\nWD = Withdrew\nR32, R16, QF, SF = Round in which Jones lost in amateur match play\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place\nGreen background for wins. Yellow background for top-10.\n\nJones was the subject of the quasi-biographical 2004 feature film Bobby Jones: A Stroke of Genius in which he was portrayed by James Caviezel. The film was a major box office flop, grossing only $1.2 million the first weekend and $2.7 million overall, against a production cost of over $17 million. The film was also littered with historical inaccuracies. The Jones legend was also used to create a supporting character in The Legend of Bagger Vance in 2000, and the event where he called his own penalty is used for the main character, Rannulph Junuh.\n\nBooks\n\nJones authored several books on golf including Down the Fairway with O.B. Keeler (1927), The Rights and Wrongs of Golf (1933), Golf Is My Game (1959), Bobby Jones on Golf (1966), and Bobby Jones on the Basic Golf Swing (1968) with illustrator Anthony Ravielli.\n\nJones has been the subject of several books, most notably The Bobby Jones Story and A Boy's Life of Bobby Jones, both by O.B. Keeler. Other notable texts are The Life and Times of Bobby Jones: Portrait of a Gentleman by Sidney L. Matthew, The Greatest Player Who Never Lived by J. Michael Veron, and Triumphant Journey: The Saga of Bobby Jones and The Grand Slam of Golf by Richard Miller. Published in 2006, \"The Grand Slam\" by Mark Frost has received much note as being evocative of Jones' life and times.\n\nBobby Jones Golf Company\n\nFounded in 2003, the Bobby Jones Golf Company designs, develops, and sells metal-wood golf clubs. The company has an exclusive, worldwide license agreement with the family of Bobby Jones (known as Jonesheirs, Inc.) and the internationally renowned Hartmarx Corporation for the use of the Bobby Jones name for golf equipment and golf accessories."}

{"text":"Junior Golf \u2013 Practice Your Weakness, Maintain Your Strengths\n\nWhen I think of Junior Golf, I think of the future. What things can I do to ensure that they learn to love the game and play it for a lifetime? Surely, if they are interested in competing, I am happy to help them down that road as well. I think we can all agree that one of the boundaries to the game is its difficulty. There are many things being written about making golf fun and helping juniors build golf skills but this post will be for the slightly older junior that has made a choice to spend extra time on this sport.\n\nAs always, this is just my opinion and part of my observation as a coach of juniors and as a coach of a 3 time NJCAA National Championship squad. I think as golfers, we can agree that the individuals playing the game will tend to notice things they are good at and things that need more work. How many times as a coach have you had a junior student come to you and say, \"I really need help with my (\"X\") but not on (\"Y\") cause I do that pretty well. Sometimes they have made a correct assessment and sometimes they haven't. Part of our job as the coach is to help them determine what skills are appropriate for that particular scoring level or the scoring level they are striving for. This is one place that I think Shot by Shot can really help. Shot by Shot is an analysis program that will help the junior golfer and the coach direct the practice.\n\nMany times, I will watch junior golfers practice and they will be practicing the one thing they do really well. It could be anything from their short game to the their driving. While this makes for great fun while practicing, how much is it improving their skill set. Golf is a game which requires skills that need to be called upon one at a time from a vast array of possibilities. This requires the student to be proficient in many things so they can call upon them when needed. Some skills are used much more often than others but the lesser used skills need to be practiced as well.\n\nI constantly remind my junior golfers to practice their weaknesses and maintain their strengths. I think the meaning of this statement is quite clear. I hear them say too often that, \"I practiced my putting so much that my I lost my wedge play.\" I think it's important for them to know that they can't ignore the skills they do well. I recommend that they use a rotating practice schedule that has a majority of the time focused on those skills that need a little work but never ignores the skills they are doing well. Don't forget to cover all the bases from the fitness levels to the mental game.\n\nIs this schedule organic? You bet it is. We are constantly upgrading it to reflect current conditions and measuring those skills to help define the plan. Can it be done without a measuring program? Of course it can but I think my junior golfers like to see the charts and graphs that Shot by Shot provides. Plus it gives me a chance to see if what I am seeing as a weakness is actually hurting their game. Many times I have had a belief of a weakness that, for what ever reason, didn't seem to appear during their practice or competitive rounds. As coaches, we need to be aware that the practice ground and the field of play are very different animals and need to be treated as such.\n\nI encourage you to chat with your junior golfers about their game as often as you can. Provide them a schedule to follow that touches on all parts of their game but focuses on the skills that need the most time.\n\nImagine the chain in the above picture as your players set of skills. If you put the pressure of a tournament round on that chain, I think we can all agree where the chain might break.\n\nThe goal is to create a chain of skills of equal strength.\n\nPlease pass this on to your junior golfer via Facebook by clicking on the share button or email if you think they find some value in this post.\n\n7 comments\n\nGreat post John. I use Shot by Shot and feel that it is the best golfstats program out there. I love that you get the \"Improvement Opportunity\" as the first thing you see. Also, the ability to compare current results\/stats with the results\/stats of a target group is pretty important in the stages of development. It is not so easy as a 10 handicap player to always compare to PGA Tour stats (can create an negative effect sometimes).\n\nOne question though: Being in a cold climate part of the world, how do you prioritize what they should be working on during the competitive season?\n\nAs a cold climate coach, I notice that most players spend the early spring focused solely on regaining their swing. For most of them, the swing comes back quicker than they might think.\n\nFor almost all of them, their short game is so far behind their ball striking it is glaring. It's nice to have something that clearly shows them the stark reality.\n\nHonestly, during the competitive season, I let their game prioritize the practice. When I mentioned the schedule is organic and can change week to week, that was true. Truthfully, it usually turns out the focus needs to be on short game but we don't ignore the long game.\n\nI'm not sure I answered your question so please let me know if I didn't.\n\nJohn,\nAs always, great information. I am a big proponent of letting the math deliver the message. An analysis program like Peter's lets them see clearly what they need to be spending their time on. Do you make the Shot by Shot subscription mandatory?"}
{"text":"National News\n\n'The Big Swing' in Wimborne, Dorset, aims to feature 1,000 children in record golf day\n\n18 04 2012\n\nOne thousand primary schoolchildren from Dorset are expected to take part in 'The Big Swing' this Friday (20 April) \u2013 showing off their new golf skills in an event that is likely to be a UK record.\n\nThe Big Swing, held at Canford Park, Wimborne, is believed to be the biggest ever golf event of its kind for children in the UK. It is the pinnacle of the area's 'HSBC Golf Roots' project, a national initiative run by the Golf Foundation, the leading golf charity that aims to make golf more accessible to children from all backgrounds and circumstances.\n\nWhile the accent for the day is on fun, teams of 10 children will all be trying their best to win The Big Swing for their school. \"The whole idea about The Big Swing is for all these boys and girls to have great fun and get a further taste of what golf has to offer,\" said Golf Foundation Regional Development Officer Sam Stephens.\n\n\"Golf can be for everyone and is a great sport for youngsters as it promotes life skills like honesty, integrity, co-operation and perseverance. There is also a competitive edge to The Big Swing which makes it exciting, but we aim to ensure that every one of the thousand boys and girls has a great experience.\"\n\nThe Big Swing project has provided a first introduction to golf for children all over the Dorset school area and has involved 36 schools with training for many teachers. Youngsters have been enjoying the easy-to-play golf format called 'Tri-Golf' during their PE lessons and after-school clubs. Canford Magna Golf Club has been a strong supporter and the club's PGA Professional Darren Stratman, the founder of The Big Swing, has been regularly coaching youngsters in the schools. A number of teachers have been so inspired they are sending a whole year of teams along for the day.\n\nDarren has also been training some 200 Young Leaders to help on Friday; 14-17 year-olds who will gain valuable experience as volunteers as they mentor the young children in their games. The leaders will oversee eight-game competitions between schools and the two winning teams of ten children will go forward to Dorset's 'School Games' finals in June, held in Bournemouth to coincide with the arrival in London of the Olympic Torch.\n\nPGA Professional Darren Stratman said: \"This is the third year of The Big Swing and we have been amazed at how local schools have got behind this. Last year we had 550 youngsters playing and there was clearly a demand then to create even more opportunity for boys and girls of all abilities. This year we believe we will reach 1,000 youngsters which will be a UK and possibly world record!\"\n\nHe added: \"The great thing about the event is it can mix easily really exciting school competition with the fun format Tri-Golf, which so many youngsters can enjoy. We have been thrilled to introduce many new children to golf and to train so many volunteers who we believe will also gain much from the experience.\"\n\nA group of Bournemouth University students is also helping Darren during the project, as part of their Golf Management studies course work.\n\nDarren revealed that World Trick Shot Champion Geoff Swain will also be showing off some of his best tricks for all the youngsters present on Friday. Darren added: \"It is great that Geoff can help us on the day and I'd also like to thank Canford Magna Golf Club for their support in enabling me to put this event together with the excellent support of Sam Stephens and the Golf Foundation.\"\n\nThe Golf Foundation is aiming to reach one million children per year through its national programme, HSBC Golf Roots. To achieve this, it has a fundraising target of \u00a33 million per year. HSBC Golf Roots is already supported by The R&A, The European Tour, the Professional Golfers' Association, the Ryder Cup Committee and Trust, the British Golf Industry Association's 'Grow Golf' Fund, Sport England and headline sponsor HSBC, who collectively contribute just under \u00a32 million.\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n* To learn more about The Big Swing, go to \n* To learn more about HSBC Golf Roots and the Golf Foundation call 01992 449830 or see \n* For media information on the Golf Foundation, call Ben Evans on 01747 820384 or 07789 722853.\n\nNotes for editors:\n* The Golf Foundation is a British Isles charity dedicated to bringing more young people into the sport.\n* The Golf Foundation is committed to developing the sport at the junior level by supporting the implementation of national development plans and by working in partnership with the golfing bodies in England, Wales and Scotland.\n* Each year more than 750,000 children across the British Isles benefit from the initiatives and resources available through the Golf Foundation."}
{"text":"GolfGist.com\n\nA Good Golf Pre-Shot Routine: Necessity for Every Golfer\n\nIan Hughes, PGA Teaching Professional, GolfTEC\n\nYou might ask yourself, \"Why do I need a pre-shot routine?\" Or for that\nmatter, \"What is a pre shot routine?\" A pre-shot routine is quite simply\nthe habits or actions one takes in the few seconds before the golf swing\nis made.\n\nSo, why is a good routine necessary? It is important because it allows us\nto relax, and it enables us to develop something that is repeatable in a\ngame where even the best players in the world struggle with constancy,\naccuracy, and repetition.\n\nThe next question to ask yourself is, \"Do I have a pre-shot routine?\" If\nthe answer is \"yes\", is it a good one? If the answer is \"no\", your golf\ngame will benefit from developing one.\n\nLet's take a look at some components of professional's pre-shot routines\nvs. amateur's routines to see how yours measures up.\n\nThe difference that I see between most amateurs and professionals lies in\nthe quality of their pre-shot routines and their ability to repeat their\nroutine time in and time out. Most amateurs will hastily walk up to the\nball and then make two practice swings, then one time they will make no\npractice swings, and then waggle three times the next. These random\nactions breed inconsistency.\n\nMeanwhile, professionals will go through the same repeatable course of\naction each time. This enables them to put their mind at rest. By knowing\nyou have done your routine thousands of times, it allows the mind to focus\non the actual shot at hand, thereby eliminating negative thoughts, which\nwreak havoc on most amateur golfers. A good pre-shot routine will also\ndistract you from the pressure of each shot. You can concentrate on\nrepeating your routine, rather than worry about the possible negative\noutcomes of the shot at hand.\n\nA great example of this would be David Toms' performance during the 2001\nPGA Championship at the Atlanta Athletic Club. Toms had a 12-foot putt on\nthe 72nd hole to win his first major championship. Toms was able to focus\non the task at hand by relying on his pre-shot routine. It enabled him to\nput his pounding heart and shaking hands aside and concentrate on his\nspeed, line and stroke. When the ball was halfway to the hole, Toms knew\nhe had sunk the putt and won his first major championship.\n\nA good pre-shot routine is beneficial to players of all abilities. Not all\npre-shot routines should be the same, but yours should be one that is\nrepeatable and relaxing.\n\nHere are a few tips to work with to develop a good pre-shot routine.\n\nStart behind the golf ball and envision your target.\nOnce you have focused on a target, make a practice swing with your eyes\nremaining focused on your target.\nAs you swing, envision the perfect result from your shot.\nNow step up to the ball and take your address.\nOnce you are comfortable with your address, take a deep breath, releasing\nthe tension in your body as you exhale.\nFinally, take one last look at target to improve focus and let it rip.\n\nIf you are having a problem developing a good pre-shot routine,\ntry  for some help or read some more of our free\ntips."}

{"text":"The New Rules of Golf Instruction Blog and Golf Tips\n\nMy Assistant Teacher, Ben Austin and I just videotaped our first installment of a Winter Practice Program for everybody. We gave a talk to our Member Coaching group Tuesday afternoon and it sparked an idea to give our blog readers weekly updates and nudges to make your golf game better during the winter.\n\nSome of the games best golfers came from cold climates. These golfers had an opportunity each winter to get away from golf and get a fresh perspective. It was also a chance to practice indoors and practice in a mirror. Getting repetitions without a golf ball or with less consequences allows habits to develop (read \"The New Rules of Golf Instruction\" Chapter on Practice for more ideas on how to Practice effectively).\n\nWe are urging you to use this winter to really focus on skill-building. We will be posting videos to give you ideas of what to work on and how to work on it. We recommend a putting mat and an eyelinegolf.com Putting Plane training aid.\n\nWatch the video below and tell your golfing friends to sign up for the blog to become part of our Winter Practice Program.\n\nEssential #6 is the Swing Plane. The shape of the swing is not a natural thing. Most of us will naturally think taking the club down the target line will hit the ball straighter. Many of us have thought \"Straight back and Straight Through\" will hit the ball to the target. A key thing to remember is we stand to the side of the ball and bend over to the ball. These factors lead to the shape of swing that works best.\n\nIn the video below I will explain some key information and demonstrate a drill or two that will give you the right idea and how to make it a habit in your golf game. Watch the video below and pass it on to your golfing friends who need some help.\n\nSam Froggate and the good folks at eyelinegolf.com are dedicated to golfers improving their putting. They specialize in putting training aids for golf that are innovative and practical.\n\nYou know my New Rules philosophy is all about developing skills. Good drills and solid training aids are how you build habits. My favorite putting training aid is the Putting Plane. I just did a putting tip for eyelinegolf.com and will let you know when it has been edited and ready for viewing.\n\nThe number of views for yesterdays question lets me know I need to answer more of your questions. I am going to start with the golf swing. I will then answer your questions for short game, mental toughness, etc.\n\nPlease, in the comments section below, give me your questions regarding the golf swing. I will answer one or two a week for the next month and then move to another topic. - - -\n\nOur New Rules Essential Skills series continues. The first week we got your Pre-Swing to be solid. The second and third week we got you to hit the ball solidly. The forth week we swung the club with rhythm. This week I want to have you focus on the #1 key to direction control - club face angle at impact.\n\nOver the years, I have heard teachers and players claim that this happens automatically if you do some other move correctly (usually with the body). I also hear too many times about how the hands are not trustworthy. These thoughts are flat out not true. The New Rules way of thinking says golf is about being skillful. The squaring of the club face will seem to happen automatically for the golfer who has practiced and become skillful at this move.\n\nThe video I have included has been viewed almost 8,000 times and it contains the drills I recommend to become skillful and eventually make it where your clubface seems to square up automatically. Clubface awareness is an Essential Skill that every golfer must master to hit the ball to the intended target.\n\n\"The New Rules of Golf Instruction\" continues to gain momentum with golfers and golf instructors alike. I spoke to a group of PGA professionals in the Tennessee PGA Section on Monday, Nov. 30 and a second semester group at the Professional Golfers Career College on Tuesday, Dec. 1. Follow the link above to download this critical book for your ultimate improvement. Long time PGA professional Bobby Greenwood told me he thinks New Rules has a chance \"to change golf instruction and golf improvement to a logical approach that guarantees success for the golfer.\""}

All of those rotation muscles or turning musclesare going to be used, so we have to make sure before you start hittingthat those are warmed up and ready to go.The second engine is my arms, my wrists, and my elbows.In my golf swing, in the back swing, my wrists are going to set.As they come down in to the ball, they're going to hold that angleand then release the club powerfully onto the ball,and then as I go through, they reset.So, you can see there's a huge amount of action on my wrists, my elbows, and my shoulders.We need to make sure we really warm those up,because I'm the center of the circle, and my arms are rolling around me.You can see my left arm stays straight there.My right arm is folding.As I come back done, both arms are straightening.As I go through, my right arm rolls over my left, and my left is folding.We've got a huge amount of action in the golf swing.We've got what your body does. All of those turning muscles and holding muscles.We've got what your wrists do--setting, holding the load of the club,and then releasing all that power to the ball.What we need to do for you in your warm up is to get your body ready to do that.We need to make sure it's injury prevention, and also to maximum your golf game out on the golf course.You're also going to be on the golf course for at least 4 hours.You're going to be walking 6-1\/2 to 7 miles carrying your golf bag.You need to think about what you're going to put into your body to maketo make sure it can handle what you're going to need it to do out on the golf course.So, water, hydration, is absolutely a vital point.Make sure not only that you're drinking fluids before you go out, but that you keep topping yourself up as you go around.Also, think about what you eat before you go and play golf.A hamburger and chips tastes great but if you've got that in your tummy,your body is using a lot of energy to digest that,which means you don't have access to that for you golf swings.Food and water--absolutely vital out there.What we're talking about is getting you to be physically ready to play golfand to have your body help you all the way around the golf course.[\u266a\u266a][Steaming Well][ - copyright 2012]\n\nAbout\n\nGolf pro Simon Holmes talks about creating speed and control for an effective golf swing and how to warm up your upper and lower body as well as your arms hips and elbows.

{"text":"Video:What Is a Scramble?\n\nA scramble is a common golf game for charity events but it's different from traditional stroke play. Here is a guide to how to play a golf scramble.See Transcript\n\nSHARE ON\n\nTranscript:What Is a Scramble?\n\nThis is Todd Kolb with About.com. Today, we are going to talk about the scramble format in golf.\n\nRules of a Golf Scramble\n\nThe scramble is one of the primary forms of tournament play for golf associations, charity events and the like. The scramble is usually played in four person teams or two person teams. For two person scramble, handicaps are usually used applied. And a four person scramble, handicaps are not usually used. In a scramble, each player tees off on a hole, the best of the tee shots is selected and all the players play their second shot from that spot. The best of the second shots is determined, then all play their third shots from that spot and so on until the ball is holed. So in a typical scramble event, we can be on a four person team or a two person team.\n\nExample of a Golf Scramble\n\nToday, Alex and I are going to be on a two person scramble. First thing we are going to do, we're both going to hit our tee shots, we're going to see which shot we like the best and then we'll go from there. All right, so Alex and I have both hit our tee shots and we've certainly chosen that hers is a better position than mine is, so I picked my golf ball up and we're going to both hit a shot here now from where Alex hit her original drive. Okay so we've made it up here to the green again and Alex has hit it inside my ball, so since we're a team in this type of format, a scramble format, we're going to go ahead and putt from her ball. Well, we just finished that hole up in what we call a scramble format. We both hit tee shots, we hit second shots and with each one of those we picked whichever shot we thought was the best for our team until we completed the hole.\n\nFor more information, visit About.com.\n\nAbout videos are made available on an \"as is\" basis, subject to the User Agreement."}

{"text":"John Shippen worked as the head\nprofessional at Shady Rest Golf & Country Club until\nretiring in 1960. (USGA Museum)\n\nIn more than 70 years of collecting golf's history, the USGA\nMuseum has been privileged to obtain invaluable treasures that\nare essential to the game's legacy. There are also artifacts in\nthe collection that command an importance not just in the\nhistory of golf, but in American history. Such is the case with\na club made and used by John Shippen Jr. (1879 - 1968), an\nAfrican-American golfer who was a rarity in his time.\n\nOriginally from Washington, D.C., John Shippen was one of nine\nchildren born to a minister and his wife. Shippen's father\nmoved the family to Southampton, N.Y., in 1889, where he was\nsent to serve as a preacher on the Shinnecock Indian\nReservation. Shippen was 10 years old at the time and\nbefriended a young member of the Shinnecock tribe named Oscar\nBunn. When Shinnecock Hills Golf Club opened in 1891, the two\nboys became caddies. Showing natural talent for the game,\nShippen was taken under the wing of Shinnecock's golf\nprofessional, Willie Dunn. He benefited from Dunn's\ninstruction, becoming an excellent golfer who was better than\nmost members at this pioneering American golf club. Dunn\nrewarded Shippen with the assistant professional position,\nwhich allowed him the opportunity to give lessons, repair clubs\nand play the course regularly.\n\nWhen the second U.S. Open was played at Shinnecock Hills in\n1896, the club's members paid entrance fees for both Shippen\nand Bunn, believing strongly in their talents for the game. It\nhas been said that the day before the championship was to\nbegin, various English and Scottish players threatened USGA\nPresident Theodore F. Havemeyer with their withdrawals if Bunn\nand Shippen were allowed to play, citing their races as\nobjectionable. Havemeyer explained to the players that the\nchampionship would proceed as planned, even if Bunn and Shippen\nwere the only two competitors. The next morning, on July 18,\n1896, the second U.S. Open Championship was under way, with all\n32 players reporting for their tee times. Shippen finished the\nchampionship in fifth place, but the next day the Chicago\nTribune observed that \"anyone who plays Shippen has got to\nforget his boyishness, and pay careful attention to his golf,\nfor Shippen is, in view of the circumstances, the most\nremarkable player in the United States.\" John Shippen had\nbecome the first African-American to compete in the U.S. Open.\n\nShippen decided to forego any further education and pursue a\ncareer in golf. He went on to compete in the U.S. Open in 1899,\n1900, 1902 and 1913, but his race was a continuous obstacle as\nhe was frequently denied the chance to play when he attempted\nto enter other tournaments. Nonetheless, Shippen never\nabandoned his passion for the game and was appointed as the\ngolf professional at various golf clubs throughout his career.\n\nBut with \"J.M. Shippen\" stamped prominently on top of the wooden\nclub in the USGA Museum collection it is hard to resist asking the\nquestion: could Shippen have used this club in his appearance at\nthe 1896 U.S. Open? As tempting as it might be to think this club\nwas used at that historic occasion, Shippen's position as a golf\nprofessional provided him opportunity to make and sell his own\nclubs over a number of years and he could well have made the club\nfor individual use or for sale in his shop. But when did he do so?\n\nCrucial to the question is whether the club in the USGA Museum's\ncollection pre-dates or post-dates Shippen's participation in the\n1896 U.S. Open. According to Pete Georgiady, author of several\nbooks and an expert on early clubs and clubmakers, the stamp on the\nclub that reads \"J.M. Shippen\" was created by a die-cut stamp. This\nis evident in the uniformity of the letters. Earlier clubs created\nor owned by Shippen have been found to have a more irregular stamp,\na sign that the letters were imprinted individually. A die-cut\nstamp, which cost about $10, a tidy sum at the turn of the century,\nwould have only been purchased by Shippen if he were creating and\nselling his own clubs on a regular basis, according to Georgiady.\nAs he was not in a position to do that as a teenager at the 1896\nU.S. Open it is unlikely he could have used this club.\n\nBy the late 1920s, Shippen was head professional at a club owned\nand operated by African-Americans in Scotch Plains, N.J., the Shady\nRest Golf & Country Club (now known as the Scotch Hills Country\nClub), where he would remain until his retirement in 1960. In an\ninterview with\nTuesday Magazine\n, Shippen once said, \"I wonder if I did the right thing when I quit\nschool and went into golf. Maybe I should have kept going and went\nto Yale like my brother, who's a teacher. I wonder until I look out\nthe window and see that golf course. Then I realize how much\nenjoyment I've gotten out of the game, and I don't wonder anymore.\"\n\nRosemary Maravetz is the former collections manager of the USGA\nMuseum.

{"text":"Aid for Golf Training\n\nA GOLF TRAINING AID CAN SMOOTH OUT THE FLAWS\n\nThe quality of golf played on the Professional Tours is the product of many hours of practice; even the professionals will use a golf training aid if it can prove to be helpful in areas of the game. Some of this golf training aid is the simplest of things even just a few tees can help with the putting stroke and the swing.\n\nThe putting stroke is so very important. A handicap golfer who can avoid three putting will see his or her handicap come down. A simple practice nets can be two rows of tees to create an avenue for the putter head to move between in the direction of the hole. The tees ensure that the putter head is taken back straight and follows through in the target line. The stroke also involves tempo and gauging pace. Ideally the length of the back stroke should be the same as the follow through and that principle can be practiced using the swing is much more complex and its tempo equally important. There is a mid iron club with a hinge at the midpoint; it is designed to release if the tempo of the swing is uneven, and stay in place if everything is fine.\n\nMain Priorities of Golf Training Aid\n\nThe important thing once a golfer is keen on finding ways to improve and has begun to look at a golf training aid as one means of improvement is to look at the main priorities and make some decisions.\n\nA weakness may be putting. The ingredients of a good putting stroke can mostly be manufactured by creating a routine, practicing the stroke itself, tempo, alignment; a golf training aid can help with every aspect. While a handicap golfer may never be able to create the timing, not have the physique to match the professionals, hard work on the putting part of the game can be invaluable and can help to match the pros.\n\nVideo instruction for golf training aid has become popular and many club professional use video equipment to illustrate to a golfer any flaws in their swing and the corrections that need to be practised. But practice is the key and any lesson given via video or from the club professional needs to be practised. At that stage, the golfer needs to find time for practice rather than just expect the changes to be automatically absorbed and brought into play.\n\nAspects of Golf Training Aid\n\nA golf training aid is available for every aspect of the game that a golfer may wish to improve. The biggest problem does revolve around the swing because people have so many moving parts and they need to work in a coordinated way to produce consistency. Once the stance is perfected, arms, legs, torso etc must all work together. There are things that can be worn in practice to help quieten those parts of the body that need to be quiet, or to move the arms back on the correct plane, and on it goes. A golf training aid is there for most things, its then down to the golfer and his willingness to practise."}

Of course, that didn't always happen and everyone knows you only get one do-over so you better make it count.\n\nIn golf, a do-over is a mulligan. As you can guess, a mulligan is not \"legal\" in the rules of golf. You are supposed to take the shot where it lands \u2014 good or bad. At some charity golf events, one can purchase mulligans as an additional fundraiser and since everyone is on the same page, it's OK.

{"text":"Better Your Golf Swing for Better Golf\n\nSwinging a golf club is one of the most complex and difficult movements in the entire world of sports. Unlike other sporting motions, such as punching or kicking, the golf swing requires many parts of the body to work in simultaneous harmony in order to produce a desired result. There are many different muscles working during a golf swing. Because of this, there is a lot of potential for a part of the swing to go wrong, in turn affecting the entire swing.\n\nPerfect Your Golf Swing\n\nDue to the complex nature of the golf swing, it can be hard to analyze it and determine exactly what is going wrong when it comes to any individual golfer's swing. It is, however, possible and desirable to do so. Without determining exactly what is wrong with a golf swing it is impossible to understand how to put it right.\n\nThe first thing that needs to happen in order for a golfer to begin the process of improving their golf swing and wider golf game is to take everything back to basics. When golfers first start out practicing their game they do everything very consciously and carefully. Over time, this careful, analytic method of playing the sport can be replaced by a more practiced, less thoughtful style of play. By getting back to a method of thinking about every aspect of golf carefully, a golfer is able to identify exactly what aspect of their swing is going wrong.\n\nIdentifying the problems in a golf swing is only half the battle. Over time, golfers practice their mistakes and they become an ingrained part of the individual's golf game. Once mistakes have been identified the golfer will need to replace them with the correct way of doing things. It may take some time for this correct golf swing to become natural as the previous incorrect swing had become so integral to the golfer's game.\n\nSome golfers may find it impossible to work out exactly what they are doing wrong when they swing a golf club. This can often be made much easier to stop and analyze through filming the golf swing. Filming a golf swing allows the golfer to watch themselves in extremely slow motion over and over again. This gives plenty of time to look at every part of the swing and see what is going wrong. This can be a lot easier than trying to analyze a swing in real time.\n\nGo Back to Golf Swing Basics\n\nOther than working on the golf swing itself, it can be greatly beneficial for a golfer to take some time and analyze their pre-swing mechanics in detail. Golfers need to check basic fundamentals such as if they have their weight properly distributed, if the ball is in the correct position, if they have their feet and shoulders aligned correctly and so forth. These are things which beginner golfers are taught very precisely but experienced golfers may forget to pay close attention to over time. By returning to the fundamental pre-swing mechanics, a golfer is able to determine whether it is something they are doing wrong at this stage that is causing their game problems."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the rambling before \"I CALL BS!!\" has to do with everything after it?\n\nIt seems to me, that what I call talking points are the \"politically correct\" popular things to say, but in my opinion they are a series of feel good but empty statements. I call BS because until you stop allowing players to flout the rules (as Compton did on Monday), then 1-5 are just \"talk\".\n\nI do agree with one thing you say for sure. The time it takes to determine proper drops is crazy long,\nwhile the rule dealing with it is not that long. It goes in the hotdog stand?, nearest point of relief, no\nnearer the hole. Get movingAm I alone?\n\nI agree, what does everything after the \"BS\" have to do with what came before?\n\nFirst, this rant is up on here in one forum or another twice a week, at least, did you just discover the pros are slow? So, who do you think disagrees with that?\n\nSecond, your statements about what happens on the local level mean that what the pros do aren't adversely affecting the game. Self-governing, at least according to you.\n\nThird, I, like everyone one else around here would prefer to see the pros have to play a faster pace, yet, when it comes down to it, their pace of play really has no impact on my life. Nobody I play golf with is as slow as Erik Compton was on Monday, and I think he was slow, but, they aren't playing a tough course in windy conditions, wanting to maintain\/obtain Tour playing privileges, on a day when nobody really wanted to be there, anyway.\n\nFourth, their play has no influence on anyone I play with, and I think the suggestion that amateurs imitate the pros is a little overstated. I see some of it, especially around the greens for those that over think putting, but I don't see pros playing slow affecting the game more than cost of golf, diminishing golf opportunities, and the main thing - - - - competition for other interests in people's lives that just wasn't there 15, 20 and 30 years ago.\n\nThe PGA and the USGA want to grow the game, and they don't control how the Tour handles slow play at its events.\n\nWhen the Tour talks about growing the game it's more about new market opportunities for manufacturers and the Tour's product as well. The Tour is always hypocritical, no news flash there.\n\nI get that slow pros are frustrating and the Tour won't do anything about it, but their playing slow on TV isn't what is causing people to get out of the game or not get into it.\n\nYou have every right to be frustrated, of course, but why let it get to you? My remote still takes me somewhere else while I'm waiting for Kevin Na to pull the trigger.\n\nI want to know when the last time a tour player called a penalty on themselves for not adhering to the rules of golf (or the PGA tour specific rules) regarding pace of play?\n\nYou do know that players aren't exactly able to call a pace of play penalty on themselves, right?\n\nPer USGA rules, Pace of Play Penalties are only assessed to a player in a group, or match, that is being timed. Unfortunately, it is up to the tournament officials to make the call on who will, or will not, be put on the clock. The pace of play problem lies with the officials, not the players.\n\nI understand the main points you are making, and I agree with them whole-heartedly. Personally, I think that golf should incorporate a shot-clock model, much like bowling and billiards do.\n\nIn a professional bowling telecast, a player is allowed 30 seconds from the completion of the last shot to execute another shot. If they take longer, they are fined. In addition, they are allowed to take a quick \"time-out\" during the course of the match for certain reasons (equipment change\/adjustment, etc...).\n\nIn a professional billiards tournament, it is very similar. They get 30 seconds from the completion of the last shot to execute another. If they take longer, they are fined. Each player is allowed 1 \"extension\" per game. This is usually used if they find themself in a difficult position and they want some extra time to think about and plan out their shot.\n\nHere is my proposal for golf:\n\nA time-keeping official is assigned to each group and is in charge of timing each golfer, for every shot of the round, starting on the first hole (not after the pace of play is already a problem). The USGA allows a player 40-50 seconds to play a stroke, depending on the situation. The first time a player exceeds this time frame, penalties are assessed per the USGA rules (shown below). In addition to this, each player is allowed 2-3 \"extensions\" per round. This extension would buy them an extra minute of time to plan out their shot, read the green, wait out the wind, etc... After all, they are playing for millions of dollars. If they need to take a bit more time on a couple shots in a round than us mere mortals would take, that's OK by me.\n\nPersonally, I think this will help speed up play by quite a bit, while still being fair to the players. What do you all think?\n\nIt seems like every drop situation, even simple ones, require a rules official. Like Picker said, it's not that complicated, move on.\n\nIn the local pick up game, drops don't take long. They shouldn't. Guys playing pick up games aren't playing for millions of dollars and their livelihood.\n\nI understand the point and the pace needs to pick up, no question. But to think these guys are just going to look at a ball, take a quick drop (if they even drop it instead of moving it with a club like I'm sure most of us do) and move on is wishful thinking. They're playing for a lot more than we are, especially the guys who aren't well known. Them collecting any check instead of a DQ can make a huge, huge difference.\n\nDidn't Tiger try to quicken this issue up just a week or two ago? How did that turn out for him?Slow play is often exacerbated with poor play. I know some people will be of mindset \"I paid for my green fee & cart so I'll take as long as I damn we'll please. (No idea what happens at a private club)\n\nTee It Forward was a nice initiative, but I think \"Finish Under Five\" would do more good for the game.\n\nI agree with OP. I also think if you're a slow player you need to play at a time when it won't affect as many groups.\n\nMy question is why isn't there a rules official with every group or at least every other? The amount of time it takes to find and get a rules official is what causes a lot of the time. I mean this is the PGA. Hire a bunch of rules officials that travel with the tour. Guys would work like 2 weeks on and then off one. Fly them in on Tues or Weds and then they fly out Sunday night. I mean the NHL and NBA and Major League Baseball all seem to be able to provide umps\/refs for every game and they need a lot more than what would be needed for the PGA tour. IMO there is no reason there isnt a rules official with each group or like i said at least every other.\n\nPlus you will get a more accurate ruling, bc the rules official will be walking with the group and will see what happens, not have to relying on someone telling them what happened.I really like your first idea a lot, know the rules and keep pace or suffer the consequence. Why shouldn't this be a player\/caddy decision?! BBIt seems like every drop situation, even simple ones, require a rules official. Like Picker said, it's not that complicated, move on.\n\nI think it is simply ridiculous how long it takes to play some PGA Tour rounds, there has to be something done to light a fire under their a**. At the same time you have to realize that one stroke can separate a pro from a $100K check and a $50K check. I think I would take my time and get a ruling on a drop too...Great story on Sky Sports today. Rob Lee and Mark Roe (who's a complete douchebag btw) played a competitive round of golf on the European tour in two hours and two minutes shooting 70 and 67. Obviously they were out of contention but still does show what can be done if players put their minds to it.I would venture a guess that the numbers would be somewhat skewed based on playing partner, field size, start time,weather conditions, course type or difficulty. The numbers I think would identify the slowest and out of 144 players there will be 10-14 that are the slowest the large majority will be within 15 minutes of each other...........now that its been quantified now where are youGolf being what it is, the courses being so different from each other, and therefore, the TV setup, the stands, etc I think players should still be able to consult officials regarding drops, whether the ball is \"plugged\" or not: let's remember we're in an era where some guy in his basement can call officials to report an infraction, and the officials will actually act on it if there is basis to do so. In what other sports is this the case ? So I think there should be an official assigned to each group. I'm sure the PGA is rich enough to do that. That official would also be in charge of pace of play and anything else pertaining to that group. As others have mentioned, I think it would be a great idea to do so...that is unless Mark Russell likes seeing himself on TV too much...\n\nI agree with the OP: some rules are more important than others in the eye of the PGA. The cynical in me wants to believe that longer rounds = longer broadcasts = more commercials = more $$$. Maybe there is some of that as well. Just a thought. excuse excuseWho cares what their excuses are? They aren't holding ME up. If anything, if I were playing for a million bucks or more I would thinking through my shots a little extra. You and I don't have that problem, and don't have the context to pass judgement on those guys. If I had three shots for million bucks I would likely soil my drawers (not really) and we expect these guys to rush through that process have to agree with MadGolfer76 on this one.\n\ni'm willing to give compton a pass most every case. but he shouldn't even be the focus for the slow play at torrey. unfortunately he was when the announcers focused on him while waiting for his group to finish so we could get to tiger .fact is pga tour is becoming increasingly slow and the suits aren't doing a thing about it.\n\nWell, just take out the time limit from the rules then. Maybe I'm oversimplifying things but they should enforce whatever rule is in the book. Playing on the PGA Tour isn't a right, it's a privilege. If someone can't follow the rules, then they deserve whatever penalty that pertains to that rule.\n\nIf the Tour likes the way things are, they can drop the time limit. If they feel 45 seconds, or whatever the rule is, isn't enough, they can bring it to 90 seconds if they so choose.\n\nI would just like them to take a stand. Pick up the mic, with the cameras on, and say on record:\"Pace of play is a judgment call. The 45-second rule is dropped. Any and all decisions are final\". Just make it clear and stop hiding behind technicalities and status: be accountable PGA Tour. That's all we want."}

The terrain varies from flat to rolling hills, so you can still expect some uneven lies. Geoffrey Cornish and Brian Silva redesigned the course"}
{"text":"Pros: This course is nicely placed, just outside of town, and it's a great course to go get a quick round in. It's brand new (it opened July 19, 2008). Not too hard, but you probably won't get more than 5 under, even if you're really good.\n\nCons: As a result of just opening, they are still working on some things. In the woods, there are many leaves on the fairway and such, while it would be much nicer to have them blown out of the fairway. Also, on hole 9 there is a walking bridge which they are fixing up; but even when they are done with it, the placement is very odd, and I don't think i'll even use it.\n\nOther Thoughts: The entire course is on the north side of a baseball\/softball field complex. The first hole is along a walking path on the west side of the area. The tee is immediately above a ditch, and you throw over a small wall above the ditch. the hole is straight, but there are some trees in the way, making you go low, or left to right, and at 283, it's somewhat of a struggle to get it there and avoid the trees. Go up the hill to the right for the second hole, which is straight, but long, with a couple limbs guarding the right side of the hole. The third is to the left, and shorter, but float it too much and you'll go 50 feet past it. this is probably the easiest hole, so take advantage. The fourth tee is straight behind the third hole, and over an open field through the trees guarding the hole. This hole is a tough birdie to get, because past the trees the ground dips before heading upward to the hole, so your disc has to go up the hill while losing speed quickly. If you don't go up the hill very much, that leaves you with a decently ranged putt (40 feet or more). Five is to the right, and is downhill, but the very loose dirt around the hole makes the putt annoying. 6 is a lot longer than it looks, probably because of the 20 feet you slightly go uphill, and don't realize it until you end up 70 feet short of the hole. The next hole is to the right, in the woods. A branch sticking out beside the tee makes this annoy for RHBH\/LHFH throwers. You can go low, but making it climb back up the hill to the hole is difficult, but not impossible at all. The 8th is split by a few trees, but not hard if you can throw with a curve accurately. The ninth is easily the hardest hole, being up the hill between two trees around another tree and under some branches. This hole can be birded, but only with a beautiful, accurately curing drive. This hole has a bunch of coal around it, which is quite annoying."}
{"text":"On this page we will discuss five key points to help you improve your strategy and lower your score.\n\n1) First, get the right attitude: To improve your score, you have to learn how to play the game, not how to swing or how to hit the ball farther. \"Too many people tend to forget that the real object of the game, once the round is under way, is not to make pretty swings or hit pretty shots, but to find the wisest, most efficient way to get the ball into the hole in the fewest strokes possible\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.And everything starts from having the right attitude: play for what you know you can instead of what you hope you can do\u2026..Play comfortable. I think this is the best advice I can give anyone about actually playing the game.\n\nIt's the road to consistency. It's so simple but it makes a huge difference !\" (Raymond Floyd - excerpt from the book: the elements of scoring).\n\n2) Putting, Putting, Putting:\nIf you want to be a scorer, you have to be a good putter. Whether you are a beginning or a seasoned player, you will have noticed (or you will soon do\u2026) that putting has more effect on your score than any other area of the game. Additionally putting is the final \"call\". While you can always try to recover with your next shot if you miss a swing or an approach shot, if you miss a putt, there is no recovery rather than adding one more stroke to your scorecard. This is why putting has an immediate effect on your scoring and on your mental game. Good putters gain confidence and go to the next tee shot full of positive energy, while bad putters go depressed or angry, which will in turn affect their swing, too. Hence, like we said at the beginning, if you want to be a scorer, you have to be a good putter! To learn how to improve your putting game, see our section dedicated to putting.\n\n3) Study the course upfront: The ability to play the right shot at the right time and plot his way round the course is what made Jack Nicklaus the most successful golfer ever. Many other players had better swings and a more stylish short game, but nobody could beat Jack's strategic approach to the cours. So, performing a good course management analysis upfront is a key to lower the score.\nHow should you do this ?\n\nFollow these key principles:\n3.1) check the yardage\/distance chart to plot your shot strategy till the green.\n3.2) always play away from trouble (it seems obvious, it isn't if you don't plan it carefully).\n3.3) choose the set of golf clubs according to the corse design.\n3.4) always play to leave yourself an uphill putt.\nSee also: Course management.\n\nLastly, we suggest you to read the following book where Butch Harmon performs detailed, hands-on, explanation on course management and how to put it in practice. \"I now want take the\n\nImprove (Lower) your Score\n\nimprovement process literally to the grass-roots level. In the course of this book, I take three virtual players and I teach them how to play strategically smart golf that's right for their games\u2026\"(Butch Harmon - excerpt from the book: Playing Lessons\n\n4) Patience and Perseverance: When played at a very high standard, golf is considered to be one of the hardest games. Surely, it is, but the key to keep improving and scoring better is simple: \"Golf requires patience and perseverance. There are no shortcuts\u2026\u2026\u2026.When Butch Harmon and I overhauled my swing during the 1998 season, Butch would have me repeat one movement for 30 minutes. I would get so tired it felt like\n\n5) Devote more than 50% of your practice to the short game: The more you practice, the better you will understand how slope, lie, ground and other external factors (wind and rain) affect the ball fly. \"When most amateur golfers go to the driving range to practice, they take with them a driver and a selection of irons\u2026\u2026.Surprisingly, no thought whatsoever is given to pitch shots, chip shots and bunker play. And yet it is the short game,\n\nthe shots played from around the green, which can, potentially have the most profound effect on their score and, consequently, their handicap\" (Tony Dear - excerpt from the book: Good Golf - made easy)."}

{"text":"Become a Sponsor!\n\nA Few of Our Sponors\n\nHow to Take it to the Course\n\nHow to take it to the course\nNate Morris, Golf Digest Top 100 Club Fitter, Certified Personal Coach\n\nAs coaches, the most common complaint that we hear is that our students struggle with taking their practice game to the course. We have all done it. We get into a groove on the range and we feel great about our swing and the ball goes where we want it to most of the time. Then we get on the course and nothing goes according to plan. That is because after every swing on the range or in the bay, your brain makes small adjustments, either conscious or subconscious, to the swing. After a bunch of adjustments we can hit the ball pretty well. The problem is' we don't make those adjustments on the course because no shot is the same and there is too much time between shots.\n\nIn order to take it to the course, you have to practice in game-like situations. I call it scrimmaging. To do this, you need to use a little imagination. Think about a hole that you want to play, preferably one that you struggle with. Then imagine the fairway somewhere on the range. You can use two flagsticks to mark the edges of the fairway. Set up with the club that you normally tee off with and go through your entire pre-shot routine and hit the shot. Based on where it ends up, pick a new target and a new club. Try not to hit the same shot more than two times in a row.\n\nHere is an example of how I do it. I picture a long par 4 with a dogleg to the right. First I hit my drive and try to land it in the fairway. If I hit a good shot and it lands in the fairway, I will pick a closer target for my second shot and give myself a better lie. If I hit a bad shot, I will pick a longer target and give myself a bad lie. I might put it in a divot, or walk over and hit out of the rough. If I miss the green with the approach shot, I will hit a small pitch or chip to a target on the range. Once I am on the green, I will pick a new hole.\n\nI will always play two or three holes like this at the end of my practice session. It allows me to see how the new ball flight might work on the course. It also helps to train your mind on things like pre-shot routine, target visualization and playing with just a hint of pressure. This also makes practice more fun and less boring."}
{"text":"Years ago, I was fortunate to help one of the game's best teachers write an instruction book. The book never got a lot of recognition, but those who read it have told me it really helped their games. It's called How to Win the Three Games of Golf and was the brainchild of Golf Digest Teaching Professional Hank Johnson, who for many years was the No. 1 Teacher in Alabama. Hank was also a noted player, who had a stellar run at Auburn University and qualified for the 1969 U.S. Open at Champions Golf Club, won by Orville Moody.\n\nHank came up with the brilliant idea of breaking the game down into three distinct parts: The Golf Swing, the Golf Shot and the Golf Score. If you keep these separate when you work on your game, I promise you'll practice better, play better and score better.\n\nHank based his ideas on tested motor-learning and educational research. He found that when you're working on your swing, it's best to do it by not hitting golf balls. You'll make much faster progress and the changes will stick if you work on your mechanics and positions away from the range (certainly away from the course) and even without a golf club. Swing a broom or other similar object in front of a mirror, and repeat the correct positions you want to get into. If you try to hit balls and work on your mechanics at the same time, everything often suffers and you often regress and lose confidence.\n\nWhen you get on the range and start hitting balls, forget about the mechanics you rehearsed without balls. On the range you should be concentrating on hitting golf shots. Pick out specific targets and hit shots to them. Visualize the ball flight and trajectory. If you start thinking of your mechanics, get away from your pile of balls, work out your mechanical thoughts with practice swings, then return to hitting shots thinking non-mechanically.\n\nWhen you're on the course, all you're doing is putting the shots you practiced on the range into play. Here you should only be concerned with the conditions, your strategy, club selection, and where you want the ball to go. You're simply trying to make a golf score. If you need to think of something in your swing, make sure it's a non-mechanical thought, like visualizing the target, swinging in a smooth tempo or holding your finish.\n\nThis approach might be difficult to do at first, and it definitely takes time to start trusting it and staying with it. But if you do, you'll start to play some of the best golf of your life. And you'll also notice that you're not so mentally tired at the end of your rounds. Because you're finally playing golf--really playing golf. Not stressing over your mechanics shot after shot.\n\nGood luck with your game this week, and look for Fitness Friday in two days.\n\nEditor's note: Every Monday, PGA professional Kevin Hinton examines a key shot from one of the weekend's tour events and tells you what you can learn. A\nGolf Digest Best Young Teacher, Kevin is the Director of Instruction at\nPiping Rock Golf Club, Locust Valley, N.Y., and is a Lead Master\nInstructor for the Jim McLean Golf School at Doral Resort & Spa. He\nalso teaches at Drive 495 in New York. This week, Kevin examines Steve Stricker's marvelous wedge to kick-in distance on the ninth hole at Kapalua, which helped turn the momentum and propel the nine-time tour winner to the victory circle in the year's first tournament.\n\nKevin Hinton: Stricker's up-and-down on the par-5 ninth for his second consecutive birdie was a pivotal moment of the final round. Steve pitched his third shot to gimme range, and regained his three shot lead over Jonathan Byrd. He then cruised to a final-round 69 and the Hyundai Tournament of Champions victory. Let's take a closer look at Steve's pitching action and see what you can learn. Watch video.\n\nStricker is an expert at the fundamentals of consistent pitching. The less-than-full wedge shot is one of the most difficult in the game because you are not making a complete swing. Solid contact is not easy for the average golfer. Let's see how Stricker does it:\n\nAt address, he has narrowed his stance, played the ball slightly back of middle, and set more weight on his front foot . . . approximately 60 percent or so. In the backswing, he keeps his lower body relatively quiet as he swings his arms back and allows his wrists to hinge. This is a very important note. While the most significant difference between pitching and chipping is that in pitching we allow our wrists to hinge, I think the key to Steve's pitching--his consistently good contact and distance control--is that he doesn't overdo it. Read more\n\nWhen you go to a tour event on a Monday or Tuesday, like at this week's Cadillac Championship at Doral, you see what real practice is all about. We're not talking about a quick warmup before a round. We're talking about truly working on your game, as if it's the most important thing in the world. In a day, the average tour pro spends about three to four hours concentrating on the full swing and an equal amount of time on the short-game.\n\nBut tour pros are not just beating balls or blindly rolling putts. They make their practice productive by using props--shafts, yardsticks and other devices--to check their alignment, their ball position, their swing plane, their putting path. Sometimes it's with their teacher, most often with their caddie, so they have another set of eyes to check them. This is work. It's what they do for a living. And if done correctly, it pays dividends.\n\nWant to practice like a pro? Here's what you do:\n\nMake yourself a practice station on the range. Always put shafts or other clubs on the ground to check that your stance line is square to your target line. Jim Flick, who coaches Tom Lehman and Jack Nicklaus, likes to have players put the alignment shaft along their heels, not their toes, because if you like to flare out one foot, it will not alter your alignment. Then place another shaft perpendicular to your target line to indicate your ball position. Finally, put a shaft in the ground to the side of your body on the same angle as your clubshaft at address. This will help you determine if your swing is on plane. Note the photograph of Vijay Singh (above), who always practices with such a \"plane check.\"\n\nNow if you really want to practice like a pro, always place the ball\nyou're about to hit directly behind the divot you just made (note the Singh photo again). Try to\neliminate the smallest amount of turf from the range so the\nsuperintendent has the least amount of area to reseed. Also notice that\ntour pros take shallow divots. Only"}

{"text":"An Effective Lesson\n\nIf we all can agree that the purpose of taking golf lessons is: TO GET BETTER, then we must understand ALL of what a lesson must encompass to accomplish that objective.\n\nYou come to this game with certain athletic ability \u2013 eye\/hand coordination and a sense of motion that generates clubhead speed. All too often lessons get in the way of your natural ability to deliver your motion from ball to target. Why? Because you start thinking about what to do while you are over the golf ball.\n\nResult: your natural rhythm gets interrupted by your thought process, you become mechanical, and you get worse \u2013 before you get better.\n\nAll Golfstruck lessons are specifically designed to avoid this \"lesson trap.\" Our philosophy at Golfstruck is simply: your ball flights will improve, immediately.How?\n\n1.THE FEEL OF MOTION\n\nThe Golfstruck difference is that we teach you not just what to do, but how to convert your new understanding to the feel of motion required to produce your desired ball flights.\n\n2. WHERE YOU ARE GOING\n\nBy starting with ball flights, i.e. focusing your attention on WHERE YOU ARE GOING, rather than on swing theory (WHAT YOU ARE DOING), we replace confusion with the understanding and delivery of THE FEEL OF MOTION.\n\n3. FREQUENT REPETITION \u2013 Put This Shot in YOUR Bag!\n\nFrequent repetition of your new feel of motion imprints (from muscles through the nervous system to the brain) the feel of motion essential to producing desired ball flights \u2013 on command. Repetition of quality motion generates a \"stored program\" in your brain that you can recall \"on command,\" so you can successfully take your game from the range to the golf course.\n\nPractice becomes fun only whenyou know you are getting better. So a Golfstruck lesson provides the immediate feedback you need to KNOW you are getting better by structuring your practice sessions for you \u2013 with Golfstruck logic and learning tools. With the Golfstruck approach to SMART practice, you will know you are getting better within the first 10 minutes of each practice session.\n\n4. PERFORMANCE ROUTINE\n\nFinally, as you practice, you must do so with a Performance Routine that Works. Why? You will always play the way you practice! So you must practice precisely the same way you will play your shots on the course, i.e. learn to play shots \u2013 On Command! So for each type of shot, your Golfstruck lesson will include The Performance Routine that works best to produce each type of desired ball flight, predictably and consistently."}

It's amazing that\nthey held me up to the caliber of all these great players.\n\nWhy are you so gracious all the time?\n\nSemple Thompson:\nBecause that's just the way I feel. I just don't feel like I'm\nthat wonderful.\n\nWhere does that graciousness come from?\n\nSemple Thompson:\nI don't know. Maybe from taking myself as an amateur as opposed\nto proving I'm the best in the world, wanting to kill everybody.\nI play the game for the love of it. I want to play well \u2026.\n\nWho were your influences growing up while playing the\ngame?\n\nSemple Thompson:\nProbably my parents, first of all. And then a lot of women that I\nsaw play in the Women's Amateur and the Women's Open. There was\nJoanne Carner. She was head and shoulders above us amateurs. She\nhit the ball a mile. She won five or so amateurs I think - an\nunbelievable number. I played against her and got waxed a couple\nof times. She turned pro at a relatively late age.\n\nJudy Bell was right up there when I was younger. She was fun\nand made the game interesting. Barbara McIntyre was the same way.\nI would say amateur women were my important people. Marlene\nStreit was another one.\n\nHow has golf shaped your life? Has it defined your life?\n\nSemple Thompson:\nIt certainly has defined my life because since I've been out of\ncollege it's been my main individual sport, although I love\nhorseback riding too. It's been my main summer activity for a lot\nof years. And competition has been a big part of it, an important\npart to keep me interested and keep me practicing.\n\nWhen's the last time you played a round?\n\nSemple Thompson:\nI played last Sunday.\n\nWhere, and how did you play?\n\nSemple Thompson:\nIn Sewickley, Pennsylvania. I only played nine holes. I played\ntwo balls.\n\nAs you've grown older, you've discussed how your game has\nsuffered. What has been the most frustrating part of it\nall?\n\nSemple Thompson:\nWell, I think I've started to lose my concentration quite a bit.\nAnd I don't quite want to spend too many hours practicing and\nthat leads to deterioration in one's game. So I would think\nprobably the mental part is the most frustrating. Since I'm not\nworking on it actively, it's like anything else - it slips away\nand I tend to slip into negative thoughts.\n\nEarlier in your career, you sought the help of a hypnotist.\nWhy did you do that?\n\nSemple Thompson:\nIt was a couple years out of college. Because my golf game was\nseriously lacking, and this guy wanted to hypnotize me and I\nthought it would be fun.\n\nWhat's it like to be hypnotized?\n\nSemple Thompson:\nIt's great!\nI highly recommend hypnosis.\n\nWhy so?\n\nSemple Thompson:\nFor me, it's relaxation and visualization. I love to lie down on\nthe floor and listen to a count that relaxes me. Once I'm\nrelaxed, I don't feel my body at all. I can just go into my head\nand think all the good thoughts I want to happen.\n\nWould you describe it as an out-of-body experience?\n\nSemple Thompson:\nIt's kind of similar. But if you said that to someone it might\nmake them kind of nervous. I think it's really cool to be relaxed\nand still awake and think about positive things that will\nhappen.\n\nWhat's something about you that someone might be surprised\nto know?\n\nSemple Thompson:\nThat my sister and I raise red worms.\n\nWhat do you do with red worms?\n\nSemple Thompson:\nRed worms create\nworm poop or castings for\ngardeners. Red worms can also be used for fishing, not that I'm a\nfisherman. We haven't sold any yet but we have sold some\ncastings. So I'm in there digging in the dirt putting oxygen into\nit, growing worms. This is on a family farm like a huge fruit\ncellar. We have concrete beds filled with peat moss and horse\nmanure. It's like composting.\n\nPut you on the spot. Which is your greater love: golf or\nhorses?\n\nSemple Thompson:\nI really love horses, but golf has been so important to me. The\ncompetition has been the key. Of course winning doesn't hurt. It\nwould be a toss-up.\n\nWhat song would describe you?\n\nSemple Thompson:\nI'm not good at stuff like that. I like Whitney Houston things\nthat are upbeat. 'One Moment In Time.' \u2026 I like inspirational\nsongs. Not religiously inspirational. Just upbeat."}

{"text":"How To Time The Release In A Golf Swing\n\nBy: Michael Bell\n\nBreak Studios Contributing Writer\n\nNeed to know how to time the release in a golf swing? Sometimes it can be a little tricky to time the release in a golf swing. Golfers might swing hard yet achieve minimal distance. When this is the case, it's may be because the timing of the release in a golf swing is off. But a simple drill can help golfers time the release in their swing, which can mean maximum distance when it counts most on the golf course. Here's how to time the release in a golf swing.\n\nPlace six to eight golf balls in the bottom of a headcover. This will add weight to the headcover.\n\nGrip the headcover. Take a normal grip at the neck of the headcover, just as you would when you address a golf ball. It could be any grip, overlap or interlock, among others. The important thing is not the grip, but what you are doing to help time the release in a golf swing.\n\nSwing. Take it back slow and swing smoothly down the ball line and through the hitting area. Feel the weight of the headcover whip through the ball, and how it is releasing. You'll notice it's heaviest when your arms are fully extended. Bingo! That is your optimal point to release the club in a golf swing.\n\nPractice. Now that you've learned how to time the release in a golf swing, practice where it counts, on the golf course. Golf is all about muscle memory, so get a good feel of how your forearms, wrists and hands felt when the weighted headcover swept through the hitting area during the practice sessions. If you can do that, then you can maximize your power."}

{"text":"As you start off the first tee you notice that trees line both sides of the fairway, which means a well placed tee shot is required. Number 2 is a short par 3, slightly up hill, meaning you will maybe have to take an extra club. As your round progresses your come upon holes 3 and 4 which are par 5's. Number 3 is designed to where your tee shot is sligtly up hill but is followed by a second shot that is down the hill and then back up to the green. Number 4 is a down hill par 5 that is very reachable in 2. Number 5 is a uphill, short par 4. Number 6 is probably th most challenging hole on the course. It demands a perfect tee shot and mid to short iron precision into the green. Number 7 is a par 3 over water. Numbers 8 an 9 are both par 4's with number 8 being the more challenging. Number nine is one of the easier holes on the course, with a good drive all you will have left is a sand or pitching wedge. Come enjoy this great nine whole lay"}

An errant disc could easily do some damage to some unexpecting golfers throwing or walking in the opposite direction.\n\nAt least that's my take on it, but I have only played 2 rounds out there."}

{"text":"First an aside; I hope you've taken a look at the Martin Chuck video I posted a couple of days ago. He's really great at explaining the golf swing. Go to YouTube and put his name in and you'll find more good stuff.\n\nOnce you understand the fundamentals of the golf swing how do you make yours repeatable? By now everyone should now the answer \u2013 Practice! That doesn't mean you have to pound balls for hours at the range, it does mean you have to practice the right moves because they are not natural. It's with repetition that you'll be able to swing correctly by default. Believe me it takes time and commitment. That's why knowing that you're doing the right things is critical.\n\nWe've covered a bunch of the basics, enough to get you started on the path to reducing your handicap. There are some 'check downs' that you should be aware that will help you monitor your swing. Just like pilots have a check down list before they take off, these will help you remember to get all of your moving parts working well together. In this and some following blogs I'm going to give you a good start on what to put in your Check Down list.\n\nThe first item is to make sure that the length of your follow through (from impact to the end of your swing) is longer than the distance from setup to the top of your backswing. You must do this to make sure that you are accelerating through impact. I'm sure a physicist could explain it with formulas, but doesn't it just make common sense?\n\nMost amateurs, including moi, tend to put a lot of effort into the backswing and the start of the downswing. Pros put the effort into the follow through and thereby get greater speed into the ball at impact. As Jim McLean says, the fastest part of your swing should be after impact.\n\nTry it. Go back only 2\/3 of what you normally do and then make sure your follow through is longer. You'll know instantly if you've done it right. I'm betting that most will find the end of the swing in a place it's never been before. The other benefit is you'll stop going back beyond the point of your flexibility \u2013 past that you're going to break down all the angles you've worked so hard to create.\n\nThe biggest deterrent will be the natural inclination (but wrong) that the farther you coil the farther you'll hit the ball. Watch the pros when they hit their short irons outrageous distances but appear not to go back very far at all. Rhythm, timing, smoothness are all important, while a too big backswing is a killer. Good luck."}

One, I'm not around most of the people that might criticize me to my face for what or how much I'm posting, so I feel freer to post what I want and as often as I want. And two, I have a lot more free time during the summer, so my brain runs wild with thoughts and I have more time to sit down and tweet and blog.\n\nBut what makes me want to do this, really? Why do I have the urge to put words on this page that tell the reader about my golf game, or my beliefs, or my mentality about things?\n\nWhy be a minimalist?\n\nIt's a way to escape the excesses of the world around us \u2014 the excesses of consumerism, material possessions, clutter, having too much to do, too much debt, too many distractions, too much noise.

When you set the club on the ground, that leading edge or that knife, that sharp edge doesn't sit completely on the ground. The higher that essentially sits off the ground, you can see that, the more bounce you have okay.\n\nWell, what happens is as I lean the handle back, you can see that leading edge gets farther off the ground which increases bounce. As I lean the handle forward, that decreases bounce and you have zero bounce at this point and basically all you have is a sharp leading edge. What happens is, is that when people tell you to lean your hands ahead like this and keep the handle out in front, you take away all bounce.\n\nWell, bounce is your friend and bounce is forgiveness. It looks something like this. I'll just go to Joel here. If I lean the handle ahead, that club comes to an immediate stop so you better hope the ball was in there somewhere, where as I can hit purposely two inches behind this one and that ball still wasn't anywhere near a chunk but that's because I've got the handle returned to here to there but never this way and so when that club lands, it slides. Any time I get in tight like this, I can hit behind the ball, at the ball, next to the ball and the ball's going to come off clean. When you're on the golf course, the test is you don't get to hit it three or four times, well, some of you might if you get a really bad shot!\n\nStrike Mark\n\nBen: I just want to see the contact. So a little toe. Did I talk you into that?\n\nStudent: Because you said you hit everything left.\n\nBen: Yeah.\n\nGrip\n\nStudent: I finish aside from what I do wrong posture wise, I'm hitting the ball to the right and I think some of it is because I'm just behind, does that make sense?\n\nBen: Yeah, yeah the club face is definitely open right? So the question is, how do we get the club face three degrees more closed?\n\nStudent: Right.\n\nBen: The way I always, go ahead and take your grip, the way I always close club face is to take this hand, take this hand off real quick. There you go, now put the right hand on. Right there you're just not going to open the club face in there. It's a much stronger position; especially when our club faces, you know, yeah, like a vacuum, right? Okay so you've got your left hand on there stronger. Go a little stronger than you think. Yeah, just hit one from there and see what happens. I mean that's what I'm talking about. We can play from there.\n\nStudent: Yeah, definitely, so strong.\n\nBen: So that's twenty more yards. So we'll take this hand off, yeah, the whole hand has to come over and you see that dot right there, the thumb has to be on that side of the dot.\n\nStudent: Okay.\n\nBen: So why don't you do that on all shots except for little chips and stuff.\n\nStudent: Okay.\n\nBen: All full swings we need to be over there and that'll help just close that club face a little bit.\n\nStudent: Fantastic, thank you.\n\nBen: All right, now you're going to swing out to the right, trust it. You went underneath it, dang it. It's going to be really good. You got it, right?\n\nStudent: Yeah, I got it.\n\nBen: You know what to do?\n\nStudent: Yeah.\n\nBen: It's going to be epic.\n\nStance and Swing\n\nStudent: Have you always taken it back that short?\n\nBen: No, not always but we found that I don't have a lot of rotation in my upper back and so once I get right there, in order to get farther I have to go like this and use my lower back which actually isn't good for consistency. So we're working on more rotation in my thoracic spine, but until then it's just like boom! And I'm hitting it so straight.\n\nStudent: Yeah, that's awesome.\n\nBen: I was telling my coach, \"I want to take it back further.\" He goes \"why wouldn't you want to take it back shorter and keep increasing our distance?\" And I'm like \"good point.\"\n\nStudent: Yeah, I was actually watching you do that. Is that what I'm doing? I'm tilted the wrong way?\n\nBen: So what happens is, is that you start like this and then on impact you go like this. I think you're getting more power if you preset your hips here and then you can just shoot. With me?\n\nStudent: Absolutely.\n\nSand Trap Wedge\n\nBen: If you actually, see how my shaft is actually pointing that way?\n\nStudent: Right.\n\nBen: Then that bounce hits and it slides so you get a lot of forgiveness and the ball won't go as far but you're going to get it out every time. So see how it's way forward in my stance and I've got the handle like this.\n\nStudent: Got it.\n\nBen: Okay, so put your feet in my feet and then I want that\u2026\n\nStudent: All the way?\n\nBen: Yeah.\n\nStudent: And then just swing through.\n\nBen: Go ahead, yep. See how that came out easier?\n\nStudent: Yeah.\n\nBen: Any time you lean the handle this way, you're just not going to hit the shot, you're going to dig. So just as much as you can get that shaft pointing this way right, and then you can actually practice by just\u2026 See that line?\n\nStudent: How far behind the ball are you hitting?\n\nBen: An inch.\n\nStudent: An inch? Okay.\n\nBen: And then the club actually lands in it but see how the whole head's going to hit so it's going to look like more but you know, an inch or two. Go ahead, try another one.\n\nStudent: Thank you.\n\nBen: Lean that thing way back. Like that, that's going to expose the bounce. That's all your forgiveness. The more you lean it back, yep and the more you go this way, the worse it is. The more you want to go this way."}

{"text":"Monday, May 11, 2009\n\nThe Science of Golf\n\nby Bob Levine, Exhibits Project ManagerOn May 23rd, little learners will be able to try their hand at our newest exhibit, Itty Bitty Mini Golf. In this pint-sized mini-golf course, our smallest visitors can practice their putting and learn their ABC's on gigantic letters and numbers. While fun is the name of the game, there's science behind every stroke\u2026after all, this is the McWane Science Center.\n\nHave you ever really thought about the physics of striking a golf ball? What seems like the simplest action in the world, hitting a ball towards a hole, is actually a complex chain reaction rife with scientific principles.\n\nFirst, the eyes and brain perform intricate calculations as they size up the situation. How far is the hole? At what angle should I strike the ball? What is the grade of the putting surface? How hard should I hit the ball? All of these questions are estimated based on past experience, muscle memory, instinctive knowledge, and good, old-fashioned guesswork. The brain comes up with its best estimate and sends nerve impulses down the spinal cord and into the limbs.\n\nIn order for the limbs to function properly, the muscles must contract and extend, joints must twist and turn, oxygenated blood must pump through arteries, veins, and capillaries, and tendons and ligaments must stretch and bend. All of this requires energy which comes in the form of calories from the carbohydrates, protein, and fats contained in your food (hopefully from a healthy meal in our Smart Caf\u00e9!). Your body burns the appropriate amount of energy to perform the physical action dictated by your brain and, hopefully, your body responds in kind.\n\nEnergy in the form of force is transferred from the body's core, into the arms, and down the shaft of the golf club into the club head. This force generates an impact with the golf ball. Newton's first law of motion states that a body persists in a state of rest unless acted upon by an external unbalanced force. In this case, the force of the club head impact serves as the external unbalanced force. Since a force is now acting on the ball, the ball responds to Newton's second law of motion by accelerating relative to its mass.\n\nThe ball will continue to roll at a steady velocity forever if no other forces act upon it\u2026but of course, this is never the case on Earth. In our mini-golf example, a number of forces will eventually stop the ball from moving. First, gravity is always acting on the ball, pulling straight down towards the Earth's core. Second, the friction of the turf is always slowing the ball's velocity as it travels. Third, the mini-golf holes are enclosed by barriers and the ball, if struck hard enough, will eventually ricochet off a wall which will change the ball's vector. Of course, if you're lucky and\/or good, the forces you impart on the ball will keep it rolling until it comes to its final resting place at the bottom of the hole you were initially aiming for.\n\nThat's just the tip of the iceberg! Every action we take, no matter how minor it seems, is brimming with science. Think about the physics, chemistry, and biology inherent in every step we take\u2026every word we speak\u2026everything we do! The world is full of scientific principles and the only way to truly understand them is to explore and learn! Contributor Profile:\n\nBob Levine is the Exhibit Project Manager at McWane.

{"text":"HOW TO HIT A HOOK\/DRAW\n\nHitting a slice is usually not a problem for anyone who \"sucks at golf\". The 'Ol Banana Ball often defines the term! There are so many things you can do during the golf swing to cause a slice. Most of which happens at address before you even start the club back!\n\nThe best way to cure a slice is to learn how to hit a hook. Once you learn how to execute this shot, and what it \"feels like\" to hit this shot, you'll be well on your way to curing your slice for good.\n\nIn order to hit a controlled hook several things have to happen. The clubface has to approach the ball from inside the target line. (an inside-out swing) The clubface has to be pointing at the target at impact, and you must release your hands to square the face up at impact. Simple enough, how do we do that?\n\nFirst take a \"square stance\". Both feet \"parallel left\" to the target. To see this take your normal stance and then lay a club on the ground with the shaft touching your toes. Step away and look from behind and see where the club \"points\". If it's not parallel left of the target adjust the club on the ground until it is. Take your stance again with your toes now touching the adjusted club on the ground. You are now set up correcty for a straight shot. Got it?\n\nNow set up again with your toes touching the club on the ground which should be aiming parallel left. Bring your right foot back away from the ball about 3 or 4 inches. (more or less. AWAY from the ball, not wider!) You are now set up with a closed stance. If you adjust the club on the ground to touch your toes now and check from behind, it will be aiming either right at the target or to the right of the target. We're half way there!\n\nNow take your stance again, toes touching the club pointing right of the target, clubface aiming At the target. Bring the club back on your takeaway along the LINE OF YOUR FEET. The idea is to bring the club back \"inside\" the target line, (line of the ball to the target) and then to stay on the same plane on the downswing, striking the ball with the club coming from inside the target line, and extending out to the right of the target after impact before it returns naturally to the finish. The clubface facing the target at impact. This will impart a right to left spin on the ball. Since the club head is traveling to the right of the target at impact, and the clubface is pointing AT the target, (just like at address) the ball will start off right of the target and the sidespin will cause it to draw back in.\n\nWant a repeatable and simple Golf Swing that provides power, accuracy consistency and will help you lose that weak fade or slice? Click here.\n\nHelpful Tips:\n\nFast hands are needed to hook the ball. If you already have fast hands the above may work fine. If it doesn't start to hook after some practice try this: To speed up your hands and allow them to turn over at impact sooner, take a stonger than normal grip. To do this you need to rotate your hands to the right. Take your normal grip with the club on the ground behind the ball. Without changing the position of the clubface on the ground, re-grip the club with your hand further under the club. ( The V's of your hands that point say to your right shoulder or chin, now point outside the right shoulder.) (see how to grip the club if you don't get this) By rotating your hands to the right you speed up your wrist action and it's easier to square the clubface at impact naturally.\n\nWhen you get to the impact zone make sure you make a conscience effort to turn your hands over hard! (release your hands)\n\nPractice this with 1\/2 swings without a ball. You should see the back of your right hand clearly when you reach hip height on the follow through. That tells you you've released the clubhead. If you don't see the back of your hand you've lost a lot of power, left the clubface open, and the ball will either slice or push-slice.\n\nGREAT DOWNSWING TIP!\n\nIt's easy to say swing from inside out, but how do you know you're doing it? Here's how! When you start your downswing make sure you start by dropping your right elbow into your right side. So close that it might even brush against your shirt. If you do this it will cure a lot of problems immediately! Just remember to release the hands at impact.\n\nPractice these moves at the range until you can consistently hook the ball. All of these adjustments are based of course on how you set up now, how you grip now etc. I can't see you, but it almost doesn't matter. Unless you are already gripping it like a sledgehammer their should be room to rotate your hands a bit more to the right. Once you've hooked a few you can work on fine tuning it by possibly not closing your stance as much, or bringing your grip back a little more to the left.\n\nWhenever you go to the range be sure to take some time to practice hitting hooks, draws, and fades. It will take some time but eventually you will get the feel for these shots and will be able to correct and adjust for whatever \"bug\" creeps into your swing on the course. Nothing is more frustating than not knowing what is causing a big slice, and aiming further left only makes it worse.\n\nYou'll be amazed at how quickly your scores will drop when you practice shot making and not just beating balls hoping the stars will allign and one will go straight. Practice doesn't make perfect, it makes permanent. Practice the right things and you'll improve. Practice the same wrong swing over and over and you'll always SUCKATGOLF"}

{"text":"Plan your strategy before playing\n\nDusty SloanPublished: June 8, 2006 12:00AM\n\nNo contractor would start to build a house without a blueprint, and most business professionals develop a business plan before launching a venture. The success of these projects is determined by the planning done before the work begins.\nBut how many golfers do you know who actually plan their strategy before they begin their round of golf? I would bet very few. And I also would guess the few who do so generally are good players. Planning in golf is an essential part of course management, and a key to building a good score by making sound decisions throughout the round.\nI think the decisions golfers make on par-3 and par-5 holes are some of the most important for course management. Have you ever heard a golfer exclaim finally an easy hole as they pulled up to a par-3 and then proceed to take a double bogey (or worse)? As par-3s, these holes definitely are shorter and may seem to be a break in your round, but they are scorebreakers if you end up with a big number on the scorecard.\nPar-3s are not defenseless. Pay special attention to the trouble areas that usually are part of a good par-3. This may be conditions like wind direction, water and sand hazards, and pin position. Always remember your goal on par-3s is not to break your round. Play for par. A bogey will not hurt you too badly and a birdie will be a bonus, but a big number will ruin your round. A wise plan is to play to the fat part of the green and eliminate the big score.\nLikewise, par-5s should be a good chance for par or better for good golfers, but poor shot selection can turn the par-5 opportunity from birdie to bogey very quickly. Plan your par-5 and par-3 strategies before you start these key holes in your round.\nThere is a lot of ego in reaching a par-5 in two, and there are occasions to try to do so, but the smart golfer will consider the risk\/reward factor in their shot selection. If reaching the green in two is not realistic, it may be wise to use a 3-wood off the tee and then carefully consider your second shot club selection, so you will end up with your favorite or most comfortable yardage as the third shot approach to the green.\nLet me build an example of par-3\/par-5 strategy by utilizing my home course. Rolling Acres has a unique back nine holes in the fact that the first six holes on it are alternating par-5s and par-3s. This is rather unusual and gives the golfer a great blend of risk and opportunity. Hole No. 10 is a par-5 which plays about 500 yards and is reachable in two for the long hitter, but the second shot must carry a sizable water hazard.\nThe par-5 hole No. 12 can play up to 600 yards, the longest hole in Ashland and Lorain counties, and absolutely is a three-shot hole under most conditions. Hole No. 14 is a reachable 510-yard par-5 if the golfer can shape a left to right drive.\nThe par-3s between these holes range from a short 157 yards on No. 15 to a 210-yard challenge on hole No. 13. This stretch of six holes, and the decisions that golfers make on them, can make or break a round.\nIn business, you are well-served to develop a plan and then implement it. This works in golf, too. Make good decisions on par-3s and par-5s in your game, and you will like what happens to your scoring average.\nn Brad Ruminski is a certified PGA Golf Professional at the Rolling Acres Golf Club (419-652-3160"}

{"text":"Health & Wellness In BC and Beyond!\n\nOur golf specific 4 part series starts with understanding the scope of prevention and screening techniques widely offered by both medical and fitness professionals. Over the course of the last decade I have worked with more and more golfers who experience similar mechanical breakdowns, whether they are recreational or elite golfers \u2013 the corrective component should be an active part of any person's golf game.\n\n53% of amateur golfers and 30% of professional golfers will play with an injured back or performance hindering injury this year. InAmerica, more than $50 billion is spent annually on back pain-related healthcare costs. Therefore, with stats like these \u2013 it pays to invest in proper coaching, and bio mechanical corrective tools, like the TPI and FMS\/ SFMA screens. When used together and tailored to the athletes goals, can lead to not only prevention of injury, but advancement on the green.\n\nThe TPI Golf Screen is one of the most valuable tools in the toolbox for any golf, fitness, or health professional who works with golfers, even at the recreational level. Both screens can help identify physical limitations that shape a player's swing and contribute to painful movement.\n\nWhat's the difference?\n\nTPI -Titleist Performance Institute (TPI) \u2013 the leaders in elite player development. Is a screen to showcase mechanical dysfunctional and breakdowns, related to the measure of risk of injury or poor play specifically in playing golf. There are 13 individual tests within the Level 1 Screen plus additional tests introduced at Level 2 for the wrist, ankle, and neck.\n\nFMS \u2013 Functional Movement Screen (FMS) \u2013 is a ranking and grading system to showcase mechanical dysfunctions, breakdowns and asymmetries within the fundamental movement patterns performed day to day, and relates that to physical activity. The SFMA (selective functional movement assessment) takes it one step further is closely related to the TPI screen in it's specificity to breaking down movement even further to better pull out dysfunction.\n\nBoth aim to sequentially offer corrective intervention techniques for improved overall movement in the client's chosen sport and daily life.\n\nOne way to organize the TPI screen is along the global movement patterns within the SFMA. This structure won't provide the same level of prioritization as within the FMS, as it is more indepth and used within the clinical setting more so that the gym floor, but we can begin to combine and connect the individual tests using the SFMA Top Tier seven assessments, along with the TPI specific tiered movement pattern assessments.\n\nTop \"Swingers\" for Golf Specific Corrective Intervention:\n\n1. Cervical Patterns\/ Pelvic Tilt Patterns: making the argument that considering they are both affected by the other (meaning the top and bottom of the spine \u2013 when one moves, the other must follow). It makes sense to screen both of these elements. Lower crossed posture (S posture in TPI terminology) with a pelvic restriction, will have a similar effect as a cervical restriction due to the interrelationship of spinal segments. This is extremely common and cannot be over looked.\n\n2. Upper extremity in Postural Alignemnt: 90-90 screen falls into this category along with the 90-90 in golf posture. The 90-90 golf posture test puts more emphasis on shoulder mobility and posterior line in conjunction with the back line, spiral and lateral fascial lines.\n\n3. Multi -Segmental Flexion and Multi-Segmental Extension, as well as Upper Quarter and Lower Quarter Screens: both apply equally. Setting up your physical intention starting out on the tee, you need to be able to differentiate upper and lower extremity to ensure proper follow through and minimize lateral shifting; which directly relates to a reduced mobility and rotation in the hips necessary to power out and connect with the ball. Moreover, the S-posture commonly seen in poor golf mechanics is directly related to these specific assesments.\n\nFull TPI Screen (cross over with the FMS and SFMA), consists of the following:\n\nPelvic tilt\n\nTorso rotation\n\nLower body rotation\n\nOverhead deep squat\n\nToe touch\n\n90-90 shoulder and 90-90 shoulder in golf stance\n\nSingle leg stance\n\nLat length\n\nUpper quarter (without and with scapular stabilization)\n\nLower quarter\n\nGlute bridge\n\nReach roll and lift\n\nLeg lowering\n\nAnkle inversion\/eversion\n\nWrist (multiplanar)\n\nPartial squat\/ankle eversion\n\nCervical spine\n\nFMS and SFMA: (Top Tier Assessments \u2013 applicable for golf and integration with the TPI)\n\nI would also be inclined to implement the trunk stability and rotary stability depending on the clients overall performance. Much of the swing pattern stems from being able to differentiate upper and lower extremities, rotation at the hips and powering through the trunk with flawless technique. This sequence is key to a golfer's performance in tee-ing off.\n\nApplying Corrective Interventions:\n\nIf the player is in pain, the first priority is to get them out of pain, much like in the FMS, if they score a \"zero\" a.k.a feel pain, refer directly to a physiotherapist or golf specific athletic therapist.\n\nAddress the breakdowns that are most relevant to the player's swing pattern. A major concept upon which TPI is built is the body-swing connection. How the player sets up their stance, body positioning in relation to the ball and how the player swings the club is an expression of his or her underlying movement ability or restriction pattern.\n\nCorrect all the failures you can visually see. You can only correct one movement pattern at a time. A big issue we see are clients and coaching programs that become too scattered and it will overhelm the client and most likely your own perscrption. Start with the lowest scored test or largest asymmetry (visual breakdown) and start to clean it up with corrective work off the green and practical application on the range or on the green. Most often we find when one pattern is cleaned up, they will innately affect the rest of breakdowns (usually for the better). This will give you more of an accurate overall assessment of the clients performance in their swing, chipping, putting etc.\n\nHave a prioritization scheme within the Screen. It is designed to give you the major movement patterns, but after the first screen, you should start to get a feel for the client's specific mechanics. If they pass certain tests with flying colors, there is no need to rescreen them every time on that test. I screen clients every quarter on the full screen, but every 4-6 weeks I will screen the prioritized movement patterns, and each session will ensure there is an increase in movement and better performance \u2013 this comes from communication and active engagement between myself and my clients golf's pro.\n\nThis is part 1 of a 4 part series on golf specific correction and intervention strategies. Next week we will look at the fascial components and tensegrity of the lines associated with the swing. We will also breakdown corrective drills to improve your tee off, based on the balance and integrity of this massive structure \u2013 we call our Fascial System.\n\nThis will be a great post for those of you who have inconsistent drives, slice the ball or have mobility restrictions in the hip and spine.\n\nMuch of the fascial system integration in performance based movement can be found"}

{"text":"Tiger Woods was the defending champion of the Wachovia Championship held in Charlotte. However, he couldn't make the tournament because of his knee surgery that kept him out. However, I'm not quite sure him playing would have made a difference after seeing Anthony Kim's performance this year. Kim finished today's round with a 69 and won by a five shot margin over Ben Curtis.\n\nBut that's not really the exciting part of it--first, Kim's 16 under total broke Tiger's tournament record by 3 shots, and the win made him the youngest on tour to win since 2002 (He's 22). He used a combination of booming drives and pinpoint accuracy around the green to basically blow away the competition.\n\nI love seeing things like this happen on the tour, not only because of the outstanding play, but with Kim once again proving that parity in golf is not such a bad thing. I am sure that everyone has their favorites week in and week out, but with having new players like Kim come along and make it that much tougher and give the PGA much more credibility and excitability (yes, I know Tiger is the marketing king, but he can't win every time....)."}
{"text":"Free Golf Lessons\n\nCrush Your Drives AND Keep It In Play\n\nby Frank Peter\n\nSo you want to drive like Tiger and putt like Ben Crenshaw, huh? Don't we all.\n\nLong drives and accuracy are a bit like oil and water in terms of a combination but they don't have to be. Just imagine if you could hit your drives consistently in the fairway 250 yards + nearly every time. Wouldn't that make the game a lot easier and more fun?\n\nOf course good equipment also helps a lot. Most importantly, appropriate clubs that are proven for long drives while still being very forgiving are a good way to add extra yards. A good example is the new Pinemeadow Golf Doublewall 400cc Driver which features a exclusive proprietary design to maximise distance while increasing the sweet spot for improved forgiveness.\n\nAlso, having a good tee ball is critical to your confidence and placing the ball\nwhere you can score. We all can get easily frustrated when things go\nsideways with the driver so I'm going to share you with you some secrets on\nhow to get the most distance from your tee ball while keeping it accurate.\n\nThere are basically three elements to being able to get the distance and\naccuracy you desire with the driver.\n\nYou must have a good handle on the clubhead and have complete control of\nit. There are two things to check when dealing with club face control.\nFirst, you need to check your grip. Second, you need to see if you have the\nability to hit a ball to the left and to the right. If you can do both of\nthose, you should be able to split the difference and hit the ball straight.\nNow, I'm not talking about being able to work the ball like a trick shot\nartist, just know how to bend it a little right or left when needed. (Hint:\nOpen the clubface to hit a fade, close it slightly for a draw)\n\nMake sure you have good rotation in the shoulders and hips. Power is\ncreated from \"coiling\" or turning away from and then back through the ball.\nIf you don't \"coil\" or turn properly, you will never realize maximum\ndistance. Pretend you are trying to turn your belt buckle as far away from\nthe target while turning during your backswing. Also, make sure that when\nyou come through the ball at impact, you are completing your turn to a nice\nhigh and solid finish.\n\nYou will need really good rhythm in order to achieve your best distance\nand accuracy. Don't be tempted to make a quick move from the top of your\nswing, which can ruin your entire tempo and sequence of events. (Most high\nhandicappers make this mistake). You can counteract this movement by\ndeveloping internal counting during your swing. Counting \"one one thousand\"\non your backswing and \"two one thousand\" on the downswing will help to\ncreate a smooth rhythm.\n\nNow, most people will have trouble with these elements with the driver\nbecause it is the longest and most difficult club to hit. It will be easier\nwith the shorter clubs because there is less of a premium on distance and\nmore on accuracy.\n\nOne drill I have seen work wonders is to try and alternate hitting your\ndriver and 9 iron when practicing. Start with the 9 iron and make a few\ngood swings using the 3 elements above. Don't overswing, just make nice\neasy swings. Then, pick up the driver and create the same motion and tempo.\nDon't swing any harder, just focus on the elements. If you can't hit the\ndriver with the same results as your 9 iron, go back to the 9 iron and see\nthe difference. Keep alternating 9 iron and driver until you get a\nconsistent rhythm and tempo. A great case in point is to watch PGA pro\nKenny Perry. He hits the ball a long way with a very compact and easy\nswing. Why? Because he has great control over his clubhead, makes a\nwonderful turn away from and through the ball and lastly, has exceptional\nrhythm.\n\nSo, pay attention to these 3 elements and don't be surprised if you starting\nhitting them long AND straight"}

In the afternoon all amateurs played short tees so the intermediates and recs got rated off the advanced division.\n\nThe pros played long tees both rounds and you can see from their scores that the afternoon breezes accounted for no more than a one-throw difference from their morning rounds. So the weather was not much of a factor, and the pros show how much of a factor it was.\n\nKnowing all that, do you think you'll be able to generate official ratings for the first round for the lower amateurs?

{"text":"know why this is getting upvoted so much. Do you watch golf? Do you ever see someone chip from the green? No. The only way this is true is most greens aren't that big. If a pro lands on the green that far from the hole, they absolutely do putt.\n\nHere's the real reason the longest putts were made by amateurs:\n\nPros aren't as likely to be in a position this terrible on the green\n\nIf a pro puts it in the hole from this far out it's a happy accident - they didn't mean to do it. Putting the ball in the right position for a two-putt is better than going for an essentially impossible 1-put and ending up too far away to make the second putt. Any pro should 2-putt the vast majority of lies. A 3 putt is a mistake, and a 4-putt is just unheard of.\n\nWhile I agree with the rest, the last I doubt is important. This isn't longest putt ever but longest televised putt ever. It seems to me highly doubtful that there are far more amateur golfers having their rounds televised than professionals.\n\nThis is terrible reasoning for an already faulty premise. Professional golfers don't putt from that far out because they put the ball closer to the hole on the green. I can tell you from years of experience at golf clubs around the United States, nobody is using a wedge on the green.\n\nBut LT. these Mexican Triad Marijuana Dealers are taking over these streets and dealing heroin pot to welfare! They don't respect the law and all these Senator Congressman in the Oval Offices are trying to jam me up.\n\nYOUR RIGHT BROBOVSKY GODDAMNIT GET OUT THERE AND CLEAN UP THESE STREETS\n\nIf the Everyman only knew... I swam competively in my youth and in college. The swimmers \"partied\" the hardest of any frat or sports team. When you practice twice a day 6 days a week you tend to do that.\n\nTrue story: My friend went to a college which the US swimming team was using for Olympic qualifying rounds. She went to a party that night and Michael Phelps came in and yelled \"Who wants to suck Olympic dick?\"\n\nI recall my brother (former All-American on Auburn University's swim team... knew a lot of Olympians) telling me a story about Phelps and Eric Vendt (former USA distance swimmer) having a \"contest\" at the Olympic village in Athens in 2004. Sex was 2 points and any other sexual encounter was 1 point. At the end of the Olympics, Phelps beat Vendt by a score of 38 to 37 by fucking some girl in the airport bathroom before their flight left.\n\nSo yeah, I don't think he cares if Reddit finds his face unattractive.\n\nI used to live in Colorado Springs, and one night me and my friends go get some food at the BK right down the road from the Olympic training center. Just as we were leaving, Phelps walks in. My friend asks him \"are you Michael Phelps?\" Phelps turns to us and yells \"I'm just trying to eat my fucking food.\"\n\nthe golf course at st. andrews is a links style course - no trees, bunkers are generally small and potholish as opposed to the miniature beaches of non-links couses, and the fairways blend right into the greens with no rough or longer grasses separating them. While the grass in the fairways is generally longer than that of the greens, because of the lack of significant variance in length of the grass along the line between the tee and the green, you get the joke.\n\nPros do putt from that distance, all the time. The thing is they do the smart thing and position the ball for an easy 2-putt rather than trying to hole it and potentially fucking themselves over and 3-putting.\n\nWanted to ask about that handicap thing. I understand the basic theory that \"A golfer's net score is determined by subtracting the player's handicap from the gross score (the number of strokes actually taken).\" thus allowing for low skill players actually 'win' a competition even if they had a larger number of strokes during the game.\n\nBut what is the reasoning behind this? Like you don't see a tennis match between Federer and some low rating guy start 0:2 in favor of the outsider just because Federer is higher in the ranking. So why is this in golf? Is it a tradition?"}
{"text":"So true......and because of that huge lead in points, it took a long, long time for Tiger to fall out of the number 1 rank.

{"text":"The House of Zen\n\nDevongolfer, I quickly put this quick video together to explain the roles of ground forces play in golfswing. I hope this gives you better insight and understanding. Ground forces Roll In The Golf Swing\n\nZen, many thanks for taking the time to put this together for me, I really appreciate it, especially since you are busy doing other things as well.\n\nFrom your video, I took the following points\n\n1: above all stability. As you crank up the effort, you will need counter balancing forces to maintain stability, otherwise you will create a slide or a turn. This means not only power from the right leg \/ foot creating the turn, but extra effort from the left leg \/ foot to constrain the movement to a pivot, not a slide.\n\n2: what you want is a rapidly accelerating and then rapidly decelerating radial motion of the hips (give or take, about about a stable pivot point). I might come back on this as I think more about Hitting and Swinging, but I understood what you were saying in the video\n\n3: there is not a lot of movement (distance moved) in the hips, it is more about power \/ thrust or torque. In other words it is not so much moving the hips as using the hips to create torque so that the upper body moves.\n\nOn this last point, I got something from raz's and Dart's comments on this thread, so I will add another comment on this in a separate section.\n\nI think there is more in the video for me to, so I will come back to it in the future. Thanks again.\n\nI saw raz's and Dart's comments about \"dynamic connection\" and \"resistance\" earlier. I felt that this was important, but was not sure what they meant. Then Zen posted his video about ground forces (not the same thing at all), and I thought, that's it, I am off to the practice ground.\n\nI am going to use the word \"clench\" as in clenching teeth or buttocks, I am sure there are better words, but this what I am going with just for the purposes of this post.\n\nAt set up, everything is relatively relaxed. As you start the turn, you brace the right knee and this restricts the right hip from moving back. If you keep going with the shoulders, you feel a stretch in the right side.\n\nNow, I think I understood something important today, I'm posting, as usual, in case I have misunderstood and then someone can correct me.\n\nYou can create that stretch feeling in two ways, I found.\n\nThe way I assumed was meant, until today, was to turn until you could not physically turn any more.\n\nThe way I found, using Dart's and raz's comments as pointers, is that you can also \"clench\" the muscles in your core, including the right side. This tightens the connection between the hips and the shoulders. In this state, you cannot more the hips independently of the shoulders, they are locked together.\n\nSo, what I was doing was making a backswing and then clenching. This was not at the maximum possible rotation position. It was a full rotation, but not 100%, and then clench at this point and hold.\n\nFrom here, I would drive the hips forward maintaining that feeling.\n\nAll the power and the acceleration from the hips is transmitted instantly to the upper body, there is no independent movement of the hips leaving the upper body behind.\n\nI would worry about heaving my shoulders OTT, but I remembered Pete's videos about the hip movement and made sure that the rotation in the hips was more about moving the left hip back than the right hip forward.\n\nWhat this means is that the shoulders are still turned back relative to the hips all the way down through impact. You don't ever unwind the torso, you just use the power of the hips and the right arm.\n\nI can do this because I can feel it, it is not a thought.\n\nFrom here, this developed into turn, clench, hit the heck out of the ball with the hips and the right arm and NOT with any relaxation of that clenched feeling and definitely NOT with any movement of the shoulders turning forwards relative to the hips.\n\nIt all got a bit PCH to start with, leaving the club behind. But once I started to work on HCP, but wanting that clenched feeling plus the power of the hips and right arm working together, I started to get the hang of it.\n\nI think, and correct me if I am wrong, that the clenched feeling is what raz means by a dynamic connection as opposed to relaxed muscles that allow the hips to move independently of the upper body.\n\nI think also that this creates the conditions needed for further effort on the ground forces to pay off, otherwise that effort would just go into moving the hips not the golf ball.\n\nDevon, In summary the ground is king, homer 6-m-1 is a vital clue and 2-m-4. Our focus is our feet, we connect with the ground effectively is what creates good lower body stability. How we push and pull against the ground is what produces lower body acceleration and stretch the muscles between the lower body and upper body.\n\nThe deceleration of the lower body allows us to contract the core muscles which have been stretched. Remember it's about the amount of acceleration applied to the muscles being stretched. To generate the stretch\/shorten cycle.In addition if we don't generate deceleration patterns, our lower body we can not contract the core muscles effectively to accelerate the upper body. Lower body stabilization and bracing is crucial to producing lower body deceleration patterns. Again how we press forward and generate an equal opposite force reaction on the downswing phase, is equally important to stabilize the lower body so it can decelerate effectively so the core muscles can contract and the upper body accelerates.\n\nIn addition to this to pass speed to the next body segment it has to slow down. To transfer speed from the lower body to the upper body. The lower body must slow down. Conservation of momentum.\n\nThis is the same for upper and arms relationship. The upper body must slow down to pass energy to the arms. The arms must slow down so we can transfer energy out into the club. The whole body must brace at impact to ensure all the energy from the ground up is transfered out through the club and imparted onto the ball.\n\nBased on the quick cycle of thinking I understood something and then you pointing out that I really did not, I think this is an area that I should leave alone until I get a chance to see your chum in the UK, Alex.\n\nHowever, when I next get a chance to experiment on the practice ground, I think the thing I need to try and feel is that diagonal stretch across the front of the torso. And stay away from that feeling of stretch in the right side, I liked your illustration of how that is a sign that I might be moving the upper body incorrectly.\n\nThe great news is that you took the time to come back and correct me before I ruined a season based on getting something wrong. I have done that before!\n\nDon't worry about clenching buttocks, I did not mean that I was doing that, I was just trying to illustrate what I meant by the word clench. Bad writing in the post by me.\n\nDevon, Happy to help, keep on asking questions and happy to keep on helping you to understand. It' is very complex and once you do understand it, you will understand why I bang on about why this all has to be trained. I see so many theories out their and claims you just do this with your feet etc and walla you have ground forces. You quick know they don't understand the full story what ground forces play. Ground forces are only one piece of the puzzle, although a very important piece though.\n\nSame as Mike's stuff ( Sevam ) it may work for him what he does although won't work for others, these are his feels that he generates. Although again he doesn't quite do what Hogan does either, Mike loses connection with the ground in his downswing you can see his centre of mass drifting and going into extension at impact. His belt buckle drifts to right field(coaches call this air rooting). Hogan never did that. Hogan also never locked onto his left hips as indicate either, he internally rotated and his lower body braced at impact. Mike doesn't do this.\n\nAlthough what I do like is Mike bringing ground forces to the world's attention, his message is a 100% right the secret is in the dirt, ground force are crucial. Hogan's secret was how he connected with the ground and he had beautiful lower body mechanics.\n\nHow ever this was only part of the puzzle of what made Hogan great. He had a kinetic link was his real secret. A company processed his swing in 2D biomechanics the measurements showed a kinetic link sequence.\n\nThis is a great video to watch explaining why coordination has to be trained and the kinetic link has to be trained. Back in the day our company us to only supply 3D data to coaches and health care professional, fitness trainers etc. What was founded is even though your improved people swing mechanics, physical limitation and fitness. When you re-tested them there was no changes in their coordination or swing sequence. People would also regress back to old habits and physical limitations or issues or issues. The reason for this is due to their Kinetic link not changing and due to break down in their coordination and movement patterns was the root causes to their physical limitations or issues and injuries.\n\nVinumcoupe, I did a bunch of testing for an AFL club, what we did find between efficient kickers who kicked to the ball long and accurate in comparison to a short kicker. Is how efficiently they utilised all the power generated from the ground up and transferred all their speed into the football. The guys who kicked it long utilised majority of all their speed from the ground up. They had great connection with the ground and had an effective kinetic link.\n\nShort kicker, break down in ground connection and stability, acceleration deceleration patterns were poor or break downs. Muscular loading or break downs in stretch shorten cycle of muscles in segments. Again they have a break down in their kinetic link to utilise speed and power at the point of impact.\n\nWhat we have found short kickers or kickers have break downs in their kinetic link have a high rate of injuries. Mainly ACL's, hamstring tears etc. This is due to create over acceleration speed of the kicking leg, producing superficial speed to over compensating for a break down in their link. This cause over extension of the knee and hip extension.\n\nThis is due to there aren't using the stretch\/shorten of the muscles to accelerate deceleration of each segment. Instead if the segment decelerating it kick on acceleration put velocity and force on their knee joint centres and muscles.\n\nAgain it's the left leg, torso, right leg, knee extension, foot. Kinetic link. The stretch shorten applies between each segment.\n\nBowling is similar to throwing a baseball really again same old same old again.\n\nIt's all about coordination or the muscles and ground in any sport really once you have the basic understanding cycling, running, walking and kicking are a similar pattern in movement and coordination. Any rotational sport like, tennis, baseball and golf again similar patterns in coordination and movement. The same principles apply.\n\nAlthough when it comes to the sport at hand you have to train the coordination and movement specific to that activity. This is known as specific activity coordination. We Tailor Progressive Skills Training specific to that activity and custom built specific and individually for that athlete.\n\nThere is talk of what Ben Hogan did and there is many misconceptions out there on what Hogan lower body did. A lot of these conceptions are based on visual conceptions based from video or pictures, which can be very deceiving.\n\nThis explains and gives us all a better inside what nueromechanics is about and how we go about training an athlete how to address break downs in movement and coordination or a break down in their Kinetic Link and how we go about training a new patterns.\n\nThe neuromechanics is part of biomechanics, the neural drive or nervous system sends signals or impulses to command the muscles to contract to move body segments. In order to change a persons movement essentially you are retraining their brain sending signals and impulses to command the muscles . In order to change movement you have to train a new circuit to send signals or impulses to command the muscles to produce the new movement pattern. As you develop this circuit the pulses become faster.\n\nAs an example you start of with a basic movement you start of slow to develop a new circuit to send pulses to contract the muscles to coordinate this basic movement. As you repetitively do this basic movement around the circuit you start to develop Myelin. The Myelin develop sheaths which wraps around the circuit. The Myelin sheath it's like fat, What the Myelin sheaths do is increase the charge to make the impulses or signals transmit faster.\n\nWhen you can coordinate this movement slow , you slowly add speed to to the movement so the brain can learn to transmit the pulses or signals faster, to tell the muscles to contract faster. As you repetitively do this pattern with a little more speed you develop more myelin which enables the brain to transmit signals at this speed to coordinate the basic movement pattern. When you achieve this you keep on adding speed to it until you can do at the speed specific to activity you are doing. Once you have basic movement you then add more complex movement patters to which every activity you are learning.\n\nA baby learning to roll, than sit up, then crawl, then stand up, then take slow steps and finally walk at full speed, then learns to run. In a nutshell same again learning small basic movements and add more complex movements and progression as they develop coordination and myelin.\n\nAs you can understand why the mental side is important to make sure our heads don't get in the way of our development. You don't want to conscious interfering with the automatic process.\n\nI hope this all makes sense.\n\nWhat we do is we test an athlete and we used force plates software to measure the interaction with the ground. We used EMG software which measures the muscles and biomechanics to measure the movement or movement patterns. . The Progressive Skills training we custom built for each individual athlete again each exercise was researched and tested using force plates, emg and biomechanics software. So when we look at the data and see certain break downs we know what drills to give to them which will address that break down, retrain and develop a new pattern. The same for the functional programs, the engineers tested certain gym exercises to find out what patterns they can train or what negative impacts they have. How can certain exercise either increase strength to increase power out of the muscles and also train certain movement patterns. When we re-test this tells us how people are progressing and the changes in movement, it also gives us a road map to what is the next phase of drills and exercises they need to keep on developing their new patterns.\n\nEverything we do we research and test, the more people you test see patterns and trends for certain break downs, It's like lower body mechanics there is three distinct breakdowns. From these certain break downs you see many different causes and effects how the rest of the body moves. Over 25 years of testing you have a mountain of data to cross reference to see patterns and trends. So when you test someone and see a certain pattern you know these set drills that we have researched and tested will address these breakdowns and develop new patterns of movement.\n\nWe know providing all the other facets are covered and providing people doing their training as instructed they will improve and get results. It has taken our engineers 25 years of research to develop what ZenoLink is today.\n\nFor the athlete they are given the drills and by doing the drills this trains their body how to develop and kinetic link improve their coordination to swing a golf club or orRecently there has been discussion on how does the club load or how do we create lag. So how do tour player load or create lag of the golf club here is the truth how they do it.\n\nhere is the real truth how tour players load the club.\n\nIn the golf swing is composed of four components and three links\n\n. The components are the hips, shoulders, arms and club shaft. The links are the musculature connection for each component. As the golfer begins the back swing, the components rotate in a clockwise fashion around the spine. This then begins to lengthen the muscles and pre-loads or stretches each link. (The muscles between the Lower body and upper body. The muscles between upper body and arms. )\n\nBefore the club and shoulders reach maximum rotation on the back swing, the hips begin to transition; changing direction and rotating in an anti-clockwise acceleration towards impact with the ball. Note that this occurs while the shoulders, arms and club continue in their clockwise direction, thus creating muscular pre-load or stretch between the lower and upper body.\n\nWhen the muscles are pre-loaded or stretched the muscles contract and cause the shoulders to then begin their transition, changing direction (following the lead of the hips) in an anti-clockwise acceleration towards impact while the arms and club are still in a clockwise direction the muscles are pre-loading between the upper body and arm. Once pre-loaded occurs the muscles between the upper body and arms contract causing the arms to change direction and accelerate toward impact. This sudden change of direction cause the arms and club to pre-load the muscles of the wrist and forearm, the club begins to load or the angle between the right wrist and the club increases as the arms and wrist accelerate into impact.\n\nOnce all of the components are accelerating in an anti-clockwise direction towards impact of the ball, the body uses both physics and physiology to most efficiently create club head speed. The hips are the first to reach maximum rotational speed. Like a whip, once a maximum speed is reached, the segment then decelerates, \"passing\" the momentum (speed) to the shoulder segment. Both the passing of momentum and the stretch and shortening of the muscles between hips and shoulders accelerate the shoulder segment to a maximum speed twice that of the hips.\n\nThe shoulders, having reached the maximum rotational speed, now decelerate and \"pass\" their momentum to the arms to a maximum speed twice that of the shoulders.\n\nFinally, the arms \u2014 in the same manner as the hips and shoulders \u2013 decelerate, passing energy to the club, thereby doubling the momentum yet again. The club then uncocks and accelerates into impact with the ball with both maximum linear and angular speed, creating optimum speed and power at the point of impact.\n\nThe above is quite a skin full to wrap our heads around although in a nut shell all this means is :\n\nWhat causes the club to load is when the lower body accelerating towards impact followed by the upper body accelerating to wards impact applies speed or velocity to the arms whilst they are still going back to complete their back swing. The rotational speed of the lower body and upper body accelerating towards impact, forces the arms to change direction and load the club creating the angle between the right wrist and the shaft. As the arms continues to accelerate towards impact this angle continues to increases until the arms slow down. When the arms slow down this causes the club to release or the right wrist to unhinge and the club accelerates delivering at the speed at the point of impact.\n\nScott, with cricket bowlers is it the faster bowlers or spin bowlers who leak power thru their delivery stride?\n\nRupert_The_bear, They can both lose power through their delivery stride.\n\nThe actually coordination of movement to generate a bowling action is the same, lead foot, hips, core(upper body) arm (internal\/external rotation). Fast bowlers use speed and forward momentum to generate more speed, as well as using a kinetic link.\n\nUsing their speed running in can be lost if they don't heel strike and connect to the ground effectively. This effects two things: 1)Their ability to generate more hip speed to stretch the muscles in the core to accelerate the upper body.\n\n2)The main power loss is the forward momentum of speed, their lead foot\/leg doesn't stabilise at foot contact passing the momentum up through to the hips. In addition the foot contact it what produces hips rotational speed.\n\nThis is very important to understand the lead leg has to stabilise to transfers speed up through the body. Also the stabilisation is to decelerate the lower body for two reasons.\n\n1)The muscles stretched in the core between the hips and upper body can contract to accelerate the upper body.\n\n2) transfers speed up through the kinetic link to deliver all the speed out through the arm.\n\nRupert same applies for spin bowlers they produce the same patterns so the same applies, the reason they don't bowl as fast is they aren't using as much speed or forward momentum when they hit the crease is all.\n\nHope this helps, does this make sense? If it doesn't i can try to explain further it's so hard to explain in simple terms and not to write a 3 page Essay at the same time :)\n\nScott, can I send you thru some photos of a left arm off spinner for you to have a quick look at & give some comments on.

{"text":"Each week Old Warson Country Club Director of Instruction Rick Ewing gives a tip of the week. This week, he guides golfers through the proper backswing.\n\nThe more compact your backswing, the easier it is to hit solid irons. When you begin the takeaway with your shoulder turn, the club should be pointing away from the target when it is parallel to the ground (about half way back). Controlling the clubface at this point is also important. When your club is parallel to the ground, the clubface should look slightly closed (it will look closed but will actually be square to your swing plane). To eliminate wasted motion, work on moving your hands on a circular path (45 degrees) to the top of the backswing. There is a simple checklist for the position at the top of the backswing (this is opposite for a left-handed player):\n\nA) Flat left wrist (the hinge in the left wrist occurs in the bottom of the wrist, not by cupping it). B) Angle in the right wrist (feel like you are holding a serving platter in the front of your right wrist). C) Right elbow pointing at the ground (no chicken wing). D) Keep your left forearm and shaft of the club on the same plane (45 degree angle).\n\nUsing a mirror at home or at a golf facility will allow you to get feedback on your backswing positions. Don't over think the backswing...you are not hitting the ball backwards.\n\nOne crucial element for good iron play is to maintain a constant spine angle throughout the swing. This enables you to hit down at impact, correctly taking a divot after the ball. Many amateurs tend to rise up as they swing the club down in a mistaken attempt to help lift the ball into the air. Lifting leads to poor contact such as fat or thin shots.\n\nTo correct this tendency, swing to a finish position and then hold it for a moment. Then bring the club back down as if someone hit the rewind button. You should be able to get right back into your address position. That's maintaining your spine angle.\n\nWant to ask Rick Ewing about a golf tip. Email him at rickewing@pga.com."}

The result is The First Tee of Greater Charleston, a program designed to expose kids between 8 and 18 to a game that could change their lives.\n\nNot because it will improve their short game or lengthen their drives. Although hundreds of kids will be exposed to golf and taught the skills of the game through this program, the ultimate goal has more loft than a sand wedge.\n\n\"We're not trying to make better golfers,\" said Ben Grandy, the program's director. \"We're trying to make better people for our community.\"\n\nCore values\n\nGrandy expects more than a hundred kids to show up next Tuesday (June 17) when the First Tee program kicks off at Patriots Point Links in Mount Pleasant.\n\nThe golf course has donated time and space for the program. The kids have been recruited from the Boys and Girls Clubs, The YMCA and the YWCA.\n\nInstruction will be handled by a host of volunteers, according to Grandy.\n\n\"We've got PGA pros who have been in the business 20 years; we've got retirees who just love the game of golf; we've got college students; your average working people. Some know a lot about golf, some don't, which is great, because the program isn't just about golf.\"\n\nThat's because The First Tee teaches things beyond the basics of alignment, swing plane and keeping your head down.\n\nDuring these precious hours of instruction, the real focus is to instill the program's Core Values of Life \u2014 honesty, integrity, sportsmanship, respect, courtesy, judgment, confidence, responsibility and perseverance.\n\n\"It's not just about golf,\" said Grandy, a 25-year-old graduate of Clemson's Professional Golf Management program and native of Batesburg-Leesville. \"We get views from all different kinds of directions. We want our volunteers to form relationships with the kids and be able to relate to the kids in what we call 'coachable moments.'\n\n\"We want them to take what they're learning in the program and relate it to what they're learning outside the program through school and other sports.\"\n\nLife skills\n\nOne notable aspect of this First Tee program is that it's been the brainchild of the 20-something generation here in the Lowcountry.\n\nThe president and driving force behind it is Joel Willis, a 27-year-old Georgia graduate from St. Simons Island, who came to Charleston four years ago and works in the risk management business.\n\nHis efforts to bring First Tee to town resulted in a 30-member board that has spent tireless hours making this program a reality. First Tee, a national program, only approves a handful of these local chapters each year.\n\n\"It's really an initiative to teach life skills through the game of golf,\" Willis said. \"The nine core values are things that you and I learned as golfers on the golf course. The kids we're targeting will be from low-income families that aren't preaching those things.\n\n\"A lot of these kids are coming from broken homes. It's a tough road for the mothers out there who are trying to get them to school while they're just trying to survive.\n\n\"Hopefully we can put the time in with these kids and really make a difference.\""}

We have all heard the saying, \"you drive for show and putt for dough.\" This seems to be true at all levels of play from junior golf to playing golf in club tournaments to the major professional tours. Being able to create a consistent putting stroke is vital to you being able to shoot better scores.\n\nArticles will give you the best putting tips on the grip, stance, backswing, forward swing and the finish position. The putting tips are easy to read, easy to understand and easy to implement in to your practice sessions and more importantly when you play. Learn how to better your stroke by only using one hand, implementing free training aids and use tips that the PGA Tour Professionals use.\n\nPutting training aids are very helpful along with putting tips when trying to develop your stroke. There are many popular aids such as the Putting Pegsby Izzo Golf, the TOMI Putting System, the Putting Square System by Eyeline Golf and The Putting Arc Deluxe. It is important when selecting a training aid for yourself you will want to make sure that the theory that it is based on is the theory that you are trying to implement into your golf game.\n\nDave Pelz was a NASA scientist that decided to use statistical data to determine the best way to improve your short game. In his first book, Putt Like The Pros, Pelz unveils the data that he has collected for years to give you the advantage on the greens. Pelz has also written the popular books, The Putting Bible and The Short Game Bible.\n\nStan Utley has become the most demanded teacher in the US. His students include PGA Tour Players as well as Champions Tour Players that include Jay Haas, Craig Stadler, Peter Jacobsen, and Darren Clarke. In addition, many others have received advice from Stan Utleyabout their putting. Utley's theory revolves around the thought that the putter will move in an arc during the stroke. This calls for very few body parts to move and resulting in a consistent stroke. Utley has written two books: The Art of Putting and The Art of the Short Game.\n\nMany golfers wonder how to improve their golf scores the fastest way possible. Even after hearing putting tips that will improve your stroke is the best way to improve your scores. Still, the golfers shuffle over to the driving range and pull out the driver and start pounding away. If this could be you, keep in mind that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting different results."}

{"text":"First Tee introduces golf to kids\n\nWednesday, 20 March 2013 10:53\nLast Updated on Wednesday, 20 March 2013 11:01\nWritten by Ken Garner\n\nKids do say the darndest things.\n\n\"I want to hit my ball in the sand,\" one child golfer confided to another Saturday at Tiger Point Golf Club. The youngster, barely taller than his exaggerated practice club, stood near a sand trap flanking the pitching green a few dozen yards from a driving range.\n\nThe boy was among a dozen or so 5 to 7 year olds participating in the First Tee of Northwest Florida's golf skills program. Evidently, the group hasn't covered scoring strategy \u2013 more experienced golfers know hitting into sand traps is detrimental to their score.\n\nBoozer and some parents helped the children properly grip their clubs \u2013 after helping some decide whether they were left- or right-handed \u2013 and practice swinging the club from an \"L\" formed by golfers' arms and the club's shaft held above and behind their heads through the stroke and back to a reverse \"L\" on the follow-through.\n\nFinally, Boozer directed the children to hit the balls onto the chipping green. That was the target, the green, from 20 yards away. Most of them hit their shots on the first try; a few golfers overshot the mark, a few dribbled the ball toward the target and \u2013 like their older counterparts \u2013 some sliced or hooked the ball wide of the green.\n\nThe children didn't seem to care. After running out of ammunition, Boozer directed the kids to retrieve the balls, adding that each golfer should return with four balls. The scramble resembled nothing more than an early Easter egg hunt, without baskets, but complete with squabbles over who collected which bounty.\n\nThe hour-long session ended with the group divided into boys' and girls' teams for a contest to see which team, and which golfer, could hit a ball closest to a bag tossed on the green for a target.\n\nAccording to its website, The First Tee \"is an international youth development organization introducing the game of golf and its inherent values to young people.\"\n\nThe organization sponsors a variety of after-school and in-school programs using the game of golf to reinforce values like integrity, respect and perseverance.\n\nThe First Tee of Northwest Florida was founded in 2003. It has provided 53 national school programs in Escambia, Okaloosa and Santa Rosa counties' schools and 10 golf courses: Osceola Municipal Golf Course in Pensacola, Stonebrook Golf Club, Pace; Tanglewood Golf Club, Milton; Marcus Point Golf Course, Pensacola; The Club at Hidden Creek; Tiger Point Golf and Country Club; and the military affiliate programs at A.C. Read Golf Course (Naval Air Station Pensacola), Gator Lakes Golf Course (Hurlburt Field), NAS Whiting Field Golf Course and Eglin AFB Golf Course.\n\nThe mission of the local chapter is \"to positively impact the lives of young people by promoting character development and life-enhancing values through The First Tee's 'Life Skills Learning Experience' and the game of golf.'\" The mission is based on nine core values: honesty, integrity, sportsmanship, respect, confidence, responsibility, perseverance, courtesy and judgment.\n\nThe First Tee of Northwest Florida participates with the Greater Pensacola Junior Golf Association, Pensacola Sports Association and Par Four Charities to involve young people who otherwise might not have an opportunity to learn and play the game of golf and learn its values.

{"text":"Swiss Ball Workouts\n\nHere's a quick and easy way to fire up your golf muscles, and improve your strength and flexibility.\n\nMost golf professionals realise the importance of having a flexibility, strengthening and conditioning program. These days, a lot of tour pros use a Swiss ball as part of their daily workout. I suspect that nearly every tour player has a Swiss ball in his home. And, you'll see them in all of the medical facilities on tour. If top players are using Swiss balls to work out, then there's every reason that you could benefit, too.\n\nIf used correctly, a Swiss ball will allow you to build up your postural control. It can also be used to get extra flexibility and core stability. It's a moving sphere, so it requires you to do 'balance re-education'. From a practical point of view, it's light so it can be carried around and used anytime, anywhere, like in a locker room or office.\n\nHowever, there are certain requirements with Swiss balls that many people don't realise. First, you've got to use the ball dynamically to improve your posture. Just because you sit on a Swiss ball doesn't mean it's going to help \u2013 many people actually slump into bad postures. The other big mistake is to buy the wrong sized Swiss ball. If it's too small or big, you're likely to slump or compensate. It's important to be measured so that your legs aren't hanging off the ball and to prevent you from leaning too far forward. Also ensure the ball retains its pressure because a deflated ball can lead to soft posture as well.\n\nI like to think of a Swiss ball workout as an intrinsic challenge that you give yourself every day, rather than just rolling around on it with no purpose. My drills are a little different from generic Swiss ball workouts because I arrange them in a golf-specific sequence. It's a bit like the gears on your car. I want to make sure that you're 'layering up' your skill and motor control as you do these 'tasks', especially before a round of golf. If you use the last exercise first, then you won't get as much control as if you do them in the correct sequence.\n\nThis program takes some time to build up from level 1 to level 7. So contact your local physiotherapist if you experience sharp pain or difficulty with any of the exercises. But I guarantee your golf will benefit from the workout. You'll see the relevance in the golf swing and it will allow your golf muscles to 'fire'.\n\nI firmly believe the Swiss ball can revolutionise the way we prepare specifically for golf. If used correctly, it allows you to build postural control and gain extra flexibility and core stability.\n\nMy skill-graduated exercises are what I call 'primal' challenges. Your muscle groups perform different functions in a sequence rather than just a solitary action. You really have to concentrate throughout your body to keep good form through the chain. I guarantee the workout will talk to you. In other words, you'll see relevance to the golf swing with regard to your set-up and lower-body support. You'll feel the correct muscles 'fire' through the chain if you're doing them correctly. Your posture should improve, your lower base should stay stronger and you'll be able to sequence the right muscles at the right time.\n\nThe beauty of this sequential warm-up routine is that it allows you to measure your feels and tolerances every day. You can gauge your quality of movement for every exercise (say, with a mark out of 10). You can measure how quickly you fatigued on each exercise. And, finally, you can understand how each exercise relates to the golf swing. Since your energy levels vary, they're unique exercises that you can use to monitor your body from day to day.\n\nThe players I've trained see immediate relevance. The secret is not to overdo it. You've got to learn how much you can handle on a particular day. Some days will be better than others. So it's not about doing hundreds of repetitions or 10 times 10. It's about doing what you can handle and understanding your body from inside out"}

So there's him hitting it good, me hitting it mediocre, and two others who are either so rusty as to be poor, or so new as to be slow and poor. Despite hitting from the yellows.\n\nFive hours later, as we finish in the twilight and I've posted a disappointing middle score to my previous two rounds at the same place... well, I'm done. I've gotten to that usual plateau place of feeling that I don't need to play this game anymore, at least not for a good long time, since it's clear that any progress I've been making is an illusion. But more importantly, I've seen what happens when hobbies are shared, especially when it's hot and bad golf has been committed.\n\nNow, the Shooter Wife and I don't have a ton in common. She doesn't watch sports very often, and I can't say I'm big on the knitting and fabric arts that take up her time. We don't watch the same shows, and she doesn't play poker or fantasy sports. When I'm watching shows like \"The Wire\" or \"Breaking Bad\", she's far away; the same goes for me when she's tucking into a cozy mystery with people with British accents. But here's where it works: we don't force things on each other, and we basically share stories with what we've done.\n\nThe husband and wife didn't come to tears over the course of the day, and maybe she'll get better over time. When it was all over, they were still on speaking terms and asking for a restaurant recommendation. But man alive, life is too short to argue with your spouse over what club she should be hitting off the tee, or cringing and apologizing to strangers when she can't keep up or observe common golf etiquette. (I don't much care about the latter, but I do notice when it's violated, and try not to do it to others.) And a little distance in some things isn't exactly toxic to a relationship. I'm coming up on 15 years now and OK... and when I shared this little story with the Shooter Mom? She told me all about how her sister had been taught golf by her current husband, and how after an initial burst of enthusiasm for it, she lost all taste when He Got Demanding. I can't imagine this is a very rare story.\n\nI get that the game takes up too much time, and I get that it's nice when you can share things together. But in the devil's bargain that is golf... I'm thinking no. As in Hell No. (And no, they really were nice people, and he really could play. Especially through the cringing"}

{"text":"Bounce angle is a term generally associated with wedges, but any golf club can have a bounce angle. Besides the golf shaft, bounce angle may be the next most misunderstood concept of a golf club design. Part of this lies in the definition. I have seen many places where the writer defines the bounce as:(Old definition) The measurement of the number of degrees from where the club rests on the ground and the club's leading edge.While the definition above may have been true in the past, it is technically not correct anymore. Before I explain why, let us lead you gradually in this discussion by examining the anatomy of the sole.\n\nFirst, there are four factors that go hand-in-hand in understanding this design parameter of a golf club; sole radius (if at all), sole width, leading edge height and contact point on the sole.If you look at a barrel of old irons, there will be two things you will notice about the sole of a golf club: they were very narrow and they were flat (or almost). Going through my collection of clubs, even game improvement irons as late as the end of the 1990s exhibited relatively narrow soles (0.75\" wide or less) and very little radius compared to custom golf clubs offered today. Take one of these clubs and place it on a table with the shaft being perpendicular to the ground. A toe view of the club should look something like the following diagram.\n\nLooking at the anatomy of the sole, there are a couple important terms to know. The outermost dimensions of the sole are the leading edge (positioned at the bottom of the face) and the trailing edge (positioned along the back edge of the head). The distance between the leading and trailing edges is the sole width. Note that the trailing edge of the sole may be tapered, so the sole width may vary along its' length. Most manufacturers will reference the center point of the sole for this dimension. It is also important to realize that few irons are perfectly flat on the sole although it may look that way. In addition, head manufacturers will normally grind or radius the leading or trailing edge so that it is not a sharp point.\n\nThe next term to mention is the contact point or where the sole makes contact with the ground line when the hosel or shaft is perpendicular to the ground. In the diagram above, the contact point is in the center of the sole meaning that both the leading and trailing edges of the sole are parallel to the ground. If the sole were perfectly flat, then the contact point would be the entire sole width.\n\nWhat happens when the contact point is not in the center of the sole? To start out the understanding of bounce let us use our example where the sole is perfectly flat, contact on the sole is not in the center and yet the hosel is perpendicular to the ground. In this case, there are only two possible positions that the sole can rest on; the leading and trailing edge of the sole.\n\nBuild Better Clubs Now! The Modern Guide To Clubmaking In It's 4th Edition Only $22\n\nIn the case where the contact point is on the leading edge, then the trailing edge with rest above the ground line. The sole angle relative to the ground line forms the bounce angle. In our example, a 0.75\" wide sole has the trailing edge measuring 0.052\" above the ground line, which creates a 4\u00b0 sole angle pointed toward the ground. When this condition occurs, it is referred to as a negative bounce angle or also referred to as a \"digger\" sole. A digger sole does just that as it has a tendency to dig into the ground, which could be considered a negative design characteristic for any club designed to hit off of the ground.\n\nConversely, if the contact point is on the trailing edge, then the leading edge with rest above the ground line again forming a sole angle relative to the ground line. The bounce angle with a 0.75\" wide sole with the leading edge measuring 0.052\" above the ground line creates a 4\u00b0 sole angle pointed upward from the ground. When this condition occurs, it is referred to as a positive bounce angle.\n\nWhy would a golf manufacturer design a golf club with bounce in the first place? It is important to understand at impact that the club may not return with the hosel perpendicular to the ball or that the golfer starts out with the club positioned as the manufacturer measures the loft of the club, but perhaps with a forward press. Whenever the ball is positioned on the ground, it may be necessary for the golfer to hit \"down\" on the ball in order to make solid contact and achieve getting the ball airborne and with increased back spin. For a further explanation why it is important to hit down on the ball, please reference the Angle of Attack article. To account for the downward angle of attack, manufacture's needed to create some bounce into their designs in order to avoid the club from burying into the ground conditions.\n\nHere is an example of the same flat-soled iron with a 4\u00b0 bounce angle with the shaft parallel to the ground and next to it, the same club at impact with a 4\u00b0 angle of attack. By creating the bounce leaving the leading edge above the ground at address, avoided the club from digging into the ground at impact. As the angle of attack matched the bounce angle, the contact point of the sole on the ground is in the center of the sole. If the angle of attack had been any less than 3\u00b0, then the trailing edge would have made contact with the ground, thus the ball would make contact on the face closer to the leading edge of the face. However, if the golfer struck the ball with an angle of attack greater than 5\u00b0, then the leading edge would have made contact with the ground first.\n\nLuckily manufacturers have done away with flat soles as the margin for error is small. The modern iron looks more like the following diagram and as you can see has a sole radius from front to back with no well defined trailing and leading edges to reference. Sole radius accounts for variable angles of attack with minimal contact of the sole on the ground\n\nProducing a radius on the sole, the clubs could conceivably make contact with the ground line at several different positions not possible with a flat sole. Examine the next diagram in regards to the sole radius and the contact point. With a flat soled club, contact made with the center of the sole touching created no bounce as the leading and trailing edges would be level with one another. Therefore on a radius soled club, 0\u00b0 bounce occurs when the contact point is made in the center of the sole when the shaft is hosel is perpendicular to the ground. A positive bounce angle occurs when the leading edge is higher than the trailing edge. For this to occur with the shaft perpendicular to the ground, then the sole contact must be made rearward from the center of the sole. A negative sole angle occurs when the trailing edge is higher than the leading edge. Again, with the shaft perpendicular to the ground, the contact point on the must be forward of the center of the sole.\n\nHowever, this is the very reason why the original definition does not apply anymore. For example, the contact point could be located in the very center of the sole. By the old definition, it was the angle created by the contact point and leading edge. When the sole was flat, this was true, but not with a radius sole. Look at the following diagram to see the reason why. As mentioned before, if the contact point is in the center of the sole on a club with a radius, then there is 0\u00b0 bounce therefore this drawing doesn't accurately depict what sole bounce really is.\n\n(Correct definition) The measurement of the number of degrees between the clubs's leading and trailing edges in relationship to the ground line when the club is in the square position and with the hosel perpendicular to the ground.\n\nThis leads us to the next part of the discussion to understand how bounce is made \/ measured on a club with a radius sole. In order to produce a radius, there first needs to be a circle. For example, let's say the circle on the right has a diameter of 4\" so the radius of the circle is half of that or 2\". The radius of the sole can only be as wide as the sole itself. Scaling to the diagram, the sole radius will be 1.25\" (as indicated by the solid red line), which is extremely wide, but selected to better illustrate the basic idea.\n\nLook at the two pie-shaped segments within the circle. At the base, each is one-half the width of the sole. Where they connect would be the contact point on the ground line which would be in the center of sole. Due to the radius of the arc, only one point along the circle can make contact with our ground line, therefore the outermost positions of the pie shaped pieces along the circumference of the circle will be higher than the ground line. These are labeled \"leading edge\" and \"trailing edge\", which the red line depicting the \"sole width\" which is parallel to the ground line. Using our example with a 2\" radius and a 1.25\" wide sole width, the leading edge will be 0.1\" above the ground line, yet the bounce is 0\u00b0.\n\nA flat soled club with a 1.25\" wide sole and 0\u00b0 bounce, the leading and trailing edges would be on the ground. It is important to understand effect of sole width on the distance from the leading edge to the ground line. There is a faint dotted orange line above and parallel to the red line. If the sole width was 2\", then the leading trailing edges would be 0.268\" above the ground. Contrarily, the shorter the sole width, the leading edge would not be as high given the same sole radius. The importance of this statement will come later.\n\nNow that we have established the sole radius and sole width, the next thing is to select the degrees of bounce to create the leading edge height and contact point on the sole. To help understand this part, let's take the two pie-shaped pieces and the solid red line out of the circle. In the diagram below it looks like we now have four tiny ships. The one on the furthest left is our original model from the diagram above. The second model is the same segment of the circle, but rotated 4\u00b0 counterclockwise from the center of the circle so that leading edge is higher than the trailing edge. The dimension to the right of each segment is the dimension from the leading edge to the ground line. This would be considered positive bounce because the contact point is now located rearward of the center of the sole. Again, it is not the contact point that determines the bounce it is the difference between leading and trailing edges in relationship to the ground line.\n\nThe third model in the diagram shows when the segment of the circle is rotated 4\u00b0 clockwise from the center of the circle so that trailing edge is higher than the leading edge. This creates a negative sole angle, but due to the radius, the leading edge is above the ground line (0.052\"). The last model represents what happens more on a sand wedge where the bounce is much higher than typically the rest of the set (in this case 12\u00b0). The contact point is much closer to the trailing edge, which also raises the leading edge higher off of the ground. A situation where the leading edge is too high can lead to shots that can be bladed in certain situations.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the narrower the sole, the less height the leading edge is above the ground line. By narrowing the sole from 1.25\" to 0.781\" (closer to a normal sole width), the leading edge lowers substantially with the same 2\" sole radius. The model on the far right illustrates just how bounce itself does not tell the whole story. There is a term called effective bounce, which is the bounce measurement, along with the leading edge height and sole width. Even though the fourth model in the two diagrams have 12\u00b0 bounce, the leading edge height is a little over 0.1\" difference. While this may not seem that great, it can make a big difference in the playability from a tight lie versus a fluffy lie, with the former being better for tighter lies or firmer terrain.\n\nIn addition, sole radius plays a factor in how the leading edge can be up off of the ground. Let's use the same 0.781\" sole width as above, but increase the radius to 1.5\" (remember the smaller the circle the more radius occurs). Incorporating a greater radius on the sole allows the leading edge to be higher off of the ground. Look at the difference between first two models in the two diagrams as both of these have 0\u00b0 bounce. Where the difference really shows up is when the sole is rotated clockwise, the same as if the head was de-lofted due to a descending angle of attack, the leading edge is not as low to the ground and less likely to dig in. This is one of the reasons why normally you find more bounce on narrower soled clubs as often the sole has more radius than a wider sole model.\n\nA prime example of this (although it does not exist in any head that I am aware of) is if the radius was very small (0.625\" radius) and the width was extremely narrow (0.5\" wide). Even if the club had 30\u00b0 bounce, the leading edge would only be 0.25\" above the ground line! Below is a quick guide to factors and how they affect leading edge height:\n\nMore radius (think of a smaller circle)\n\n=\n\nThe higher the leading edge will be off from the ground\n\nWider sole with the same radius\n\n=\n\nThe higher the leading edge will be off from the ground\n\nGreater degree of bounce\n\n=\n\nThe higher the leading edge will be off from the ground\n\nAscending angle of attack\n\n=\n\nThe higher the leading edge will be off from the ground\n\nLess radius (think of a larger circle)\n\n=\n\nThe lower the leading edge will be off from the ground\n\nNarrower sole with the same radius\n\n=\n\nThe lower the leading edge will be off from the ground\n\nLesser degree of bounce\n\n=\n\nThe lower the leading edge will be off from the ground\n\nDescending angle of attack\n\n=\n\nThe lower the leading edge will be off from the ground\n\nTo better illustrate the effect of sole width and radius on the bounce angle, examine the following chart. The chart represents two different width soles (0.781\" and 1.25\") and three different sole radii (flat, 3\" and 1.5\"). Note: the leading edge has not been ground off in these cases leaving a sharp distinctive point of reference. In addition, these are not necessarily recommendations or fitting examples, rather more for the purpose of explaining their relationships.\n\nThe most common sand wedge bounce is 12\u00b0 on a medium width sole (0.781\"). Looking at the Leading Edge Height from the Ground Line chart, we can see that the distance to the leading edge would be 0.163\". The same leading edge height occurs with the flat sole and the one with the 1.5\" radius. Remember we said before that the club may not end up in the exact same position? Let's say a golfer was to use each of the clubs and had a 5\u00b0 angle of attack. When the club returns to impact, now the leading edge has been lowered by the golfer. The underlined values at the 7\u00b0 bounce (12\u00b0 bounce minus the 5\u00b0 angle of attack) show the new leading edge height. The head with the greater radius has the leading edge height higher than the other two heads with the same sole width (0.096\" vs. 0.110\").\n\nLeading Edge Height from the Ground Line\n\nSole Radius\n\nFlat\n\n3\u2033\n\n1.5\u2033\n\nFlat\n\n3\u2033\n\n1.5\u2033\n\nSole Width\n\n0.781\u2033\n\n0.781\u2033\n\n0.781\u2033\n\n1.25\u2033\n\n1.25\u2033\n\n1.25\u2033\n\nBounce\n\nin.\n\nin.\n\nin.\n\nin.\n\nin.\n\nin.\n\n0\n\n0.000\n\n0.026\n\n0.052\n\n0.000\n\n0.066\n\n0.136\n\n1\n\n0.014\n\n0.033\n\n0.059\n\n0.022\n\n0.077\n\n0.147\n\n2\n\n0.027\n\n0.041\n\n0.066\n\n0.044\n\n0.089\n\n0.159\n\n3\n\n0.041\n\n0.050\n\n0.074\n\n0.065\n\n0.102\n\n0.171\n\n4\n\n0.055\n\n0.060\n\n0.083\n\n0.087\n\n0.116\n\n0.183\n\n5\n\n0.068\n\n0.071\n\n0.091\n\n0.109\n\n0.131\n\n0.196\n\n6\n\n0.082\n\n0.083\n\n0.101\n\n0.131\n\n0.147\n\n0.209\n\n7\n\n0.095\n\n0.096\n\n0.110\n\n0.153\n\n0.164\n\n0.222\n\n8\n\n0.109\n\n0.109\n\n0.120\n\n0.175\n\n0.181\n\n0.236\n\n9\n\n0.123\n\n0.123\n\n0.131\n\n0.196\n\n0.199\n\n0.251\n\n10\n\n0.136\n\n0.136\n\n0.142\n\n0.218\n\n0.219\n\n0.265\n\n11\n\n0.150\n\n0.149\n\n0.153\n\n0.240\n\n0.239\n\n0.280\n\n12\n\n0.164\n\n0.163\n\n0.165\n\n0.262\n\n0.260\n\n0.296\n\n13\n\n0.177\n\n0.176\n\n0.177\n\n0.284\n\n0.281\n\n0.311\n\n14\n\n0.191\n\n0.189\n\n0.189\n\n0.305\n\n0.302\n\n0.328\n\n15\n\n0.204\n\n0.203\n\n0.202\n\n0.327\n\n0.324\n\n0.344\n\n16\n\n0.218\n\n0.216\n\n0.215\n\n0.349\n\n0.345\n\n0.361\n\nYou might have noticed that most wide sole cavity back wedges do not have the same amount of bounce as a narrower blade-style model. To have the same effective bounce, less measured bounce is needed and here is the reason why. Let's say we have a 1.25\" wide sole wedge with a 3\" radius. This will effective make the leading edge 1.81\" above the ground. The same golfer with the 5\u00b0 angle of attack will now return the club at impact with a leading edge height of 0.102\" or the equivalent of the narrower sole clubs with greater bounce.\n\nIn an extreme example of where there is a very wide sole (1.25\") and has a high sole radius (1.5\") the manufacturer may select a bounce for the sand wedge may appear low on paper, for example 4\u00b0. This still leaves the leading edge height 0.183\" above the ground. Even if the golfer returned the club with a 5\u00b0 angle of attack, then effectively it has a negative 1\u00b0 bounce. But due to the high radius sole, the leading edge will still be approximately 0.125\" above the ground.\n\nYou might even see long irons with negative bounce as part of their specifications. Once considered that the head was inaccurately manufactured if the bounce was negative is no longer true. Often times the #1, 2 and even 3-irons are used off of a tee. Thus any time the ball is off the ground, then an upward or ascending angle of attack occurs which will add both loft and bounce to the club at impact. Even if clubs with negative bounce are hit of the ground with a level swing, the modern sole radius will prevent the chance of a \"fat\" shot as the leading edge will be above the ground line.\n\nMost manufacturers do not provide bounce specifications other than for the wedges, perhaps for good reason as it can be quite confusing to the customer. Even if they did, sole radius and sole width specifications will not be included. So it is really up to the manufacturer to understand these relationships when designing a particular model to make it playable.\n\nVery few times you see the exact same head, but in different bounce option from a fitting situation. The only time multiple bounce options are available occurs with only a few name brand manufacturers who will sell enough to make it a worthwhile investment in tooling. The two leaders in the wedge category (Cleveland and Titleist) offer some high bounce and even low bounce options for the different conditions and the golfer's angle of attack. Otherwise it will require a skilled clubmaker to grind the sole or alter the loft to customize the effective bounce.\n\nBy reading this article, hopefully you have gained a better understanding and comprehension of what exactly the bounce angles mean and how the manufacturers derive at their final product. Bounce can be more complicated than this when you factor in any maladjusted lie angle, if the face is opened or closed or if the sole was produced with multiple radii or intricate grinds or bevels on the sole. However, the basics regarding sole width, leading edge height and contact point on the sole still apply.\n\n26 Comments on Understanding Golf Club Bounce Angle\n\n[...] While the definition above may have been true in the past, it is technically not correct anymore.

Maybe too much of a G.W.B. simplification, but it would really help in our decisions re sand wedge purchases.\n\nNice technical article\u2026but I still do not understand \u2013 clearly \u2013 how that translates to club selection and course conditions\u2026..for example, if most courses I play are public\/semi-private\u2026and the fairways are not groomed like Augusta National\u2026what is the best bounce for my wedges?\u2026.what are considerations for the sand trap?\u2026.thanks\u2026\n\nMuch will depend upon what you are currently using. That is what is the sole width, bounce and sole radius of your current sand wedge? The last question you probably cannot answer without having access to a radius gauge. But more importantly what problems are you having like blading the wedge over the green or having the wedge dig into the sand and you end up hitting weak shots out of the bunker? I cannot recommend a SW by bounce alone as a few others specifications also have a cause and effect relationship with bounce and your angle of attack.\n\njust read your article on bounce. The question I have is, \"What effect does the bounce angle have on the balls reaction when when it hits the green?\" Can I assume the higher bounce angle will cause the ball to roll farther when it hits the green and that the lower bounce angle will cause more backspin?\nThank you.\nR. Keating\n\nThe backspin is more of a function on how you \"pinch\" the ball. That is how cleanly you hit the ball, your angle of attack and how much moisture is between the face and the ball. Bounce angle might have some influence on how solidly you might be able to hit the ball.\n\nA cambered sole simply means that the sole is not flat, but radiused \u2013 in most castes front-to-back and heel-to-toe. This allows the sole to conform to different lies and elevations by being less likely to dig and so it glides on the terrain.\n\n[...] recently had a nice long conversation with a professional club fitter regarding the bounce article that I had written a couple years ago that prompted me to write this Blog posting. One of the [...]\n\n4\u00ba is the amount that most manufacturers will discern from mid bounce to low bounce or from mid bounce to high bounce as in this case. If you played from a hardpan lie or an area where the grass was bare or have a shallow angle of attack (sweeper), then I think you would notice a difference in ball flight and solidness of contact.\n\nGreat information and insight for all skill levels of players. This has enlightened me, and motivates me to research even further the cause and effects of attack angles, bounce angles and the overall effect of ball flight when combined. I believe this greatly affects the decision-making process for the many types of shots required to improve my gamemanship. Thanks, Jeff! Good stuff!\n\nI have a Ping G10 sand wedge.I thas a 54 degree loft and n .13 offset and a 12.o bounce and the back edge has been rounded off. Ialso have a aCleveland G10 56 degree wedge that has been rounded off with a swinweight o 12 and a 12.0 counce . Around the greens in the hih apron grass and when I want to flop a shot the cleveland wedge gives better results. I feel it is be cause the sole width isn't as great as the Ping sole width enabling me to get the Cleveland under the ball better than with the Ping which has a greater sole width. What are your thoughts and the same thing is true in dry sand but I can't advance the ball as far with the Cleveland as with the Ping.\n\nA narrower sole will in effect have less effective bounce and make it easier to get under the ball. Regarding distance, that can be a function of the shaft, overall weight and offset aside from the bounce or sole configuration. Plus, don't forget the number engraved on the sole to indicate loft isn't always exact. There is usually a +\/- 1\u00ba tolerance. That 54 degree wedge could be anywhere from 53 to 55 degree and be perfectly normal.\n\nWhat would you suggest for taking fairly accurate measurements for the Negative Bounce on Putter heads? I understand there are devices that can be used for measuring the hosel lie and face loft of putters but how would someone inspect a Negative Bounce angle and get a fairly accurate reading on what it is? if the norm is somewhere around a 2 degree negative bounce how can I be sure any putter is close to this spec?\n\nIt is impossible to tell because I do not know what the sole widths and sole radius are on the two clubs. Not only that, but how you come into contact with the ball (sweeper\/slidee or a digger). All those need to be factored in.\n\nJeff, I plan on buying titleist ap1 712 irons and making the lofts 2 degrees strong. Tis means the 3 and 4 iron will have -1 degree bounce and the 5 and 6 iron will have 0 degree bounce. Do you think the clubs will still be playable or will they dig too much? Hopefully, the leading edge will still be off the ground, if I'm phrasing this correctly.\n\nYou should have no troubles because there will be a front-to-back radius. If the sole was flat, then that would be an issue. Hitting down slightly on the ball will still keep the leading edge from digging."}

If they are not trained then hitting a shot where you want it is purely an accident.\n\nSo, how do you train your hands?\n\nFirst off, do not use a golf club to train with. Instead use a tennis racquet, ping pong paddle, or anything that is racquet-like. The face of the racquet emulates the clubface, but on a much larger scale, so it is easier to monitor.\n\nThere are only three things a clubface can do:1. Layback, 2. Close, 3. Hood.\n\nEach of these motions produce different trajectories, but a straight ball flight.\n\nLayback produces the highest trajectory while closing produces the lowest. Layback can be \"under rolled\" and closing can be \"over rolled\" - the duck hook.\n\nThese motions also have names associated with them and they are called Hinge Actions. Horizontal Hinging is closing and works like a door opening and closing, a full roll feel. Vertical Hinging works like a pendulum, a kind of a \"reverse\" roll feel, and Angled Hinging works like a canoeist paddle, no roll in either direction.\n\nOn their respective planes there is always a no-roll in either direction. But when they are placed on an inclined plane, where we play golf on, they take on the characteristics of that plane.\n\nFor instance, Horizontal Hinging on its associated plane does not open or close but when placed on the inclined plane it is turned to the right and rolled to the left. So any type of curvature starts with either an over roll or under roll of the selected Hinge Action.\n\nNow let's start training the hands. Take your racquet and hold it in your left hand straight out in front of you so that the left arm is horizontal to the ground and that the racquet face is at a right angle to the imaginary target line. Now move your left hand to the right across your chest. Did the racquet face turn or roll? Of course not. That's because it is on it's associated plane. Now move it back toward the target. Did it turn or roll? The answer is still no!\n\nNow hold the racquet and assume your address position. Take your left arm back like you did before until it is a mirror image of what you did on the horizontal plane. This time the left hand and racquet face had to \"turn\" to match up, didn't they? You see, whatever the face angle is on it's associated plane has to match when placed on the inclined plane. So with Horizontal Hinging there is a \"feel\" of turning to the right and rolling to the left. Your job is to not over roll the clubface.\n\nOnce you have gained a mastery of educated hands then the hands do not care what you place in them. It could be a tennis racquet, baseball bat, or golf club. If they are trained they will respond properly."}

{"text":"Golf\n\nGolf is a outdoor game where each player plays his own small ball into a hole using various clubs, or, as defined in the Rules of Golf: \"The Game of Golf consists in playing a ball from the teeing ground into the hole by a stroke or successive strokes in accordance with the Rules.\"\n\nMany holes include hazards, namely bunkers (or sand traps), from which the ball is more difficult to play than from grass, and water hazards (lakes, ponds, rivers, etc). Special rules apply to playing balls that come to rest in a hazard which make it highly undesirable to play a ball into one. For example, a player must not touch the ground in a hazard with a club prior to playing a ball, not even for a practice swing. A ball in a water hazard may be played as it lies or may be replaced by dropping another ball outside the water, but a penalty is incurred in the latter case.\n\nThe grass of the putting green is cut very short so that a ball can roll over distances of several meters, and \"to putt\" indeed means to play a stroke on the green where the ball does not leave the ground. The hole must have a diameter of 4 1\/4 inches (108 mm) and a depth of at least 4 inches (101.6 mm). Its position on the green is not static and may be changed from day to day. This hole on the green has a flag on a pole positioned in it so that it may be seen from some distance (but not necessarily from the tee). It is also termed \"the pin\".\n\nThe borders of a course are marked as such, and beyond them is out of bounds, that is, ground from which a ball must not be played. Special rules apply to certain man-made things on the course (obstructions) and to ground in abnormal condition.\n\nEvery hole is classified by its par. The par of a hole is defined by the distance from tee to green. Typical values for a par three hole range from 130 to 230 yards (120-210 m), a par four hole from 300 to 475 yards (275-435 m), and a par five hole from 450 to 600 yards (410-550 m). Par is also the theoretical number of strokes that an expert golfer should require for playing the ball into any given hole. The expert golfer is expected to reach the green in two strokes under par (in regulation) and then use two putts to get the ball into the hole. Many 18-hole courses have approximately four par-three, ten par-four, and four par-five holes. The total par of an 18-hole course is usually around 72.\n\nAt most golf courses there are additional facilities that are not part of the course itself. Often there is a practice range, usually with practice greens, bunkers, and a driving area (where long shots can be practiced). There may even be a practice course (which is often easier to play or shorter than other golf courses). A golf school is often associated to a course or club.\n\nVarious clubs are designed with the face having differing loft (the angle between a vertical plane and the clubface when the club is at rest). Perhaps with the exception of tee shots, it is loft that makes a golf ball leave the ground, not an upward direction of swing: for shots with a particularly high trajectory such as pitches, the club actually hits the ball in a downward motion, and with most other shots the motion is more or less horizontal. Typically, the greater the loft, the higher and shorter the resulting shot.\n\nWhile it is possible to play a range of different shots using only one club, modifying only the speed and direction of swing, this is not a particularly successful technique. Far easier is it to keep the swing as constant as possible and achieve different lengths and characteristics of ball flight using a different club for each shot. To facilitate the choice of a club for any particular situation, all irons (and many woods and wedges) come in sets of similar clubs graded by loft, shaft lenght and weight. Clubs are numbered for identification with the smallest numbers indicating the lowest loft.\n\nA typical set of clubs may consist of irons 3 to 9, three wedges, woods 1, 3, and 5, and a putter.\n\nWoods are long clubs (shaft length about 40-45 inches or 100-115 cm) for long shots. The have large heads that are somewhat spherical in shape with a slightly bulging clubface Iron heads are typically solid with a flat clubface. The typical lofts for irons range from 16 to 60 degrees. \"Long\" and intermediate irons (i.e. those with a lower loft) are usually played from fairway or other easy ground. \"Short\" irons (with a higher loft) are played from difficult ground and especially for approach shots to the green.\n\nWedges are irons with lofts of more than approximately 50 degrees. Pitching wedges are rather similar to other irons but have a higher loft than those. Some wedges have specially designed undersides that make them suitable for shots from bunkers (sand wedges) or from the rough. Lob wedges have a very high loft and are used for approach shots or from sand.\n\nPutters come in a variety of head shapes; they have a very low loft and often a short shaft. They are used to roll the ball on the green to get the ball into the hole.\n\nTraditionally, most metal golf club heads were made by forging, which involves the careful shaping of the club head through hammering and pressing of heated steel. Today, most modern golf club heads are cast. Forged clubs are still prized for feel while cast clubs often have modern game improvement characterists.\n\nWooden balls were used until the early 17th century, when the featherie ball was invented. A featherie is a handsewn cowhide bag stuffed with goose feathers and coated with paint. Because of its superior flight characteristics, the featherie remained the standard ball for more than two centuries. In 1848, Rev. Dr. Robert Adams invented the gutta percha ball (or guttie). Because gutties were cheaper to produce and could be manufactured with textured surface to improve their aerodynamic qualities, they replaced feather balls completely within a few years. In the twentieth century, multi-layer balls were developed, first as wound balls consisting of a solid or liquid-filled core wound with a layer of rubber thread and a thin outher shell. This design allowed manufacturers to fine-tune the length, spin and \"feel\" characteristics of balls. Today's golf balls are usually of a two- or three-layer design, consisting of various synthetic materials and available in a great variety of playing characteristics to suit the needs of golfers of different proficiency.\n\nAn appendix to the \"Rules of Golf\" defines that a golf ball must not weigh less than 45.93 grams, that its diameter must not be less than 42.67 millimetres, and that its shape may not differ significantly from a symmetric sphere. Like clubs, golf balls are subject to testing and approval by the R&A, and those that do not conform with the regulations may not be used in competitions.\n\nSometimes transportation is by special golf carts. Clubs and other equipment are carried in golf bags. Golfers wear special shoes with exchangeable spikes (or little plastic claws termed soft spikes) attached to the soles. Tees are often made of wood or plastic and resemble nails with a flattened head. A tee is pushed into the ground to rest a ball on top of it for an easier shot; however this is only allowed for the first stroke (tee shot or drive) of each hole.\n\nThe underlying principle of the rules is fairness. As declared on the back cover of the official rule book: \"play the ball as it lies\", \"play the course as you find it\", and \"if you can't do either, do what is fair\". Some essential rules state that\n\nevery player is entitled and obliged to play the ball from from the position where it has come to rest after a stroke, unless a rule allows or demands otherwise (Rule 13-1)\n\na player must not accept assistance in making a stroke (Rule 14-2)\n\nthe condition of the ground or other parts of the course may not be altered to gain an advantage, except in some cases defined in the rules\n\nThe Decisions on the Rules of Golf are based on formal case decisions by the R&A and USGA and are published regularly.\n\nThe etiquette of golf, although not formally equivalent to the rules, are included in the publications on golf rules and are considered binding for every player. They cover matters such as safety, fairness, easiness and pace of play, and players' obligation to contribute to the care of the course.\n\nThe regulations regarding the amateur status of golfers [1] are very strict. Essentially, everybody who has ever taught or played golf for money (or even accepted a trophy of more than a modest monetary value) is not considered an amateur and must not participate in amateur competitions Also in the 1930s the wooden golf tee was invented. In the 1970s the use of metal to replace wood heads began, and shafts made of graphite composite materials were introduced in the 1980s.\n\nIn the United States, golf is the unofficial sport of the business world. It's often said, in fact, that board meetings merely confirm decisions that are actually made on the golf course. For this reason, the successful conduction of business golf (which extends beyond merely knowing the game) is considered a useful business skill; many business schools include a \"business golf\" course.\n\nMost business golfers either cheat at golf, if they are poor golfers, or play under their ability, if they are good, since it is considered most advantageous to lose to one's superior, but within fewer than 6 strokes.\n\nGolf is not inherently an expensive activity; the cost of an average round of golf is $3636 [1] and the game is regularly enjoyed by over 26 million Americans. Most regions of the country feature public courses which strive to be affordable for the average golfer.\n\nGolf's status as the American \"business sport\" is probably connected to the expense of playing the game on a private course. These courses are usually open only to lifetime members and their guests, and private course memberships can cost as much as $300300,000.\n\nThe purpose of the high membership cost is not, primarily, the maintenance of the course. Rather, many private golf courses set high membership fees to exclude \"undesirables\" from being able to play on the course. This exclusion also allows corporate dialogue to be concealed from the public.\n\nThe Masters has been played at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, GA since its inception in 1934. The U.S. Open and PGA Championship are played at various courses around the United States, while the British Open is played in the U.K.\n\nWinning a major is the crowning career achievement for many professional golfers. Most will never accomplish this very difficult feat. Jack Nicklaus, who is widely regarded as the best golfer of all time, has won 18 majors.

{"text":"Mental Putting Tips \u2013 Accessing Your Potential\n\nThe putter is the most important club in your bag. It's the club that you use more often than any other club. A hot putter is what makes a champion. The physical aspects of putting look simple, but every player knows that putting is more than just a physical task. The mechanics of putting must work in combination with a player's visual skills, powers of imagination, and level of confidence. The mental art of putting is the true challenge in putting. Putting, more than the long game, is a test of a player's emotional stability and patience.\n\nThe human factor is what makes putting so challenging. Our emotions, feelings, and thoughts are what brings a new dimension to a simple physical task. Just a bit of tension or fear can throw off the best of strokes. A flicker of doubt can cause a golfer to be tentative or steer the stroke. Trying too hard to make a putt can cause a player to tense up and leave a putt three feet short of the hole. And when not putting well, players search for \"the secret\" to making putts. These players switch to a new putter, change their technique, or alter their putting routine.\n\nWhat they don't understand is that the secret to making putts is inside them. You have to start with the belief that you have putting potential. This is the first step in using your mind to putt your best. Using your mind to putt your best also includes believing in your putting skills, using your imagination, focusing on execution, and having a positive attitude about putting.\n\nThe following are six of the most important keys to using your mind to putt your best:\n\nA Positive Attitude and Approach. Good putters love to putt. They don't fear this aspect of the game. You can't putt well if you go into a round wondering if you are going to putt poorly today. Take a positive approach and challenge yourself to putt well today.\n\nHigh Putting Confidence. Confidence means believing in your skills, and in putting you must have conviction that you can make putts. Confidence comes from practice, making putts on the course, developing your touch, and believing in your ability. Confidence is a mindset that says \"I can do this.\"\n\nStrong Sense of Touch. One of the most important skills to have is the ability to control your speed. Most three-putts are caused by poor distance control. Your touch also influences the line you select. The line you select depends on \"pace.\" When you select a line for a breaking putt, you must dial in the right speed or the putt won't hold its line. So touch is important for both distance control and hitting your lines.\n\nAn Execution Focus. The goal is to make putts. All golfers know this, but you can't focus on making or missing. You have to focus on the ingredients of the task that will help you make putts such as reading the green, selecting a line, aiming to a target, and allowing your instincts to take over. If you do these well, you have a good chance of making putts.\n\nStrong Imagination and Good Vision. Putting is a visual task that requires strong imagination. You must be able to read greens and also \"see\" or \"feel\" your line. Your imagination allows you to predict the line of your putt, given a certain pace, that your ball must travel on to go in the hole. The better you can see the breaks and \"see\" the line, the more putts you will make.\n\nThe Ability to Trust Your Stroke. Once you have a consistent stroke, putting becomes a visual and mental task. You practice \"stroke\" so you can focus on your line and speed when you play on the course. If you become too \"stroke bound\" on the course, you will most likely steer your putts and not be able to focus on speed or line. Let your instincts take over when it comes to your stroke and focus on hitting your line with the right pace.\n\nEverybody has had a great putting round or a stretch of holes in which they putted well. Think back to when you had a great putting round. What was your attitude like that day? What was your focus like? Were you allowing your instincts to take over? What thoughts and feelings helped you to putt your best? Most likely, this is the mindset you need to putt your best. The secret to great putting is within you. Now you have to tap into it and access your putting genius."}

In addition, you must remain patient and work on shot accuracy to make your shots go where you want them to. In the following paragraphs, you'll find suggestions on how you can become a better golfer. callaway irons A long putt requires you to focus on the speed at which you will be hitting the ball. Don't aim for the hole, instead aim for a point between yourself and your goal which lies on the way to the hole. That way, you are less likely to either overshoot or undershoot, and your second putt is more likely to be a manageable one. cheapest golf clubs Therefore, you should stretch prior to every round and make sure to drink sufficient amounts of water. As with any sport, better physical conditioning can lead to better performance. callaway driver Go for maximum opportunity with your drives using the exact same tee height. Teeing too low could result in grounders, but teeing too high could result in you popping the ball upwards, losing valuable distance. If you do some driving practice on the range and optimize the height of your tees, you can hit each ball knowing that it will fly far.Make sure you know exactly how to keep accurate score when you're playing golf. When you know how to keep score you aren't judged as a bad player, it is something that shouldn't be overlooked. When keeping score, every time you attempt to hit the ball is counted as a stroke. Your score at each hole is calculated as the number of strokes it takes for you to get your ball to the hole. The basic idea is that you want as few strokes as possible for each hole.Before you pay for a previously-owned club, check out the head. Golf clubs with a large amount of wear from heavy use will show a shiny spot where the ball has come in contact with the club. This isn't going to help your game because the club will slap your ball, rather than hit it.If your club isn't guiding you when you swing, go for a lighter grip. You should be able to focus on the weight of club head to focus on the mechanical aspect of the move.If you are staring down a really long putt, then you should concentrate your focus on what speed you hit your ball with. Instead of aiming for the hole, read the putt and aim for an intermediate target. This will give you the best chance of success for your putt. Golf is an amazingly popular hobby around the world, topping the list of the most widely enjoyed sports. Because golf can be such a challenge to master, you'll need to put in as much effort and dedication as you can to become an exceptional golfer.

{"text":"Golf Tips For Irons\n\nAre you looking for tips to play better golf with your irons? Being that your golf irons are your dominant clubs in your bag. I would assume the answer is yes.\n\nYour irons are used more than any club that you have. It would be obvious that you would want to start hitting better shots with them.\n\nBut first we must identify each type of iron that you have. These category of irons are the long irons, middle irons and the short irons. Each one has a different job that they carry out.\n\nMost golfers have trouble hitting their long irons the most. This could be because you are standing further away from the ball (like with your driver). Hence, your short irons are usually the easiest because you are much closer.\n\nMastering your iron play can be very difficult. It going to take some practice to get your ball the desired height and distance that you want with consistency.\n\nTo make this happen, you are going to need some good golf tips for irons.\n\nStart With A 7-Iron\n\nIf you are a beginner golf and just starting out, you should start off practicing with your 7-iron. The reason I suggest these is because it is the club in the middle. It is of average length and it is much easier to control than your, \"let's say\", your 4-iron. Its swing plane is just about in the middle and has the right amount of loft. It will get the ball in the air with some good distance.\n\nYou should be able to identify the problems in your swing easier. Such as, hooking or slicing.\n\nHit Down On It\n\nYou will need to learn how to hit down on the ball. This is commonly known as \"trapping\" the ball. It may seem crazy to want to hit down on the ball when the idea is to get it up.\n\nWhen first looking at a lofted club you may be thinking that you need to get the club under the ball to get it in the air. However, your irons where designed to hit the ball on the downswing.\n\nWhat happens when hitting down is the clubface will contact the ball just before getting to the bottom of your swing arc. Because of that, the golf ball gets \"trapped\" in between the face of the club and the surface. This is when the ball compresses. Instead of hitting the ball into the ground, the ball will \"spin\" off the clubface (backspin) and ascend straight into the air. How high the ball gets into the air will depend on the loft on the club.\n\nGive this a shot to see how it turns out. You should notice a different.\n\nPosture For Iron Shots\n\nMany people assume that you should have to adjust your posture with different irons. However, your posture does not need to change. It is how far you stand from the ball with the varying lengths of the irons.\n\nWhat remains the same constant with either my long, middle and short irons is my spine angle and leg flex. What will change with each one of your irons is the ball position. For short irons, you will play the ball in the middle of your stance. For middle irons, one ball width closer to your lead foot. For long irons, you should be about two balls widths closer to your lead foot.\n\nStay On Plane\n\nAnother key ingredient for improving your iron play is to stay on the correct swing plane. Your short irons will have a steeper plane than your long irons.

{"text":"In episode 8 Barry Rhodes author of 999 Questions On The Rules of Golf tells us how the Royal & Ancient in St. Andrews became responsible for administering the Rules of Golf.\n\nHe explains how in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries there were many different rules, as each Club developed had their own versions. This obviously led to difficulties and in 1897, by common agreement of the existing clubs, most of who were in Britain, the Royal & Ancient Golf Club (R&A) were asked to take control of the Rules. The first international set of Rules was then published in 1899.\n\nThe United States Golf Association (USGA) also adopted the R&A Rules and published them for American golfers in 1900. However the two golfing bodies then went their separate ways for the next 50 years.\n\nAs Barry states in the video, itt is important to stress that there aren't two sets of Rules.\n\nIn 1952 the R&A and USGA agreed to co-operate to produce a unified set of Rules for worldwide use and this is the situation today. The two bodies meet regularly and agree on any changes to the Rules, which occur every four years, and any new or changed Decisions on the Rules, which are published every two years.\n\nThere's just one difference between the two and to the majority of us it's of little relevance. There is no limit to the value of prize that an amateur player may receive for a hole-in-one in the USA or Mexico, which are governed by the USGA, but for the rest of the world the R&A limits the value of prize that a player may receive for a hole-in-one to just \u00a3500.\n\nLike many golfers I often ask myself why are there so many Rules and Decisions. On this occassion Barry reminded me that there are more than 60 million people playing golf, in almost every country in the world, in all sorts of climates and playing conditions. So the Rules have to cover everything that could possibly happen to the player and his ball on the course.\n\nAs we know it's an impossible task for most players to learn all of the Rules. In fact Barry has spent more than ten years getting to grips with the Rules and Decisions on the Rules and still learning.\n\nHowever, I'm sure that if you have watched or played any game regularly, such as soccer, pool, trivial pursuits or even poker, you'll have witnessed arguments as to whether a particular play is valid, or not. Sooner or later players have to check, or establish, rules so that they can compete fairly against each other on a level playing field. There's only one game of golf, with a universal set of Rules, and if that's the game that you want to play then you have to respect and abide by all of them, so as to preserve the integrity of this wonderful game.\n\nIn conclusion I asked Barry how would recommend players get a better understanding of the Rules?\n\n\"Well, the easy answer to that question would be to recommend that every golfer should carry a book of Rules in their pocket, which they regularly take out, read and digest. But I know that's not going to happen. Most players learn from the situations that they experience on the course. Every time something new crops up they discuss it afterwards in the bar, or the Pro Shop, until they are satisfied that they know the right answer. To assist golfers everywhere I've taken this to the next step and written a book containing 999 questions on the Rules of Golf with answers, references to the Rule, or Decision, number and explanations, where required. I've covered the myriad situations that can occur on the golf course and have included an index so that golfers can easily find the relevant Q&As for the situation that they are interested in.\"\n\nif you Google '999 Questions on the Rules of Golf' you'll find that most online booksellers will have it in stock.\n\nWhat is the rule if a golfer picks up his ball and drops without informing anyone or indicating his intention either to his partner or fellow competitors if he takes a relief with or without penalty?\n\nSly\n\n04. Aug, 2010\n\nBarry, what is the ruling In this situation: In stroke play Player A chipped within gimme distance and was on approach to mark his ball when his fellow competitor B, who is to make a pitch 40 yards off the green requested A to let B hit first. Out of courtesy, A obliged and B hit his pitch shot which fall short of the hole. Later on it was learned that B's request has something to do with the possibility that A's ball may be used as a backstop.\n\nSteve\n\n06. Jul, 2010\n\nWhen ball if OFF the green is the only options taking the flag out or leaving the flag in? My question is when OFF the green, can I have the flag tended by someone who makes the decision to leave the flag in or take it out based on the ball rolling fast, slow, etc. Can that person tend the flag, pull it or leave it in?\n\nEddie\n\n08. Feb, 2010\n\nBarry in a match play game one player plays a shot into the hole as the other player has played more shots he lifts his ball and concedes the hole the other player goes to the flag and finds his ball jammed against the flag but just lifts the ball out what is the rule?\n\nimants\n\n30. Jan, 2010\n\nMany thanks for this informative page of rules.\n\nSue\n\n29. Jan, 2010\n\nRegarding GPS systems on golf buggies, many clubs are now allowing these in competitions but I cannot see where this has been sanctioned by the rules of golf. Can you advise, thanks\n\nBarry's Reply:\n\nSue,\n\nThe Note to Rule 14-3, Artificial Devices, Unusual Equipment and Unusual Use of Equipment, states, \"The Committee may make a Local Rule allowing players to use devices that measure or gauge distance only.\"\n\nSo, GPS devices may only be used in competition if there is a Local Rule permitting their use. It is important to check this before the competition starts as the penalty for a breach of Rule 14-3 is disqualification.\n\nRegards,\n\nBarry\n\nTom\n\n18. Nov, 2009\n\nBarry,\n\nAnother continuously, very windy day, very firm green at Royal Adelaide. The ball refuses to stop wobbling and threatens to move (as much as a ball can refuse or threaten!). Should one then (1) wait until the wind drops possibly invoking slow play, 2) press the ball into the green on replacement \u2013 causing a change to the playing surface \u2013 2stroke penalty or 3) not ground the club before playing a shot and risk hitting a moving ball\n\nBill\n\n16. Aug, 2009\n\nRules question. It is a very windy day, my ball is on the green, I put a marker down to mark the position of my ball but leave my ball on the green whilest someone else putts, the wind blows strongly and my ball rolls a couple of yards away from the hole. Is my ball deemed to have been marked and just replace it at the marker or have to play it as it lies.\n\nThanks\n\nBill\n\nBarry's Reply:\n\nThis is a question that even Tournament Pros get wrong most of the time. Decision 20-4\/1; \"Q. A player replaces his ball on the putting green but does not remove his ball-marker. Subsequently the wind moves his ball to a new position.\n\nWhat is the ruling?\n\nA. Under Rule 20-4, a ball is in play when it is replaced, whether or not the object used to mark its position has been removed.\nConsequently the ball must be played from the new position ? see Decision 18-1\/12.\"\n\nNajib\n\n10. Aug, 2009\n\nIf a hit from the tee hits a golf bag that caddies are holding or resting at some distance, what is the penalty and on which player, the one who hits or the one whose bag it is! please advise.\n\nBarry's Reply:\n\nNajib,\n\nIt depends whether it is stroke play or match play and whose bag the player hits. Here is a summary; 1. In stroke play player's ball hits his own bag, one stroke penalty (Rule 19-2) and play the ball as it lies.\n2. In stroke play player's ball hits his fellow competitor's bag, no penalty (Rule 19-4) and play the ball as it lies.\n3. In match play player's ball hits his own bag, one stroke penalty (Rule 19-2) and play the ball as it lies.\n4. In match play player's ball hits his opponent's ball, no penalty but he may choose to cancel the stroke and play a ball as nearly as possible at the spot from which the original ball was last played (Rule 19-3), or play the ball as it lies.\n\nNote that the penalty for 1. and 3. was two strokes until a change in the Rules at 1st January 2008.\n\nRegards,\n\nBarry Rhodes\n\nJim\n\n23. Jun, 2009\n\nWhen hitting the ball from off the putting surface a player has the option of asking a playing partner to leave their ball in position so as to act as a 'backstop'.\n\nCan the partner, in leaving their ball in position, mark the ball and thereby be able to replace their ball exactly should it be struck?\n\nJim,\n\nBarry's Reply:\n\nWhilst you are correct in saying that the player has the option of asking a player partner to leave their ball in position so as to act as a 'backstop', the opponents also have the option of asking for the ball to be lifted, Decision 30-3f\/11; \"Q. A and B are playing C and D in a four-ball match. B's ball is near the hole in a position to serve as a backstop for A's ball. C requests B to lift his ball. B does not comply and A putts. What is the ruling?\n\nA. B is disqualified for the hole for failing to comply with Rule 22-1. If A's ball strikes B's ball, A would also be disqualified from the hole since B's infringement assisted A ? Rule 30-3f. If the balls do not collide, A is not penalized.\"\n\nAlthough it is not specifically covered in the Rules or Decisions, my opinion is therefore that the partner could legitimately leave his ball marker by his ball but that the opponents could ask for it to be lifted if they thought that it could assist the person making the stroke.\n\nRegards,\n\nBarry\n\nNajib\n\n22. Jun, 2009\n\nIs it legal for Golf Clubs as members of National Golf Federation to amend R&A Rules and enforce some of their local rules! Pls advise!\n\nBarry's Reply:\n\nNajib,\n\nThe answer to your question lies in Rule 33-8 Local Rules; \"a. Policy The Committee may establish Local Rules for local abnormal conditions if they are consistent with the policy set forth in Appendix I.\nb. Waiving or Modifying a Rule\nA Rule of Golf must not be waived by a Local Rule. However, if a Committee considers that local abnormal conditions interfere with the proper playing of the game to the extent that it is necessary to make a Local Rule that modifies the Rules of Golf, the Local Rule must be authorized by the USGA.\"\n\nIf you are worried about a particular Local Rule that your Committee has implemented I would be pleased to give you my opinion as to whether it is permitted by the Rules of Golf.\n\nRegards,\n\nBarry\n\nLorinda\n\n21. Jun, 2009\n\nCould you please advise on whether a golfer is allowed to use the back of his club face. For example a right handed golfer using the right side of hisputter to execute a left handed putt.\n\nThank you.\n\nRegards\n\nLorinda\n\nBarry's Reply:\n\nLorinda,\n\nYes, Rule 14-1 states;\n\"The ball must be fairly struck at with the head of the club and must not be pushed, scraped or spooned,\" so it does not matter which side of the club is used.\n\nInterestingly, Appendix ll, 5, to the Rules states; \"The clubhead must have only one striking face, except that a putter may have two such faces if their characteristics are the same, and they are opposite each other.\"\n\nRegards,\n\nBarry Rhodes\n\nKelvin Meyler\n\n20. Jun, 2009\n\nWhat's an hole in one, never had one of those.\n\nSteve maybury\n\n17. Jun, 2009\n\nOn our 18th hole there is a bridge over a creek. If your shot comes to rest behind the bridge within a few feet, there is no way to play a shot at the green. Do you get relief and if the ball is in the rough, where do you take relief?\n\nBarry's Reply:\n\nSteve,\n\nThe bridge is an immovable obstruction. You only get relief from an immovable obstruction (a) if your ball is not within the margin of a water hazard, and b) the immovable obstruction (bridge) has not been declared as integral to the course in the Local Rules, and c) when the ball lies in or on the obstruction, or if the obstruction interferes with a player's stance or the area of his intended swing. You do not get relief just because the bridge is on your line of play to the green. See Rule 24-2.\n\nRegards,\n\nBarry\n\nSteve's Reply:\n\nOk, so if the bridge interferes with my swing within the within the water hazard and it is on the bank I would get relief and drop it within the hazard. How far can I move it?\n\nBarry's Reply:\n\nNo! If your ball is within the margins of a water hazard you do not get any relief, see a) in my answer below. The relevant words in Rule 24-2 are in Note 1, which reads; \"If a ball is in a water hazard (including a lateral water hazard), the player may not take relief from interference by an immovable obstruction. The player must play the ball as it lies or proceed under Rule 26-1.\"\n\nIf your ball lies outside the margin of the water hazard, but an immovable obstruction located within the water hazard interferes with your stance or area of intended swing, then you find the NEAREST point of relief, not nearer the hole, that avoids the interference and drop the ball within one clublength of that point, not nearer the hole. In these circumstances you may not drop the ball in the hazard and you must re-drop the ball if it rolls and comes to rest in the hazard.\n\nRegards,\n\nBarry\n\nSteve\n\n17. Jun, 2009\n\nI hit a ball into the trap and it landed on the Rake head. the rake was laying half into the bunker and the head of it is laying in the middle of a 3 foot straight drop in soft sand. My playing buddies told me I had to replace the ball in the same spot in the bunker. BUT, the only way I could do that, was to; IMBED the ball into the sand (otherwise it rolls to the bottom of the bunker.\n\nMy question is, of course, is that the rule? Do I have to IMBED the ball into the same place in the bunker?\n\nSteve\n\nBarry's Reply:\n\nSteve,\n\nNo, you are not permitted by the Rules to press the ball into the sand. Your question is dealt with in Decision 20-3d\/2;\n\n\"Q. A ball came to rest against a movable obstruction, a rake, in a bunker. When the rake was moved the ball rolled nearer the hole.\nAccording to Rule 24-1, the ball had to be replaced. Due to the slope and the fact that the sand was firm, the ball, when replaced, rolled closer to the hole.\n\nUnder Rule 20-3d, if a ball will not come to rest on the spot where it originally lay, it must be placed at the nearest spot not nearer the hole where it can be placed at rest. The spot where the ball originally lay was farther from the hole than any other part of the bunker. Thus, there was nowhere to place the ball at rest in the bunker that was not nearer the hole.\n\nWhat is the proper procedure if:\n\n1. The only way the ball would remain at rest at the spot where it lay would be to press it lightly into the sand?\n\n2. The sand is so hard that it is impossible to replace the ball?\n\nA. There is nothing in the Rules permitting a player to press his ball lightly into the sand or ground to make it remain at rest.\nAccordingly, in either case, since the player could not place the ball in conformity with the Rules, he should proceed under the stroke-and-distance option of the unplayable ball Rule (Rule 28a) or, in equity (Rule 1-4), drop the ball, under penalty of one stroke, outside the bunker, keeping the point where the ball lay directly between the hole and the spot on which the ball is dropped.\n\nThe same principle would apply if a player is proceeding under any Rule and the ball will not come to rest in the bunker at a spot not nearer to the hole than the appropriate reference point.\"\n\nRegards,\n\nBarry\n\nClifton Barnhart\n\n17. Jun, 2009\n\nIs there a general understanding about whether it is appropriate for a player to remain silent as he watches his opponent set up to break a rule? It's been my experience that the gentlemanly thing to do is to bring up the issue before a shot is executed when possible, giving time for discussion and modification before things are irreversible. Of course, doing this may lessen one's chance of winning a match on a rule technicality. Most of us would prefer to win through superior play, not superior knowledge of a rule. What are your thoughts?\n\nBarry's Reply:\n\nClifton,\n\nIt is perfectly right and proper to stop someone breaching a Rule of Golf. Referees are encouraged to do so. The definition of Advice specifically points out; \"Information on the Rules, distance or matters of public information, such as the position of hazards or the flagstick on the putting green, is not advice.\"\n\nHowever, in stroke play, you are not permitted to ignore a breach of the Rules by any competitor once it has happened. As soon as you observe a Rule being breached you have to bring it to the player's, and their marker's, attention, otherwise you may be deemed to have breached Rule 1-3 \u2013 Agreement to Waive Rules. It is different in match play where you may choose not to call a penalty on your opponent(s), as in this format of golf no-one other that the two sides of the match are affected.\n\nYour final point could be the subject of a lengthy discussion. Should I suffer because I have a good knowledge of the Rules and may therefore call more penalties on myself than someone who does not? We are all obliged to know the Rules (Rule 6-1) and the way that most players learn them is when something happens on the course that affects them directly, so players can indirectly benefit when we call their penalties. If we choose to ignore breaches of Rules in match play then will we remember that we may not do so in stroke play, when we are obliged to protect the interests of every other competitor?\n\nThere are always two sides!\n\nRegards,\n\nBarry\n\nRichard\n\n17. Jun, 2009\n\nHi Andy i have question for you on the rules of golf . I was playing in a golf competition the player i was facing was using a standard putter .\n\nWhen it came to make the putt his hands where right off the putter grip and about half way down the shaft is this legal .\n\nI am lead to believe that this is illegal am I wright or am I wrong. And yes he did go on to win the competition gutted .\n\nBarry's Reply:\n\nDickie,\n\nYes, this is permitted. There is nothing in the Rules of Golf restricting how a player may hold his clubs when making a stroke.\n\nThanks for sharing again, Andy. Most useful and I agree that the best way to remember a rule is to have it happened to me. It's etched in the mind forever. Interpreting rules often causes debate or argument because just as there are five different fingers on one hand, there can be many, many more differing interpretations by individuals to what is written in the rule book on any of the rules.\n\nNajib\n\n17. Jun, 2009\n\nBarry\/Andy:\n\nThnx for a gr8 video, deeply interesting. I knew the rules but unfortunately how little. Different countries different people but same enjoyable golf. I like to hypothesize that golf should govern inter-regional and inter-country conflicts. My son says that Pakistan and India should turn Kashmir into a battery of golf courses and settle their holes-in-ones and garrison bunker outs. The landscape is sheer beauty. I am writing from Pakistan where every rule is flouted with impunity and rewarded, hehe, but where golfers probably do wee bit better courtesy R&A\/USGA.\n\nPlease give me a DVD option to download as I also like to pay by VISA or MC. Although I would love to get a signed copy for my library but my environmentalist disclaimer not to print and save paper becomes difficult to reconcile with! How about electronic signature?\n\nAndy: \"be nice to be nice\"!\n\nregards, najib\n\nThomas Wight\n\n17. Jun, 2009\n\nIs there is an official rule, or gentlemen's understanding, when you have been given a putt, which is within 24 inches of the hole, but you go ahead and putt it and miss it?\n\nCan you putt it for practice? Or if you go ahead and putt and miss it do you have to count it?\n\nAlso is there a difference in the ruling depending if it is medal or matchplay? I am plagued with the yips so bad that my fellow golfers can't stand to see me miss so many little putts. I now use a belly putter, which helps somewhat.\n\nBarry's Reply:\n\nThomas,\n\nThe first and most important point is that putts may not be 'given' in any form of stroke play competition. Rule 3-2 states, \"If a competitor fails to hole out at any hole and does not correct his mistake before he makes a stroke on the next teeing ground or, in the case of the last hole of the round, before he leaves the putting green, he is disqualified.\"\n\nIn match play, putts may be conceded and once the concession has been made it may not be withdrawn. So, if a putt is given and the player still tries to hole out and misses it does not matter as the concession stands. There is no 'gentlemen's agreement' on the length of a putt that may be conceded in match play, it is solely up to each opponent. 'Gimmees' tend to get shorter the closer the match becomes!\n\nRegards,\n\nBarry\n\nMartin\n\n16. Jun, 2009\n\nPreparing to play a pitch and run onto the 9th hole on the Old Course when I notice a few yards ahead of my ball is a dirty big divot mark with the sod lying close by. I pick up the sod and replace it and play my shot to within 2 feet from the hole, my opponent tells me I have improved my lie and that he wins the hole.\n\nI'm shattered and horrified. Was he correct?\n\nThanks\n\nBarry's Reply:\n\nMartin,\n\nYes, your opponent was correct. Rule 13-2 says, \"A player must not improve or allow to be improved: \u2026..his line of play or a reasonable extension of that line beyond the hole\u2026.. by any of the following actions: \u2026..creating or eliminating irregularities of surface, removing or pressing down sand, loose soil, replaced divots or other cut turf placed in position\u2026\".\n\nReplacing a divot on your line of play prior to making your stroke would certainly incur the penalty of loss of hole in match play, or 2 strokes in stroke play.\n\nCheers\n\nBarry\n\nDan Noonan\n\n16. Jun, 2009\n\nHi Andy,\n\nA quick rules question pertaining to the use of these new drivers with the interchangeable shafts, alternate weighting systems and even adjustable face angles. Is there a rules violation associated for changing any of these parameters during a round of golf? Thanks.\n\nDan\n\nBarry's Reply:\n\nDan,\n\nYes, Rule 4-2a states, \"During a stipulated round, the playing characteristics of a club must not be purposely changed by adjustment or by any other means.\"\n\nCheers\n\nBarry\n\nJohn Reeves\n\n16.

{"text":"Article: The Athletic Motion Of The Golf Swing\n\nThe Athletic Motion Of The Golf Swing\n\nThere is really one basic athletic motion which is used in all of athletics. The golf swing is golf's version of this athletic motion. It is the same basic motion that is used to hit a tennis ball, throw a football, kick a soccer ball, or break a rack in pool.\n\nTo describe the athletic motion, let's take a look at the baseball pitcher. Why the pitcher? You are familiar with the pitching motion and have probably thrown a ball or two yourself. The pitcher does what you as a golfer want to do; throw it fast, accurately and consistently. As a golfer you want to hit the ball long distances and down the middle with consistency.\n\nSo just how does the pitcher throw the ball? How do you throw a ball? It's not complicated. Let's take a look so we can apply these principle..."}

{"text":"That soreness in your throat is probably from the golfing world trying to force-feed you gratuitous helpings of US Open champ Rory McIlroy. Or maybe it's strep. What do I look like, a doctor? Anyway, the 22-year-old Northern Irishman gave a lot of credit to his girlfriend, 20-year-old rugby cheerleader Holly Sweeney, for winning his first-ever major earlier this month.\n\n\"Holly and I have been together since I had just turned 16 and she was 14. She knows me better than basically anyone else in this world does, apart from my parents. And to have someone like that with you is very grounding,\" said McIlroy during an interview.\n\n\"She's obviously my girlfriend but she's also become my best friend over the past few years. I can say things to her that I wouldn't be able to say to anyone else.\" McIlroy added.\n\nI spent ten minutes trying to tie Rory's collapse at the Masters into an oral sex joke but I couldn't quite get there (that's what she said), but I'd imagine that a childhood friend makes for a better friend than, oh I don't know, a Swedish nanny with a labradoodle. Good for you, Irish people. But why do your cheerleaders wear shorts? Especially when their neighboring Scotsman wear kilts? Come to America, Rory, so we can build you up as the next Jack Nicklaus and then destroy you when you nail half the women in Jupiter Beach. At least afterward, you get to grow a beard. So there's that.\n\nAs I watched Rory McIlroy treat the U.S. Open like a disobedient orphan over the weekend, I thought two things:\n\n1. Rory McIlroy is extremely great at golf, and 2. He sorta looks like every child star does when they've stopped being cute and turned 20 and nobody wants them anymore.\n\nSo it makes sense that McIlroy would have a child star past, seen here as a bad ass little 9-year old chipping golf balls into a washing machine on \"The Kelly Show\". The host, Gerry Kelly, even one-ups sports blogs by about twelve years with his finishing quote: \"The Americans have Tiger Woods. We have young Rory and, believe you me, this boy can hit a ball.\" And here I was thinking he was the daughter on \"Gilmore Girls\".\n\nCompare and contrast this to Tiger on the Mike Douglas Show at age two, where he was cuter and 1000% more like Webster.

{"text":"Those are three bad examples you listed if you're trying to show distance as being a real negative. All three reviews you listed rated the courses high, which shows they enjoyed playing them. Maybe if someone really rates a course lower because of distance, it's a valid point; otherwise, just like those 3 reviews, it's clearly intended as a compliment.\n\ni can see what Eric is getting at. i've noticed the \"i'm not close enough comments\" but i don't really think it's a big deal. the reader of the review should be smart enough to figure that one out for themselves.\n\nhowever if someone were to actually mark down a course for not being close enough then i would say that's not right.In all three of these examples the reviewers are obviously not being serious. They are making a point that these courses are so good that they are jealous that they don't live closer to the course. They are sarcastically using the \"con\" section to give the course another \"pro\". I don't have a problem with it. Sometimes a course is good enough that it's hard to give it a con so people get creative because they feel obligated to put something in the con section.\n\nAn actual con would be something like \"it's not worth the 30 minute drive from Austin to play this course\" which I think is a valid con.\n\nHow far you live from a course should have no bearing on your review. It would appere that most of the things we are seeing are not actually changing the score given however. If a course is good enough people will drive to play it.\n\nI'm agreeing with most everyone before me. All three of these reviewers were giving the course a back-handed compliment saying they wished the course was closer to their homes. All three gave those courses high scores."}

At this point, you'd think that some other golfer (or, well, many other golfers) would have picked up the pace and actually hit some weights, since part of the advantage of being Tiger is that he's actually very athletic, at least in comparison with the usual collection of bloated sacs that make up a tourney field. You'd also think that, given that The Feline One has made enough money to fund his own Buick Bailout, that some other elite athletes would have taken up the sport, in say, high school and college, and started to bubble their way up from the Q-School.\n\nBut what has happened instead is that Tiger has competed against the same old tired hands of his generation, with no clear rival stepping up to the plate, or young gun making him sweat it out by outdriving him by a couple of clubs, the way he used to do to people when he was just coming up.\n\nWhat are left with is the following.\n\n1) Woods is just that singular and unique a talent, that like Jordan before him, his very presence and competitive intimidation just makes the existence of rivals laughable.\n\n2) Woods hasn't really inspired new people to play golf, so much as to just watch it.\n\nPersonally, I'd go for option 3, which is to say some of both. Besides, even if you are inspired to take up the game to be more like Tiger, you still need clubs and a place to play. But your mileage may vary"}

{"text":"I believe the principles of good sand play are pretty much the same for everyone. If you want to hit the ball higher, there's no arguing that you must either open the club-face or position the ball farther forward in your stance to increase your launch angle. I mean, there's no other sound way to obtain more height on the shot.\n\nThere are other principles that have more to do with strategy and club selection than with physics and swing mechanics. Every amateur (high handicappers especially) should obey the following rules at all times.\n\nFrom fairway bunkers, forget about using any club longer than a 4-iron unless the sand is moist and packed, with the ball perched in a perfect lie.\n\nAnother fairway bunker tip: Take at least one club more than you would from grass at the same distance.\n\nThe longer the shot, the lighter you should hold the club. That increases your ability to generate speed, and speed is necessary on every shot from sand.\n\nIf your lie is even a little dicey, position the ball at least an inch farther back in your stance than you would from a perfect lie. If the lie is bad, play it back even farther.\n\nFrom greenside bunkers, aim for the top of the flagstick - most misses from sand come up short rather than long, so give yourself the benefit of the doubt."}

{"text":"More Golf Lessons\n\nOther\n\nHybrid Golf Lessons For Your Backswing\n\nWelcome to the Full Swing Hybrid Golf Lessons. This is Golf Lesson #4: Set Swing Lesson. This lesson is designed to help you make a good move through the ball. This lesson is a continuation of the Set Swing Backswing Lesson, as it takes you from that position and gets you through impact and to the Set Swing Follow Through.\n\nThis is a great way to develop your swing. Practicing this lesson will help develop your rhythm and timing so that it will be easier to hit solid shots. You will be amazed at how far you can hit the ball once you get the positioning and timing.\n\nTurning your chest properly will effectively shorten your swing but make it more powerful. The tour pros talk about a big chest\/shoulder turn and a short arm swing. This is how they create such controlled power. You don't need a long swing to hit it far...you need an effective swing.\n\nHybrid Golf Lessons Step #1 : Address\n\nPlease see the Full Swing Setup Lesson for Hybrids for more details on a solid address position.\n\nIt is very important that you have a good setup position. You could learn this lesson perfectly, but if your setup is out of position then you won't be able to take advantage of the great swing you have developed.\n\nHybrid Golf Lessons Step #2 : Club Parallel\n\nPlease see the Club Parallel Backswing Lesson for more complete details on how to swing back to this position.\n\nTurn your shoulders and chest to maintain your triangle.\n\nYour club should be parallel to the ground in line with your toes.\n\nThere should be very little change in your weight distribution.\n\nHybrid Golf Lessons Step #3 : Set Swing Backswing\n\nPlease see the Set Swing Backswing Lesson for more details.\n\nMuch like in Step Two...please do not move forward with this lesson until you feel comfortable with this backswing position.\n\nYour left arm should be parallel to the ground.\n\nYour shoulders and chest should be fully turned away from your target.\n\nYour weight should be centered over your golf ball.\n\nHybrid Golf Lessons Step #4 : The Downswing\n\nYour initial move back to your golf ball should be as simple as throwing a ball. Please see Throwing the Ball Lesson for more details.\n\nThe first thing that should happen is that you should shift a little more weight onto your left foot. The Backswing starts from your shoulders and works it's way down to the ground...your Downswing will start from the ground and work it's way up.\n\nThe best way to feel this is to have the sensation of pressing your left foot into the ground. If you were throwing a ball you would be lifting that foot, stepping forward and planting on the ground to have more power. The golf swing is the same...we just don't move the foot. You can think of popping bubble underneath your left foot. Just a little extra pressure on your left foot will get the job done.\n\nAfter pressing your foot into the ground, it is just a matter of unwinding your hips and chest. Make sure you do this all at the same time. You don't want your hips to move without your chest, or either to move without your arms and club.\n\nRemember how the Set Swing was also called the 'L' swing. To create power you want to maintain that 'L' until just before impact. You can see how your 'L' is still intact as you are making your move to the ball. This can only happen if you use your body to make your swing. If you try to swing the club by moving your hands alone...you will automatically lose your 'L' and your power.\n\nHybrid Golf Lessons Step #5 : A Different View\n\nTo keep your club on plane (meaning on line to your ball) you must keep your right elbow close to your body. Much like if you were to skip a stone across the water. As you step into the throw your right elbow tucks in against your side. This is big part of your downswing because it will help maintain your 'L' for power, and keep your club on line for accuracy. If you start your downswing with your arms and hands then your elbow will drift away from your side and you will hit weaker shots that will fade...slice.\n\nMy hands are in front of my chest and the shaft of the club is pointing at the ball.\n\nHybrid Golf Lessons Step #6 : Impact\n\nImpact is the split second during your golf swing in which the club makes contact with the ball. All the movement your body does during your backswing and downswing, are simply trying to setup for a good impact position. If you can deliver your club onto the back of your ball properly...you are going to hit great shots.\n\nThere is a big difference between good contact and proper contact. Good contact will get you around the golf course...proper contact will help you shoot your dream scores. Let's try and work on making proper contact.\n\nTo make proper contact you will want to make sure that the back of your left hand is flat and facing your target. This is critical for making proper contact. It is the only way for your club to hit your ball at the proper angle so that you can use the natural loft of your club. A common fault is having the the left wrist break towards the target. This increases the loft of your club and makes you hit the ball higher and shorter than it should. A great drill is to put a ruler on the back of your left wrist and make parallel to parallel swings. The ruler will help keep your wrist in place.\n\nAfter pressing your left foot into the ground on your downswing your weight should naturally move onto your left foot. This is because at impact your right knee should be flexing and moving towards your ball. This will make your right foot roll onto it's instep. These two things will help drive your weight forward and through your shot.\n\nHybrid Golf Lessons Step #7 : A Different View Of Impact\n\nThis picture is taken from the target side. The key thing to note looking at the impact position from this angle is how open your hips will be to your target. Notice how your hips will almost be facing your target already, even though you are only just at impact. This position helps generate a lot of power as well as proper contact.\n\nHybrid Golf Lessons Step #8 : Parallel Follow Through\n\nThis position should virtually mirror your backswing.\n\nYour club should be parallel to the ground with the toe of your club pointing up to the sky.\n\nThis time your right wrist should be flat, as if you were shaking hands with someone. If your hand is in the position to receive a 'low five' from someone then you are out of position, and you will have unnaturally increased the loft of your club.\n\nAlmost all your weight should be on your left foot. So much so that you should feel the pressure of your weight on the target side edges of your left shoe.\n\nHybrid Golf Lessons Step #9 : Set Swing Finish\n\nThis should be almost a mirror of your backswing. This time your right arm should be straight and parallel to the ground, while your left arm folds and stays close to your body.\n\nAlmost all your weight should be on your left foot and you should be rolling up onto the toes of your right foot.\n\nSince your hips are turning through your shot, your left leg will naturally pull away from your target line and will be almost straight. This is a good thing because it is creating room for your club to swing though your ball. You may have also heard that it is good to 'hit against a firm left side'. Well the straightening of your left leg will help create that firm side which does lead to more power.\n\nThe most over used statement in golf is 'Keep your head down'. I have never said that in a lesson. Yes...you do need to keep your eye on your ball. However, keeping your head down can restrict movement of your follow through. If your head and neck muscles are relaxed then they should rotate naturally with your body. This will give you a much more free flowing motion.\n\nHybrid Golf Lessons Step #10 : A Final Check\n\nMake sure that your hips and chest keep rotating through your swing. If they stop turning you will lose a lot a power and consistency. If you have turned them properly then your belt buckle (or zipper if you are not wearing a belt) will almost be facing your target.\n\nYou can see in this picture how your left leg straightens and pulls back while your right knee flexes and moves toward where you ball was. This is simply opposite of your backswing move. Once again...a mirror image.\n\nThe most important part of the follow through is maintaining your spine angle. This is the angle between your hips and back. It should remain the same as it was at address. If you keep the same angle then you are much more likely to hit solid shots. If that angle changes, especially getting more vertical (commentators often call it coming out of your shot) you will end up hitting a lot of weak shots to the right.\n\nIf you go back to the Throwing the Ball Lesson you will notice that I was throwing the ball underneath a club held about belt high. This was to help get the feeling of staying down through my swing so I could maintain my spine angle. Keep this image in mind and it will help you make solid contact.\n\nThank you for taking the Set Swing Lesson in the Hybrid Golf Lessons Series. This is a great way to practice not only the positions of your swing but your rhythm as well. Making solid contact using a half swing is not easy, but helps teach you to turn everything at the same time to make great consistent contact.\n\nPlease practice this stage of the swing until you can hit many solid shots in a row. There is not point moving onto the Full Backswing Lesson for the Hybrid until you are comfortable with this lesson.\n\nGood luck with your practicing and playing.

{"text":"How Do Cast Irons and Forged Irons Compare?\n\nAnswer: The terms \"cast\" and \"forged\" simply refer to the manufacturing process used to form the shape of the iron head.\n\nCasting always involves turning the metal from which the ironhead is to be made into its molten, liquid state, after which it is poured into a mold to form the ironhead design.\n\nForging involves literally pounding or compressing the metal, in its solid form, from which the ironhead is made into the designed shape of the ironhead, after which a number of other machining and drilling steps are necessary to complete the production of the ironhead.\n\nIf you have a cast iron and a forged iron of exactly the same shape and weight distribution design, the same loft, the same center of gravity position in the two heads, and the heads are built with the same shaft, same length, same grip and same swingweight\/MOI, hitting the same ball, the shots will fly identical distances and 99-percent of all golfers will never know which was forged and which was cast.\n\nMost of the remaining 1-percent want to believe that the forged iron would be softer in feel because the carbon steel of a typical forging is a softer metal, but scientific research has shown that the hardness difference in a metal alone is not enough to create a difference in impact feel. All of the other factors listed above are the reason for differences in the feel of shots hit with one club vs. another."}

As more and more Asian's take up the game, and it is already huge there, Asian travel destinations including Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam will be huge. In addition, India is about 15-20 years behind the boom that China started about 30 years ago, so India will be huge over the next 20-50 years. If you look farther afield toward the latter half of the century, the African continent with its emerging economies and emerging golf markets will be a significant player."}

Commitment is being free from second-guessing, doubt, or hesitation. Composure is being calm and focused, poised and at ease.\n\nThe ideal state of mind for Action is feeling confident, focused, and in the flow, with the body and mind synchronized in the present moment.\n\nThe best Response to results is one that enhances future performance. Accept the outcome of every swing and use each shot as a learning experience.\n\nGolf is a reaction game. We react to misses, and we also react to our address position. Many bad shots are directly related to mistakes made in the setup, especially in putting. A lot of players think putting alignment is just getting their feet parallel to the target line. That's a good start, but it's not enough. Your feet, hips, shoulders, eyes and arms all should be aligned with the target line. The most common mistake players make is squaring their feet but leaving their arms and shoulders open. This causes you to have to hold the putterface open through impact to compensate for pulling across the ball from an open position. At minimum, it's a really inconsistent way to putt. Get your alignment squared away, and a smoother stroke will soon follow. You'll be knocking in more putts from every distance."}
{"text":"By Kiel Christianson\n\nPlayers of all ability levels need to remain cognizant of fundamentals: stance, alignment, grip. If one or more of these is faulty, chances are the resulting shot will be faulty, too.\n\nPosture is one of the cornerstones of the swing. A lot of recreational players hunch over the ball or hang back on their heels or stand stiff-legged. None of these postures will allow you to swing smoothly through the ball.\n\nIn this video tip, Mark Bereza from Annika Academy demonstrates how to get set up with correct posture and balance. Once these are established, you'll have a much better chance at making an athletic, powerful, and smooth swing."}
{"text":"POWER HITTER: Over-the-Hill Pitch\nAfter narrowly missing the green in two, you find yourself with an awkward uphill pitch shot and no view of the flag. You don't want to leave this shot short, but without seeing the flagstick it's hard to gauge the distance accurately. Here's how to leave this short shot close enough to give yourself a reasonable chance at par or birdie.\n\nTILT WITH THE SLOPE: First, walk up to the green to see how much distance and slope there is between you and the flagstick. Will you need to carry the ball to the hole, or will it release some? Next, set up to the ball with your sand wedge and tilt your spine until it's perpendicular to the slope. Then shift most of your weight to your downhill leg. This will encourage you to swing the clubhead up the slope, not down into it. Take a wider stance than normal to help with balance.\n\nDOUBLE YOUR EFFORTS: Swing back twice as far as you would for the same shot from a flat lie\u2014hence, if you have 15 yards to the flag, make your 30-yard swing. This is to account for the steep incline which, when combined with the 56 degrees of loft on your sand wedge, will shoot the ball almost straight up into the air. If the lie is really steep, consider using your pitching wedge.\n\nREACH FOR THE SKY: Maintain your spine tilt as you calmly accelerate the clubhead through impact, swinging with the slope. Your follow-through should be a mirror length of your backswing, which prevents the face from closing and digging into the ground. Maximize loft by keeping the face pointing skyward well into the follow-through."}

{"text":"You've heard it from your father: stand up straight; stop slouching! It's great advice for golfers, too. Good posture allows for balance, the foundation of every good swing.\n\nBy keeping your balance, you can deliver the clubhead to the ball with both speed and accuracy. Without balance, the swing loses tempo and falls apart.\n\n'It's not often that you see a pro hitting a bad shot when they have stayed on balance. After most poor shots, the player finishes off-balance,' says touring professional James Stewart, executive director at the J&J Golf Academy at Discovery Bay Golf Club.\n\n'If you make a conscious effort to stay balanced, you'll be surprised at how many good shots you hit.'\n\nEathorne says most golfers have poor posture - even professionals. 'I am amazed at their skill level - that they can drive the ball so far without pain,' he says. 'Imagine how good they'd be if they spent three to nine months correcting their posture.'\n\nImagine how good a golfer you could be if you worked on your posture, too. Try these movements demonstrated by Stewart.\n\nBent over row\n\nWhat it works: improves postural endurance of the back, butt and hamstrings, and strengthens the shoulder girdle.\n\nMethod: bend slightly at the waist. Ensure chest is up to keep lumbar spine angle aligned. Lift dumbbells towards chest over two counts, squeezing shoulder blades together. Return over two counts to the start position. A set consists of eight to 12 repetitions; do two or three sets with one-minute rest in between.\n\nProne cobra\n\nWhat it works: conditions the postural muscles and re-establishes optimal spinal alignment for all of the golf clubs.\n\nMethod: lie face down. Lift shoulders, turning elbows outwards. Keep chest open. Hold for 30 seconds, then return to start position. Rest for 15 seconds and repeat. A set consists of four to eight repetitions; do one or two sets with one-minute rest.\n\nForward Swiss ball roll\n\nWhat it works: strengthens abdominals, hip flexors and shoulder extensors. Good for stabilising the spine through the full range of club lengths and maintaining spine angle for the duration of the swing.\n\nMethod: kneel on ground with forearms resting on ball. Slowly roll ball forward, keeping abdominals engaged. Return slowly to start position and repeat. A set consists of six to 10 repetitions; do two or three sets with one-minute rest.\n\nHorse stance\n\nWhat it works: trains all key stabiliser muscles in the spine; particularly good for those who experience lower back pain while putting.\n\nMethod: kneel on ground with hands on the floor. Extend right leg out and left arm, keeping them the same height as the hips. Ensure the spine and heel are neutral. Hold for 10 seconds, then return to start position and repeat on opposite side. A set consists of 10 repetitions; do one or two sets with one- minute rest.\n\nRussian twist\n\nWhat it works: strengthens core muscles and lower back stability.\n\nMethod: Lie face up with shoulders on ball and feet on the ground. Keep abdominal muscles engaged. With palms together, point hands upwards. Rotate to the left over two counts, and to the right over two counts. A set consists of 10 to 12 repetitions; do two or three sets with one-minute rest.\n\nKneeling on Swiss ball\n\nWhat it works: conditions balance, dynamic posture and co-ordination; will help improve putting and chipping the most."}

{"text":"Visualize Golf Shots to Banish Mechanical Thoughts\n\nHave you ever been mired in a terrible round of golf, making one lousy swing after another, then hit a great shot out of the blue when faced with a near-impossible situation (up and over a tree, for instance)? You likely threw your hands up in a mixture of surprised joy and disgust, wondering where the heck that swing had been all day.\n\nIt was there all along, of course, just waiting for your creative side to bring it out.\n\nWhen you're trying to extract the ball from a tough spot, your mind must visualize a way around the trouble. You naturally focus on the task at hand, freeing your brain from mechanical swing thoughts (\"finish the backswing,\" \"keep your head down,\" etc.). In other words, you've unwittingly adopted a \"see ball, hit ball\" approach.\n\nSo how do you transfer that mindset to routine tasks like tee shots, chips and putts, when the goal is more obvious and mundane? Again, visualization and creativity are key.\n\nPro golfers always picture the precise shot they want to hit before taking the club back \u2013 the trajectory, shape, roll and finish. This puts a positive image in the mind; the body then makes the motions needed to turn the image into reality.\n\nWhat's more, if you're imagining the ball flying at the target, you can't simultaneously think about the mechanics of your swing. Before you know it, the ball will be sailing away.\n\nAlways visualize shots on the range and around the practice green. Before hitting each ball, picture the flight you want to achieve \u2013 a fade or draw, for example. The same goes for chips and putts; paint a mental image of the ball taking the break and diving into the hole.\n\nIt may seem too simple to really work, but just ask any professional. Visualization will unleash your creative side and suppress those voices chattering technical details."}

{"text":"What Is Meant by Tempo in your Golf Swing\n\nWhen we talk of tempo in the golf swing, we're talking regarding the glue which keeps the swing together. In straightforward language, it is the pace with the swing, and is dictated not with the arms and legs but by the hub of the body. It is going to differ for everybody, because everyone is going to pivot their body at varying speeds, consequently their swing tempo is going to differ. And naturally as you age, this pace that you will pivot the body will lessen.\n\nBut Simple Golf Swing tempo is vital because devoid of it the varied areas of the body which contribute to the swing will not mesh. When the body, legs and arms are not in sync the body is going to struggle against itself, creating not just lesser yardage but also troubles in accuracy.\n\nYour swing will lack smoothness and can look jerky and awkward. So for most people the easy response to this dilemma will likely be to slow down so that every area within the body may work as one, but there will be more to it than just going slower.\n\nAs stated earlier, the hub of the body will be where the rest of the swing starts from, and thus the core dictates swing tempo. And since the core of the body will have the capacity to rotate only so quickly, (that will depend on the person swinging the club), the arms must keep coordinated.\n\nBut since the arms have the capabilty to move with a quicker pace as opposed to the body, when we try to generate additional club speed and hence more yardage, we generally try to do it by swinging our arms with greater speed. This will get everything out of sync, and the result will be regularly a poor shot.\n\nSo permit the body to get you to correct position at the point of golf ball contact, and let the arms take the lead from your body hub. Next, what is the correct arm rhythm, or how fast should the ideal backswing be? It is for the most part agreed the backswing ought to take three times more time getting to the uppermost of the backswing as it does to get from the peak of the backswing to the golf ball at contact.\n\nSo if you're to count to four starting at the instant as you start the club back, at the pinnacle of your backswing you would reach three, subsequently at golf ball contact you will be at four. You certainly wouldn't aim to work on this as you're on the golf course, but it really will be a good exercise to do on the driving range, or simply whenever you're taking a few swings with the club.\n\nAn additional little training drill which may help is to grasp a club using both hands, club shaft parallel to the ground. Turn the body into the backswing position as you count up to three, then bring the body back to the ball contact point, reaching it at the four-count. By doing this you'll feel the appropriate tempo, never too fast or too slow, that is comfortable for you.\n\nLastly all you have to accomplish is bring that proper tempo to the golf course and have it incorporated in your Correct Golf Swing when you are concentrating on other golf course management concerns."}

Even though I know everyone of them is trying to kick mine.\n\nIf my game starts going sour, the last thing I want is advice or help from someone in my group, be it a friend, colleague or stranger. I HATE it when someone gives me advice on the course during a round - most of the time they are not pros and have no idea what they're talking about, and if I use that advice chances are I will be heading up another dead end street. When my game is not up to snuff, I know my swing and my game well enough to turn things around (most of the time) and scramble for a decent score (for me, which means mid 80s).\n\nSo my advice would be, just play your game, you are not kicking their butts, you are kicking the golf course's butt. And they might not want your help to begin with.\n\nI have a similar issue in that I am the best golfer in my group of friends and they always ask me what is going wrong and things like that. I know I am not a professional, however I know alot about golf and some things are very clear what they are doing wrong or could fix. I feel bad telling them they are all messed up, so until they say something I try to pay my own game and not let them affect my play. Not sure what else to tell you. Good luck.\n\nThat's one of my favorite things! I call it the \"fake pro\". It's always the guy who is a 15-20 hcp who give you generic swing fixes. I usually just smile and nod and forget their advice quickly.\nAs for whooping your friends, I was playing in a friendly skins game and it seemed like everyone's game was going south for everyone but me. I just wrote down my scores and collected my winnings. There's not much you can do to help a friend on the course. I just try to keep it classy, not gloat, and complement their good shots.\n\nYou pretty much said it...it's an individual sport. I would say you have to go about your own business and its on them to get their own game together. There is also a mental aspect to golf that sets people apart.\n\nYou sound like a bloated 30 handicapper. Do you have a mirror on the first tee ? If someone is struggling especially your friends and you see a litle swing defect that might help then that is what friends are for. You must golf alone a lot!"}
{"text":"A small peek into the madness of Myong's mind. Only a small peek cuz I don't want to reveal how truly insane and disturbing my mind is.\n\nTuesday, August 26, 2008\n\nEnglish, Dammit!\n\nWow.\n\nThe LPGA has just passed a ruling that any Tour member who's been on the tour for 2 years must pass an English oral evaluation or they will be suspended. This of course is aimed at the ever growing number of foreign golfers on the LPGA tour, especially from Korea. The LPGA currently has 121 members and over a third (45) are Korean.\n\nWhile I agree with the thinking behind the ruling, I find it a bit harsh to suspend a player for something that has nothing to do with the game they're playing. These players are in a foreign land and must learn a new language to adapt but it's not like their job is to negotiate high powered deals. They're here to put a small white ball in a cup. No need for talking.\n\nThe deputy commissioner of the LPGA states \"Athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development....There are more fans, more media and more sponsors. We want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it\". Um...more like you want to help your Tour not lose the few sponsors it has left. Why is that the responsibility of the players? Isn't it the Tour's job to market and promote? I agree that the Korean players are not the most outgoing and social but why blame them for the international flavor of the Tour now?\n\nWhy blame the product and not the system? The international players are clearly taking over the LPGA (not to mention the PGA). Don't you want your product to showcase the best quality of golf out there? You really want to potentially lower the quality of your product because of a language barrier? I wouldn't be surprised if what they really wanted to do would be to limit the number of foreign players on Tour but of course that would get even more negative feedback and calls of racism. But that's what other countries do in their sports leagues. In Korea, the pro basketball league has a maximum of 2 foreign players per team rule. But good luck getting that passed in the US, the land of the overly politically correct.\n\nIf it's more English speaking top players you want, why don't you pump more money into the American girls junior golf system? Because there are very few top American players now. If you've watched golf coverage nowadays, they usually display the flag of the home country of each player on the leaderboard. Good luck finding more than 1 or 2 USA flags on an LPGA leaderboard.\n\nLike I said, I agree with the concept, but disagree with the execution. Even though it seems the Koreans understand and support the rule (and believe me, they do want to learn English...badly), I still find it unnecessary. It just seems like a cowardly way of discouraging more foreign players from joining the Tour. Have you seen the Futures Tour money leaders? All Koreans. So this Korean wave isn't gonna stop anytime soon. But now that they're forcing the English or you're out clause, it may mean a few less players but I think it may decrease the quality of the LPGA.\n\nOf course, as with anything else, it's all about the Benjamins. No one really cares about interviews with winners at the end of tournaments and whether or not they're done in English. It's all about the sponsors. There is quite a large disparity in purse money between the PGA and LPGA. An average winner's purse in the PGA is about $1 million now and in the LPGA it's more like $250,000. And the LPGA is losing tournaments left and right due to lack of attendance and sponsors. There are times when they have tournaments only every other week! So they're dying to fill their schedule with quality tournaments and that comes from sponsorships.\n\nThe sponsor's time to interact with players comes during the Pro-Am round and if they're stuck with a non English speaking golfer, they get no fun out of it and will pull the plug. That's what it comes down to.\n\nSo it's a shame that the situation has come to this. With the ever present Asian contingent on the LPGA, I knew something like this would happen but I never imagined it would happen like this. We'll see how it goes..."}
{"text":"Making bunker shots\n\nWhether you call them bunkers, sand traps, or hazards, they can be a nightmare for beginning players or, sometimes, a strategic place for a savvy pro to aim. With practice, getting out of a bunker can be as simple as a chip shot from the fringe. To understand bunker shots, take a good look at your sand wedge. On the bottom, you'll see a bump that you won't find on the other clubs. This is called the 'bounce.' When you swing at a ball that rests on sand, the bounce will be the first part of the club to touch the ground, allowing the rest of the club head to slide underneath the ball and propel it out of the bunker. Conditions at individual courses will determine which kind of wedge you need. Hard sand requires very little bounce; soft sand needs a lot. If your ball is buried deep in the sand, you need to try a different approach, since it's not possible to slide the club head beneath the ball. Instead, you need to chop down on the sand an inch or two behind the ball, allowing the sand, rather than the club, to send the ball flying. One word of caution: this type of shot won't put any backspin on the ball, so allow for a long roll. Finally, there are a few pieces of bunker etiquette to observe. Always enter a bunker from the low side, so you don't collapse the steep wall that the greenskeeper built. When you leave the bunker, it's polite to erase your footprints. You can use your foot, or many courses keep rakes available for this purpose"}
{"text":"My last few editorials have, perhaps, had a tendency toward a faint hint of snobbishness. I would never have believed myself capable of such a thing had I not seen it with my\nown eyes. But, moving forward here, instead of toning it down I think I'll go ahead and embrace it.\n\nIf you feel, as I sometimes do, that the spirit of the game of golf is being besmirched and befouled, that it is no longer a \"gentleman's game\" or \"the game it was meant to be,\" etc., I have a proposal: Let us introduce judging\ninto the game of professional golf\u2014like in gymnastics or ice skating\u2014so that an Artistic Impression score is combined with a Raw score (the raw score being the number of strokes taken to\ncomplete regulation play) in order to arrive at a final, overall or Total score.\n\nOne of the uninteresting things about how golf is scored is its rawness. There are no style points. So, as the scoring is now, somebody with ugly, jerky, tortured-looking technique can \"win\" simply by getting the\nball in the hole in the fewest strokes. How absurd, how... unrefined.\n\nLet's look at a how it might be otherwise. What if Player A did indeed have the lowest number of total strokes at the end of play, but when combined with a style score Player B, who had more strokes, actually won the event by combining an excellent\nraw score with style and elegance? To me, that sounds like an improvement on the way things are now. Especially given the fact that luck is an undeniable factor in the game. We don't want it to be like rolling dice, do we? I mean, if Player A can\n\"win ugly\" I'd rather not suffer the psychic damage from watching it.\n\nThink about it for a moment: if professional golf were like any of the judged sports (diving, ice skating, gymnastics, etc.) some players who have won professional golf tournaments would never even have qualified for the\nevent in the first place. It would surely be the case that the game's top golfers would still win most of the time based on the combination of both scores; but some players who have won (particularly the most glaringly\nuncouth cases) would not have.\n\nTo take our scenario a bit further, consider for example that Artistic Impression (AI) could influence the total score by 10 points per round (i.e., plus or minus up to 5 strokes). Player A shoots 72, but their AI score is -4 out of a possible best\n-5 for the round, meaning that their total score for the round is 68. Conversely, let's say Player B takes 62 total strokes to complete the round, but their AI score is +5 (the worst possible AI score in our hypothetical example). Player B's total\nscore for the round would be 67. Player B therefore finishes ahead of Player A because Player B's spectacularly low raw score more than makes up for their poor AI score. But for Player B to succeed over time it would require spectacularly low raw\nscores (total strokes) consistently. So winning ugly could still happen, but it would be very difficult and, therefore\u2014one would hope\u2014vanishingly rare.\n\nOf course the precise mechanics of the AI system would have to be worked out, but the essence of the idea is clear: in order to succeed in professional golf you would have to not only \"shoot low,\" but also have some class and display some\ntaste and refinement doing it.\n\nComponents of the AI score might be things like swing aesthetics, demeanor and comportment on the course during the round (obviously, what a player does outside of a golf competition is irrelevant to an AI score), cumulative comportment (a player's\nhistorical demeanor and comportment on the course), observance of etiquette, or other things. And to combat Goody Two-shoes overacting, wheedling and fakery\u2014like folding your hands on top of your desk, affecting an angelic facial expression and\nkeeping your eyes locked forward when the teacher approached in grade school, in order to get a gold star by your name, or some equally meaningless doggy treat... sorry, where was I... oh, right\u2014there would have to be a\ncomponent of \"credibility\" woven into the system somewhere too. (That might be a subcategory of the cumulative comportment component\u2014say that three times in a row really fast.)\n\nAs just a made-up-off-the-top-of-my-head example of how AI might work, if you were some guy, let's say, on the Senior Tour with a blatantly sourpuss attitude, a scruffy face (the wretched old billy goat type, not the well-manicured type), goofy\nclothes that didn't fit, a doofus-looking little pony tail sticking out of the back of your cap like a tomboy, and an ugly-but-effective swing; you would certainly have to be penalized to the maximum extent of the system (a negative\nbonus points allowance may even have to be considered, for particularly noxious presentations). But, just to make things clear, if Arnold Palmer showed up at an event with the scruffy face (including and probably\nespecially the billy goat type in his case) and the pony tail, etc., with his swashbuckling gotta-love-him demeanor he would most likely be rewarded for many of the same things.\n(And wouldn't you LOVE to see The King do that? Jack could easily pull it off, too.)\n\nOf course the AI score would be subjective, but that is inevitable in judged sports. If the judging were done by a panel\u2014say, for example, Feherty, McCord, Faldo, Miller and me (notice how I managed to include myself amongst\nthose illustrious people)\u2014rather than by just one individual, that would at least eliminate the possibility of prejudice or favoritism to a reasonable degree.\n\nAdministering a system of Artistic Impression in professional golf scoring may simply be too cumbersome or problematic (and it would probably not be feasible on the amateur level, let alone the recreational level). But the spirit of the proposal is\nplain. For professional golf to remain the refined and sophisticated game that it has come to be known as, for it not to degrade into a brouhaha for the unwashed (hoping that it's not too late), I believe that one possible solution is augmentation of\nthe scoring system by the inclusion of Artistic Impression. After all, to me, \"being good at golf\" is more about the grace and style of a player than it is about just the number of strokes.\nTo wit, one can accidentally ricochet the ball off the comfort facilities and make a hole-in-one.Of course, if that was done intentionally it would receive\nthe maximum number of style points...a bonus points system may even have to be considered..."}

{"text":"More Articles\n\nGolf is a game of precision. In order to be precise with every swing of the club and hit of the ball, golfers must have proper body form and technique. In addition, golfers must have great kinesthetic awareness, which comes from muscular strength, endurance and flexibility. A successful fitness plan will help the golfer meet his goals. The components of golf fitness are well-rounded and include flexibility training, golf specific strength training, core training, aerobic conditioning and a diet and nutrition plan.\n\nFlexibility Training\n\nFlexibility training is possibly the most undervalued, yet most important component of golf conditioning. Range of motion of the body's muscles and joints play an integral part in many of the golf movements. Flexibility can be defined as the range of motion about a joint and its surrounding muscles during a movement. By increasing the joint range of motion, performance may be enhanced and the risk of injury reduced. The rationale for this is that a limb can move further before an injury occurs.\nFlexibility training has many benefits such as correcting muscle imbalances, increasing range of motion, relieving joint stress, promoting muscle relaxation and enhancing kinesthetic awareness.\n\nGolf Specific Strength Training\n\nOne important result of strength training is increased physical performance. Muscles use energy in order to produce movement. When we strength train, we increase the muscle size, strength and endurance. Having increased body strength, not bulk, enhances your golf game by improving the force of your swing.\nThe power of the golf swing is directly influenced by the core muscles and rotation of your hips. A stronger core allows the hips to turn faster in your swing increasing the length of your drives and iron shots. A stronger core and hip rotation will generate more power as a golfer rotates. These golf muscles play a critical role in increasing clubhead speed. Clubhead speed is created when the golfer delivers impact on the ball.\n\nCore Training\n\nTraining the power house of the body to achieve more force in the golf swing is much different than going into a gym and lifting heavy weights or using the machines. Golf is dynamic and involves balance, coordination, stability and body awareness.\nGolfers need to focus less on muscle group isolation and more on muscle group integration. Once a stronger and more flexible core is developed, the golfer will be able to rotate fully on the backswing and create maximum torque. Full rotation and torque generate high levels of clubhead speed without the golfer having to physically swing harder.\n\nCardiovascular Training\n\nCardiovascular fitness is a special form of muscular endurance. It is the efficiency of the heart, lungs and vascular system in delivering oxygen to the working muscle tissues so that prolonged physical work can be maintained.\nCardiovascular training serves as the foundation for other fitness programs. The conditioning and health of the heart and blood vessels are the basis for safety and performance in nearly all athletic endeavors.\nGolfers need to have an aerobic capacity for the course. On average, a golfer will walk approximately 5 miles on a course and many can be rugged or hilly. When the heart and lungs cannot handle the increased heart rate and oxygen consumption, the golfer will become winded and tired and his or her game will suffer because of fatigue.\n\nDiet\n\nA diet that is balanced and consists of carbohydrates, proteins and fats is recommended for golfers. Approximately 50 percent of a golfer's diet should come from whole grain carbohydrates. This includes oatmeal, brown rice, fruits and vegetables.\nCarbohydrates are the body's preferred source of energy and without enough of the right carbohydrates, the body will be tired and unable to perform. Protein is found in meats and dairy. This macronutrient rebuilds muscle tissue and regulates chemical processes.\nFat is the final diet component for the golfer. Like carbohydrates, fat is also an energy source for muscle, however, fat has 5 more calories per gram than carbs. The recommended amount of fat is less than 30 percent of the golfer's daily calories.\nFinally, water intake and hydration are a crucial part of the golfers diet. The body needs to stay hydrated, especially during the warmer golf months. Golfers lose water through perspiration and respiration. That water must be replenished as a slight drop in hydration can cause fatigue and even confusion.\n\nReferences\n\nAbout the Author\n\nAmy Neighbors is president and master trainer of Swing Athletics Golf Performance Fitness.

{"text":"Scotty Cameron Putters | Scotty Cameron Putter Fitting\n\nThe following video takes an enthusiastic Cameron Collector through the process of being fitted for a putter. Enjoy.\n\nIn this video Ryan Crysler takes an avid Cameron Collector through a detailed process of stroke evaluation in order to evaluate necessary adjustments to one of this person's Scotty Cameron putters.\n\nWhat I found interesting about this video was a tool called the Cameron cube which looks like a putter attachment that is designed to help a golfer with releasing the swing at the correct time. The device essentially is a square with a hole in the middle that goes on the face of the putter. The ball is then placed in the hole. The golfer then swings through the ball and as the cube is get higher off the ground the ball is free to move forward. This uncovers the natural direction of the ball based on a golfers swing. The golfer can then adjust their swing so that the ball goes straight.\n\nThe conclusion on this video was for the golfer to practice their swing instead of any loft adjustments being made to the putter."}
{"text":"Who remembers the Adams Tight Lies GT irons? What would be similar today?\n\nI had a set of these once upon a time and played my best golf with them .\n\nGave them to my nephew years ago when he started golfing. I can't think of anything similar off the top of my head in today's irons. They had a mid \/ large size head, a fairly narrow rounded sole and a topline that was narrower than a something like a Ci11 but not at thin as a blade. The cavity was also pretty shallow."}
{"text":"For golfers who are new to the game, there are lots of confusing terms associated with golf clubs. In addition, some of the explanations are inaccurate as well. One of which I want to address is offset. Many times I see the explanation that offset shifts the center of gravity further back in the head resulting into a higher ball flight. I want to dispel this myth and help those understand the function of offset better.\n\nMore\u2026First, it is difficult to truly tell what offset does by itself. Typically heads with reduced, little or no offset tend to be designed differently from irons with more offset. Increased offset irons are designed as game improvement clubs, many of which have more upright lies, wider soles and shorter hosels positioning the center of gravity lower than comparable profiled irons. In this case, there are too many other parameters that have changed to honestly know what effect offset itself does to ball flight.\n\nI am fortunate to have accumulated a lot of different irons over the years. One particular model was a Ping Eye II style iron that every manufacturer had their own version back in the late 1980's and early '90s. Dynacraft's version was called the \"4140\". This was a progressive offset, cavity back design with the offset of the 5-iron being 3.5mm. Dynacraft also tooled up another design called the On-line. This head was made from virtually the same mold as the size, shape and profile were replicated. The only difference was the On-line featured no offset at all. Finally, two heads that was so similar to one another that the effect of offset can honestly be tested.\n\nTo understand how small difference this really is, look at the value. In metric, 3.5mm might seem like a lot, but in imperial measurements this amount to only 0.138\" or just over 1\/8th of an inch. The other important consideration is the ball position in the stance. Let's say a golfer is at the driving range hitting off of the grass. The golfer drops or rakes a ball somewhere on the ground in front of them. From there he or she attempts to align themselves to the ball and their target. The ball may be nestled down in the grass or maybe sitting up on a little patch of grass. The ball will be a positioned in relationship from the distance of their body and also in relation between their front and back foot. I can tell you that the difference from one time to the next, the position will be greater than 1\/8\" difference, especially if the person is a higher handicapped golfer. Remember this very important point as clubs are played by humans and not swing robots.\n\nWith these two clubs in hand, they were measured very carefully to make sure they had the exact loft and lie, if not they would have been adjusted. As luck would have it, both measured 28\u00b0 loft and 60\u00b0 lie. Again these were older clubs as reflected by these angles. Each clubhead was built as a demo with the same shaft, shaft weight (within the gram), frequency, grip weight, while the shaft were carefully cut on a cutting jig to ensure the exact amount was trimmed from the tip and butt and then assembled to the same length and swingweight. The offset head required two small strips of lead tape to achieve the exact same weight.\n\nWhat happens when these two clubs are hit side by side at the range? Remember what I said earlier about the position of the ball in the stance and how it sits does in the grass. The average golfer upon solid contact can hit the ball straight with the offset club, but also the non-offset club too. However, the tendency on the majority of the shots was that the offset club would yield a ball flight more left than the reduced or non-offset club (this for a RH golfer). The other thing that was apparent was the trajectory, with the non-offset club hitting the ball higher. To understand why can be explained by the position of the center of gravity.offset1.jpg\n\nThe center of gravity of the non-offset club is actually further behind the face of the club. The hosel does contribute a considerable percentage of the overall clubhead weight. The clubhead with more offset actually shifts more weight forward of the face rather than backwards. However, the center of gravity in relationship to the centerline axis of the shaft is further back in the offset head. This is what helps the clubface assist is closing the face. A reward center of gravity increases the center of gravity angle, therefore naturally closing the face.\n\nI asked a few other very low handicapped golfers who are knowledgeable about the equipment and the swing to tell me if they thought offset hit the ball higher or lower. The best response I share is that offset tended to \"trap\" the ball at impact and effectively cause the ball to produce a slightly lower shot that will tend to go more to the left for a right-handed golfer. This has always been my experience as well with the same angles, shafts, shaft flexes, etc.offset2.jpg\n\nThere has been much debate over the years on the effect of offset. I am sure that I will hear arguments from fellow golfers who will read this and make a judgment based upon that golfer's past experiences. My contention is the clubhead design, aside from the actual offset, may be the reason for their response. I simply wanted to conduct a scientific approach to limit all other variable as physically possible to test only one parameter \u2013 offset.\n\n4 Comments on The Myth of Offset\n\nJeff,\nI had a set of King Cobra SSi iron that I recently sold. What I am looking to replace the with will either be the Acer XK, XK Pro, Caiman Rawpower, or the System Q2 irons in 5-pw. I hit the Cobras pretty straight, so I am trying to decide if I need the extra offset in the XKs , or should I consider a closer offset in the Caiman and SystemQ2s, or should I think more about the XK Pros? The Cobra SSi has a similar offset to that of the Cobra SZ irons that just came out.\nAny information would greatly be appreciated.\n\nThe offset of vintage Cobra irons must be a closely guarded secret as I cannot find them list anywhere on the irons you once had. But Cobra irons have been traditionally designed for the masses so I would say the offset would be more similar to that of the Caiman irons. If you had trouble pushing the older irons, that is where you might consider a more offset models.\n\nas much as I would like some of your clubs, I just can't get the techs straight. will there ever be a club fitting n the Atlanta, ga. area. thanks\nIf not what graphite shaft would be the closest to the ping 129 senior. I think that has a low kick point. thanks\njay coffsky"}

{"text":"Improved golf fitness helping LPGA stars raise the bar\n\nWatching the tournament rounds of today's LPGA players is more exciting than ever. Annika Sorenstam continues to dominate women's golf and shows where finesse, strength and athleticism come together to make way for the future.\n\nIs today's female golfer really that different? You need only look as far as statistics from previous years in combination with current levels of play to answer that question.\n\nIn 1998 - only seven short years ago - Sorenstam drove the ball 246 yards in average driving distance. Today, her average distance is 272 yards. Since undergoing a full-scale assault on fitness with the help of a personal trainer, she has gained nearly 30 yards in distance.\n\nBut is Sorenstam the lone ranger in women's golf or the wave of the future? Back in 1998, if a LPGA player drove the ball 250 yards, she was in the top 17 players in her field. Today, a player who drives the ball 250 yards won't even make the top 40.\n\nSo, what accounts for these new performance standards and how can female golfers around the country prepare for high level competition?\n\nThe most important aspects of the golf swing and the game, in general, all revolve around the building of a strong and solid foundation for the body, the mind and the basics of an athletic swing. Each of the following concepts plays a critical role in your understanding of what creates a great round of golf as well as contributes to lifetime enjoyment of the game.\n\nStamina\n\nThis is clearly the most under-estimated portion of the game. Golfers tend to ignore the cardiovascular component of golf. However, walkers cover an approximate walking distance of four to five miles each round. Even cart riders put in their fair share of walking, depending on local cart rules, weather conditions and following errant shots.\n\nPoor cardiovascular conditioning can certainly have a negative impact on your game. In his book entitled \"How I Play Golf\" Tiger Woods said \"fatigue can affect your focus and cause you to make a bad decision. I never want to lose a tournament because of a bad decision precipitated by my being out of shape.\"\n\nStability\n\nThe most important rule in a golf conditioning program is to work and develop strength from the core region of the body outward. A strong trunk allows forces to be transferred effectively from the legs to the upper body. It also enables the body to withstand those forces without breakdown.\n\nStabilization comes in many forms for the golfer including postural stabilization, trunk stabilization and joint stabilization. A strong and stable body allows the golfer to maintain the spine angle throughout the entire swing.\n\nStrength\n\nStrength comes in many forms with regard to the golf swing. Strong back muscles allow the golfer to endure the explosive movements in the swing. Strength in the trunk region or \"core\" area of the body produces stability and helps to generate power.\n\nCombined muscle strength produces balance and coordination. Strong ligaments and tendons also prevent the joints from going beyond their range of motion. Physical strength often promotes mental acuity and toughness as a result.\n\nFlexibility\n\n't become a limiting factor in your performance. While women have a tendency towards ample flexibility, this isn't always the case.\n\nToday's female golfer knows that hard work creates results and translates to a better position in the playing field. If you are looking for ways to take yourself to the top of the leader board, then place the needs of your body at the top of your priority list to make a definitive difference in your game.\n\nEditor's note: Susan Hill is the President of Fitness for Golf, a Web site dedicated to helping golfers improve through golf-specific programs.

Thus, if you want to improve your gaming skills and make good scores, refer to the following unique tips:\n\n\u00a7 Keep in mind that in golf the most important parts of your body are your hands, so it is vital to exercise them well before you start playing the game. According to experts, about 50% of a golfer's ability is based on swinging, so you should regularly practice swinging, as this can successfully drag out any rigid or stressed muscle in your hand.\n\n\u00a7 Most of the golfers think that golf is not a tiring game like basketball, which needs some warm up exercises, so they ignore to do such exercises before playing the game. This should not be the case as all the golfers should be aware with what should they do before playing the game, and they need to warm them up well and stretch their muscles properly.\n\n\u00a7 It is vital for every player to familiarize himself or herself with the six parts of the golf swing technique to play a good game. These six parts are back swing; take away, proper setup of the golfer's posture and position, proper alignment of the golf club, impact, and the follow-through.\n\n\u00a7 If you want to play a good game then you should consider the size of the club. It is core to any golfer to select the right golf club, and the first thing that should be considered when choosing a golf club is its length. The length of the club should be suitable and appropriate for the player to make him or her comfortable when playing.\n\n\u00a7 You should focus on the target and on your game without thinking about other things if you want to make good scores. So, the first thing that you should learn is to turn off your mind and let your body to swing with no conscious intervention.\n\n\u00a7 Make sure to learn properly the technique to gripping, as this is core to perform well. If you observe the professional golfers, you will see that most of them have similar grips. So, you must find the best hand position and grip for you, and once you find the grip that is working for you then stick to it.\n\n\u00a7 Another tip to play a good game is to use a heavier club if you want to reduce your swing to 75%.\n\n\u00a7 Watch the professional golfers when they are playing, and try to capture the techniques they use to make good scores.\n\nThese are some basic tips that one can use to play a good game. But make sure that the most important thing for a golfer is to keep his or her body healthy before the tournament or championship to perform outstanding, and to compete well."}

{"text":"The New Rules of Golf Instruction Blog and Golf Tips\n\nMy Assistant Teacher, Ben Austin and I just videotaped our first installment of a Winter Practice Program for everybody. We gave a talk to our Member Coaching group Tuesday afternoon and it sparked an idea to give our blog readers weekly updates and nudges to make your golf game better during the winter.\n\nSome of the games best golfers came from cold climates. These golfers had an opportunity each winter to get away from golf and get a fresh perspective. It was also a chance to practice indoors and practice in a mirror. Getting repetitions without a golf ball or with less consequences allows habits to develop (read \"The New Rules of Golf Instruction\" Chapter on Practice for more ideas on how to Practice effectively).\n\nWe are urging you to use this winter to really focus on skill-building. We will be posting videos to give you ideas of what to work on and how to work on it. We recommend a putting mat and an eyelinegolf.com Putting Plane training aid.\n\nWatch the video below and tell your golfing friends to sign up for the blog to become part of our Winter Practice Program.\n\nEssential #6 is the Swing Plane. The shape of the swing is not a natural thing. Most of us will naturally think taking the club down the target line will hit the ball straighter. Many of us have thought \"Straight back and Straight Through\" will hit the ball to the target. A key thing to remember is we stand to the side of the ball and bend over to the ball. These factors lead to the shape of swing that works best.\n\nIn the video below I will explain some key information and demonstrate a drill or two that will give you the right idea and how to make it a habit in your golf game. Watch the video below and pass it on to your golfing friends who need some help.\n\nSam Froggate and the good folks at eyelinegolf.com are dedicated to golfers improving their putting. They specialize in putting training aids for golf that are innovative and practical.\n\nYou know my New Rules philosophy is all about developing skills. Good drills and solid training aids are how you build habits. My favorite putting training aid is the Putting Plane. I just did a putting tip for eyelinegolf.com and will let you know when it has been edited and ready for viewing.\n\nThe number of views for yesterdays question lets me know I need to answer more of your questions. I am going to start with the golf swing. I will then answer your questions for short game, mental toughness, etc.\n\nPlease, in the comments section below, give me your questions regarding the golf swing. I will answer one or two a week for the next month and then move to another topic. - - -\n\nOur New Rules Essential Skills series continues. The first week we got your Pre-Swing to be solid. The second and third week we got you to hit the ball solidly. The forth week we swung the club with rhythm. This week I want to have you focus on the #1 key to direction control - club face angle at impact.\n\nOver the years, I have heard teachers and players claim that this happens automatically if you do some other move correctly (usually with the body). I also hear too many times about how the hands are not trustworthy. These thoughts are flat out not true. The New Rules way of thinking says golf is about being skillful. The squaring of the club face will seem to happen automatically for the golfer who has practiced and become skillful at this move.\n\nThe video I have included has been viewed almost 8,000 times and it contains the drills I recommend to become skillful and eventually make it where your clubface seems to square up automatically. Clubface awareness is an Essential Skill that every golfer must master to hit the ball to the intended target.\n\n\"The New Rules of Golf Instruction\" continues to gain momentum with golfers and golf instructors alike.

{"text":"Perhaps the lawyers and professional grammarians employed by the R&A and USGA should be told in addition to the thousands of referees around the world who will now have to go back to school.\n\nIf qualifications are relevant I used to be a professional grammar analyst and I have no problem with the structure of the words in the book.\n\nHowever, the words of Humpty Dumpty are more significant than anything we might think.\n\nYou want to know why so many people disregard and disrespect the rules of golf? One of the reaons is because the rulebook says one thing while something else entirely is enforced. I've come to the conclusion that a professional grammarian is something that the USGA lacks, and until they become consistent in the way that they enforce tehir rules, I will not donate money to them.\n\nIt makes absolutely no sense whatsoever for the other green (the one without the flagstick) to NOT be declared a wrong green and preventing players from taking relief from it.\n\nWhy would you want to let players hack up a painstakingly prepared putting surface with a wedge or an iron, where that green is typically nowhere near the actual green in play? To put that green in play the following week or whatever? Except, now you can't because it's all damaged!Now, if the 2 \"greens\" are in fact contiguous to each other with perhaps a strip of rough between them in one area (but the contiguity is maintained in another part), then it's a single green, and it would be no different than having a bunker in the middle of the green: it's not necessarily a smart or cost-effective design, but it's possible, even when only amateurs and hackers are using that course. There is such a hole at #15 at The Ranch, in San Jose, CA.The problem here is two-fold. First of all, invoking \"common sense\" is somewhat of a logical fallacy that creates bias. What might be common sense to you is not going to be common sense to everyone, and this has been made obvious based on the fact that we are having this conversation. Furthermore, I find that golf rules, in general, tend to not be based on common sense at all. And I could name a dozen rules that prove that point, but I digress.\n\nWhat is obvious about golf rules to me is that the rules are extremely strict about when, where, and how a person can take relief from certain lies. Furthermore, the game itself is designed to give players a variety of different types of shots to try to execute in order to keep the game challenging. So in my opinion, these factors along make up for the use of \"common sense\" in your argument. It's just not a factor.\n\nMy interpretation of the rule relies on a strict reading of how the rule is written without any outside bias figured in.\n\nBut that's the kind of argument that justifies why more than half of the world's lawyers are in the US. Nitpicking every letter of the law, instead of taking the big picture approach and looking at the intent of the law...\n\nCarry on, and ruin the greens, if you like (and you'd better be ready and have the rules of golf and the Webster dictionary in your pocket to fully explain why you did so, when the club head pro sees you do it). I'll take a drop under the wrong green rule: it's just common sense to me and most people...\n\nSo hypothetically, if the two greens on different levels were connected by a tiny strip of green-bridge, miniature-golf style, then it would suddenly become a single green again, right? That seems a strange distinction to enforce.\n\nYou cannot post new topics in this forum You cannot reply to topics in this forum You cannot edit your posts in this forum You cannot delete your posts in this forum You cannot vote in polls in this forum"}

{"text":"OK, you want new clubs. Do you drop a big number and buy the name-brand set you\nsee on the pro's bag, or do you save some bucks and buy the knock-off set? There\nare pros and cons to going either way. I'll present the argument for buying knock-offs.\n\nXL-20 Iron Set Left Handed\n(Similar to Callaway X-20)\n\nBut first, let's make an important distinction between perfectly legal knock-offs\nand clones, and that of illegal, counterfeit fakes. A knock-off might have a similar\nlook and the performance traits of a name-brand club. But the legal knock-off will\nhave a clearly marked and distinguishing name and logo so that there is no question\nas to what you're buying or playing with. No patents or trademarks will have been\ninfringed. Nor will they try to fool you with a too-similar name and look, like\nthe King Snake vs. King Cobra rip-off that we saw a few years ago.\n\nOn the other hand, the shape and design marks of the counterfeit club, down to exact\nlogo and paint color, have been painstakingly replicated to fool the buyer. The\nability to distinguish between the real McCoy and an illegal fake is hard even for\nthe expert. Unless you are trained to know what to look for, it is pretty hard to\ntell the difference \u2013 until you hit the ball. That's when the inferior materials\nand craftsmanship of the fake clubs show themselves. Fakes and counterfeits are\nillegal and shouldn't be bought.\n\nA fake Rolex may impress some people, and it still tells time. But a fake golf club\nisn't going to impress anyone; it just won't feel right or perform as well. What's\nworse, the fake will cost about the same as the real thing. Everybody knows that\nif the price is too good to be true, it's probably not the real thing. To avoid\nsuspicion, the sellers of counterfeit golf clubs try to sell at prices comparable\nto the originals.\n\nClones and knock-offs, on the other hand, are made with quality components, using\nthe same grade of steel and titanium, and often from the same foundries and manufacturers\nthat supple the name-brand companies. With quality materials and similar design\nprinciples, knock-offs perform similarly to the name brands but provide much better\nvalue; you can usually save 60% to 70% off the name-brand set. The money you save\non clubs you can spend on lessons, which is always money well spent.\n\nName-brand companies spend a lot of money on research and development to continuously\nimprove performance. And there is no question; the clubs they sell get better year\nafter year. They also spend a lot on marketing to convince golfers that they can\nbuy a better game. Advertising and branding costs are legitimate expenditures. They\nhelp pay for the major golf magazines, network broadcasts and licensing revenue\npaid to sponsored touring professionals. With a name-brand club, you're paying far\nmore for these marketing costs and overhead than you are for design innovations\nand better performance.\n\nKnock-off manufacturers accept that they will not have cutting-edge designs and\ninnovations. But they have evaluated design changes that have truly improved performance\nover time. They then model these design principles into their own-make clubs. For\nexample, the major design changes that have led to truly better performance over\nthe years are perimeter weighted, cavity-backed irons; offset club heads; hybrids\nthat replace long irons; bigger club heads for bigger sweet spots; big, lightweight\ndriver heads; and graphite shafts. The changes that come out year after year are\npretty much minor refinements on these major innovations.\n\nYou can get all these game-improvement innovations at a very reasonable price by\nbuying knock-offs from reputable suppliers on the web. They offer the same custom-fit\noptions as the name brands. A reputable dealer will clearly let you know you are\nbuying a knock-off; a seller of counterfeit merchandise will try to tell you it's\nthe real thing.\n\nKeep in mind that not everyone has the same idea in mind when using the words knock-off,\nclones and fakes. For our purposes, and yours, if you distinguish between illegal\ncounterfeits and legal knock-offs, you'll be on the right track.\n\nOh, and if you're in the market for a titanium knock-off driver, make sure it's\ntitanium and not a titanium alloy. The later is mostly aluminum and meant to fool\nthe uninformed."}

{"text":"Learn to measure proper distance from ball\n\nBy Kim Jeong-kyoo\n\nTo hit the ball firmly on a consistent basis your setup needs to satisfy certain basic requirements; one of the vital essentials is correct distance from the ball.\n\nWhen the ball is not hit in the dead centre of the clubface, it is as well to check your distance from the ball first rather than make a helter-skelter attempt to find a solution in your in-swing movements or swing mechanics.\n\nStanding too close to the ball or placing the bodyweight too much on the heels causes poor contact of the ball on the heel-side of the clubface; standing too far away from the ball or distributing bodyweight too much toward the toes results in bad contact of the ball on the toe-side of the clubface. Your body balances itself during the swing for equilibrium and leans forwards or backwards, thus pushing or pulling the clubhead outward or inward.\n\nSimilarly, standing too close to the ball at address robs you of the space between your hands and belly to swing your arms through, which forces you to swing the club back outside the ball-target line and swing down on a path that is from outside to in. You will produce pulls to the left or pull-slices depending on the clubface alignment through impact.\n\nSimilarly, standing too far away from the ball causes you to take the club away from the ball on a path that is overly inside the ball-target line, costing balance. You will produce pushes to the right or push-hooks depending on the clubface position in relation to its path.\n\nIn a nutshell, when your swing does not go on track, you'd better check first, your grip apart, how far you are standing from the ball.\n\nAn easy method of measuring the proper distance from the ball is to grip normally and stand erect and relaxed with the club extended straight out in front of you at a comfortable arms length, the shaft being horizontal to the ground. Allow your arms to hang straight down naturally from your shoulders with the upper parts of your arms pressed comfortably to the sides of your chest. Getting your arms to be separated from the chest causes you to stand too far away from the ball.\n\nNow, without curving your back or flexing your knees, lean over from your hips until the sole of the club rests on the ground. Also essential here is to stick your bottom out behind your heels. Then, without dropping your hands, flex your knees just enough so your shinbone leans a little forward toward the ball. Try to feel your chest is almost perpendicular to the ground as it would be when you are walking on the fairway.\n\nYou are now measuring the proper distance from the ball regardless of which club you are using.\n\nHowever, to further ensure that you are standing at the correct distance from the ball you need to have a definite sensation that your left arm and the club are hanging down comfortably from your left shoulder.\n\nArching your wrists upward causes you to stand too close to the ball, resulting in slice. Cocking your wrists upward too much allows you to stand too far away from the ball, bringing about hook.\n\nIf you are going to make a mistake, it's better to cock your wrists a tad upward. However, be sure that your wrists are as straight as they are when your arms are hanging down naturally from the shoulders with the top of your left shoulder, left arm and the clubshaft forming a straight line. This is particularly true of golfers who set up in an upright posture.\n\nAlso critical to setting up with a proper distance is to place your bodyweight in the proper fashion. Depending on where to place your bodyweight you can stand too far from or too close to the ball. Placing the majority of your bodyweight back on your heels causes you to stand too close to the ball and keeping your bodyweight mostly on the toes causes you to stand too far away from the ball. For all normal full shots it needs to be on the inside of the balls of your feet.\n\nMeasuring an improper distance from the ball makes it a terrible struggle to whack the ball firmly in the middle of the clubface. For future use remember your distance from the ball when it is struck well on the sweetspot of the clubface."}

However, if you've played from the wrong spot and then take another shot after that one before discovering the mistake, you finish the hole if you haven't done so yet or you get whatever score you marked for that hole with a 2-shot penalty. That's the general rule for all mistakes like that.\n\nThanks, Chuck.

Do you automatically grab your \"water ball?\" You know, the one you won't mind losing when you're playing by a body of water? Oops \u2026 you just programmed yourself to hit the ball right into the water!\nEvery golfer agrees that once you learn how to swing a club, golf is primarily a mental game. Golfers like Bobby Jones, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson, Tiger Woods, and other greats have all stressed the importance of developing mental sharpness, toughness, and focus to have success on the course. And yet, even though the experts say that 90% of golf is mental, how many golfers actually develop or know how to develop a solid mental approach to their game?"}
{"text":"Shaft Drill ~ Fix your Backswing & Cure your Push\n\nThe backswing is one of the most important parts of your golf swing. What you do during your backswing will affect the results of your golf shot.There are two common faults on the take-away that can lead to a pushed shot. The first is an exaggerated backswing that travels too far away from your body (outside your target line), the second is the opposite (too far inside the target line). This drill can help you fix both of these faults.\n\nYour target line is an imaginary line that extends from your target through your ball.\n\nAn outside the target line backswing will tend to loops inwards on the downswing. This is because, physically hitting the golf ball becomes nearly impossible if you don't. So if you're pushing your shots and your backswing is well outside your target line. You've got quite the out-to-in loop in your golf swing.\n\nOn the other hand, it is quite common to hit pushed shots with a backswing that is too far inside. This move alone will force your downswing to be inside the target line heading into impact, leading to push or push hook.\n\nBy placing a shaft in the position shown in these pictures, you are able to fix both these potential causes of your push. The idea is to have the club ahead of the shaft throughout your entire swing. If the club drops inside your target line at any point in your backswing or downswing, you will make contact with the shaft. Work on changing your swing path slowly with this drill. Only hit balls once you are comfortable with the proper motions."}

{"text":"Posts Tagged 'set-up'\n\nThere are manyways to swing a golf club, but only one way to hit a golf ball correctly.\n\nThe whole idea behind my philosophy is the above statement. When looking at the top players of all time, there are no two golfers that swing the club the same way, however they all manage to impact and strike the ball in a similar fashion. How is it possible that Lee Trevino, Ray Floyd and Nancy Lopez can make the ball get to the target the same way that Ben Hogan, Nick Faldo and Tiger Woods do? The only answer can beimpact.A position where the weight is well on the front foot, the handle leads the clubhead into the ball while the head remains over or slightly behind the ball.\n\nToday I will identify a few key factors that facilitate a sound impact position. Swing the club any way you want, but obey these few simple points, because the vast majority of the greatest golfers follow them.\n\nGrip:\n\nAlmost every champion golfer has a grip that favors the strong end of the spectrum vs. the weaker side. I can only find one legendary golfer that utilized a weak grip and that would be Ben Hogan \u2013 all the others were strong, with a few being neutral. A strong grip encourages the hands to lead the clubhead into the strike \u2013 an integral part of a proper strike on the ball.\n\nA Slightly Strong Grip\n\nSet-Up:\n\nAt address it is important for the head to be centered between the feet. This will leave the spine relatively verticle and the shoulders fairly level. Stance width should favor narrow over wide and the ball should never be too far forward. Keep in mind this set-up is in place to allow the golfer to get into a proper impact position as simply as possible.\n\nCorrect Set Up for Irons\n\nThe Pivot:\n\nThere are two important points to note in the pivot motion: the plane upon which the shoulders pivotand whether or not the body stays within the 84 degree line. The plus here is that the better the shoulder pivot, the less likely the body is to move laterally (sway) and get across the 84 degree line.\n\nIn the shoulder pivot, the lead shoulder must move down and then across vs. simply turning across and behind the ball.\n\nAs the body winds to the top and just before transition begins, the back side of the body should be flush up against the84 degree line. This loads the energy in the swing efficiently and prepares the body to glide effortlessly into a sound impact position. If you do happen to break the line with your hips or upper body here, you will be challenged to get to the proper impact position.\n\nThe 84 Degree Line\n\nNotice how all of the above factors are in place to facilitate the body being able to get to impact in an efficient manner. This is the secret to all of golf's greatest players' swings: they all had different swings, but everything they did allowed them to get into the proper position to deliver the club onto the ball correctly. You would do well to incorporate a few of these elements into your swing.\n\nShots struck off the ground need to be hit with a descending blow and shots struck off an elevated tee are better when hit with an upward blow- fact! While TrackMan stats for the PGA Tour may show that on average Tour players hit down on their driver (1.3 degrees), as mere mortal golfers, we need to make sure we are efficient and get the most distance we can out of the driver by hitting up on the ball. If you need some more convincing how about this: Golfer A swings at 90mph and hits 5 degrees down on the ball (-5 attack angle). Their average well struck tee ball goes 234 yards. Now, golfer B swings at 90mph and hits 5 degrees up on the ball (+5 attack angle). Their average well struck tee shot travels 256 yards- a gain of 22 yards while swinging the same speed! Ready to listen now\u2026.?\n\nI have recently started noticing that many golfers actually set up to hit their irons in the same manner as their woods or vice versa. Ever wondered why so many of your playing partners are either good with the woods and not the irons or no good off the turf and solid with the driver? The answer is, is that there are two different types of swings. One that suits shots hit off the ground or close proximity to it and a swing that suits the upward, efficient hit of a driver off a high tee.\n\nThe picture above is an excellent illustration of what I have been seeing. Here, I have a student setting up to a driver and an iron. Notice any similarities? In case you're wondering the seven iron stance is on the right. They look decidedly alike don't they? The good news is that this was taken at the beginning of the lesson, she made the necessary changes and gained 14 yards with her driver while maintaining a solid descending impact with the irons.\n\nIt should stand to reason that if there are two swings then there should be two different set up positions. Here are the important differences\u2026\n\nSetting up for shots off the ground:\n\nAs in the picture at the top of the page the weight should be anywhere from a 50\/50 split to favoring the front foot slightly\n\nYour head should be centered between the heels\n\nThere should be very little spine tilt away from the target and as a result the shoulders will be fairly level\n\nSetting up for shots off a high tee:\n\nAs in the picture below the feet are fairly far apart and there should actually be a little more weight on the back foot than the front foot\n\nThe ball is positioned inside the left heel and teed high\n\nThe spine should be tilting away from the target a little as you prepare to \"swing uphill\"\n\nSet Up for an Upward Strike\n\nThe best teacher you have available to you to help with this is a mirror. You are now aware as to what it should look like, but you don't quite have the feel yet. Get in front of a mirror, set up so that it looks correct (your feel might have something else to say about it!) and take that with you to practice or play.\n\nThink of the bounce on a wedge, or any iron, as an insurance policy against digging the leading edge of the golf club into the ground.\n\nIt is very important for any golfer to not only understand what the bounce is, but how to use it to their advantage. An excellent exercise to do every now and then is to hit a few pitch shots off of a lie board. This is a flat plexiglass board that most club fitters use in determining the correct lie angle a golfers irons should be set at. If you do not have access to a lie board, use a piece of plywood painted black. Just be sure to not hit any shots where the ball is too close to the edge of the board.\n\nWhat you should see...\n\nIf the markings on the sole of the club are as pictured above you are using the club correctly. Should they be closer to the leading edge you might be in danger of sticking the club into the ground on your next chip of pitch. The most important aspect of using the bounce correctly is addressing the ball correctly. Take a look:\n\nThe Set Up for a Chip or Pitch\n\nIn the above image you will see the ball positioned in the center (watch out for too far back as it reduces the bounce at impact and makes it easier to do some gardening); the feet are fairly close together; and the hands and weight are just slightly in front of the ball, with emphasis on slightly.\n\nAs you go through the motion of striking that chip or pitch try to feel that the handle and the clubhead get back to impact at the same time \u2013 in other words don't allow the handle to get too far in front of the clubhead at impact as you are then exposing more of that sharp leading edge to the ground. And we all know what that can lead to easier to hit down on. As you get to the longer"}
{"text":"Stallone II\n\nAfter years of muscling his way across the screen, Sylvester Stallone seeks a different label: serious actor.\n\nStallone: Five years ago. I was curious about the game. I wasn't excited at first. I was actually quite miffed by the fact that so many people were attracted by this odd game that had been stigmatized for years as being an old man's sport. So having played polo for years I thought I'd just try to burst this myth--what could warrant hours and hours of television every week? Who's watching this? I didn't know one golfer. So I went out there and I proceeded to make a fool of myself the first two days. I bent the hozzle on a 3-wood and a 5-wood, which is pretty hard to do. I was atrocious. But the instructor kept saying, \"Oh, that's wonderful, Mr. Stallone. That's wonderful.\" I was literally digging elephant graves. A family of five could live in one of my divots. That's how bad it was. What happened was I became captivated by my ineptness, my inability to function properly. I was outraged by the way my body rebelled and refused to cooperate. I said, \"I feed you, I clothe you, I bathe you and I ask you to do one thing--hit this stupid white sphere, and you betray me over and over.\" So it came to me doing battle--me against me.\n\nCA: I can imagine. You've had a good relationship with that body. You've been athletic, this should be easy. Right?\n\nStallone: Exactly. I couldn't understand it. I thought I'd done sports eminently more complex: polo, downhill skiing and boxing--not even close. There is no more precise sport in the world. And I think that is the fascination. There is a psychological dependency that happens with golf. That's really why it does bear definition by so many different quarters. In other words, there are probably more books written on golf than any other sport.\n\nCA: Thoughtful books.\n\nStallone: Yes. They're like philosophies. And you realize that golf is completely psychological. One hundred percent.\n\nCA: You've been quoted as saying that it's like a window on the personality of a person. Do you see that every time with every person you play with?\n\nStallone: One hundred percent. I've played with the finest pros in the world and I've played with people who seriously should have their arms amputated. They are that dangerous to their fellow man. I mean they're hitting ball washers. How do you hit a driver and the ball goes behind you? I've seen them hit ducks on the course, trees. Horrifying. I mean truly dangerous. You want to lay flat on the ground every time they hit.\n\nCA: What about their behavior, is that a window on them, too?\n\nStallone: The behavior. I have no tolerance for people who make a living, a very good living, in a multitude of professions and then come out on the course and absolutely have the audacity to believe they are going to bring this course to its knees, and they're shocked, angered and outraged when they miss a 20-foot, left-to-right, downhill, breaking-against-the-grain putt. I said, \"Are you out of your mind? Do you really think that you're going to make that?\" Or they're stuck in wet sand and they wonder why they top the ball--excuse me, a pro couldn't make that shot. So that bothers me and I tend to never play with them again. I'd rather play alone. Because the most beautiful part of the game is I don't do this for a living. Imagine if that putt was for the house. The kids' college education. Your future, your insurance, your reputation. Your card, your tour card. That's pressure. But we're doing it for nothing. We get to go home and go back to our well-paying job. So what is there to be angry about? Why should there be temper tantrums? This is a perfect time where I think people have an opportunity to learn control. Don't give in to it. Who doesn't want to go crazy and smash the club? But it's a poor carpenter who blames his tools, that's all I can say.\n\nCA: You've started bringing a hitting net on set. Do you find that is an easy release between scenes or at the end of the day?"}
{"text":"How To Increase Your Swing Speed\u2026.\n\nThe majority of golfers think that to hit it farther they must swing harder. The reality is we must swing faster, not harder. To swing faster the speed of the hands must not increase during the backstroke and down stroke.\n\nHere's an example;\n\nImagine 2 pulleys, one above the other. Around these 2 pulleys is a belt, on this belt there are golf clubs attached. When the club goes around the pulley does the club speed up? Absolutely! But, did the belt speed up? NO! Think of the arms and hands as the belt, as long as they stay at a constant speed the club will automatically speed up. By trying to swing harder and changing the backstroke and downstroke speed the club will actually slow down! This causes the surface speed to change and the result is a slowing down of the golf club.\n\nTry this drill \u2013 Hold the club by the clubhead so that the grip end of the club is pointed at an imaginary golf ball. Start swinging back and forth and listen to the sound the club makes. You'll hear a \"swishing\" sound. Where you hear this sound is the fastest moving point of the swing. Get the \"swish\" to happen past Impact, (release is a power loss). This means that the club will be accelerating at Impact! If you hear the \"swish\" before Impact then the club has no choice but to slow down (decelerate)!\n\nIn reality, when the club and ball meet the club will slow down, but this is a drill to train ourselves to accelerate through Impact , not before Impact!\n\nIn addition, there has been a lot of talk about the low point of the arc. Some say it is at the sternum. Let me just say this, if in fact this was the case then there would be no divot in front of the ball unless every ball was played back of center of the chest!\n\nThe low point is, and always will be, the outside of the target side shoulder! The only exception is when the target side wrist is in an arched condition and the shoulder is behind the Impact point of the golf ball. Then the target side wrist becomes the fulcrum of the swing and the low point\u2026ie, Brad Faxon.\n\nChuck Evans is one of only 31 Teachers in the world to hold the designation of \"Doctorate in Golf Stroke Engineering\", he is one of the most highly sought after instructors in the world not only by players but other teachers as well and is known as the Teacher of Teachers!

{"text":"Every golfer knows the importance of developing a proper pre-shot routine, but the value of a post-shot routine is equally important. Often individuals play fabulous golf, yet don't quite understand why they \"blow up\" for two consecutive holes. If you as a player cannot learn how to shake off a poor shot before moving onto the next, it will be difficult to consistently play your best golf by reducing the number of \"blow-up\" holes.\n\nPromptly after each shot, you should conduct a quick self-debrief. If your shot was good, then replay it in your mind. Build as much emotion as possible into the visualization so that you take ownership of it. You could add a specific action (e.g. fist pump) to anchor the emotion to that action for future reference. In essence, you want to create an emotional library of success to draw upon on the next shot. Look back on Tiger Woods' successful rounds; did he ever miss a fist pump after an incredible putt?\n\nIf you hit a poor shot, realize that every shot is a perfect reflection of the actions that preceded it. Ask yourself, \"What happened\u2026did I commit to the shot\u2026was contact poor\u2026did I lack focus?\" Logically, you want to learn from it. If we truly look hard enough, almost every disaster contains elements of a blessing. Next, play that shot backwards in your mind \u2013 then scrub it out. The point is: learn something from each shot, make way for positive energy and focus on the next shot.\n\nTwo of golf's greatest players, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods, use post-shot routines. Woods uses the \"10-pace rule.\" For the poor manners and anger he sometimes displays, if you watch him carefully, you will observe that he purges himself once he moves roughly ten paces beyond the shot. He understands that you cannot continue to embrace your anger and disappointment, and you must return to an optimistic, positive state of being.\n\nNicklaus has commented that he has never three-putted the 18th green in a tournament. However, the facts would prove him wrong. He replaced the negative feelings and replayed it as a successful outcome to ensure he always had confidence when approaching the final putt in a tournament situation.\n\nAlthough the steps described above may seem like a lot of work, in truth, they only take seconds. Remember that poor swings will produce poor results, but at a deeper level, a poor swing could be the result of fear, bad memories and\/or timidness. A post-shot routine is every bit as important as the pre-shot routine and incorporating one into your game will not only help you build mental toughness and golfing self-forgiveness, it will help you excel at the game.\n\nWhen used correctly, training aids can be a great way to develop a specific skill or movement in your golf swing. Practicing with the right training aid reduces the learning curve and gets you on your way to a better swing. Below are three of our favorites for fixing some of the most common swing faults we see.\n\nPower Leg Coil \u2013 A lower body sway, where the weight shifts outside the trailing leg, is a common problem for many golfers. This fault often leads a reverse pivot and makes it difficult to shift your weight properly in the downswing. To get a feel for the proper pivoting action in the backswing we often use the Power Leg Coil. This training aid makes it nearly impossible to sway, by replacing the incorrect leg action with the desired pivoting motion of the trailing leg. Not only is the Power Leg Coil an effective tool for reducing your sway, but it also fits easily in your golf bag and can be used on the driving range or at home as part of your between-lesson practice schedule.\n\nSwingyde \u2013 The Swingyde can be used to establish the correct amount of wrist hinge, eliminate poor clubface position at the top, create lag in the downswing and produce proper forearm rotation in the follow through. That's a lot for a simple little device that attaches to any golf club! The Swingyde can be used indoors, or as you practice on the range or in our practice bays. The feedback provided by the Swingyde is immediate and simple to interpret; make the correct move and the Swingyde connects to the forearm of your lead arm. Make the wrong move and you'll know right away from the resulting lack of connection.\n\nPower Angle \u2013 If you struggle with keeping your arms extended and away for your torso at the top of your swing, the Power Angle may provide the cure you're looking for. This unusual looking device starts with a molded grip and encourages an early wrist hinge and extended lead arm at the top. Once you've mastered the top position, the Power Angle helps get your trailing elbow down and in front of your right hip at impact, leading to a more powerful release of the club and more distance.\n\nSo if you're looking for a new way to tackle that nagging swing fault that refuses to go away, ask your Coach about these and the many other training aids found in your local GolfTEC Improvement Center.\n\nI'm often asked how long someone has to practice a certain change before we can officially consider it \"changed.\" I've discovered that the best answer is that it completely depends on how you practice. Many studies have concluded that in order to change a learned motion (like those in a golf swing), anywhere from eight to ten thousand correct repetitions are necessary. While that number may sound daunting, it can be lowered significantly by over-correction, or exaggerating a desired motion.\n\nExaggerate the desired motion\n\nFor example, if you and your Coach are working on shortening your top position to gain more consistency with your contact and shot dispersion, you may find that what you feel often doesn't coincide with how long your swing actually is. In this instance, it is effective to challenge yourself to make swings that are well short of the desired position. Most likely, you'll find that if you're able to develop a feel for where that shorter point is, making the change becomes much easier and requires less time.\n\nWhere to practice\n\nThis brings us to the key point of where you practice. I recommend that all my students allocate a considerable amount of their practice time to in-bay practice for most changes. For some, the absence of ball flight can be a tough hurdle to get over. However, once you begin to let go of the result and start to focus more on the process, you tend to discover that your swing not only changes more quickly, but it often does so with less frustration! Very few of us are able to hit the necessary number of poor shots on the range without reverting back to what is comfortable (i.e. incorrect) in order to see better short-term results. Hitting in a controlled environment\u2014with cameras that can pick up every motion in your swing and allow you to play them back in slow motion\u2014allows you to focus on the process and helps you make the connection between what you feel and what you do.\n\nIn the end, your pace of improvement relies on many factors: how much time you devote to making a change, how you attempt to make that change and where you attempt to make that change are just a few. It only makes sense to stack the odds in your favor and do it in an environment that caters to utilizing your time in the most effective manner possible, doesn't it? As we enter the off-season in many regions, the next three to four months offer the opportunity to make effective, long-term swing changes that will stay with you for years to come. I suggest working with your Coach to develop an off-season practice regimen (if you don't already have one) and sticking to it in the coming months. When next season starts, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Stroke play\n\nStroke play is a scoring system for golf (compare to match play). Another term for stroke play is medal play. Stroke play is the scoring system for the vast majority of professional golf tournaments. (For a notable exception, see The INTERNATIONAL.)\n\nIn stroke play, players record the total number of strokes taken in the entire round of golf. The lowest total score wins. Players' scores are usually reported in relation to par for easier comparison with other golfers' scores. For example, a player whose score is three strokes over par after a given hole would appear as \"+3\" on the scoreboard.\n\nIf players are tied after the regulation number of holes in a professional tournament, there is a playoff between all tied players. The playoff is a pre-determined number of holes (anywhere from a single hole to a full round). If players remain tied after the playoff then play continues in sudden death format, with the first player to win a hole outright winning the tournament.

{"text":"A Lesson On Learning\n\nHow to be a good student at your next golf lesson\n\nBy Barry Goldstein, Photos By Warren Keating\n\nWhy is it that some golfers improve dramatically and rapidly while others, no matter what they do, fail to advance beyond the level of novice? As a golf instructor who has given more than 10,000 golf lessons over the past eight years, I'm here to tell you why: Achieving successful results from a golf lesson begins and ends with you, not the instructor. An effective golf instructor can only do so much and is only as good as the student allows him or her to be. Hence, the first step to becoming a better golfer begins with becoming a better student.\n\nPlay First The next time you schedule a lesson, try to play nine or 18 holes before your session with the pro. This will not only help you feel more relaxed and comfortable, but will also help you gauge what part of your game needs improvement. One of the most common mistakes golfers make is not doing enough between lessons to make their next session productive. Remember, golf lessons are supposed to help you improve your game, and without enough time on the course, all the lessons in the world won't help a bit.\n\nThe Bad Tell me if this sounds familiar: You roll into the golf course parking lot one minute before the lesson, or even late, with no time available for stretching or warm-ups. Upon arriving at the practice tee, you immediately pull the driver from your bag and begin taking monstrous full swings. You're stressed out from work, and the traffic didn't help. During the lesson, you inform the instructor that you \"can't\" change your grip or swing because it's \"uncomfortable.\" You perform prescribed drills in front of the teacher, but never on your own. You demand instant improvement and, frankly, you talk often and listen little.\n\nThe Good Unfortunately, many students resemble the one described above. These circumstances cause too many distractions and make quality time with a golf instructor less effective than it could be. The solution? Well, let's start by looking at students who do the right thing when receiving lessons.\n\nMost successful students arrive early. They begin their warm-ups before the scheduled lesson time. They stretch, hit some wedge shots and work their way through the bag. They leave stress in the parking lot and know that for the next 30 to 60 minutes, they aren't going to challenge any preconceived notions or feelings about their golf swing. Instead, they'll be open and receptive to trying new things.\n\nThey bring a notebook to record important points made during the lesson. They inform the instructor of their golf history and with what parts of the swing they tend to struggle. They maintain a positive attitude throughout the lesson.\n\nGood students are willing to experiment and work to change flaws. They never say \"can't\" and, more importantly, they know that improvements are the result of not only careful instruction, but also diligent practice. They work on drills that will continue to shape a correct swing long after the lesson. They listen much more than they talk.\n\nSuccessful students know that to get better, they may need to make some \"uncomfortable\" changes, but they continue to practice, knowing that these changes will help them improve in the long run. Rather than getting frustrated, they simply understand that it's change that's most important."}

{"text":"Finding Your Balance In Golf\n\nTo create a golf swing that produces both consistency and power, you must maintain balance throughout the entire swing. The key to achieving balance is to set yourself up with your weight centered over the balls of your feet. By doing this, your legs will feel lively and ready for action.\n\nMany golfers make the mistake of setting up with their weight on their heels, thereby locking their lower bodies into a stationary position, not ready to make an athletic move.\n\nHere is how to find your proper balance point: Standing tall with your feet spread apart shoulder width, bend forward at the hip joint and allow your rear to move slightly back. At this point, your knees may be slightly locked. Now flex the knees slightly; this will allow your hands to hang in line with your chin and place your weight naturally onto the balls of your feet.\n\nWhere you bend is crucial to finding your balance. It should not be a feeling like that of sitting down on a barstool; this would cause the weight to move back onto your heels. Practice finding your balance just a couple of minutes a day and it will start feeling very natural."}

{"text":"Play Golf the Pebble Beach Way: Lose Five Strokes Without Changing Your Swing\n\nMost golfers agree that the game is more mental than it is physical. The average golfer spends too little time learning how to \"play the game.\" Playing the game means understanding your shot tendencies and accurately predicting what the ball is going to do after you strike it. It\"s not about changing your swing mid-round or trying out the latest band-aid-it\"s about playing smart with the swing you already have.\n\nIn Play Golf the Pebble Beach Way, Laird Small, Director of the Pebble Beach Golf Academy, guides you through the 18 holes of the Pebble Beach Golf Links as if he was on your bag, teaching you how to improve your score by changing your mental approach to the game and answering key questions such as:\n\n\u2022How do you manage first-tee jitters? \u2022What questions should you ask yourself before every approach shot? \u2022How do you read tricky lies and get out of trouble? \u2022How can you think like an architect? \u2022How do you bounce back after a bad hole?\n\nSmall shares anecdotes and lessons he learned from some of the greatest champions in golf-including Nicklaus, Watson, Palmer, Miller, and Woods-and how they navigated their way around this storied course. From Nicklaus\" famous 1-iron to the 17th green at the 1972 U.S. Open to Watson\"s remarkable chip-in on the same hole 10 years later, you\"ll hear their stories as well as how these legends pulled off each shot, and what they were thinking.\n\nAfter reading Play Golf the Pebble Beach Way, golfers will not only be ready to play Pebble Beach, they\"ll have the tools necessary to shoot their lowest scores ever without having to wade through hundreds of complicated terms and swing details. The book teaches golfers how to play better golf using their own authentic swing while having more fun doing it.\n\nAUTHOR Laird Small has been the Director of the Pebble Beach Golf Academy since 1996 and is one of the country\"s most highly respected instructors.

{"text":"Ralph Kramden (of the old T.V. show, The Honeymooners) wrote down all of his weaknesses and strong points in an attempt to better himself. The idea was to \"eliminate the weaknesses, and build up the strong points, making them stronger\". And while we're not concerned whether or not you can \"speak French\", (inside H.M. joke) it's important to write down what is costing you the most strokes on the course and focus on that area first.\n\nStart off by listing any shot the plagues your whole game. If you're a chronic-anything (slicer, hooker, dribbler, choker, whatever), write that at the top of your list and start there. See \"Learn to do the opposite\".\n\nIf you have an all around decent game, no consistent slice, hook, balloon ball etc, then you've got to dig a little deeper. Separate your game into category's according to your golf bag. 118 Golf Bags. Driver, fairway woods, long irons, short irons, wedges, and putter. Rate yourself from 1-10 on each. Keep in mind that the Driver, wedges and putter are probably your most used clubs. Give these extra weight when deciding what \"needs fixin'\" first.\n\nPay careful attention to the weight you place on your short game. This includes short pitches, chips, and putting. These shots account for at least half the strokes on your scorecard. Many don't practice these shots because practicing chipping isn't as satisfying as whacking the driver at the range. Keep in mind that practicing chipping can really be free. You can work on it at home, on the practice green before your round, etc. See The Short Game for tips and practice strategies\n\nLook in quick fixes first, to see if you may be doing something so fundamentally wrong that you can shave strokes with one easy correction. .\n\nLook through the articles in the ISAG instructional area, focus on your problem area first, but eventually take a peak at the other areas. You may find some ideas that you hadn't thought about in the way of practice etc.\n\nNo matter what your skill level, check out the mental game area. The mental approach is MORE important then any other aspect of golf. The mental game includes not just strategy, but staying in the moment, letting bad shots go, the ability to focus on the green and not the water in front. It effects the way you practice and play.

{"text":"April 08, 1957\n\nSummary And Review\n\nAnd second\u2014I hope that this series will serve as a body of knowledge that will lead to further advances in our understanding of the golf swing. Every year we learn a little more about golf. Each new chunk of valid knowledge paves the way to greater knowledge. Golf is like medicine and the other fields of science in this respect. In another 15 years, just as there will be many new discoveries in medicine based on and made possible by present-day strides, we will similarly have refined and extended our present-day knowledge of golf. A golfer, as I see it, has 15 or 20 really productive years\u2014years in which his efforts to realize his full potential as a golfer lead him to speculate about and experiment with every phase of technique, continuously and intensively. He can only find out so much. There are only so many days in a week and only so much daylight in a day. Had I, as a young man starting out in professional golf in 1931, known then what I have managed to learn by 1957 and been able to start my experimentation at this more advanced point, I would have been privileged to have possibly made more advanced contributions during my best productive years. Other younger men will have that immense pleasure and privilege.\n\nI was thinking the other day, \"What a long time I have been learning about golf!\" I must have been about 13 when I started to work on my game conscientiously. I was caddying then at the Glen Garden club in Fort Worth, and I took a member named Ed Stewart as my model. A very fine amateur, Stewart was a workingman who couldn't afford to play too often, and none of the other boys wanted to become his regular caddy. That suited me fine. I caddied for him whenever he played and studied his swing and his shotmaking technique closely. Then I'd go and compare my swing with his and try to improve mine by copying certain of Stewart's movements that were obviously correct and desirable.\n\nThe first really important change I effected was the action of my left knee. Mine used to shoot straight out when I took the club back. Ed Stewart's knee, I noticed, broke in nicely to the right. I practiced correcting my knee action on the lawn at home until there was no lawn left. In the neighborhood where our family lived, each of the houses had a small lawn that was separated from the others by hedges. The grocery store was about six houses or six lawns away. Whenever my mother sent me to the store for a loaf of bread or a pound of butter or whatever it was, I never walked to the store, I always played to it, sometimes chipping from one lawn to the next, sometimes setting the lawn two or three hedges away as my \"green,\" sometimes hitting to the farthest \"green\" with a full nine-iron shot\u2014all the time checking my left knee action or whatever phase of my swing I was working on. I doubt if my practice improved the looks of the neighborhood, but it was awfully good for my game.\n\nIn golf, you know, you learn some things very early and other things surprisingly late. For example, take just three of the several elements I now regard as absolutely fundamental to any and every good swing: the proper waggle, the proper hip turn, and the proper backswing plane. I came to understand the value of the waggle comparatively early: I was just starting to follow the circuit in 1932 when I learned from observing Johnny Revolta and talking with him that this genius of the short game geared himself for the different demands of each shot around the greens by modifying his waggle to suit that particular shot. Say he had to pop the ball over a bunker and have it put on the brakes immediately. He'd waggle with sharp, staccato, jabby strokes, a \"coming attraction\" of the stroke he'd use to clip the ball the way it had to be clipped to produce maximum bite. Or say he was pitching the ball to land on a selected point on a slippery green and was going to let the ball trickle the rest of the way to the cup down a side slope. He'd gear himself then with delicate, little pencil-stroke waggles that seemed to be all finger tips. And so on and on\u2014an individual waggle for each different chip shot in his marvelous repertoire. It struck me that it would be a very intelligent thing to use this method of Johnny's not only for my short shots but to adapt it also for my full shots. I began to do so immediately.\n\nNot long after this\u2014in the middle 1930s, I would say\u2014I got the correct hip-turn action clear in my mind, mainly from studying newsreel movies of the best golfers in action. It wasn't until 1938, though, that I grasped the concept of the plane. I'd been thinking sporadically about the plane for some time before that, examining the plane on which the batter swings in baseball and making some tentative suppositions about the golfer's plane. Yet it wasn't until I really began to worry about the unreliability of my back-swing that I was driven to conduct a serious investigation of the plane. Long before I fully understood what the plane did for you and why it worked out that way, I realized that I had hit on something of tremendous significance for me. On the winter circuit, as we traveled from tournament to tournament, I would be up in my hotel room night after night studying my backswing plane in the full-length mirror, trying to memorize it so well I would instinctively swing back the same way time after time.\n\nIn the seasons before the war, as I learned more and more about the golf swing and how to play golf, I enjoyed increasing success on the tournament circuit. Nevertheless, I never felt genuinely confident about my game until 1946. Up to that year, while I knew once I was on the course and playing well that I had the stuff that day to make a good showing, before a round I had no idea whether I'd be 69 or 79. I felt my game might suddenly go sour on any given morning. I had no assurance that if I was a little off my best form I could still produce a respectable round. My friends on the tour used to tell me that I was silly to worry, that I had a grooved swing and had every reason to have confidence in it. But my self-doubting never stopped. Regardless of how well I was going, I was still concerned about the next day and the next day and the next.\n\nIn 1946 my attitude suddenly changed. I honestly began to feel that I could count on playing fairly well each time I went out, that there was no practical reason for me to feel I might suddenly \"lose it all.\" I would guess that what lay behind my new confidence was this: I had stopped trying to do a great many difficult things perfectly because it had become clear in my mind that this ambitious over-thoroughness was neither possible nor advisable, or even necessary. All you needed to groove were the fundamental movements\u2014and there weren't so many of them. Moreover, they were movements that were basically controllable and so could be executed fairly well whether you happened to be sharp or not so sharp that morning. I don't know what came first, the chicken or the egg, but at about the same time I began to feel that I had the stuff to play creditable golf even when I was not at my best, my shot-making started to take on a new and more stable consistency. THE BASIS FOR THIS PROGRESS, LET ME REPEAT, WAS MY GENUINE CONVICTION THAT ALL THAT IS REALLY REQUIRED TO PLAY GOOD GOLF IS TO EXECUTE PROPERLY A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF TRUE FUNDAMENTAL MOVEMENTS.\n\nNow that we have gone into the swing, stage by stage, from the grip to the finish, I think it would be extremely instructive to \"wind the swing back\" and see what are the key fundamental actions a golfer performs to move correctly from one position to another.\n\nTo begin with, what does a golfer do to arrive at the correct position at the finish of his swing?"}

{"text":"How To Handicap Golf\n\nBy: Kathryn Gierok\n\nBreak Studios Contributing Writer\n\nBy keeping some basic guidelines in mind, you can learn how to handicap golf. Handicapping golf is a process by which the difficulty of a course is equalized for players of different skill level. Make sure to obtain the proper handicap in order to be an effective player.\n\nObtain your USGA handicap index score for the course on which you are playing. This determines how many shots over par you typically take an a course rated as being of average difficulty. Be aware that each hole on the golf course will be rated between one and eighteen, with one being the most difficult hole and eighteen the easiest. Likewise, your handicap will indicate your skill level--if you are given a fifteen handicap and your opponent an twelve, he is expected to shoot three strokes better than you.\n\nCommunicate with your opponent about your handicap level. In the example given, your opponent should allow you three extra strokes to be at the same point that he is. If it takes him three strokes to complete the hole and you six strokes, you are still even.\n\nBreak the number of handicap strokes up appropriately according to the golf course. In the example given, you will receive only three strokes more than your opponent over the entire eighteen holes, so it is essential that you save the extra shots for the most difficult holes. Using the extra shots when they aren't needed will be of no use to you in the long run."}

Glancing at the boy's swing, I would classify him as a beginner. I overheard the pro telling the youngster and his dad that his clubface was too closed at the top of his swing. Walking to my lesson I kept asking myself, \"Do I keep things simple for my students . . . especially children?\"\n\nWhen teaching children or even beginners, we can often over-complicate things. Many of us speak a language very few understand. Swing plane, clubface angle, forearm rotation and spine angle are everyday terms in our world, but not many students know what they mean or how it applies to them. Most people do not like to ask questions or admit they don't know what we are talking about. When you ask a student if they understand you, they usually say yes.\n\nFor me, I like to make sure we are on the same page. I will ask them to demonstrate what they think I am telling them to do. This opens the communication line and also shows me as their teacher whether my style or word choice is being comprehended. Students get excited when they demonstrate a proper drill or idea; they are engaged and their confidence builds.\n\nWith children, keep is simple. Have kids figure out how to hit the ball high or low, bump a shot through the fringe, and keep it fun. As children develop and understand the game, you can begin to discuss more technical terms with them. Don't forget: This form of simple communication should also be directed towards the parents. In the beginning, perfect swing mechanics are the least of things with which young players should be concerned. Our job is to help people enjoy the game, not bog it down with terms students they don't understand.\n\n]]> LESSONS\n 06 Jun 2013 16:58:17 +0000Thomas Wartelle, USGTF Level IV Member lessons require more planning, a more expanded practice facility, and a different method than one-to-one instruction.

Safety instructions must be emphasized before the students get golf clubs in their hands:\n\n\u2022 Only swing clubs in designated hitting areas and bays. Never swing a golf club until you have cleared your swing space. Do this by looking around you in all directions and testing the space for backswing and forward swing to see that no person or object interferes.\n\n\u2022 Never walk up behind someone who is poised to swing\n\n\u2022 Never swing a club toward someone as it could slip from your hands.\n\n\u2022 Never walk out in front of the hitting line to recover a ball, tee, or for any other reason.\n\nFor greater impact, do not just preach these precautions, but demonstrate them at all times. Use a partner \/ teacher system for more effective instruction. Pair the students so that while one is performing the other is observing (caddy system).\n\nGive brief, simple instructions the students can apply and practice for a few minutes, then bring them back for the next step. Keep the explanation and demonstration brief. Break this up several times in the lesson to allow for application, practice, and correction. It is important to not get involved with one student longer than the others. Individual help is necessary, but it should be brief so that others are not neglected. Time management is paramount when teaching groups.\n\nThese tips will go a long way to furthering your teaching ability as a professional.\n\n]]> THIS YEAR'S US OPEN TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT MODERN GOLF?\n 04 Jun 2013 14:11:53 +0000Mike Stevens, USGTF Level Ill Member people in golf believe that the distance people are hitting the golf ball these days is detrimental to the game.

Yet, the governing bodies don't seem to be overly concerned about it. Even though they acknowledge that the pros are hitting the ball farther, they counter with statements that the scoring has not changed very much. Rarely do they point to the fact that golf courses have gotten much longer to offset yardage gains.\n\nThis year could have been a perfect opportunity to compare just how much modern equipment has changed the game, or not. The US Open is being played at the Merion Golf Club in Ardmore, Pennsylvania. In all previous Opens, the course ranged from 6,480 yards to 6,550 yards. That is what Merion played to in all previous Opens from Bobby Jones to David Graham. The opportunity to compare has been lost, as for this year's tournament, the course has been lengthened to just under 7,000 yards.\n\nRarely in this day and age do professional tournaments play on courses under 7,200 yards. Remember when the 600-yard hole at Firestone was considered a brute? Players reach this hole in two now, and some with irons. If equipment and balls have not mattered, then why the need to keep adding yardage? The only way to determine the true effect is to play on a course exactly as it was built. That won't be the case, however, this year when there was a perfect opportunity to do so. Instead, we'll get an altered layout with overgrown rough, and in the end, they will say the distance issue is a moot point.\n\nOh yeah, and the moustache painted on the Mona Lisa looks real good too.\n\n]]> PROBLEM WITH TOO MUCH BOUNCE ON A WEDGE\n 06 May 2013 20:14:38 +0000James Douris, USGTF Level III Member of the biggest faults I see in intermediate and advanced golfers in their short games is they create too much lag in their pitching and chipping swings.

That is, they lead with the hands too much and the clubhead lags behind. This usually stems from a powerful swing which compresses the ball. This golfer often struggles with touch around the greens and often struggles with taking too big of a divot.\n\nThe problem I see stems from the selection of wedges that they are using. I teach my students to use low-bounce wedges, which help to get the leading edge under the ball without having to lead with the wrists. Leading with the hands through impact creates a low punchy style of a shot that is often inconsistent, and runs out too much and creates usually quite a deep divot. By using wedges with less bounce, the golfer can play the ball farther forward in their stance, open the face slightly, and use a smooth \"armsie\" swing and still get the leading edge under the ball without hitting it skinny or driving the leading edge deep into the ground. It is important, when playing the short game this way, that the clubface is fractionally open, and the ball is played up in the stance. If we open the face on a high-bounce wedge, the leading edge is raised too high off turf, and we will run the risk of hitting it skinny or be forced to hit down on the ball too much. this leads to getting too steep, creating a lower-than-desired shot that relies on spin and a good bounce.\n\n]]> WE CAN LEARN FROM ADAM SCOTT\n 06 May 2013 16:46:33 +0000Cole Golden, USGTF Level IV Member year's Masters tournament provided a lot of great lessons we can learn from and teach our students.

The one that stands out the most in my mind is the patience that the winner, Adam Scott, exemplified during his final round. Patience is something many of us preach to our students, or even try to work on in our own game, but it is more difficult to integrate than other skills.\n\nDuring the final round, Scott began his round with a bogey on the first hole. His demeanor walking off the green was very calm; one couldn't tell if he made a par or worse. He parred the next hole, which is a par-5 that many players think is a birdie hole. Again, he walked off the green very calm, not upset for making par. Many players, including yours truly, start to press if they feel they are falling behind the leaders. Scott kept calm and birdied the next hole.\n\nHe then parred the next nine holes in a row, missing many makeable birdie putts. His conduct never changed. He stayed patient, knowing that he was hitting the ball well and that the putts would start to all. If he would have started to press his game when he was not making birdies, he would have started to put more pressure on his ballstriking, possibly resulting in poor execution and possibly some bogeys.\n\nScott made three birdies on the last six holes, eventually winning in a playoff. His patience and calm demeanor allowed him to take advantage of great shots and not get in his own way, winning his first major. It took me a long time to learn how to play this way. I would always feel that missing short putts or not making birdies meant that I was falling behind the leaders. Tournament golf is a long process. You must stay patient and let the good scores come to you.\n\n]]> IMPORTANCE OF BALL POSITION AND STANCE WIDTH\n 03 May 2013 19:28:42 +0000Thomas Wartelle, USGTF Level IV Member position and stance width are two key fundamentals that can have a great effect on a golfer's impact position.

The following data is an average of the measurements for these positions from over 100 Tour players. How do you measure up?\n\nBall Position\n\nFor the driver, the ball is positioned directly in line with the lead foot instep.\n\nThe ball slightly moves progressively back in the stance with each club.\n\nFrom the driver to the 9-iron, the ball moves back 2.7 inches for Tour professionals.\n\nFor individuals with extremely wide stances, the ball can move slightly further back but not more than 5 inches or past the center point.\n\nStance Width\n\nThe stance width with a 5-iron should be shoulder width.\n\nThe driver stance is the widest, with averages near 2 inches outside of the shoulders for each foot.\n\nThe 9-iron stance is 2 inches narrower than each shoulder.\n\nThe lead foot is opened toward the target (flared) 25 degrees.\n\nDistance from the ball\n\nThese are measurements with standard clubs from the end of the lead foot (toe) to the center of the ball. Excessively large or small foot size can change this slightly. The average foot size is 11.\n\nProper distance from the ball (toe to center of the ball) is dictated mostly by length of club.\n\nThis distance can also be affected by numerous body characteristics, including height (taller = closer), shoulder and hip width (narrower = closer), arm length (shorter = closer), and foot size (larger = closer). The reality is that most people will fall between these tolerances. Height, arms, hips, and foot size only have a slight effect on distance.\n\nThe driver distance (45- to 46-inch driver) is between 32 to 36 inches from the ball (pro average: 33 to 34 inches)\n\nThe 5-iron distance is between 22 to 26 inches (average 24 inches).\n\nThe 9-iron distance is between 18 to 22 inches (average 22 inches)\n\nFor every inch in length of a golf club, there is a .5 inch (1\/2 inch) difference in distance.\n\n]]> BETTER GOLF IS UP TO YOU\n 03 May 2013 18:09:21 +0000Mike Stevens, USGTF Level Ill Member \u2026 Continue reading \u2192\n\n]]>In again. It seems like each season there is a new theory on how to do something that people have been doing for hundreds of years.\n\nIt is often easy to become over-reliant on the words of a golf teacher to the point of forgetting that golf requires time and repetition. Not to say that a teacher isn't relevant, but understand that the teacher\/student relationship is really a journey in self-discovery. Unfortunately, golfers good and bad will try anything that even hints at being the one thing that they think will quickly make them better. If it is on the cover of a magazine or a 30-second spot on TV, a note to self is recorded and off to the range one goes. Many of my friends are like this, and probably yours, too: Eternal experimenters, quick-fix searchers, and generally on a path to failure.\n\nI am going to paraphrase from a recent article I came across in a popular golf magazine. Getting better at golf requires a deeply personal engagement. It is a subtle and difficult process that is always a mystery. In essence, what it comes down to is that golf is hard. When I contemplate that, I often recall the movie A League of their Own, when character Jimmy Dugan is told by his player that baseball is too hard, his response is classic: \"It's supposed to be hard. If it was easy, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great.\"\n\nWe should never forget that golf is a journey, a winding road with many ups and downs. There are guides to help along the way. In the end, however, it is up to you.\n\n]]> YOUR TALENT!\n 12 Apr 2013 17:30:21 +0000Thomas Wartelle, USGTF Level IV Member golf teaching professionals, it is important to have highly developed technical knowledge and teaching skills.

However, we must be able to sell that skill (lessons) to be financially successful. Therefore, it is important to market yourself as a golf teaching professional. The USGTF provides numerous resources that are available from the National Office. Here are some often-overlooked points that will help you become a better and more successful instructor:\n\nYour professional experience and talent are valuable assets. Therefore, do not be afraid to sell your talents. Often, golf instructors charge too little for their time, talent, and experience.\n\nTry to sell a percentage of your lessons as a program such as group lessons. If you charge $75 per hour for an individual lesson but charge $30 per group lesson with 5 people per hour, you have now effectively doubled your income. The added benefit is group lessons often have more energy and dynamics. Be creative!\n\nNGF statistics show that 87% of golfers would play more golf and spend more money if they could play better. Yet, only 13% of golfers are taking regular lessons!\n\nInvest in your business and education. It is important to keep up to date with technology, training aids, and equipment. Equally as important is to continue your education by utilizing the vast resources that the USGTF and WGTF have to offer.\n\nAs an instructor, you should adapt and constantly evolve to the changing world. Use new and innovative marketing ideas in your kids' programs, ladies' golf clinics, and social events that combine golf and business. Try to keep up with effective forms of communications. Opportunities exist when you make an effort. Simple cost-effective ideas such as online social media, involvement in group activities, community clubs, parks and recreation, and volunteering for local schools can provide a great boost to your client base.\n\n]]> IS YOUR FRIEND\n 12 Apr 2013 17:05:44 +0000Arlen Bento, USGTF Level IV Member the spring season makes its way into many parts of the northern US and the Masters starts to loom on everyone's must-watch golf radar, I wanted to write about the new technology that has come out in the driver market for 2013. \u2026 Continue reading \u2192\n\n]]>As the spring season makes its way into many parts of the northern US and the Masters starts to loom on everyone's must-watch golf radar, I wanted to write about the new technology that has come out in the driver market for 2013. There are some really great new products from all the major manufacturers this spring, many with new technology that allows players to adjust their clubs to fit their games with changeable hosel and new weight systems. For many low-handicap players, the ability to adjust the clubhead just slightly can make a big difference in the shot patterns and launch angles of any new driver.\n\nAs many of you know, I make a living selling golf equipment, so I wanted to share with you some information that I have been finding though our demo days in South Florida.\n\nWatch your loft!\n\nWe have been finding that, with many of the new adjustable drivers, the goal has been to lower spin rates to get maximum roll on all drives. Lowering spin rates are great \u2013 if you get the ball in the air on the right launch angle. Many players have tried to lower their spin by using lower-lofted drivers. For many, lowering the launch angle too much can actually be detrimental.\n\nMy suggestion is that if you are thinking about getting a new adjustable driver this spring, find the one that works best for you on a launch monitor. Then, try to add at least 1.5 degrees of loft to the driver with the adjustable settings to see how it changes the characteristics of the ball flight.\n\nOnce you get your new driver, take it out to play nine holes on a course that you know pretty well with the club set on the standard position, and then on the back nine adjust the driver to have a higher loft. Pay close attention to the distance, launch of the ball, the ball, and the curvature of the shot. You may be surprised to see that the higher-lofted setting may help you game.\n\n]]> ALWAYS WORK!\n 12 Apr 2013 16:59:59 +0000Arlen Bento, USGTF Level IV Member the spring season makes its way into many parts of the northern US and Canada, players that have been dreaming of playing golf on their favorite courses are now getting really excited about the 2013 golf season.,, For \u2026 Continue reading \u2192\n\n]]>As the spring season makes its way into many parts of the northern US and Canada, players that have been dreaming of playing golf on their favorite courses are now getting really excited about the 2013 golf season.,,\n\nFor those of us that live in the Sun Belt, we have been in full golf season for almost six months and are starting to see our winter friends leave for their homes in the north.\nA few weeks ago, I started my middle-school golf program and was thrilled to have almost 30 young players show up for golf from grades 3 to 8. As we started out training programs, we were spending a lot of time on the chipping and putting greens working on our short games.\n\nOn one afternoon, as we made our way to the chipping green at our local public course, I noticed an older woman on the chipping green working on her short game. Now, what caught my attention is what she was doing. She had 10 balls and a 9-iron, and she was working her way around the chipping green hitting basically the same 25-foot chip from many different angles. She was terrific, chipping almost all of her shots to within a few feet of each hole. I watched her for about 5 to 10 minutes with the kids. I told all of them to watch what she was doing, and her fundamentals were outstanding.\n\nShe had a simple setup, narrow stance, weight forward, and open feet with an open hip. Her hands held the club softly but firmly, and each shot had that perfect little \"click\" as she hit each short firmly with a descending blow. The result: A little loft, hop and roll right next to the hole.\n\nMy lesson to the kids as we were watching this exhibition was that her fundamentals were outstanding and that her practice was simple and productive. I had to finally ask her about her game, and she was so gracious, said she had been a good player for a long time, over 60 years, and she has always practiced her short game with her 9-iron.\n\nShe felt that the shot she was practicing was the shot that she faced the most when she played. You could tell she was very good at the shot \u2013 fundamentals always work!"}
{"text":"Wednesday, April 10, 2013\n\nA couple of weeks ago I had the opportunity to speak to a new student who was purchasing a lesson package for the upcoming season. During our discussion, I was explaining how we were going to approach reaching his improvement goals. I am a firm believer that it takes more than a good fundamental golf swing to shoot low scores. I am convinced that a player must learn to SCORE and learning to score takes practice. If you have been reading my recent post about Practice Styles you understand that practice goes beyond learning a new technique. I have been pushing the importance of dynamic practice. This style of practice is heavily focused on improving what I will refer to as your SCORING SKILLS.\n\nDuring my conversation with the new student he agreed with my thoughts and told me that when he practices he does \"dinner bells.\" He had me curious - what are dinner bells and how do they help your golf score? He explained that his wife, along with the wife of his most frequent golf partner, often complained that they played too much golf. So to make up for their frequent absences from home, they invented a practice game to appease their wives. Every round the two gentleman play together, they count the number of strokes it takes them to put the ball in the hole from the time they have a wedge in their hand. For example, let's say that one of them has 100 yards to the green and hits a sand wedge, which he then hits on the green and takes two putts to complete the hole. This gives him a final dinner bell score of 3. What's the kicker? For every shot over 3, that person gets a \"dinner bell\" and is required to put $1 in the pot. At the end of the season, they total their \"dinner bells\" and take their wives to dinner. What a brilliant idea!\n\nThis guy was performing exactly the type of practice that I find so important but rarely witness. It is important to note that there are lots of creative games one can play to benefit their game. I would encourage you to invent your own or feel free to ask me and I will pass on a few ideas. If I were you I would have a variety of games in your arsenal, that work on all facets of practice: putting, chipping, and long game. Invent games that you can play on your own or with friends. Another important thing to do is track your results. Write them down and compare over time. Share these games and the results with your instructor; this information will identify weaknesses and set priorities in your improvement game plan. Pay special attention to them as you make a change, not the changes before and after the change in technique. I find it important to track improvement progress in more than just the total score on the scorecard. In the case of my new student, if I can get him to lower his \"dinner bells,\" I'm certain his scores will follow and he will reach his improvement goals. His wife may not be happy, but I will accomplish my job of making him the golfer he wants to be.\n\nAs always, let me know if you have any questions or if I can help you create your own \"dinner bells.\" If you found this information helpful, I invite you to use the share buttons below. Thanks for reading and see you on the lesson tee!!\n\nMonday, March 25, 2013\n\nI am excited to announce my new partnership with eGolfplan.com. I will be recommending this comprehensive tool to all of my students to allow us to easily create their own Improvement Game Plan. I have used this blog in the past to stress the importance of a developing a game plan with real and achievable goals:\n\nThis new tool will allow those students who truly want to be on the fast track to improvement to SET, TRACK, and EVALUATE those goals. The beauty of this partnership is that any of my students registering for the eGolfplan service will be able to add me as their coach; that way, their data will be visible to me and I can add information from our lessons and design a CUSTOM IMPROVEMENT PLAN for each student. The best part is that we can track that plan and measure our success. My hope is that through the combination of my coaching and the eGolfplan system, each student will have a clear image of where they are headed as a player. This will allow them to commit to their improvement and success!\n\nThe fee to add eGolfplan and accelerate your improvement process is $39.95 for the first year, and $29.95 for each subsequent year. I invite you to check out the eGolfplan.com website for detailed information on what's include with the service. I feel this performance tool is a reflection of my beliefs on what it takes to achieve success on the golf course. It is easy to talk about a game plan and practice recommendations, but the ability to reference that information and track the progress is invaluable. Using eGolfplan makes the game-planning process simple.\n\nTo register for your own account visit  and select sign up under the Individual Plan. Once registered, follow these 3 simple steps to add me as your coach:\n\n1. Log on to egolfplan account 2. Go to Coaches Tab 3.

The post gave insight into some of the do's and don'ts when using the different styles. I highly suggest reading that post before continuing on with this one. The purpose of this post is to further detail the when and why to use each strategy and as well as how to create your PROPER PRACTICE PLAN.\n\nBLOCK PRACTICE\n\nWhen: Working on changes to swing technique. Typically used when trying to master a new skill and after instruction. Often times performed with swing drills.\nWhy: Block practice calls for slow and full speed repetition, which is perfect for learning moves that are unfamiliar to golfer. It is done so golfer can focus on only the change in technique because the lie, the target, and the distance are constant. Unlike conditions faced during a normal round of golf.\n\nDYNAMIC PRACTICE\n\nWhen: Performed when training for competiton on the course. Dynamic practice should be done when no adjustments to technique are taking place. Simulating on-course situations is ideal for dynamic practice.\n\nWhy: During dynamic practice there is constant changes to target, lie, and distance. This will help simulate the actual happenings on the course and better prepare the player when faced with evolving situations on the golf course.\n\nDevelop your own PRACTICE PLAN\n\nNow that we know the difference and understand why they should be separate, it's time to make your PRACTICE PLAN. Developing an excellent practice plan may be the biggest thing that professional golfers and other high-level competitive golfers do differently than amateur players. I am sure you have heard of Tiger Woods having his game peak in time for a major. This can only be done with a proper practice plan.\n\nSTEP 1: Select the times that you want to shoot your lowest scores or what I will refer to as identify your \"personal majors.\"\n\nSTEP 2: Identify the weaknesses that hold you back from shooting those scores.\n\n-For this I would recommend teaming up with a golf professional who can coach you through the improvement process. The great thing about working with a professional is they will help you identify those weaknesses and prioritize which ones to address first. It is important to note when you want to play your best. That will play the biggest role in prioritizing what practice style should be used first.\n\nSTEP 4: Choose PROPER practice technique\n\n-Assuming we have plenty of time before your personal major, I would look to attack those areas that cost you the most strokes and require a change in technique. You now know when changing technique, you should use Block Practice and design a practice routine highly concentrated with that practice style. I personally believe that every practice session should have a mixture of both because it keeps practice fun. As the new technique is mastered, the percentage of block vs. dynamic practice will shift until it's mostly dominated by dynamic practice. These shifts should be timed with your personal majors and performance goals. It is critical to have your dominant practice style be dynamic practice immediately before competition. Use these dynamic practice opportunities to evaluate your change and see if it led to better performance results.\n\nSTEP 5: Repeat\n\n-Once you reach the next break before competition, it is time to reevaluate your weaknesses and identify those areas which require a change in technique and shift towards a routine dominated by block practice.\n\nI hope that you have a better understanding of how to practice and are ready to implement your own PERFECT PRACTICE PLAN. Please send me any of your questions and feel free to share this post by using the buttons below. Thanks for reading and I look forward to seeing you on the lesson tee!!\n\nMonday, January 21, 2013\n\nIt pains me to walk along the driving range and watch countless players hit mountains of golf balls with no purpose. I firmly believe practice makes perfect, but feel the saying should be adjusted to say PROPER practice makes perfect. What is PROPER PRACTICE? I would say any practice that helps you reach your improvement goals. After determining your goals (see Set Real Goals to Achieve Real Success) you need to implement a practice plan.\n\nToday, I want to talk about two different practice styles: block practice and dynamic practice. In a previous post, I instructed players on How to Practice when Playing Well. In that post I introduced the idea of dynamic practice, also known as random practice. In this post, I will introduce block practice and compare it to dynamic practice.\n\nBlock practice is most similar to the practice style used by the majority of golfers while using the driving range. The difference between the two is that with block practice, you have a PURPOSE. This style of practice should be implemented when making a change in your swing technique. Obviously, it is the style of practice I use when instructing most players that are new to my lesson tee. It is critical in this style of practice to master the technique you are working on and convert it into a SKILL. Players that are implementing block practice should make numerous rehearsal and slow motion swings. Often, a swing drill will be performed during block practice. Block practice is done slowly with little variety in club selection.\n\nDynamic practice, on the other hand, is different in that the club, target, and shot style can change on a swing-by-swing basis. Dynamic practice is very similar to play on the golf course. When teaching my players to use dynamic practice, I often have them simulate a round of golf as their practice. During your dynamic practice, you should NEVER be making an adjustment to your swing technique. It would be like a baseball pitcher trying a new pitch without first learning how to hold the ball to execute that pitch.\n\nIt's important to understand these two practices, but the most important thing is to know when and why to implement them. I'll cover this next time and help you develop the PROPER PRACTICE PLAN to reach your goals. Until then, please share this post using the buttons below and send me any of your comments and questions. Thanks for reading and see you on the lesson tee!!\n\nThursday, January 3, 2013\n\nIt's a new year. A time for resolutions, new goals, and excitement. I plan on doing a future post on goal-setting and making sure you carry out those golf-related resolutions, but before I do that I want to cover another topic that I am sure will help your game. I want to talk about EXPECTATIONS and making sure yours aren't affecting your game in a negative way. I am currently reading Golf is not a Game of Perfect by Dr. Bob Rotella. In Dr. Rotella's book, he discusses players accepting the results of their shots and evaluating them with reasonable and realistic expectations. This is great insight and something I see lots of players (including myself) struggle with every time they touch a golf club.\n\nWhat do I mean by reasonable and realistic expectations? I certainly do not mean that you should limit your ceiling and only expect the very least from yourself. I have never and will never subscribe to the mentality that if you set your goals low, you will never be disappointed. I believe the exact opposite, that the higher the goals the more motivated you can be. If you are a 20 handicap and want to make the PGA Tour, then I say \"GREAT, let's get to work.\" Does that mean that when this same 20 handicap is playing a round of golf I think he should get upset if he misses a green? Absolutely not! That individual does not have reasonable and realistic expectations. He is a 20 handicap and at his very best can hit 5 greens in any given round. Unfortunately, most of us are guilty of being this ridiculous. Let's be honest with ourselves and evaluate the expectations of our next shot with the real-time status of our golf games. That doesn't mean you can't hit all 18 greens, but in the scenario with the 20 handicap, let's first work on hitting 6 greens in a round. The worst thing anyone can do is berate themselves and deflate their confidence by expecting things that are not possible at the current time.\n\nPersonally, I have come to this realization about unrealistic expectations by coaching varsity girls' golf at Canal Winchester. The players on my teams create this superstar image of themselves by boasting about the scores they shoot in practice and what they plan to shoot in our next tournament. The problem with this is that when they are early in a round and not playing their best, they panic. They start to worry about what everyone will think and it only makes things worse. The problem is their expectations aren't realistic. They don't understand that it's extremely hard to shoot those low scores when the pressure's on. The only way to do this is to be patient and not panic. Be reasonable with what you expect and the results will follow.\n\nTo conclude, I challenge you to make this your first golf resolution of 2013. Set reasonable expectations before your round and before every shot. This will help your mental preparation and allow you to improve your course management. You will start to only hit shots of which you are capable, and most importantly, you will not let a poor shot ruin your round or your score. The best part is that you can adjust those expectations as your game improves, while you are on your way to reaching those lofty goals. I encourage you to share by using the buttons below. Thanks for reading and I look forward to seeing you on the lesson tee!!!\n\nSunday, December 9, 2012\n\nI'm sure most of you have heard by now that the USGA and R&A have released a statement which will adjust the rules of golf and essentially ban the use of anchored putters starting in 2016. Let's be clear, they are not completely banning the use of long putters. However, they are prohibiting the practice of anchoring those clubs to your person, a technique made popular by PGA Tour players like Keegan Bradley and Adam Scott. If you are unclear on the adjustment of the rule I invite you to look at the picture below to gain a greater clarification.\n\nNow that everyone understands the rule, I would like to share a few of my thoughts on what is becoming a very controversial issue. Let me start by saying that I am adamantly against this ban and feel that it undermines the effort to grow the game of golf. Those who support the ban argue that it gives those players implementing this style an unfair advantage over the players who do not use the anchored putter. I find this to be absolutely ridiculous because if that were the case, almost every player would use it. I will admit that players like Keegan Bradley have been able to achieve success that they otherwise may not have been able to without the anchored putter, but can't you say the same thing about traditional putting? Or even better yet, would today's modern player have been able to achieve his or her success without modern golf ball technology? This begs the question: why single out anchored putters?\n\nWhether you are involved in the golf industry or not I am certain you have seen the wide-reaching efforts to grow the game of golf. As a PGA Professional, I have worked diligently to assist in accomplishing this goal. This is why the anchored putter ban upsets me so greatly, because if allowing a player to anchor his putter will encourage one new player to keep playing the game, or allow one current player to enjoy the game more, or bring one frustrated player back to the game than it should not be banned. We should not allow our top 1% of players to dictate how 40 handicaps play golf. I've heard many fellow professionals argue that the anchored putter does not really help the amateur player, due to poor fitting or improper fundamentals, but if it helps just one then we have effectively grown golf. I will close with this one question: what is the downside to the best golfer in the world using a belly putter? I can't think of one thing.\n\nThanks for reading and sharing. I encourage you to share your thoughts and get the debate going. See you on the lesson tee!!!"}
{"text":"Ratings are a zero sum calculation so there cannot be any ratings inflation overall. It will be interesting to see how much the SSA gets depressed as a result of home course knowledge. While some players may be able to boost their rating a little bit, in the case of Ams, it means they may be somewhat over rated and have to play in a higher division on weekend tourneys. So no advantage other than bragging rights.\n\nIn the case of some local pros trying to boost their rating playing in leagues, that will just mean they may be over rated when traveling and playing in bigger events. That's just more rating points for the top guys like Feldberg and Avery to snap up at those events to bring the local pro's rating back to earth.\n\nIn summary, there are some elements that could boost some ratings and some that might depress them. But with the zero sum ratings calculation their net impact will be minimal overall."}

We all have our favorite players just as we have opinions so..\n\nDistance vs a good short game?\n\nDistance vs a good short game?\n\nFebruary 1, 2013 12:59 pm\n\nIt may be more flashy tho go out and pound 300-yarders off the tee, and who wouldn't like to have that ability, but the game is played from 100 yards and in. The ability to do what you want with the ball as you approach the green, and hole, is far more important in the game of golf. If you really analyze the games of touring professionals and regular-playing amateurs, you see that the most vast difference in their games comes on and around the greens. The phrase \"Drive for show, putt for dough\" definitely rings true.\n\nDistance vs a good short game?\n\nDistance vs a good short game?\n\nDistance vs a good short game?\n\nDistance vs a good short game?\n\nFebruary 2, 2013 9:04 am\n\nThanks for your input and views..this has been a subject of debate for quite some time and become even more so with the development of balls, clubs, shafts, etc. which certainly have helped more golfers improve their game..however golf isn't a game you can just \"buy\", it's a game of skill regardless of the era..now simply ask yourself one question which is currently a hot topic for all of those in and around professional golf..\n\nWhy would \"anchoring\" a putter be the one element in golf the powers that be are so concerned with they are trying to change the rules?\n\nWhen you know missing a 3 to 5 foot putt cost you the same whether you hit your drive 270 yards or 300, it's all about getting the ball in the hole with the least amount of strokes..\n\nthe really great players we've seen thru the years all played to their strengths and most worked to improve their weaknesses or manage their game in such a way as to avoid them as much as possible..\n\ncase in point..Nicklaus knew he wasn't all that great out of sand traps so he he managed his game accordingly..\n\nwhat we do know..great putters win tournaments and when we have seen Nicklaus, just as Tiger did, make key putts at a crucial point to win tournaments we tend to forget how good they had to putt to get to that point..\n\nThere's no question thru the years equipment, just as golf courses have changed the way players approach the game..it's still takes good putting regardless of driving distance!\n\nDistance vs a good short game?\n\nDistance vs a good short game?\n\nFebruary 2, 2013 9:49 am\n\nI know I am likely in the minority on this one, but here goes:\n\nI would take the long ball over the short game any day. Here are my reasons:\n\n1) Whether you are a good or bad short game player, the short game can still come and go. You can have an on\/off day or even an on\/off week. In contrast if you hit it long that is not likely to change.\n\n2) Long hitters have more opportunites. Of course this is up for debate on a case by case basis, but since we are debating long ball vs short game, I am assuming accuracy is viewed as relatively even for the purposes of the question at hand. Would you rather have a wedge, or a 7 iron into the green? Would you rather be putting for eagle, or pitching from 80 yds out? On a par 3 with a tucked pin would you rather have a short iron where you can actually fire at it, or a mid\/long iron where you have to bail out?\n\n3) Long hitters have more options. On a tight hole, they can chose to use an iron off the tee and not lose much - where as the shorter hitter may not have that option. Also on many holes trouble spots can simply be overcome by driving it over them, where as the shorter hitter has to deal with it.\n\nDistance vs a good short game?\n\nDistance vs a good short game?\n\nFebruary 2, 2013 12:06 pm\n\nHizzle, I'm sure a large # of amateurs would feel the same as you..that ain't all bad either!\n\nLet's use your #1 comment..actually driving just as putting can and does get as off as it does on..so both are instances of \"come and go\", therefore subject to change on any given day...however both involve trust and confidence which is always the key to consistency so it is equally debatable..\n\nWhich would you prefer not to lose consistency in..driving or putting?\n\nDistance vs a good short game?\n\nDistance vs a good short game?\n\nDistance vs a good short game?\n\nFebruary 2, 2013 1:08 pm\n\nI'd take a top notch short game over distance any day. Heck that's where I'm out anyway. Not playing as much anymore so the driver has gotten a little sideways but I'm still able to put up good scores because my short irons\/short game\/putting allow me too.\n\nThe only reason guys like Luke and Zach and a few others can compete is because they are deadly from 100 yards and in.\n\nThere's nothing more annoying than playing with a guy that crushes you while you hit it 30+ yards by him all day!\n\nFinally, some but by no means all long drive competitors are good golfers. A good number of them probably couldn't break 90 though. Why? Zero short game.\n\nDistance vs a good short game?\n\nDistance vs a good short game?\n\nFebruary 2, 2013 5:28 pm\n\nNoko,....I agree, but with some exceptions worthy of noting. Pin position and angle of your shot to the pin would affect my preference. If you are in the left rough, with a left pin that is behind a bunker, a shot from the left rough is about impossible to get the ball to stop on the green or near the hole.....whereas a good clean lie in the right side of the fairway, most times would be a much easier shot to get close, and hold the putting surface .......now, with the same lie in the left rough from a wedge distance to the hole and the pin in the back right side of the green, with plenty of green before the pin, I would definitely rather have a wedge from that rough, than a 6 iron from the fairway........just sayin' that some conditions ....pin location and angle to the flag and amount of green to work with....being some of those conditions, might make the 6 iron from a good lie and angle in the fairway, an easier shot to pull off......"}
{"text":"British Open History\n\nThe 2013 British Open\n\nBritish Open History\n\nTHE OPEN: THE \"ORIGINAL\" GOLF CHAMPIONSHIP\n\nThe Open Championship, as it is known throughout the British Isles, is the oldest and most revered of the golfing world's contests dating back to the first held Oct. 17, 1860 at the Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire, Scotland. Unlike the hundreds of tournaments staged throughout the world today attracting an international field, the very first Open was played by eight professional Scottish golfers. Willie Park beat Tom Morris by two strokes, carding a 174 after three rounds on the 12-hole course. The following year, the second Open welcomed eight amateurs joining the professional field of 10 golfers.\n\nUnlike the many cup-like trophies awarded today, the first 10 years of Open play awarded the winner a championship belt of red leather with a silver buckle. It took three Opens until a prize fund was established at about $50, split among the second through fourth-place finishers. The champion retained the belt for a year, handing it over to the next year's winner. During the fourth year, Tom Morris was awarded the first cash prize of \u00a36 for winning the tournament.\n\nThe belt was finally replaced after Tom Morris Jr. had a run of three championships in a row up through 1870. There was no contest in '71 and the Claret Jug was introduced as the Golf Champion Trophy in 1872, won by Morris Jr. The original jug was created by Mackay Cunningham & Company of Edinburgh. It cost \u00a330. Unfortunately, it wasn't made in time to be presented to Morris, but his name was already engraved when the 1873 winner, Tommy Kidd, collected it.\n\nThe original trophy \u2013 along with the original belt \u2013 went on display at the Royal and Ancient Club of St. Andrews. The one presented to the 2009 winner was first awarded to an American Walter Hagen, in 1928. Although the winner is required to return the jug before the next year's Open, all champions receive an exact replica to keep. Three other replicas exist \u2013 one on display at the British Museum and two more used for traveling exhibitions.\n\nThe Open's first champion \u2013 Tom Morris Jr. \u2013 had a short but successful career. He was credited with the first Open hole-in-one in 1868 at the 8th hole of Prestwick. He also has the distinction of carding a win with his father coming in second the same year. Also, Morris Jr. carded the first albatross, more commonly known as a double eagle, on the first hole during his 1870 win.\n\nUnlike the majority of today's professionals who tour for a living, the Open was populated by men who worked as greenkeepers, caddies or club makers supplementing their incomes in match plays throughout Scotland. By the end of the 19th century, the tournament evolved to 72 holes of play and attracted entrants from throughout Scotland and England. After suspended play during World War I, entrants from throughout the world set their eyes on the Claret Jug. Although champions usually hailed from the ranks of professionals, six amateurs earned the championship title; the last being American Bobby Jones, who won his third in 1930. The first American born champion was Walter Hagen who won in 1922.\n\nAmericans dominated the Open between the world wars, winning every year from 1924-1933. In fact, up to World War II, only one Frenchman, Arnaud Massey, along with a handful of Americans, were the only other nationalities to sport an Open champion other than Scotland and England. Sam Snead was the 1946 Open champion in the first year play after the Second World War.\n\nPost WWII found an increasing international blend of Open participants, including champions. Northern Ireland's Fred Daly won the year after Snead and South Africa's Bobby Locke carded his first win in 1949, again in '50 and his third in '52, going on to a fourth win in '57. Peter Thomsen was the first golfer from \"down under\" to claim the Claret Jug with his first of a three-year spree in 1954. The Australian carded three more Open wins in '55, '56 and '58.\n\nExploding onto the Open scene in 1959 was another champion from South Africa \u2013 Gary Player. He would join with some of golf's most revered names during the next quarter century allowing only one win to England \u2013 Tony Jacklin in 1969 \u2013 and one to Scotland's Sandy Lyle in 1985. During these years names like Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Lee Trevino, Seve Ballesteros and Tom Watson all carded multiple wins. Watson carried the Claret Jug home five times in this time period. In the next 10 years, Open play was dominated by Englishman Nick Faldo with three wins while Australian Greg Norman nailed two championships. Spain's Ballesteros carded a third Open win in 1988.\n\nThe Open was added as an official PGA tournament in 1995 with American John Daly crowned champion. In the nearly quarter century that has elapsed since Daly's win, Americans have dominated the leader board including the present number one rated golfer in the world, Tiger Woods, who won his first in 2000 and then carded back-to-back wins in 2005-6. 2007 and 2008 have seen the winner hail from the Irish Republic, P\u00e1draig Harrington taking home the cup both years 4:22"}
{"text":"Any golfer knows and appreciates the fact that to improve your game and have a swing that puts your ball down the fairway like the professionals you have to work at it. One of the most important aspects of a good golf swing is to work on increasing golf swing speed to add more power, distance, and accuracy. This may be perhaps the greatest tool for lowering your handicap and improving your game of golf on an individual basis. So how do you increase the speed of your golf swing? Most experts and professionals agree that you must exercise and physically work to raise your golf swing speed.\n\nThe first thing to do is learn some exercises that will condition your body to create a better and more powerful swing. You must be sure to eliminate stiffness when your walk out on the course. Just raising your club above your head and shoulders and swinging the club from side to side is not enough to loosen up. Do exercises that involve a side to side motion and create power and speed with your shoulders, arms, and hands. Any exercises along these lines will help to develop speed for your personal swing. If you are interested in learning how to increase golf swing speed be prepared to work at it on a physical approach."}

I've asked this question to a number of golfers, and judging from the various responses I've received, the answer isn't obvious.\n\nSo I decided to find out with a research project that combines my academic and golfing interests.\n\nUsing a unique dataset containing thousands of individual shots of amateur and professional golfers in regular and tournament play, I developed a method to analyze these and other questions related to the play of golfers of various skill levels.\n\nIt's probably not surprising that professional golfers are better than amateurs in every aspect of the game. But having a PGA Tour player putt for a single-digit handicap golfer would only help by about two shots per round. The short game accounts for less than two shots per round. And the sand game accounts for less than one shot \u2014 not enough to make a big difference in the overall score.\n\nHowever, the long game accounts for over nine shots in an 18-hole round \u2014 by far, the biggest contributor to scoring differences between pros and low-handicap amateurs.\n\nNow suppose we split the long game into two groups: tee shots on par-four and par-five holes, and all other shots over 100 yards. Long tee shots account for a four-shot difference per round, and the other long-game shots account for about five shots per round. Either group is more important than putting or short-game shots.\n\nWhy isn't putting more important? It's partially because the amateur golfer has almost 12 putts per round within 2.5 feet of the hole that are rarely missed, so having a pro hit those putts wouldn't help much. Of course, the difference in the number of putts taken is greater between pros and higher-handicap golfers \u2014 a difference that would be made greater by the very fast greens of the Masters Tournament.\n\nThe long game is more important because PGA players drive the ball about fifty yards farther and straighter than low-handicap amateurs.\n\nNow if I could only figure out how to drive the ball fifty yards farther.\n\nProfessor Broadie's research will be presented at the fifth World Scientific Congress of Golf in Arizona at the end of March and will be published in a proceedings volume. A PDF of the paper can also be downloaded here.\n\nComments\n\nby Fred Chung |\nMarch 19, 2008 at 11:50 AM\n\nVery interesting. It is counter to what I would have thought to be true. Perhaps that is because I average 4 putts per green and am a very very long ways from being a single-digit handicap golfer.\n\nby Nicholas Ricci |\nMarch 19, 2008 at 7:34 PM\n\nThis is a neat experiment and well-researched. I would argue that the short game, especially putting, is more important than the long game. As of March 16, 2008, Tiger Woods, the number one golfer in the World, was ranked Tied-140th on the PGA Tour in total driving (a combination of driving distance and accuracy averaged). He was, however, ranked number one in scrambling percentage. He makes par or better when he misses the green 75% of the time. Of the greens in regulation he missed, he saved par more than anyone else on Tour. The next closest person in scrambling percentage is Ryuji Imada at 70.45%. That means that out of 100 shots, Tiger saves five shots from the next closest competitor in scrambling. That is a lot on the PGA Tour! This is attributed to his amazing short game and putting, which was ranked 11th on Tour as of March 16, 2008. There is a reason Tiger has won his first four events in 2008. It is because even though he may not hit the ball his best everyday, his short game and putting save him, and that is what keeps him at the top. Just to point out, Bubba Watson is ranked first in driving distance, yet he is ranked 101st in the World (no offense at all, that is very good!). This just shows how driving distance and accuracy comes secondary to a great short game. Not everyone can hit the ball 300 yards and hit a 5 iron to 3 feet from 220 yards. However, everyone can have a good short game. That is what separates the Tour player from the high handicapper. If one wants to lower his handicap, he can make large strides by improving his short game. I am sure there are plenty of single-digit golfers that hit the ball a long way. However, I challenge you to find a scratch golfer with a bad short game and week putting.\n\nby Mark Broadie |\nMarch 20, 2008 at 10:07 AM\n\nFred wrote: \"Perhaps that is because I average 4 putts per green and am a very very long ways from being a single-digit handicap golfer.\"\n\nI can't believe you average 4 putts per green! It might seem like that, but I bet if you kept track of your putts, you'll see that your average is far lower. The research shows that long game differences are more significant than putting differences even between typical middle- and high-handicap golfers. However, these results for 'typical' golfers don't necessarily apply to particular individual golfers.\n\nNicholas makes a number of interesting comments. Tiger Woods is better than other PGA tour players in just about every aspect of the game. Part of the reason he has been doing so well these past few months is that he is hitting his drives straighter - his years of work with Hank Haney are paying off. It is rare that short hitters win on the PGA tour these days.\n\nIf you look at the results in the paper, it does show that between the top-half and bottom-half of PGA tour players, putting, short game, and long game differences are about equally important.\n\n\"If one wants to lower his handicap, he can make large strides by improving his short game.\"\n\nI agree completely. It may be impossible for us mere mortals to drive the ball in the same zip code as PGA tour pros. But improving our short game and putting are very realistic goals.\n\nby Po-Hsuan (Paul) Hsu |\nMarch 20, 2008 at 11:10 AM\n\nDear Professor Broadie,\nThis is Paul, previously the finance PhD students on 4th floor and an assistant professor in UConn now. Your research results are really inteeresting but also conroversial. Anyway, it gives us a good reason to keep working on long game in driving range. I will be back for commencement in May and look forward to chatting with you there again then.\n- Paul\n\nby Lucius Riccio |\nMarch 21, 2008 at 3:24 PM\n\nMark is right on the button. I have been studying this question for nearly 4 decades and my research supports his \"unpopular\" or \"unconventional\" conclusions. Putting is important but not in the same way tee-to-green play is. Of the 24 strokes that separate a 95 shooter and a 71 shooter, on average only 8 (one third) are putts and much of that difference is due to the 71 shooter being closer to the hole when it is time to putt, not absolute putting skill. Tee-to-green play is by far the strongest predictor of score. RIccio's (Simple) Rule is Score = 95 - 2* GIRs. Three greens break 90, 8 greens break 80 and 13 greens break 70. No other factor comes close in predicting score.\nA famous builder of golf courses (and tall buildings) has for years razzed me whenever I say putting is not nearly as important as tee-to-green play and my response to him is \"if putting is so important, why do you build 7,500 yard courses?\"\nBen Hogan said there are two games of golf, one in the air and one on the ground and any 9 year old can roll a ball on a carpet (his characterization.) He understood that the tee-to-green game separates the best from the rest.\nPutting is important (or seems important)because it determines your score for the hole. If you miss a putt, you must take at least one more stroke. If you miss a fairway, you still have a chance to avoid a \"lost\" stroke and as such you might not recognize the \"cost\" of that bad stroke, even over the long haul. So putting appears to be more important than it is. Of course if you have a 10 footer on the last hole to win a match, putting is critical. But why do you have a 10 footer instead of a 1 footer?\nAnother reason putting seems so important is that the handicapping system enables many matches to go to the final putt for a determination. Take away the handicapping system and see how many matches are won by the great putter who can't hit a green in regulation.\nFor more on the research behind my comments, I discuss these issues in my chapter in Johnny Miller's book \"Breaking 90\" and in several Golf Digest articles dating back to the mid-1980's and the World Scientific Golf Congress publications dating back to 1990. I also mention some of this in my article in the upcoming May 2008 Golf Digest.\nFull disclosure: I am a colleague of Mark's and a great admirer of his work. But the reason for that is I have had the pleasure of seeing his research in detail up close and can attest to his diligence and comprehensive approach to the study of this and other golf questions.\nI think his research will stand up to any scrutiny.\nLucius Riccio\nljr14@columbia.edu"}

{"text":"the course has an SSA for typical conditions you can use that to calculate ratings. That's what the EasyScorecard app uses to generate its ratings. I suspect the PDGA iThingie app works the same way. There is a formula to calculate SSA based purely on course length and foliage that works pretty well.\n\nBut the SSA also falls out of sanctioned competitive play in the ratings process. It's the score that would be rated 1,000 for a particular round. Here's a pretty gross explanation of that process (stolen from a PDGA message board post):\n\nTake a round of tournament golf, and average all the player ratings of 800+ rated competitors with at least 8 rated rounds in their history.\nSay you get an average of 950 out of them.\nNext average all of their scores for that round (assume 18 holes).\nSay you get an average of 53.\nThen for that round a 53 would be rated 950.\nFor SSA's in the general range of 48-53 you add or subtract ~10 ratings points per stroke, so 54 is 940-rated, 50 is 980-rated, and 48 is 1000-rated (and thus also the SSA)."}

As you can guess, a mulligan is not \"legal\" in the rules of golf. You are supposed to take the shot where it lands \u2014 good or bad. At some charity golf events, one can purchase mulligans as an additional fundraiser and since everyone is on the same page, it's OK. It's not OK to tap the ball onto the green with your toe or give it a toss from the other side of a tree."}

{"text":"A great drill that I use for teaching a student to feel a natural rotation and swing is to simply make some waist high baseball swings. get a feel for being fully extended at the position the ball would be. Notice how the right elbow bends into the body on the back swing and the left elbow bends into the body on the follow through.\n\nNow if you shift the plane of the swing so that the bottom of the arc is closer to the ground, say about ankle high. Notice that to shift the plane you had to bend at the waist a bit.\n\nIts very important to know where the butt of the club is in relation to your torso through out the swing. At address position the butt end of the grip is pointed just left of the navel on a right handed player. As the torso rotates in the back swing the club stays with the navel until the club is hinged up or set just past the toe line of the back swing. On the down swing the arm swing of the triangle must stay connected to the rotation of the torso so that the butt of the club can return to the navel at the bottom of the arc.\n\nAs I work with my students on developing strength in there legs for better balance and more power, I find that most cannot get the weight from the right side to a solid left side. Resulting in a swing that hangs back, with the players momentum going away from the target rather than moving toward the target. If we picture a circle, imagine the outside of the circle as the club head path. The center of the circle is obviously around the middle of your belly. if you can visualize what the club head path would do if the center started to move backwards before the club path got to the bottom of the arc, You can see this will cause the club head path to be altered.\n\nIf you want to be able to hit your ball a long distance, this is the\nright article to read.

Even people with a lot of golf experience can overlook how\nimportant it is to have a good grip. The reason is that they can get\nstuck with their own ways of golfing instead of looking for ways to\nimprove.\n\nThere is a lot of effort that needs to be made to improve your grip\nas a golfer. There is a challenge involved in making sure that you\nchange your current grip to a better one. This change of habit can be\nhard for some golfers.\n\nGolf is a game that needs to be simplified. I have done some math to\nbreak down playing nine holes of golf on a 3318 yard par 36 course.\nWhat I've come to understand in over 40 years of playing and teaching,\nis to understand and leverage the limitations we have on the distance\nyou can hit the ball. What I mean by that is if you can consistently\nhit a 180 yard shot then use that as the engine to your game.\n\nThis is key for us to see that we can break 90 for 18 holes if we\nstay out of trouble.\n\nTom Watson is a great golfer and a great gentleman. One of the\nreasons behind Tom's success is that he follows the \"gentleman's\ntradition\" of golf.

Tom has a great\ngolf-game but more important, Tom has a great life-game. He's\nrespected.\n\nLet's try to break down the golf swing\nby using a clock. We\u2014our arms, hands and legs\u2014are going to become the\nlong second hand of this clock. Imagine your triangle (see photo)\nYour grip and the club are the second hand of the clock. At address\nposition we have the second hand (triangle, grip and club ) pointed at\n6 o'clock.\n\nHere we are in the spring time\u2026finally. I have been practicing in\nthe nice weather at the range and on the course. Today we woke up to\ncold and stormy weather. It has given me the opportunity to go through\nthe standard work out with the Automatic Swing Trainer (AST). I must\nadmit that doing the drills with one hand and having the other hand\nmirror is \"killer\". It is so nice to be able to check the key positions\nof the golf swing while doing the work out (see photos here)\n\nWhen playing golf, there is a place mentally between trying too hard and not even caring. That is where our thoughts must be.\n\nWe have to absorb all the data for each shot, such as distance, wind\ndirection and strength, elevation changes. Quick tip: if it's a\nsignificant uphill, go one club more; if downhill maybe one club less.\nTry this on your next uphill green and on your next steep downhill.\n\nWhile practicing your putting here are a few ideas that will help\nyou roll the ball better. First the set up. There are as many different\nset-up positions as there are golfers. Some like to set up with an open\nstance, meaning the left foot and hip are slightly back from a parallel\nline to the target.\n\nSome golfers are more comfortable with their left foot closer to the\nball, or in a closed stance. We need to find a stance that can help us\nkeep the lower body quiet\u2014basically motionless.\n\nLet's be honest. How many shots do you throw away during a round of\ngolf because you try shots that require more skill than you currently\nhave? How many times have we hit a bunker rather than the green trying\nto do what the pros' do? We have all tried to go for a sucker pin\nplacement, when in reality if we would have just decided to simply hit\nthe center of the green and two putted we would have been much more pleased with the outcome.\n\nThis is the\nfirst in a series that I'm calling the \"Hacker's Diary\"\u2026\u2026the notes,\nruminations and great \"finds\" of a golf hacker who spends a lot of time\nreading golf tips and golf magazines, when not working on his own game.\nI'll share with you the good, the bad and the flat out ugly instruction\nand tips that I come across. This one here below isn't bad. It's on\nimproving your putting from tour pro' Rick Smith.\n\nA good, solid base is so important to the golf swing. When the lower body does not support the rotation of the triangle we develop a lot of bad habits while trying hit the ball straight.\nThe triangle formed by your shoulders and arms (see photo here) is key\nto an accurate, repeatable swing.\n\nWhen\nchipping there are a few simple drills to help you learn to use more\nthan just your wedge. For example, if I have a little fringe to carry\nand a lot of green to work with, I suggest trying an 8 iron to hit a\nlittle chip and run.\n\nTo do this I am going to play the ball back in my stance, with a\nslightly open stance, and I want a little extra weight on my left side.\nNow I am going to use a stroke that resembles that of a\n\nAfter we have a good grip\nwith equal amounts of the back of both hands showing, and we understand\nthe triangle which consists of our shoulders and our two arms with the\nwrist acting as a hinge at the bottom of the triangle, we now have to\nhave a solid base that will enable us to rotate and raise the triangle\naround our spine angle.\n\nWhile teaching at the Golf Expo\nthis past weekend the vast majority of golfers have a few mistakes in\ncommon. The first is the Grip. It is fun to see some of the home made\nversions that golfers will try; most people try to solve their golf\nball flight or lack thereof by changing their grip.\n\nOne of the worst things we can do as golfers is to go to the course\nto play with too many thoughts on our minds. The place to work on\nmechanics and swing technique is on the range or away from the course.\nI love videoing my golf swing to verify that I am getting the club into\nthe key positions of the swing. I also really like doing strength\ntraining for my golf muscles away from the course.\n\nI have found the exercises that the automatic swing trainer has\nhelps me work on the golf muscles while swinging it in my living room.\n\nFundamentals of the golf swing. I\ncannot emphasize enough that the simpler we can keep our move the\nbetter off we will be. A good base with our feet wide as our hip\njoints. Our knees flexed slightly ( as if we are going to jump up a few\ninches ) Our weight balanced between the heels and the balls of our\nfeet. If you put your weight on your toes it is too easy to move your\nhead up and down.\n\nA little drill to try is to bend over to pick up something and you\nwill see that to do that your weight goes to your toes.\n\nWith the golf season getting started we should set some goals that we\nwould like to achieve this year. I am not talking scores I am talking\nabout practice habits that will translate into better scores. When we\nlook at the statistics for tour players ( the best players in the world\n) I am always amazed at the greens in regulation stat. Now we all know\nthat tour players play a lot of golf and the demands on their time is\ngreat.\n\nThe putting stroke is a small version of the full swing.\nAfter years of studying the swing and the putting stroke I may have\ncome across a tips that really puts it all together. On the full swing\nwe have the primary plane which is the shaft angle at address position\nand continues up the right arm to the elbow. So to me the triangle is\nthe shoulders, left arm and the right arm to the elbow.\n\nNow when making our full swing as we take the club back we get the\nclubhead moving to the toe line the right arm begins to fold into the\nbody.\n\nNow that spring is just around the corner it's time to dust off the\ngolf swing. I always like to start fresh every year with the basics so\nthat I make sure I have not pick up any bad habits. The GRIP is a great\nplace to start. I like a to use an overlapping grip. that's where the\nleft hand has all five fingers on the club. The thumb of the left hand\nneed to be what we call a short thumb. Make sure there is no gap\nbetween the thumb and the first knuckle. To place the left hand on the\nclub, first let the left arm hang naturally to your side and pay\nattention to the angle your left hand hangs at.\n\nAs winter starts to give way to spring my thoughts\u2014like\nyours\u2014return to golf, and getting out on that first tee box for that\nfirst round of the year. Maybe, you think, this is the year I break\n80, heck I'd be happy to break 90! Either way it's time to move the\nsnow blower, the snow salt and snow shovels and dust off those clubs.\nAnd when I finally got that club in my hand and took a few swings\u2014boy\ndid that feel good! Then I noticed the grips are so shiny and smooth\nthat I won't be able to keep hold of the club.\n\nSALT LAKE CITY \u2014 Producers of the 2010 Salt Lake Golf Show announced\nFriday that two of the game's biggest manufacturers, Nike and\nBridgestone, have agreed to participate in this year's consumer golf\nexpo, opening Friday, Mar.\n\nHit it Long. Hit it Straight\nLong, long, heck, really long shots, repeated over and over again is what we crave. Distance is what everybody wants. But \"accurate distance\" is really the Holy Grail of golf. Being able to hit the ball long\u2014in the fairway, in your chosen landing area\u2014is the goal. The better scorecard with\ndistance\u2014not distance that carries you into the rough. So, here are\nsome simple tips on how to gain more distance while avoiding \"blown\"\nshots.\n\nAs the AST\u2122 guides the body through the correct Range of Motion for the most effective golf swing, it will induce flexibility and stimulate the muscles of core stabilization. These are the muscles of the back and stomach that are required for the winding up of the backswing that generates the torque and strength which translates into increased club head speed and more accurate shots.\n\nConsistently sinking putts inside 15 feet will dramatically improve your score. By using the AST putter attachment you will feel the correct putter swing and drain more long putts. The putter attachment trains the big back muscles that are key to keeping the putter face square and rolling the ball on track every time. Consistent practice with the included AST putter attachment will shed strokes off your score and make you more confident on the green. Your putting can become your most trusted shot by practicing for just a few minutes a day.\n\nThe AST Golf Bag Attachments lets you practice your new golf swing anywhere. At the range. In your back yard. In your garage or at the office. The unique, portable design of the AST makes it a\ntake\u2014along\u2014companion for golf outings or a day at the office. And then we took the portability of the AST and supercharged it by adding a slick golf bag attachment (see photos below) The golf bag attachment includes a universal adjustable strap and\nattachment for the AST golf swing trainer.\n\nFix your slice, once and for all, with patented AST technology. Advanced AST engineering lets you feel a perfect on-plane swing for hitting long, accurate\nshots. Getting back to square at impact is what the AST was designed for.

That rare time is not worth compromising the whole point of the signature for.\n\nThe DQ would also discourage paperwork on the green that is already tainting the game.Vacuous argument Doc.\n\n1. 'The card can be signed (by the marker) at any time' (RulesDoc)\n\n2. 'The card must be signed (by the marker) at the completion of the round' (Rule 6-6a)\n\n3. 'The player cannot prevent a \"premature\" signature. How would they know anyway, the marker has possession of the card when the round commences'. (Skans4ever) Correct.\n\n4. 'There is no sanction anywhere in the Rules for an early signature applying to either the marker or player'. (languid) Correct.\n\n5. 'It just means that the card must be signed at the completion of the round as opposed to not being signed at all\u2026' (RulesDoc) I doubt it. This is dealt with in R6-6b.\n\n6. 'A card can in exceptional circumstances be accepted without the markers signature: D.6-6b\/6'. (RulesDoc) Irrelevant. This question is about R6-6a.\n\n....sometimes I've signed a players card when he's given it to me saying \" I have to go home now , can you hand my card in?\"....when I notice he hasn't signed it I just make something vaguely close to his name so that he isn't DQ'd\u2026. I doubt any captain would scrutinise every signature to ensure it's legit\u2026.most cards are a mess anyway\u2026.as long as there's some sort of mark there it gets accepted\n\nConsultancy\u2026.if you're not part of the solution, there's big bucks to be made prolonging the problem.\n\nI rather think that the point on this rule to take note of is that although the rule states that the card Must be signed after completion of the round. there is no way that those checking the cards can have any idea as to when the card was signed. I guess that they could go around checking with everybody's marker as to when the card was signed But I cannot see that happening.:-) As I stated previously . What possible gain could you get by signing the card early other than making sure that you do not forget to sign it? AAA; Humpty Dumpty? You have lost me.\n\nWell, the R&A does not have a problem with a card signed at any point during the round.\n\nHit it where they mow\n\nThat is hardly the point!\n\nWe do not all have access to the magic looking glass through which the R&A reads its rules.\n\nNor do we live by Humpty-Dumpty's tenet: 'When I use a word it means just what I choose it to mean\u2014neither more nor less.'\n\nThe point is, if the R&A 'does not have a problem with a card signed at any point during the round', why don't they bloody-well say so. Why maintain the fiction that is must be signed 'at the completion of the round'.\n\nYou may know that this provision has been in place since at least 1956 when the rule (38.1) stated that 'On completion of the round the marker shall sign the card \u2026'.\n\nIncidentally Doc, have you ever thought of auditioning for the part of Sir Joseph Porter \u2013 I think you would be a natural!\n\nI would have hoped someone seriously attempting to simplify the rules would have been around the various rules forums long enough gaining public opinion, where they would have encountered RulesDoc thousands of times."}
{"text":"Today we're going to talk about golf swing set-up. Well, it's where it all starts. If it's wrong, you're going to have to do something wrong in the swing to try to hit it. So it's what kind of gets our body in position to be able to perform the act that we're asking it to do. If we're out of position, no matter how hard we try, we can't perform what we're trying to do. That becomes very frustrating. So, usually, when you have problems in your swing, look first at your set- up.\n\nFirst it's your grip, then your set-up, then your alignment before you worry about the golf swing, because if those are wrong, your brain is altering the swing to try to make it work. So we've got to get the set-up correct. Well, the set-up in a golf swing is very athletic. First of all, I like to do it without a club first, and in fact, you just put your hands on your hips, lock your knees back, get your back very straight. At that point, your butt goes out, you bend at the your hips, not in your back, so the back is straight, the butt is out, knees are released and flexed. So a good athletic position could play a little football, play a little basketball, play a little tennis, play a little golf. It's all basically the same. Feet are about shoulder width. Butt out, back straight, bend at the hips, let your arms hang naturally from your shoulders. They shouldn't be construed into some unorthodox position. You're just letting your arms hang naturally from the shoulders out of your correct posture of back straight. That's easy to say. Now getting into it, a little harder to do, especially if no one is walking around looking at it for you.\n\nSo first of all, you should work on that in the mirror a lot to see that that back is nice and straight, butt is out, arms are hanging. In order to find that position, you need an order called a pre-shot routine. So what I like to see my students do is we get a good grip on the golf club, step forward with your arms to the front of your chest so there going to hang, step up with your right foot forward. Here's we're going to line up with the ball, to where I stick my butt out, get my back straight, so that's my measurement to the ball. Ball placement, in other words the relationship of this ball to this foot, a wood here. An iron more in the middle. So, we're going to be right foot measure, left foot ball placement, right foot width, with a little tilt, and that little tilt moves that weight into the right foot, puts your right eye over your right thigh so you can turn and really get loaded back on this right side. If you don't make that tilt, your head down or your ball in front, you don't get back and get loaded. You get tilted, and then you have a hard time swinging just because of your set-up. So again, grip, right foot, measure, ball placement, width, a little tilt. Turn and let it go.\n\nToday we're going to talk about short simple wedges. Wow, what a great topic, perfectly worded. That's what every wedge should be \u2013 short and simple\n\nThink about it. Your wedge is the shortest hitting golf club in your bag. You've got every club in your bag that will hit it much, much further then a wedge. So these swings should be short and simple. It's all about accuracy here. It isn't about distance. It's only about the distance I can make the ball go, not the distance I could possibly make it go.\n\nShort and simple. It's that easy. The shortness means not so long in the back swing. So when we go up to the top, instead of having great big swings, the club gets way up, we're more into a three-quarter, hand about shoulder height, club up position versus that position. That's short. Simple means we're turning our big muscles through the ball, and our hands\nare quiet. We're not trying to flip the club with our hands. So short and simple is very, very, very good wordage. It's a good thing to think about. Short, the whole body turning. Again your finish, about shoulder height, won't be way up in there flipped. Short and simple. Short, turn the hips. Short, turn it all together. Short, turn, hands, very, very quiet."}

{"text":"Our Newsletter\n\nGolf for Beginners\n\nThe right grip is the most important fundamental in golf. Gripping your club correctly lends three advantages to your swing:\n\n\u2022 Grip controls the face position of the club. Impact with correct grip helps you hit your shot straight and solid. \u2022 The only physical connection between you and your club is your grip. It allows you to create the right amount of wrist hinge which isa very imp power source. \u2022 During the course of your swing, your club is travelling some 18feet and all that while your eyes are focused on the ball. With a good grip, you can feel where the club is in space, allowing you to optimize power and control.\n\nTo assume the correct grip, right-handed golfers should follow this procedure:\n\n\u2022 Hold your club 3 feet in the air in front of your body \u2022 Make sure the face of your club is square, not open or closed (This just means pointing the club head straight up and not tilted in either direction)\n\nLEFT HAND\n\n\u2022 Place the club at an angle onyour left palm. The club should touch the base of your little finger and the portion just above the first joint of the index finger \u2022 Close your fingers around the club with your left thumb pointing down the length of the club \u2022 You should be able to see the knuckles of your index and middle finger in the address position\n\nRIGHT HAND\n\n\u2022 The club should be placed at an angle on your palm, resting on the base of your little finger, in between the base and first joint of your ring finger, on the first joint of your middle finger, and in between the first and second joint of your index finger \u2022 Cover left hand thumb with life line of right palm \u2022 Make sure the V formed by your thumb and index finger of your right hand is parallel to the V formed by your thumb and index finger of your left hand\n\nYour hands must work together as a single unit when striking the ball so it's best they're linked together in one of three ways:\n\nVardon overlap \u2013 This is the most common grip amongst professionals. The little finger of your right hand rests on the groove formed between your left index and middle fingers.\n\nInterlock \u2013 This is the next most common grip. The little finger of your right hand is locked in between your left index and middle fingers.\n\nTen finger grip \u2013 This is the least common grip but an effective one. The little finger of your right hand lies by the side of and touching your left index finger.\n\nSwing tip: To hit the ball further, use a light grip pressure. On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is light and 10 is tight, applying pressure of 3-4 is recommended for a good swing.\n\nHandling failure at the practice range\n\nNow that you've got some idea of how best to grip your golf club, there are some things to think about as you're a developing player. The game of golf is ultimately played in the head. There is a lot of practice involved, but the best players know it's played in the head not with the body. They are the most relaxed players, they practice the most, and they have the best technique.\n\nA study that put brain scans on people showed that beginners' brain activity is all over the map, like a light shower going off. Whereas the brain scans of the top touring tours showed a pin prick of light in the brain. This is because their focus is so intense. So it's not so much the body, it's training the mind to hit the ball correctly. That's why you have to learn how to handle failure at the practice range. Think about failure as data so when you fail at something, it just means you have to keep practicing at it. When you do something successfully, learn how that feels so you can replicate that.\n\nTo get the type of focus and concentration that a top pro has, you've got to put the work in that the top pro has put in. The more work you put in at the range, the better your results are going to get.\n\nQuick Guide to the Rules\n\nThe rules of golf are internationally standardized and are jointly governed by The R&A, spun off in 2004 from The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews (founded 1754), and the United States Golf Association (USGA). TheThe game of golf should be played in the correct spirit and to understand this you should read the Etiquette Section in the Rules of Golf. In particular:\n\n\u2022 Show consideration to other players \u2022 Play at a good pace and be ready to invite faster moving groups to play through \u2022 Take care of the course by smoothing bunkers, replacing divots and repairing ball marks on the greens.\n\nBefore starting your round you are advised to:\n\n\u2022 Read the Local Rules on the score card and the notice board \u2022 Put an identification mark on your ball; many golfers play the same brand of ball and if you can't identify your ball, it is considered lost (Rules 12-2 and 27-1) \u2022 Count your clubs; you are allowed a maximum of 14 clubs. (Rule 4-4).\n\nDuring the round:\n\n\u2022 Don't ask for \"advice\" from anyone except your partner (i.e. a player on your side) or your caddies; don't give advice to anyone except your partner; you may ask for information on the Rules, distances and the position of hazards, the flagstick, etc. (Rule 8-1) \u2022 Don't play any practice shots during play of a hole. (Rule 7-2) \u2022 Don't use any artificial devices or unusual equipment, unless specifically authorized by Local Rule (Rule 14-3).\n\nAt the end of your round:\n\n\u2022 In match play, ensure the result of the match is posted \u2022 In stroke play, ensure that your score card is completed properly (including being signed by you and your marker) and return it to the Committee as soon as possible (Rule 6-6).\n\nHandicapping\n\nOne of the characteristic features of the game of golf is the handicapping system. A handicap allows players of all levels of golfing ability to compete against each other equally and, consequently, is essential to the popularity and prosperity of the game.\n\nIn amateur golf, the majority of competitions cater for players who have a wide range of golfing ability. If no allowance was made for this variation then the relatively small number of high-ability players would be successful in all competitions.\n\nThroughout the world, a golf handicap is recognized as representing the number of strokes that need to be deducted from the player's actual (gross) score so that, when he plays to his average ability, his net score equals a \"Standard Score\". The amount deducted (i.e. the player's \"handicap\") is calculated so as to be representative of the player's current ability and potential at the point in time that they play in a competition.\n\nOnly amateur golfers have handicaps and, the better the player, the lower the handicap. Professionals do not have handicaps, they play in competitions without handicaps.\n\nAs a player improves, his handicap will reduce. Some highly-skilled players reach the stage where their handicaps are zero, better known as \"scratch\". A select few may even become so good that their handicap enters positive figures (e.g. +1, +2), which means they have to add strokes to their total for the round.\n\nStroke play\n\nIn stroke play, a handicap is a certain number of strokes that a player is allowed to remove from his total gross score for a round. For example, if a player with a 15 handicap has a gross score of 87, his net score would be 72.\n\nMatch play\n\nIn match play, the situation is a little more complicated. In a match played off scratch, handicaps are not used at all. In a handicap match, however, a player may give strokes to his opponent, or receive them from his opponent, depending on their respective handicaps and the handicap allowance that is in force.\n\nGolf Equipment\n\nThe Rules of Golf specify the equipment which may be used to play the game. These specifications can be found in Rule 4 and Appendix II for golf clubs and Rule 5 and Appendix III for golf balls. In general, they are 'descriptive' and 'restrictive' in nature - defining what a golf club should look like and how far a golf ball can travel.\n\nIn an historical context, the game of golf has seen progressive developments in the clubs and balls available to golfers who, through almost six centuries, have sought to improve the playing performance of their equipment.\n\nAs an amateur player, the sets wisest to invest in would be Golden Bear, PowerBilt, or Wilsons. And if you're just starting out without a trainer, be assured that you can find many videos on YouTube and other golf websites that give you tips, advice, suggestions, point out common mistakes, etc. You can find information on anything else you need related to golf by simply searching for it on the internet."}

{"text":"BEST GOLF TIP EVER!\n\nBy Senior Staff Writer Ken Tonks\n\nThe \"best tip ever\". Wow, that sounds like something doesn't it? Better than the tip about not looking up until you hear the ball fall into the hole on short putts? Could it be that good? (I always thought that to be the dumbest tip myself. If you do miss, you have no more information on the next putt than you had on the one you just missed because you weren't watching! How dumb is that???\n\nAnyway, back to the best tip ever...\n\nJust send $19.95 and I'll send you my c.d.....just kidding! Here it is:\n\nThis move involves dropping the right elbow into your right side as your first move on the downswing. You want to bring your right elbow into your side so that you can actually feel it lightly touch your shirt. What this does is keep you on the inside path to the ball, preserves your wrist cock, and eliminates that over the top move that been causing all those banana balls and cursing fits you've been having all these years.\n\nWhat you are doing is dropping into the infamous \"slot\". Watch the pro's swing. They almost seem to \"drop\" a hair as they transition from the back swing to the downswing. The legs squat just a bit, and their is a slight pause as the club changes direction. At that pause is when you think \"bring that elbow down as I start the downswing. Down, NOT OUT!\n\nMost of us \"fire from the top\" in an effort to clobber the ball. It seems like the more powerful move, but it absolutely is not. Problem with this move is that it immediately starts un cocking your wrists, while throwing your arms away from your body. The result is an over the top, outside in swing, with most of the power spent long before you get to the ball. By keeping your elbow tucked into your right side, you automatically swing from the correct inside to inside path, and you'll maintain most of your wrist cock until the last minute. As Emerald would say, \"BAMM!\"\n\nTake your time on the downswing. Swing hard!, but let it progress. You're first move should be a little drop motion as your right elbow pulls down into your right side. Now that you're in \"the slot\", get ready to let her ride! Release the hands hard at impact and feel the resulting power. If you've never hit a shot from \"the slot\" before, you're in for a treat, and a good 20 or more yards off the tee.\n\nNot a bad tip huh?\n\nIf this works for you consider sending that $19.95 to your favorite charity for kids"}
{"text":"Quick-Fixes\n\nThe Open Championship -- or as the Americans call it, the British Open, to distinguish the tournament from the U.S. Open -- was first played in 1860 at Prestwick and won by Willie Park. It remained at Prestwick for the next 12 years. Currently it rotates among nine courses. The Open has been held every year with the exceptions of 1871, 1915 through 1919 due to World War I, and 1940 through 1945 due to World War II. The Open is held in July.\n\nThe term \"golf tee\" has two meanings. The tees on a golf course refer to the areas where the holes begin -- also referred to as the teeing ground. The teeing ground typically includes three to five sets of tee markers. Players must place their balls within a designated area on the teeing ground for their first shot. A golf tee is also the small apparatus -- sometimes call a peg -- that's pointed on one end and concave on the other. The player pushes the pointed end into the ground. He then places his ball on the concave end and hits the ball off the tee. Tees can only be used at the beginning of each hole on the teeing ground.\n\nWhile Tiger Woods is certainly a long hitter, his short game has been a key factor in his success, particularly in major tournaments. Most notable was his 2008 U.S. Open victory, in which he sank a 65-foot eagle putt in the third round, then forced a playoff with a 15-foot putt on the tournament's 72nd hole. While Woods tweaked his putting grip in late 2011, the style he's employed for most of his career has certainly served him well. In 2008, Woods termed his grip \"conventional.\"\n\nIf you ask a golfer what's worse, hooking a shot into a water hazard or hitting a shank -- a shot that flies off the club at a strange angle, such as nearly straight to the right -- he might very well choose the hook over the shank, even though he loses his ball and incurs a penalty. Hitting a shank is embarrassing and a golfer who hits one shank has a lingering fear that he's going to hit another one, or more, during the round.\n\nMore Quick-Fixes Picks\n\nSometimes it's hard to know the best ball position for a given shot. While there are many general rules that can help \u2013 for example, the best ball position for an average shot is somewhere between your left armpit and the center of your chest (for a right-handed golfer) \u2013 there are ways to find the ball position that gives you the best results for the way you swing.\n\nThe Players Championship began in 1974 and was originally called the Tournament Players Championship. Unlike typical PGA Tour events, which are run by local organizations, The Players Championship is run by the PGA Tour and the players themselves. The tournament, also called simply The Players, has been played at the Stadium Course at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida since 1982. It has been played in May the past several years.\n\nThere's no telling how many middle-age amateur golfers have watched a Champions Tour event and wondered if they have what it takes to be the next Jay Sigel. The Champions Tour, known as the Senior PGA Tour until 2002, is open to golfers age 50 and over. While most of the top players on the Champions Tour were successful on the PGA Tour, Sigel, a two-time U.S. Amateur winner, didn't even turn pro until he was 50. In 1993, Sigel finished 11th in the Champions Tour's National Qualifying Tournament to earn a conditional tour card. Over the next 19 years he won eight Champions Tour events and more than $9 million. Golfers hoping to follow in his footsteps must first enter a regional qualifying tournament.\n\nPhysical fitness vans are common sights at professional golf tournaments, and many pros have their own personal fitness trainers. Weekend golfers have also gotten into the act, as local gyms and fitness centers have been quick to provide specialized programs. But you can improve your golf fitness \u2013 specifically your driving distance \u2013 by merely adding a few simple types of exercises to your daily routine.\n\nLeaving your iron shots short can add strokes to your score. That's not a good thing if you are trying to lower your handicap or beat your buddies in a friendly match. Leaving your approach shots short of the green can be especially costly. The goal of any approach shot should be to place the ball as close to the hole as possible.\n\nThe PGA Championship, one of the four major championships in men's professional golf, is played in August each year at different locations in the United States. It ranks in prestige with the Masters, U.S. Open and the British Open. Like all professional golf tournaments, the PGA Championship has certain rules for fans to follow while attending the event. Fans are encouraged to cheer great play but are asked not to engage in organized chants or conduct protests of any kind, according to official guidelines published by the PGA. Fans are also encouraged to kneel or remain seated in the front row of stands so that others can see and to remain still while players attempt shots.\n\nConfident golfers tend to shoot lower scores. Confidence allows a golfer to be decisive in his club selection. He doesn't wonder if he has chosen the right club for a given shot. He knows he has. This, in turn, has a positive effect on the execution of the shot. A confident golfer has a plan in mind for each shot. He doesn't just swing and hope.\n\nThe U.S. Open Championship, conducted by the United States Golf Association in June in the modern era, is the preeminent golf event in the United States. But it had humble beginnings as a one-day 36-hole tournament played on Oct. 4, 1895, on the nine-hole course at the Newport Golf and Country Club in Rhode Island. Only 10 professional golfers and one amateur teed it up for the inaugural event, won by Horace Rawlins who took home first prize of $150. The first prize in 2010 was $1,350,000.\n\nIf you're skilled or lucky enough to score a two-under-par eagle on a hole during a round of golf, recognize the accomplishment by properly marking it on your scorecard. It will be extremely satisfying to write the number representing the eagle on the scorecard, such as writing a 2 on a par-4 or a 3 on a par-5 hole. In addition to the number, eagles are typically represented in golf with a double-circle symbol.\n\nA nasty slice off the tee is the Achilles' heel of many amateur players' golf games. An inside-out golf shot occurs when the club is brought back \"inside,\" or close to the body, and swung down from \"outside\" the ideal plane, away from the body. This swing causes the ball to spin perpendicular to the target line, leading to a ball that bends sharply off target in mid-air.\n\nThere are few things more frustrating in the game of golf than thinking you made a good swing only to watch your ball cut across the fairway and out of sight into the woods. A slice can appear for what seems to be no reason, and it can happen to anyone. Just remember that a slice can be cured with some good advice and time spent on the driving range.\n\nMost beginner golfers and many seasoned golfers slice the ball frequently. Alignment plays a big role in the sliced shot. There is a parallax effect that takes place on the tee that most golfers are unaware of. At address, golfers assume the club is directed to the target when in fact they are aligned right of the target. Instead, golfers should line their ball and clubface to the target, with their bodies positioned parallel to the target (for right-handed golfers) to avoid slicing their shots. Other considerations also need to be addressed that might contribute to a sliced shot.\n\nSecond only to putting \"yips,\" a chronic slice is the biggest frustration among amateur golfers. A slice is caused by hitting the ball from the outside, which creates side spin that pulls the ball away from you in mid-air. So many players fight a slice that golf club manufacturers release dozens of clubs annually designed to rid you of this round-ruining ball flight. Slice cures require work, but a combination of cleaner swing mechanics and more appropriate clubs can yield impressive results in a short time.\n\nGolf can be quite an expensive game when you add up the total cost of clubs, shoes, balls, green fees and practice range fees. Golfers may think they don't have enough money in their recreation budget to accommodate golf instruction and game improvement. Golf is much more enjoyable when you play better. Game improvement requires a commitment of time--but not necessarily money.\n\nAmong the foremost bane of many golfers is the unwanted golf slice. A slice can be caused by many things, but always results in the shot veering hard right (for right-handed golfers) or left (for left-handed players). It makes staying on the fairway difficult and can lead to major problems off the tee box. Fortunately, there are ways to fix a golf slice.\n\nThe slice is the most common problem with a golfer's swing. Slicing occurs when the club face is not squared to the ball at impact. If the face is too open, the golfer will slice the ball far to the right (for right-handed golfers, left for lefties) The slice is easy to correct, but like any bad habit, it can show up again without much warning.\n\nThe strength and power in a golf swing comes from the body's powerhouse, the core. Once a stronger, more-flexible core is developed, the golfer will be able to rotate fully on the backswing and create maximum torque and power. Torque and power are ideal for generating high levels of club head speed without swinging harder. Many golfers think that swinging harder will create more distance, but it isn't true. Strengthening the core will add yards to your shots.\n\nGolf is a game, after all, and you should have fun when you are out on the course. That is hard to do if you are not getting the distance and accuracy you expect on your golf shots. Don't despair, though--you can improve your golf swing. The key is to discover what you are doing wrong, get professional instruction on how to correct your swing flaws, and invest time into practice for consistent results.\n\nThe slice is a common problem that some golfers have when striking the ball. They hit the ball toward the target, but the ball takes a drastic curve from left to right. The problem occurs during the swing when the player closes the club face and cuts across the ball rather than follow the ball straight through the strike. Making some minor adjustments to your stance, your grip and your swing can help cure your slice.\n\nThe emotional and mental aspects of golf cannot be overstated, especially if you are a beginning player and find yourself in one frustrating spot after another out on the course. But by learning how to harness your emotions during a round, you will be able to both score better during play and enjoy the sport much more.\n\nA common misconception with beginning golfers is that to increase swing speed, one needs to swing harder. This approach commonly results in mis-hit balls, slices or hooks. In order to obtain a faster swing speed, you have to be able to rotate your body back and through the shot at a faster speed. In order to improve your swing speed, focused exercise of your core muscles will result in greater swing speed and distance on your golf shots.You can think of your core golf muscles as the portion of your abs that goes from your belly button to your sternum.\n\nIt's insidious, and it can ruin a golf score. You have a chronic problem, and you have probably spent time and money to correct it. But in the end, it always comes back to haunt you. It's the dreaded slice. There are several reasons why golfers unintentionally slice the ball. They can happen during your address or as you swing the club. But there are steps that can be taken to correct them.\n\nStandard golf clubs are made with a neutral club head position that will allow a golfer with a sound swing and good hip action to hit the ball straight. But golfers who consistently slice (ball flight curves left to right) may choose an offset or draw club to help correct the ball flight. The term \"draw\" describes a ball flight that moves right to left for a right-handed golfer.\n\nLike any tradition or game that has existed for generations, golf has acquired its fair share of rules of thumb that any golfer should be expected to know. Unfortunately, as is often the case, not all of these rules to live by are true, and sticking to them could be hurting your game.\n\nIt happens to everybody. You are playing well, perhaps in one of the better hot streaks of your life. You are hitting the ball well, your short game is productive and your putter is hot. You are scoring well and you look forward to every trip to the golf course. As you are in the middle of another good round, you have a couple of tough shots that don't go your way. You start to mishit the ball -- and the next thing you know is that you have lost your rhythm.\n\nImproving a golf swing with sensory motor learning is something that is possible for golfers to do, however doing this requires focused work. Training by developing sensory motor skills demands you to do more than simply go to the driving range and hit a bunch of balls.\n\nThe slice shot, in which the ball comes off of the club and travels briefly toward the target before veering sharply away from the golfer and often out of play, is the bane of many recreational golfers. It can be one of the more frustrating problems to work on. Fear of the slice even forces many players to abandon their driver on the course, lest they lose their balls off the tee. There are several potential fixes which can be tested on the range in an attempt to fix a slice.\n\nGolfers panic when a slice appears in their game. They start to overthink every swing, and they even start to accept the slice as part of their game and change the way they manage the golf course to compensate. A slice is the result of a breakdown in the basics of the golf swing, and there are many common cures.\n\nReducing your average score by five strokes might seem like a daunting challenge. One way to approach it is to try five different methods that will reduce your score by one stroke each. Most golfers don't play up to their potential, so the opportunity always exists for significant game improvement--and enjoying golf more. Golf is both a physical and a mental game. Both aspects must be addressed for a golfer to improve.\n\nTrying to cure a golf slice without working at it is almost like trying to avoid a car accident while driving with your eyes closed \u2013 you might get lucky a time or two, but ultimately the inevitable will happen. It is almost natural for a beginning golfer to have a slice in his shot. Although the slice can be avoided, it takes work to adjust the swing in the proper way to ensure that the slice is removed.\n\nA slicing drive is a shot that leaves the face of the club traveling toward the intended target but veers off course as it travels, bending sharply away to the right from a right-handed golfer. The slice is a common problem among recreational golfers, even getting so bothersome as to cause some golfers to abandon their drivers out of frustration.\n\nA slice is one of a golfer's worst nightmares. It can appear to happen for no reason, but the reality is that there is a cause for your slice and you need to work to find it. A slice is the result of some breakdown in the fundamentals of your swing, and you need to re-establish your fundamentals.\n\nAll golf clubs are not created equal, and to get the most out of your swing, you should have clubs that fit your body measurements and ability level. Technological innovations have resulted in club designs that optimize the golf swing and help make the game more fun. Try a new driver or add some hybrids and a lob wedge\u2014and watch your game improve.\n\nA sliced shot -- the dreaded banana ball that curves severely right -- is a problem that affects most amateur golfers at nearly one point or another. The side spin that creates a slice is the result of a downswing path that travels across the target line from outside to in with a clubface that points right of the target at impact. Recognizing these causes is the first step to eliminating the slice.\n\nGolf caps help keep the sun out of your eyes while playing 18 holes, or you can wear them simply for fashion. If you wear golf caps on a hot summer day, they will most likely get filled with sweat and dirt. You can remove this by washing your golf cap, but it's important to do it safely, or it could lose shape and become unwearable.\n\nAmateur golfers often suffer from the over-the-top golf swing. With an over-the-top golf swing, you may have an inside swing path during the backswing, but as you go in to your down stroke, the shoulders rotate and the club goes outside of swing path. This causes the golfer to have to come back in on the ball at impact, causing a slice or a pull.\n\nSlicing the ball is one of the most detrimental shots for a golfer, as it is frustrating and often leads to a bad score on a hole. And no matter their level of expertise, almost all golfers slice from time to time. It occurs most often with drivers, because the club head is larger and the shaft has a greater amount of flexibility, but it can happen with any club.\n\nHaving an outside to inside golf swing can reek some real havoc with the golf game. It can cause you to slice and spray the ball all over the course. In the end, an outside golf swing can create pure confusion and the desire to give up the game for good. But there's a very simple recipe for fixing an outside golf swing and once you get it down, it will make playing the game much easier.\n\nThe shank is one of the most dreaded swing problems in golf. A shank is usually characterized by the ball going sharply to the right--or the left if you're a lefty--and way short of your target. Cure the shanks to avoid poor scores and restore confidence to your game.\n\nThe slice can be one of the most frustrating things in golf. Just when you think you have everything under control, your drive goes sailing off into a slice that lands in the woods. A slice might seem like an unfixable swing killer, but with a few minor adjustments, you should be able to get your shots flying straight and on target once again.\n\nOne of the most common problems afflicting golfers is the slice. The slice is a shot where the ball starts off to the left or on target and bends to the right of the target (or the opposite for left-handed golfers). A slice can occur for a variety of factors, but fixes and drills exist that can cure a slice with a little hard work and practice.\n\nGolf can be an amazingly relaxing sport where the player can enjoy beautifully manicured courses, pristine lakes and wondrous tees along the fairways. Of course, golf can be a royal pain, as the average player never notices those wonders of nature, instead spending his time sending errant shots into lakes, topping golf balls that barely go 50 yards and wanting to wrap his club around the nearest tree. All of these problems stem from one thing--a bad golf swing.\n\nGolfers all want to hit the ball farther. Being able to hit long drives gives you a significant advantage over your playing partners. They might have to hit a 3-iron to the green on a long par 4 whereas you are able to hit a 9-iron--generally a much easier shot to hit. The distance you can hit the ball is directly related to the clubhead speed you are able to develop throughout your swing.\n\nSensory motor learning is the process of learning physical skills using cues that require one or more of your senses, such as hearing, feeling or seeing. The most obvious sensory cue for improving your golf swing is sight. If you are a right-handed golfer trying a new grip and the ball flies to the right, you know this grip causes a slice. In addition to using visual cues, noting your balance during your swing and its effect on your shots is helpful.\n\nImproving your overall flexibility through a regular stretching routine can result in an improved golf swing. If you have poor flexibility, you won't swing with full range of motion, losing distance or accuracy when you hit a shot. By performing regular stretching every day and before playing a round, you'll decrease your risk of injury and increase your performance. Before starting a stretching routine, warm up by walking or jogging for 10 minutes to avoid pulling or tearing muscles.\n\nThe dreaded slice is an unfortunate part of many golfers' games. Even elite professionals such as Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson occasionally find themselves on the wrong end of a golf slice, whether off the tee box or fairway. A golf slice, simply put, is a golf shot that veers strongly away from the desired target--to the right for right-handed golfers; to the left for left-handed golfers. Fortunately, there are ways to go about avoiding a golf slice.\n\nThe slice is a golf shot that bends far to the right when hit by right-handed golfers, and far to the left when hit by southpaws. It is one of the most common problems faced by beginners. In many cases, a little more attention to your grip and the path of your club during the swing can correct the problem.\n\nOne of the more common shots that an amateur golfer hits is a slice, which is a shot that curves hard to the right. It is very difficult to control and often gets golfers into big trouble on the golf course. If you suffer from a bad slice with the driver or any other clubs, you need to focus on a few keys to enjoy a slice-free game.\n\nToo many players slouch over the golf ball as if they are too tired to hit it \u2026 and then they wonder why their shots end up everywhere but where they wanted them to go. Setting up with correct posture does not happen by accident, but it is not difficult to achieve either. The important aspects of posture are simply matters of common sense and taking a little care to get things right.\n\nWhile many weekend players fight a constant slice, pushed shots can plague even the best pros. Sometimes they refer to this as \"getting stuck,\" and at other times they just say \"I lost it right.\" Although many players prefer a pushed shot to a duck hook, it is better to avoid both. Fortunately, most pushing problems fall into two categories, setup problems and \"leaning\" problems.\n\nGolf students come to teachers with various swing problems that they would like fixed, and most students think there are specific fixes to specific problems. The best way to fix any golf swing problem is to make sure your swing foundation is solid, and the best way to do that is to do the same swing exercise every day until you have your fundamentals memorized.\n\nA golf swing might seem like a simple act, but dozens of things can go wrong that can turn your swing into a train wreck. If you know how to grip the club, address the ball and the basic mechanics of a swing, paying attention to some of the following bits of advice should help you make that swing consistently good. Of course, the most important tips to follow are to practice frequently and be aware of what you're doing, right down to the rotation of your hips and the way you grip the club. If you know how it feels to hit a good shot, you're on your way to duplicating that same swing every time.\n\nSlicing the golf ball can cause real problems in your game, whether you're a beginner or a longtime player. Slicing tends to put you in places you don't want to be, such as out of bounds and on neighboring fairways. A slice is often a symptom of your stance or trying to hit the ball too hard and having no idea of how your club face is affecting the ball. But, you don't have to live with a slice.\n\nGolf is an endlessly challenging, sometimes frustrating, but always fascinating game that even gifted, accomplished players come to realize cannot be mastered. Through instruction, dedication to practice and choosing the right golf equipment golfers can make immense progress in learning the game and lowering their scores. But even if a golfer goes from a 20 handicap to a 10, he still wishes he could improve to a five handicap. Golfers know there is always room for improvement in their swing and in their mental approach to the game.\n\nFor many golfers, a slice is their worst enemy. An uncontrollable slice can ruin holes and scorecards. According to a Golf.com poll, 70 percent of golfers said a slice is their greatest golf sin. And as clubs get more advanced and golfers swing harder, slices are becoming the norm. But there are some things you can do to start hitting the ball down the middle.\n\nYour golf ball lands where there is a tree between it and the green. Because you can easily reach the green otherwise, you have two choices. Assuming you are right-handed, you can go over the tree or you can hit to the left of it with a slice. If you are left-handed, you'll go over the tree or to the right of it. Assuming that you choose the latter, you'll need to do several things with your weight, feet and swing to pull off that shot.\n\nAs you progress in the game of golf, you should develop a rhythm for your swing. Basically, rhythm in the golf swing is the ability to get all the physical components of your body working together in your swing. A good rhythm makes a golf swing look effortless. Regardless of your swing speed, as long as your rhythm is solid, your swing will look and feel effortless. An important thing to recognize is feeling the force, not forcing the feel.\n\nYou know something is wrong with your golf swing, but you just can't put your finger on it. You start hitting shots a lot shorter, and the ball seems to fly like a duck rather than a rocket. What's worse is your scores begin to soar along with your handicap. What you don't realize is that your swing is made up of several moving parts, and when they do not happen in the correct order, your golf swing is said to lack timing. Here are two drills that will help you regain your swing.\n\nOne of the keys to playing golf well is a properly-timed swing that makes solid contact with the ball at the point of impact. If your timing is poor, it feels as if you are rushing to hit the ball. With good timing, the feeling is just the opposite. Your body feels smooth and relaxed and there is a positive flow to your swing.\n\nGolfers want distance and accuracy from their golf shots, especially off the tee. A fade to the right or a draw to the left can be desirable when the fairway has a curve or a dogleg. Sometimes, however, the tee shot will produce a slice or a hook. After analyzing the problem, there are some steps you can take to straighten out your golf shots for more accuracy.\n\nSwinging a golf club properly is essential to improving your score. Slight defects in a swing will cause the ball to slice or hook, you will hit the top of the ball or miss it altogether. Having the proper tools and the right mentality when approaching your shot will make your experience with the game more successful and enjoyable.\n\nThe golf swing is very fluid. The constant change means that at some points, the golfer will be quite happy and wish he could bottle his swing and take it out and use it whenever he wanted. But it doesn't work that way. Golfers go into slumps because they do the little things wrong and get into poor habits.\n\nThe slice is one of the main problems golfers face. Although it is not overly difficult to straighten out your shots in theory, the ability to do so on a consistent basis is difficult. Perhaps the most difficult part of controlling a slice is retraining your body to abandon its bad habits when swinging. This can only be done with practice and patience.\n\nFor those with an out-to-in swing path, stepping up to the ball can be an intimidating proposition, no matter where you are on the course. Because truth be told, you don't know exactly what the ball is going to do from swing to swing. A nasty slice here. A straight out pull there. Add the occasional hook and you've got a golf game you'll feel like hanging up. But there's a simple drill and a visualization technique that you can use to correct your out-to-in swing path and eliminate the mystery of where your ball is headed. The key lies in keeping your club inside before contact.\n\nAn over-the-top golf swing is one of the most common types of swing faults. When you have an over-the-top swing, there are generally two results you can expect at impact: a slice or a pull. It's all determined by the angle of your club face at impact. Because the problem is so common, there are a variety of drills that can be used to cure an over-the-top swing.\n\nHitting a hard slice or a slow fade off the tee is often cause for consternation when it comes to playing the game of golf. But a slice is often the symptom of what is known as an outside swing. An outside swing is where you start the club head outside of the typical golf swing plane. If the club head stays outside of the plane, you overcorrect at impact in order to make contact. When you do this, you're bringing the club head back inside, causing an outward spin on the ball or leaving the club face open. There's an easy-to-use technique that will get your swing path back on line and have you hitting the ball straight.\n\nAll slices are not created equal. There are many reasons why your ball ends up to the right, and before you fix the problem, you have to determine the cause. According to Golf.com, a 1 1\/2-degree variation in your club face alignment can translate into a ball that lands 70 feet to the right of the target. Fortunately, remedies exist for even the most pronounced slices. You can even buy golf clubs designed to alleviate the problem.\n\nTo get the most out of your time on the golf course you need to have a swing that results in distance and accuracy. Videos, clinics and private lessons are good ways to reinforce the positives and prevent bad habits from forming. Fortunately, with a few adjustments and a review of the basics, you can learn to swing the golf club correctly for that beautiful shot of your dreams.\n\nMany golfers play the game as a recreational activity, enjoying spending a day out with friends and relaxing on the course. And although the game in itself is fun, it also has its frustrations. By improving your golf game, you can minimize the number of bad shots you hit in each round. With more satisfying shots, and fewer poor shots, you'll maximize the fun you'll have on the course.\n\nA slice is a golf shot that curves off to the right (for right-handed golfers). It is one of the most common mis-hits for amateurs. Many golfers struggle with a slice because they don't understand the cause. The physics that cause a slice revolve around two things: the club face and the swing path. When you understand the cause of a slice, you can focus on correcting it."}
{"text":"Golf history in the west of Scotland\ndid not shine as early as that in the east. The\nrainfall in the west is higher because the clouds make landfall\nthere from\nthe Atlantic.\nToday there are well-known golf links\ncourses in the south-west of Scotland,\nbut in the 16th and 17th Centuries, golf was a game played between December and March, when the grass was naturally\ncropped short and there was\nno agricultural work to be done. At this time of the\nyear, prominent Scots from the shires went to\nEdinburgh for the social 'season' and the convenience of warmer\nwinter city living. This meant they\nmainly played their\ngolf in the east.\n\nFirst mentions of golf in the west, as is common elsewhere, are in the\nannals of the Kirk. In 1589, the Glasgow Kirk Session decreed 'no golf, carrict, shinnie, in the High or\nBlackfriars yard, Sunday or weekday'. As this\nstricture does not limit itself to just 'Sunday observance', it may have\nbeen occasioned by the dangers of playing ball and stick games in confined\nspaces, much as you see the signs today 'NO BALL GAMES ALLOWED.'\nThe location also\nimplies the game being banned was the 'short' form of golf, as discussed at\nlength by David Hamilton.\n\nPossibly because there were no coastal links accessible to the\ngood burgesses of\nGlasgow in the early days of golf, they used Glasgow Green, shown above as it\nis today. Glasgow Green has been landscaped and most of it looks very\ndifferent now to the time when the golfers played there.\n\nIn 1642, Glasgow University, like St Andrews\nUniversity in the same year,\ndeclared their approval of\nsuch sports as 'Gouffe, Archerie, and the lyk' (sic). In\n1674, there is a record of golf equipment being bought for the young Earl\nWilliam of Annandale, who was attending Glasgow Grammar School.\n\nIn 1721, James Arbuckle, a student at Glasgow University, wrote a poem about\nthe River Clyde, which he called 'Glotta'. In it, he incidentally records\nseveral details about golf on Glasgow Green, the clubs and the game, though\nhe does not appear to have been a golfer himself.\n\nIn Winter too, when hoary\nFrosts o'erspread,\nThe verdant Turf, and naked lay the Mead,\nThe vig'rous Youth commence the sportive War,\nAnd arm'd with Lead, their jointed Clubs prepare;\nThe Timber Curve to Leathern Orbs apply,\nCompact, Elastic, to pervade the Sky:\nThese to the distant Hole they drive;\nThey claim the Stakes who thither first arrive.\n\nCare in needed in interpreting exact details, given\nthe difficulties of poetic rhyme and the 'licence' poets take as a result.\n\nGlasgow\nGolf Club played on Glasgow Green from 1787 to 1870 when they moved to\nQueens Park because the Green was common ground and becoming\npopular. From the beginning of the 19th Century\nplay became difficult. The overcrowding was compounded by a\nmunicipal drainage scheme in 1813, which apparently made the area\n'unpleasant'. This role is now fulfilled by the local\nbrewery.\n\nGlasgow Green\nTempleton Business Centre\n\nThere are many historical\nsights on Glasgow Green including the Templeton\nBusiness Centre built in 1839 as a\ncarpet factory and shown above. There is also the first civic Nelson\nMonument, started in 1806, and the Peoples Palace, opened in 1898, which\ncommemorates the history of Glasgow from 1750 to the present day. A picture\nand more details of the Nelson Monument\ncan be found on the page about the early history of\nGlasgow\nGolf Club.\n\nOne early visitor to Glasgow Green\nwas James Watt. In his account of\nhis invention of the improved steam engine, James Watt\nreferred to the 'Golf Course'\non Glasgow Green. While walking on Glasgow Green\none Sunday in 1765, he passed\nby the old washhouse\nand, before he had reached\nthe Golf Course,\nhe had developed a clear vision of the separate\nsteam condenser, which greatly\nimproved the efficiency of steam engines and thus began the industrial age.\nThe event is commemorated on the Green by the James Watt Boulder,\npictured above. Good job he was not hit by a golf ball."}
{"text":"Everyone who has ever played golf knows that there are certain rules of etiquette for the game.\n\nFor instance, you always replace your divots. You never walk on your playing partner's putting line. You let faster groups play through. You never stand on the green and figure out your score while another group is waiting to hit. Those are just a few of the rules of etiquette every golfer is expected to know and follow.\n\nThere also are rules of etiquette for spectators at a golf tournament. Fans are expected to behave in certain ways so they don't disturb the players or other spectators."}
{"text":"Golf\n\nHere are some golf fitness tips that can literally improve every aspect of your game \u2013 from the distance you hit your driver (and every other club for that matter) to the way you feel on and off the golf course.\n\nAsk most club-level golfers and they'll tell you that fitness for golf is the preserve of the world's top players looking for anything that will give them the slightest competitive edge. After all, they have time to spend hours at the gym each day and easy access to the best facilities and fitness coaches. But did you know that a simple home exercise routine, performed just 3 days a week with some basic, low cost equipment, can make a significant difference to your golf game?\n\n1. Increase their swing speed and therefore their average carry distance with every club in the bag.\n2. Improve their accuracy, hitting more shots out the middle of the club.\n3. Reduce their risk of injuries \u2013 particularly to the shoulders and back.\n4. Improve their overall health and energy levels and reduce the risk of serious illness.\n\nAnd best of all, the amateur golfers that took part in these studies didn't have to give up their life for exercise to improve their golf game and their health.\n\nIMPROVE YOUR GOLF-SPECIFIC STRENGTH\n\nA golf-specific strength training program has been shown to increase club head speed in amateur golfers. While golf isn't simply about how fast you can swing the club (or even how far you hit the ball), research shows that faster swing speeds result in lower handicaps.\n\nTo a lot of gym goers, strength training means pumping iron to exhaustion. It means completing lots of isolated exercises such as biceps curls and crunches in split routines (one or two body parts worked each day). But the key to remember is that strength training for golf is NOT the same as body building.\n\nFirstly, you should select exercises that mimic the movements and positions in golf. For example, rotational exercises that work the core region (such as 'wood chops') are more suitable than traditional sit ups or crunches. Likewise, squats or lunges are more beneficial to a golfer than seated leg extensions for example.\n\nSecondly, you should choose a wide variety of exercises that work all the major muscles groups each session (even those muscles that might not predominate in the golf swing). This helps to keep your body and your musculature balanced \u2013 imbalances lead to injury. Whereas a bodybuilder typically splits his or her routine into body parts (chest and shoulders one day, legs the next etc.), a total body routine is usually more suitable for a golfer.\n\nThirdly, you should incorporate exercises that strengthen your core region (stomach, lower back, hip region) and improve your posture. This will help to prevent injury and it will also allow you to make a more balanced, more controlled and more repeatable golf swing.\n\nIMPROVE YOUR GOLF-SPECIFIC FLEXIBILITY\n\nFlexibility is under-rated. Improving your flexibility will allow you to make a fuller turn with less effort during the backswing \u2013 and that means more power in your golf shots. It will help you get into the correct positions during the backswing \u2013 and that means greater accuracy and consistency in your golf shots.\n\nBut more than your ability to hit a golf ball further and with greater consistency, increased range of motion just makes you feel better. Reducing your muscle stiffness can reduce your risk of injury, such as muscle tears, and the right types of stretches can help to improve postural imbalances \u2013 a major cause of back problems.\n\nYou can improve your flexibility through a static stretching routine completed 3x a week. It's best to stretch when your body is warm after exercise. Focus on stretches to the shoulders, upper and lower back, hamstrings, quads and calves. You can hold each stretch for 15 seconds and complete it twice or hold for 30 seconds, completing each stretch once.\n\nThe time to avoid static stretching is immediately BEFORE a round of golf. Contrary to popular belief, there is no evidence to show that static stretching before a sporting activity reduces the risk of injury or improves performance (if anything, it's detrimental). What you can do pre-round is a series of dynamic stretches\u2026\n\nA dynamic stretch uses movement and momentum to bring about a stretch. A classic example is 'arm swings' \u2013 where you start with your arms out in a crucifix position and then swing them across your chest and then out again. This dynamically stretches the chest muscles.\n\nIMPROVE YOUR CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS\n\nCardiovascular exercise will help you to feel more focused and alert on the golf course. It reduces stress and will keep you feeling fresher in the latter stages of your round. If you struggle to maintain your concentration and enthusiasm for 18 holes CV exercise can help. But more importantly\u2026\n\nRegular cardiovascular exercise literally allows you to live longer and healthier. It reduces your risk of major illnesses (such as heart disease, stroke, certain cancers and type II diabetes) and it reduces high blood pressure \u2013 known as the 'silent killer' that affects about 25% of the adult population worldwide.\n\nIf you're short on time, you can structure golf strength exercises in a way that they improve your cardiovascular fitness as well. It's known as circuit training and it's one of the most efficient, time-friendly (and fun) types of exercise.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nResearch shows that a well-designed golf fitness program improves your golf game and lowers your scores, regardless of age or current handicap.\n\nCombining a program of golf-specific strength and flexibility exercises allows you to hit the ball further, more accurately and more consistently.\n\nUsing a circuit training set up allows you to improve your cardiovascular fitness as well. This can have a significant impact on your health as well as your golf.\n\nA golf fitness program doesn't have to take over your life. You'll see benefits from a 3-day per week routine, completed at home, without requiring any expensive exercise equipment."}
{"text":"Good Vibrations\n\nTitleist has updated its popular AP iron models. The multi-material irons, both dual cavity designs, will incorporate more tuned-in feel features, Titleist says.\n\nThe AP1 (the moniker stands for advanced performance) generates a higher ball flight and more shot forgiveness than its brother. The thinner face and larger cavity help with this, as does the hefty tungsten-nickel sole. There's also a combined aluminum-elastomer shock absorption mechanism behind the face; Titleist calls it the Tuned Feel System. The idea is to banish the unwanted vibrations so that only the good-feeling feedback makes it up to the player's hands. This feature goes back to the original plan for the AP line: Titleist said consumer research convinced the company to make performance irons that felt good, instead of clubs that worked well at the expense of feel.\n\nThe AP2 is the forged model, which Titleist figures will appeal to more skilled players. It also has a cavity-back design, the tungsten-nickel sole and the Tuned Feel System. But the slightly shorter head is closer to the classis shapes most skilled players grew up with, and the sole design is cambered in a way that encourages creative shotmaking."}

{"text":"Since the publication of Harvey Penick's Little Red Book, millions of golfers have learned why this gentle, wise teacher is a true national treasure. With simple, clear images and with words that wipe away decades of overly technical instruction, Harvey Penick brings out the best golfer in everyone he touches, but there is one group of pupils with whom Harvey has always had a special rapport.\n\nUnique among great golf teachers, Harvey has worked with and helped -- and learned from -- as many women champions as men. Of the thirteen women enshrined in the LPGA Hall of Fame, five worked with Harvey for a substantial period of time. But beyond these great players -- women like Mickey Wright, Sandra Palmer, Betsy Rawls, Kathy Whitworth, Judy Rankin, and Betty Jameson -- Harvey has taken as much pleasure in the accomplishments of the countless women who came to him hoping only to be able to hit the ball in the air for the very first time.\n\nIn For All Who Love the Game, Harvey shares the lessons he has learned from all the women he's watched in his seven decades of teaching the game he loves. He describes the techniques that can help women gain greater power, discusses the psychological hurdles some women must overcome to improve their game, and gives his tips for developing the parts of the game where women can and should outplay their male partners. He provides a clear image of the proper swing, gives advice on what equipment every woman should carry, and provides wisdom, inspiration, and sound instruction for anyone hoping to improve her game. With the same blend of sage advice and common sense that made his first two books such an essential part of every golfer's library, Harvey shows how every woman, whatever her other athletic gifts might be, can play great golf and enjoy it to its fullest.\n\nHarvey has often said that the day he stops learning is the day he'll quit teaching. Fortunately for us all, that day is still a long way in the future for America's best-loved teacher of the greatest game of all.\n\nDetails\n\nISBN: 9781439128732\n\nPublisher: Simon & Schuster\n\nDate: Nov 2011\n\nSeller Statement: Sold by Simon and Schuster Digital Sales Inc.\n\nCreators\n\nOther: Bud Shrake\nAuthor: Harvey Penick"}

{"text":"golf is the perfect sport to gamble as a player. when playing with friends and such, it is almost a crime not to have at the very least a small wager.\n\n1. This way is best for players of all skill level. Simply establish a $ per unit and play with odds. So you can bet them on the tee \"5\/1 that you make 5 or better\" etc. By the time you hole out, there could be 3 or 4 different bets.\n\nSince team A is in the lead overall they hit first on every tee. Team B has the option to \"press\", or double the scores before they hit their tee shots. After Team B hits their tee shots, team A has the option to \"re-press\", which again doubles the scoreone of the simplest and easy games that my buddies and I all play is to take the best person in the group and make them the #1 player.\n\nThen take the other three guys and decide who will be the #1's partner for holes 1-6, 7-12, 13-18. So basically you divide the round into 3 seperate 6 hole one better ball matches and decide your stakes. Typically we do $10 per match with each team having one press during the 6 hole stretch.\n\nThis is very easy to keep score and I think it keeps it fair for everyone involved. Saying that, my normal group is all 2-8 handicaps so it's always very fair.\n\nIf your group has two solid players and two average\/below average players then just seperate the two good players and put #1\/#4 together and #2\/#3 together and do a one better ball match play with each team having a press and decide your stakes...\n\nSet $ amounts per hole (carry overs do apply), per side, per entire 18, for birdies (x2 for eagles)\n\nAlso set $ amount for whatever TRASH variants you want. We usually play sandies, polies, hole outs, hitting the pin, birdies or better, GIR, closest to the pin on par 3's and par 5's (3rd shot) all count as dots.\n\nTrash not only rewards the better golfers but keeps the bad golfers in the mix for things as well.\n\nWe play a standard Scotch Game.\n2 man teams determined by the highest and lowest handicap followed by the other remaining players. If there less than a 10 stroke difference then we flip a golf tee for teams.\n\nAt the start of the round a predetermined (usually $1 or $2 per point per player) amount is determined per point. There are a total of 5 possible points that can be earned per hole\n2 points to the team with the player who had the low ball\n2 points to the team with the low total strokes for the team (subtracting handicap)\n1 point for the player who is closest to the pin in regulation (ie prox)\n\nNow the fun stuff. Example, game is $1\/pt. There are up to 2 presses per hole. For example Team 1 tees off and goes out of bounds, Team 2 can press the bet making it making it now $2 per point for the remainder of the hole. If the player on Team 2 hits a poor shot, Team 1 can now repress making it a total of $4 per point.\n\nA birdie will always double the points. Ie your team wins low ball, low total, and prox, you and your partner just won 10 pts each.\n\nWhichever team is up money, they must tee off first giving the other team an option to press.\n\nAt any point a team is down, they can \"cut the point.\" When the points are cut everything doubles. So in the earlier example when the game was $1\/pt, the game is now $2\/pt. That means when pressed it goes to $4, then $8 per point. The game gets very juicy fastWow, thanks guys! All excellent ideas. I'd heard of wolf before but I've never tried it since I wasn't sure exactly how it worked. I might try to work that into my round this Sunday.\n\nI play with my brother quite a lot and we just have a standing bet of $1 per hole, $1 birdies, sandies, $2 eagles and some other stuff, no carryovers. Since we're so close in skill level it keeps things interesting as we are always trying to one-up each other.\n\nHas anyone ever played bingo bango bongo? Thats another one I've heard of but never actually figured out.\n\nYou could play Low-Total. Two vs two. Each hole has two competitions - Low Score (Better Ball) & Best Team Total. Add in junk, and it's a good time. Using the 1&4 vs 2&3 method, you could use or ignore handicaps (your call).\n\nMy foursomes favorite game is six hole \"rabbit\". The object is to hold at least one 'rabbit leg' at the 6th, 12th, and 18th holes. You get a \"rabbit leg\" if you win a hole outright with handicap strokes. If nobody holds a \"leg\" after 6 or 12 each \"rabbit\" carrys over. It's a great game, especially when there's a \"tripple rabbit running\" on the 18th as there is a potential 12 unit swing on the line.\n\nMatch up the handicaps so that they are close to even, then use the low one for each pair.\n\nTwo points are available for match play on each hole, 2 for the win, one each for the tie. Handicap may come into play on a few holes, so add those strokes according to the hole handicap on the scorecard.\n\nSix points are available for the stroke play each nine. Low total (w\/handicap) wins the nine. 3 points each for a tie.\n\nScore it this way, it evens out handicap issues and won't kill golf fish like me when they snowman a par 3..."}

The higher balance point generates greater distance."}
{"text":"Well when if I get together with club golf is there's plenty of questions about putting and here are some of the frequently asked questions, but if you want a more specific answer to your own question why not go in the internet and go to the website  and perhaps there I can be more detailed in giving you a response to your questions.\n\nA very simple question is I'm missing my putts to the left or maybe I'm missing my putts to the right but I'm consistently missing in that direction. Well that's a simple question but the answer maybe more complex because there's one of 2 reasons why your putts could go right or left. It maybe the simple one of where the face is looking through impact or it might be the one where the path is traveling through impact or it might be a combination of the two.\n\nWell that's why my friends in the PGA can help you. Fellow PGA professionals would look at your swing, your stance and your\u2014the hole way you go about the stroking of the putt and tell you which is the one that's courting you to have your problems or maybe you're got to fix both together.\n\nNow remember an open face of the impact would always send the ball to the right of the hole and close face of impact will always send the ball to the left and a direction of the putt to the right, the ball is going to go to the right. To the left, the ball is going to the left. It is when this mixes and matches in the swing that it gets more complicated and if your stroke is a mix of match you might have problems that only a pro can fix for you."}

{"text":"Yes, I owe you two dollars and no I did not finish. I threw the last hole but did not putt out if you remember. I was running late and had to get out of there.\n\nYes, the card you are speaking of was WAY slow. The biggest problem wasn't the players but having 5 on the card is ridiculous. That one extra player will add 3-5 minutes per hole x 18 holes = 55 - 90 minutes and it **** sure felt like it. They started 20 minutes ahead of us and we caught them after 7 holes, then it was throw, putt and wait. Throw, putt and wait. Every freaking hole and it wasn't just the group but the size of the group and then having to wait on pedestrians also. With less than 40 players there shouldn't be any more than 4 per card and 3 would be ideal. Not the TDs fault, flex starts are designed to make it easier on the players but it actually makes it harder on the TD with mixed divisions and cards going out one after the other. Plus he can't control what hole they start on. You have groups starting on 1, 8, 9 10, just all over the place and if a backup starts it just gets worse with every hole.\n\nI know after last night, I will make sure in Owasso that there are no more five somes out on the course. All cards will either be 3 or 4 players, no more than that. I don't play when i TD, so its hard to tell just what the backups are but its a simple math fact, less players per card should mean less time per card per hole."}

The theory is that the less ball-tee contact, the less friction, which in turn translates into longer (and straighter) tee shots. I suspect that some of the positive results are caused by the \"placebo effect\" of using something that is supposed to help. My feeling is these products are gimmicks designed to separate golfers from their money but I am willing to listen to opposing views. Anyone have a positive spin to this subject."}

You will learn how to keep the club head moving down your target line for straighter shots.\n\nJune 9th, 2011\n\nSwing: Keep your back at the target as long as possible on the downswing especially if you have to tendency to slice the ball.\n\nJune 2nd, 2011\n\nSwing: Make the grip end of the shaft point directly at the target line halfway back in the backswing to produce better path and better shots.\n\nMay 26th, 2011\n\nSwing: Swing the club 10 times a day with our right hand only. Then swing the club ten times a day with your left hand only. You will gain better feel of where the club should be during the swing and you will gain better rhythm.\n\nMay 19th, 2011\n\nSwing: To produce a consistent strike, practice hitting a spot in the same place on the ground for every swing.\n\nMay 12th, 2011\n\nSwing: Allow your body to react to the swinging of the club.\n\nMay 5th, 2011\n\nPosture: Focus your eyes on the back of the ball until after the strike.\n\nApril 28th, 2011\n\nSwing: During the backswing, turn your chest away from the target, and on the follow through, turn our chest toward the target.\n\nApril 21st, 2011\n\nPosture: Distribute your weight evenly between both your feet to promote good balance during the swinging motion.\n\nApril 14th, 2011\n\nSwing: Hold your finish for the count of four or until the ball lands to produce better balance and greater club head speed.\n\nApril 7th, 2011\n\nPosture: Set the inside of your heels shoulder width apart for stability and balance. If you have a bad lower back widen your stance slightly farther than shoulder width apart.\n\nMarch 31st, 2011\n\nSwing: During your swing, rock on your back foot on the backswing and rock on your forward foot through the downswing.\n\nMarch 24th, 2011\n\nPosture: When addressing the ball, tilt forward from the hips until your sternum points at the ball.\n\nMarch 17th, 2011\n\nSwing: A ball that starts to the right of your target means your club worked to the right of your target line at impact. A ball that starts to the left of your target line means your club worked to the left of your target line at impact.\n\nMarch 10th, 2011\n\nPosture: At address, as a right handed player your right shoulder will sit slightly lower than your left shoulder.\n\nMarch 3rd, 2011\n\nSwing: At impact, the arm closest to the target should be straight and the grip of the club should be slightly ahead of the ball.\n\nFebruary 24th, 2011\n\nBall Position: To play a low running shot, play the ball near the foot farthest from the target.\n\nFebruary 17th, 2011\n\nGrip: Your left index finger and your left thumb stay together on the club and your right index finger and your right thumb stay together on the club. Keep the line between the two together without gaps.\n\nFebruary 10th, 2011\n\nPosture: As a right handed player, set your left arm straight forming a straight line from your shoulder to the ball.\n\nFebruary 3rd, 2011\n\nSwing: Keep your balance. To practice balanced swings, pretend to throw a ball over-hand and hold the finish position. Your finish should result in having your weight solidly on the foot closest to the target while the trailing foot has the heel up with the toe on the ground vertically.\n\nJanuary 27th, 2011\n\nBall Position: For your driver, play the ball just forward of your left pinkie toe.\n\nJanuary 20th, 2011\n\nGrip: To test grip pressure, hold the club straight out in front of you. At this level you have to grip too tightly. Then hold the club straight up and down vertically. At this level you hold the club too lightly. However, when you put the club in between the two that is the perfect grip pressure.\n\nJanuary 13th, 2011\n\nPosture: Think of a rod though your spine running from the bottom of your neck to your tail bone for the best posture.\n\nJanuary 6th, 2011\n\nSwing: Make your swing have a beat, one and two or back and through produces shots with rhythm and tempo. Those shots have a much better chance of hitting the middle of the clubface.\n\nDecember 30th, 2010\n\nBall Position: For your fairway woods, play the ball off your left instep.\n\nDecember 23rd, 2010\n\nGrip: As a right handed player, your right hand should hold the grip in the tips of the fingers.\n\nDecember 16th, 2010\n\nDecember 9th, 2010\n\nSwing: Think of your golf swing as an imaginary wheel. Allow the club head to swing on the arc of the wheel. Pulling the club head toward the center of the wheel at any point during the swing will result in off-center hits.\n\nDecember 2nd, 2010\n\nBall Position: For your hybrids, the ball should be one ball inside your left instep.\n\nNovember 25th, 2010\n\nGrip: Your palms should face each other on the club whether you have a strong, neutral or weak grip.\n\nNovember 18th, 2010\n\nSwing: Clubface controls direction over path. Work on squaring the clubface at address by making the club impact the ball at a 90 degree angle to the target line. You will hit straighter shots.\n\nNovember 11th, 2010\n\nPosture: Butt up, back pockets to the sky and make your hip bones point down for the best ball striking.\n\nNovember 4th, 2010\n\nBall Position: For your irons, the ball starts in the center of your stance for your wedges then move the ball incrementally forward by a half a ball as you increase the club you use.\n\nOctober 28th, 2010\n\nGrip: If you wear out your glove in the palm of your hand, you need to improve your grip. Move the grip until your fingers of the left hand are on a diagonal from the index finger to the pinky.\n\nOctober 21st, 2010\n\nPosture: Check that you can see your shins once you are ready to hit.

In small towns, membership in the country club is often not as exclusive or expensive as in larger cities where there is competition for a limited number of memberships. In addition to the fees, some clubs have additional requirements to join. For example, membership can be limited to those who reside in a particular housing community. Historically, many country clubs refused to admit members of minority racial groups, such asindividuals. In many jurisdictions, such discriminatory requirements are now prohibited, but in others, such policies are still legal or are subject to specific circumstances. In some cases, lawsuits have forced clubs to drop discriminatory policies.\nIn one example, in 1990 professional golfer Tom Watson\n\nTom Watson (golfer)\n\nThomas Sturges Watson is an American professional golfer who has played on the PGA Tour and now mostly on the Champions Tour....\n\nThe Kansas City Country Club, founded in 1896, is a country club in Mission Hills, Kansas, USA, an affluent suburb of Kansas City, Missouri.

{"text":"Grip\n\nBen Hogan wrote that the grip is the first building block of the swing. There are several different types of grips, but the most important aspect is how \"strong\" the grip is. In a neutral grip, the thumbs are both on top of the club's cushioned grip; a strong grip rotates the thumbs slightly away from the target. You want to keep your forearms as relaxed as possible without losing control of the club\u2013this makes it easier to develop power during the takeaway.\n\nAddress & Alignment\n\nAnnika Sorenstam spent many pages in her book, \"Golf Annika's Way,\" teaching proper address and alignment. How you address the ball and align your body does much to determine where the ball goes when you hit it. Your knees are flexed and your body bent forward slightly from the waist, with your weight over the balls of your feet. Imagine a line running through the golf ball to your target (your target line); for a normal shot you want imaginary lines running through your feet, knees, hips and shoulders to be parallel to that line.\n\nTakeaway\n\nThe takeaway is the critical start of the swing, and teachers such as Manuel de la Torre spend a great deal of time on it. Rather than just lifting up your hands and the club, you want to turn your shoulders to swing them away from the ball. This \"upper body coil\" is critical to developing power in the swing, as well as getting your arms, hands and club on a good swing path or \"plane.\" At the top of the swing, your shoulders are turned nearly perpendicular to the target line.\n\nChange of Direction\n\nThe change of direction is where you find the most differences among teachers. However, a good way to start down properly is to feel that your coiled shoulders and hips start the downswing at the same time. (The hips actually start first, but feeling as if they start together prevents many swing problems before they start.) Your spine angle remains fairly constant\u2013you do not bob up and down as you swing\u2013and starting down completes your wrist cock. It feels as if your weight moves from your back foot to your front foot as you start down.\n\nImpact and Finish\n\nAs the club reaches the ball, your wrists uncock with a snapping motion (think of how a flyswatter smacks a fly) and send the ball flying toward the target. Then the momentum of the swing and the weight of the club cause your body to continue turning until your navel is facing the target and the club swings around, causing your arms to fold the club over your shoulder in the familiar finish position.\n\nIf you are looking to purchase property in any of the wonderful golf course communities in Southwest Florida, it is first wise to educate yourself in the purchase options available. While you will have to select the perfect community for your family along with the ideal home, choices will also have to be made involving golf club membership. Golf course communities in the region generally sell property with either an equity or bundled golf option.\n\nAn equity membership in a golf course community means that even if a home is purchased within the community that a membership to play will also be required. The membership is generally optional for residents and is paid on an annual basis. While looking at equity membership communities, be sure to check if there are additional fees such as greens, trails, or cart fees.\n\nA bundled golf option implies that a golf membership is included with the purchase of a home within golf course communities. Bonita Spring and Estero communities are well known for bundled options. While a bundled option does come with its own set of privileges, if you are not an avid golfer an equity community may be a better home purchase option. Generally, members of bundled golf course communities are expected to pay an annual fee, which varies by community.\n\nThroughout the Bonita Springs area many great values can be found on golf course community homes. Currently, realtors in the area are seeing a good deal of foreclosure sales and short sales at very low prices. The cities golf course communities are also seeing an influx of sales of investment properties. Bonita Springs sees 344 days of sunshine a year making it a popular vacation destination for golfers which drives the increasingly popular property investment market.\n\nIf you are looking for your dream home with a golf course setting the communities of Bonita Springs and Estero are sure to please. Popular communities in the cities include Highland Woods Golf & Country Club, Spring Run at The Brooks, and Pelican Sound."}

{"text":"photo credit: foxypar4 The USGA Rules of Golf can be quite complicated at times. Here are some to be aware of:\nNo. 1 \u2013 Brush away dew from around your ball except on the tee and it's a 2 stroke penalty.\nNo. 2 \u2013 Lift your ball to identify it anywhere on the course, tell your opponent first \u2013 no penalty.\nNo. 3 \u2013 You may clean your ball at any time after it has been lifted except if it is unfit to play.\nNo. 4 \u2013 If your ball lies against a rake in a bunker, the rake may be removed with no penalty.\nNo. 5 \u2013 Any reasonable item can be used to mark your ball: tee, repair tool, toe of club etc. Check out the rules of golf at \n\nBad practice habits contribute to poor play. Your practice sessions should be very methodical. It's a major mistake to start your practice sessions off with the driver. Since golf is a game of touch you want to begin with short pitches with your wedge to enhance your feel and timing.\n\nPGA Tour Players always start their practice sessions with a wedge then graduate up to a 9, 8, 7, etc. After hitting their irons they will use their fairway woods. Once finished with the woods they will hit several more short and medium pitch shots and then on to the putting green.\n\nBy replicating their method you will have a greater sense of feel and touch for all your golf shots. Practice smart and improve your play dramatically.\n\nphoto credit: danperry.com Golf carts are usually not allowed anywhere near the greens which means it could be a lengthly walk to the green. If your shot is not on the green you take both your putter and wedge for convenience.\n\nWhen the hole is finished you walk off the green, place your putter in your golf bag and drive off. The next time you need your wedge it's missing, it was left where you last used it. There is an ultra simple way to prevent this from happening.\n\nPlay your wedge shot and then place your wedge somewhere on the green directly between the cup and your cart. Once the hole is completed you will find your club as you walk back to the cart. A simple solution to an old problem!\n\nphoto credit: mandj98 Some golfers have a natural tendency to hit a draw or a fade even though most players actually have to learn to hit one or the other. If you are able to manage both how do you decide which one to hit?\n\nThere are many factors in the decision to hit a draw or fade: are you playing a dogleg, what is the wind direction, is your ball in the fairway or rough, what are the hazard locations (if any) and where is the pin located?\n\nLee Trevino's favorite shot was the fade which he hit consistently. Generally though, the draw is favored by most Professional golfers because they claim they have better control with that type of shot. Learn one or the other, or both and watch your handicap plummet!\n\nphoto credit: diluviTry using more hip and shoulder turn to increase your shot distance. Many amateurs make the mistake of swinging primarily with their arms. Power is generated from the proper shoulder and hip turn away from the golf ball.\n\nToo many amateurs think that \"strong arming\" the ball is the way to more distance but nothing could be farther from the truth. During the backswing the shoulders should make a full turn and face away from the target. The hips also make the turn away from the target although not nearly as far as the shoulders. In order to achieve clubhead speed you need leverage which can only be created from a good body turn.\n\nDuring the swing your arms should remain passive for much greater shot distance.\n\nphoto credit: mahalieWhat can you expect from your golf instructor? You should expect patience, understanding, a willingness to help and real devotion to you as a student. Yes, that's right, your golf instructor should be all of the above and if he or she is not, you need to find one who is.\n\nA good instructor is patient and should display a sincere willingness to help you. Your instructor should understand that you are a student, nothing more. There shoud be a keen interest in making you a better player. If you are taking one hour lessons and your teacher stops at exactly one hour even if you are still trying to work something out, it's time to get a new one. Oh, one last thing, instructors can't make you practice, they are not magicians. Need I say more!\n\nphoto credit: Pierre -M- Most amateurs do not align themselves properly. Let's start with the ball position. The ball should be one ball width left of center in your stance. When looking down at the ball your left eye (right handed players) should be one inch on the inside and one inch behind your ball (drop a ball while in the address position to test this).\n\nKeep your shoulders level to prevent your right should from coming over the top during the forward swing. Make sure your feet, knees, hips and shoulders are perfectly square to the target. Stay completely motionless when striking the ball and make sure your grip is correct Practice these tips and putt for doe, not for show !\n\n\n\nMerion C.C. 1950\nBen Hogan was one shot behind Lloyd Mangrum on the 16th hole of the U.S. Open playoff. Lloyd Mangrum was about to putt when he noticed a bug on his golf ball. Without thinking, he picked up the ball and blew the insect away. Mangrum incurred a two-shot penalty for lifting and cleaning his ball which was against the rules at that time. Hogan went on to win the playoff.\n\nCanterbury C.C. 1940\nA storm was brewing before the final round of a major when Porky Oliver and five other Pro's rushed to the first tee ahead of their starting times, there was no official there to stop them.

The purpose of gamesmanship is take slow your opponent's momentum, in other words, to make them falter. Now even though some may consider this unsportsmanship-like, it is done frequently at all levels including on the PGA Tour.\n\nSerious concentration is the primary reason why PGA Tour Pro's walk around like zombies (no ill intentions here). They maintain this frame of mind for two reasons, they are concentrating on their own play and they are blocking out distractions. In spite of their expertise, the Pro's are still subject to gamesmanship from their opponents.\n\nOne of the best examples of gamesmanship is when Lee Trevino threw a rubber snake at Jack Nicklaus on the first tee of the U.S. Open playoff at Merion.

{"text":"The more consistent your swing plane is the more consistent your ball flight will be. The more consistent your ball flight is the lower your scores will be. But just what is swing plane?\n\nA swing plane is the path that the clubhead takes around your body. A perfect swing plane would be if the clubhead was on the same exact path on the downswing as it was on the backswing. Sam Snead probably came as close to achieving that as any golfer in history.\n\nNo two swing planes are the same because no two bodies are the same. You can find your swing plane by holding the club straight out in front of you and rotating your hands and arms around your body keeping the rotation perfectly level.\n\nTilt this plane until your clubhead touches the ground and do the same rotation around your body.\n\nBy maintaining your posture or spine angle throughout the motion you will achieve a consistent swing plane.\n\nIf your swing plane fits your body type and posture, you will be very consistent in your ball striking. If you are on-plane throughout your swing and you have the proper grip, you can develop a powerful swing.\n\nBy being on-plane, the back of your left hand (or right hand for lefties) will be facing the target for a millisecond at impact, and you can use your other hand for maximum power. There always has been the belief by many that golf is a one-handed game, and that too much right hand will hook the ball. This is true \u2014 if you do not stay on-plane.\n\nThe top hand controls the swing path and keeps you on-plane, but the bottom hand gives you the added power you are looking for."}

{"text":"If we counted the actual date, the ratings of everyone who didn't play for a year would disappear. Each player has their own 12-month timetable for ratings based on the date of their most recently rated round. And their rating won't change as the calendar moves forward until they play another rated round.\n\nNope. If your most recent event rated is one that usually occurs on the same weekend the year before, it will naturally be included because the (typically) Saturdays will be exactly 365 days (366 days in leap year) apart and within the 12 month range used for ratings.\n\nI have a question Chuck, at TX States this weekend there were 9 1000+ rounds the 1st round, 8 the 2nd and only 5 in the final round which was 24 holes in 30mph wind.\n\nThe rounds varied from 1092-1002 the 1st, 1045-1008 the 2nd, and 1044-1003 the last round with an SSA of 80-81. My question is why the hot score the last round was 1044 which was a great score in howling wind and there were only 5 1000 rounds carded vs 8-9 in the 1st two rounds?\n\nThe Int. division played earlier in the morning with probably 10-15mph winds but at 30 even 7ft putts were scary and the OB was even harder to aviod. The 1st round I played like poo but the last felt better even though the rating is 8 points lower. Coda's 1044 was better than the 1045 the 2nd round and I feel that this is another case of ratings needed to be broken up into groups when using tee times.\n\n__________________\nSouthern Nationals - best events for players who like a true \"Non-profit\" and a real Finale Would it make sense then to break up ratings based on pools regardless of how close the SSA may have been between the two. The tee times ranged from 7:35 to 12;05 with the wind not breaking 10mph until 10am and at 12 it was This has happened the past 3 years and it would seem a refined ratings structure would take thiese variances into effect when instead there is a 2 stroke leeway given when the courses plau totallly different within each pool.\n\nIn my opinion there needs to be some acknoledgement given for changes like today when at 9am a 1000 rated player could hit 70-75% from 30ft and at 12-4 that went to about 25% with most being lucky to hit 70% from 12ft. When players are triple putting from within the circle on every hole vs morning rounds where not only putting but driving was easier it would seem a system which now plays a key role in determining the POY and ROY would have a way to show such differences.\n\n400ft was crazy distance with 340ft being pretty good into the 35mph gusts with most players flipping over within 300ft.......950+ golfers when in the morning an Int player could throw that with ease!\n\n__________________\nSouthern Nationals - best events for players who like a true \"Non-profit\" and a real Finale \n\nYou're trying to fix the wrong thing. If the format were made more fair then the ratings would also be more fair. Gentry doesn't want us to do the ratings manually just for TDs who get their arm twisted to do the work. It needs to be part of the TD report for everyone who has tee times to report them properly or 20 rounds, it evens out. If it doesn't even out over 10 or 20 rounds, God is out to get you, and there's nothing we can do about that either or 20 rounds, it evens out. If it doesn't even out over 10 or 20 rounds, God is out to get you, and there's nothing we can do about that either.\n\nSame golfers, who the 1st two rounds had a combined 17 1000 rated rounds (1 out of 4 scores) turn in only 5 1000+ rounds in the final....they must have played worse right?\n\nFrom what I saw this wasn't true and actually my 1st round felt the worst by far considering I was 5 back of an ADV guy who had bumped up after 3 holes and after 8 I was 8 back of Dixon.\n\nCoda's +1 (par 3's) was 5+ strokes better than all but one person in the division (another 1020 player) yet he gets a 1044 because the ratings system is so primitive it cannot even separate groups to account for basically groups playing two different courses.\n\nIn no wind I would have expected to shoot 8 strokes better and I feel that most others would have chopped off the same amount and if you looka at the rec\/int ratings you can see that they all came out on the highside of their current rating.\n\nI think the worst part is that it is known to happen yet Chuck finds a way to make the course play within 2 SSA points (in the case I don't see how it is possible) and if the rating is within 20pts then everything is fine.\n\nIt seems over the years that I can guess within 5 pts of the correct rating for a round 90% of the time and yet the system itself is continuing to be faulted by using information that would be thrown out of a high school science lab and instead of fixing the problem which wouldn't be a hard as many PDGA issues Chuck basically says that skewed ratings are just part of the game like spit-outs......\n\n__________________\nSouthern Nationals - best events for players who like a true \"Non-profit\" and a real Finale Climo shot a sick round but it was also rated as such (1083) while the hot round at the event I a referencing was 1044 with 1\/2 as many 1000 rated rounds compared to the 1st and 2nd round.\n\nWhat I am talking about it ratings not reflecting how good someone actually shot. I saw 20 putts missed within 15ft on just 2-3 cards and for Coda to shoot a 55 on the Wilmont and Finish at even on the final 6 was pretty stellar.\n\nThis is on the same lines as Olse's 55 at Manor which beat a 999 rated round by 9 strokes and was only rated a 1060.......we played VERY well in best score doubles and only bested his singles score by 2 strokes.\n\nThe fact there needs to be highest rated rounds based on differing SSA shows that the system is not perfect and that a sliding scale could show how great of a round someone really shot.\n\nPS I played like poo the 1st round with my 1st 8 holes being around 930 level golf and it was rated 1011 in the end with Miles' round being 1092. The last round I played solid for 20 out of 24 holes and rated 8 points lower than the 1st ugly round.\n\nDevan's 78-1015 was more of a 1025-1030 round with the rest of us being off by about 10-15 as well.\n\n__________________\nSouthern Nationals - best events for players who like a true \"Non-profit\" and a real Finale Yet had the event used tee times all the rounds would have been rated in a way that would not reflect how someone played accurately.\n\nWe basically played a course that was 8 strokes harder than the Ints yet the round was rated as if everyone was playing on equal footing.\n\nMy whole beef is that there should be a simple way to include these differences in ratings. This was discussed recently in regards to the Memorial with the wind being higher in the afternoon and many feeling the ratings were skewed based on tee time. I checked the data from that day and the wind we had this weekend was 10+ mph more than at the Memorial with sustained 24-28 and plenty of gusts at 35mph on a wide open course.\n\nThe majority of Rec and Int players played above their rating while the majority of Adv\/Pro players played below their rating and it isn't just a coincidence.\n\nWith all this said I personally used to be obsessed with the ratings but have, over time, realized they really mean nothing when it comes down to it as we are all hobbyists and it isn't like this is a professional sport. That reason alone isn't ewnough to keep the system from being improved to treat differing SSAs, conditions, and scoring spreads equally.\n\nThe ratings need to find a way to incorporate these into the system along with scores from the event instead of relying on just what a few players shot. I have seen too many rounds were everyone played bad but since there were 1000+ players the ratings were pulled up a bit while at the same time there are events where many players shoot outstanding but in doing so the ratings are deflated due to the fact the ratings system calculates that to mean the course was easier when in fact it may not have been and there were just some great rounds.\n\n__________________\nSouthern Nationals - best events for players who like a true \"Non-profit\" and a real Finale \n\nWe basically played a course that was 8 strokes harder than the Ints yet the round was rated as if everyone was playing on equal footingNot as much change within the division but there was an undisputed difference between the 1st pool on the course and the 2nd.\n\nI am not saying we need to rate hour by hour but breaking the day into 2-3 ratings brackets would do a lot to help fix the problem.\n\n__________________\nSouthern Nationals - best events for players who like a true \"Non-profit\" and a real Finale \n\nI would say if there's enough difference in SSAs (say 2 throws) to do the ratings separately among different groups in the SAME division, it's enough that the round results should be thrown out. Two throws is more than one unlucky spit."}

{"text":"For those of us that want to improve our game, golf putting tips are essential. While there are a number of things we can learn to improve our game using some of the techniques that the big shots in the PGA use, it is also important to note that the single best thing that a new golfer can do is practice every day. With that in mind, let's dive right into the golf putting tips we have.\n\nAs you might be aware, putting is one of the most important shots a golfer can learn. When you improve how you putt, you can knock stroke points off your final score.\n\nEyes on the ball\n\nThe first tip to share is that you must place your eyes directly over the ball. This is the same as looking down a cue stick in pool, or aiming with a racket in tennis. Prepare your stance, and hold the ball in front of your face, then drop it. If your eyes remain over the ball, you should be able to putt it with no problem.\n\nStrong Base\n\nAnother important factor to consider is your base. Some individuals don't keep it firm enough. Your legs should be just wide enough that your body becomes stabilized, and that you are able to successfully follow through.\n\nBefore we leave the golf putting tips on stance, we must look at one more important factor, and that is that your arms are correctly lined up. Your arms must line up with the hole you are playing towards directly. How accurate this line is will directly influence your back stroke's quality.\n\nWhen you have accomplished this, you are ready to move forward with the golf putting tips. Remember, that each of these will take practice to master, and these can often be done in the comfort of your backyard, as well as on the golf course.\n\nChoice of Putter\n\nTake note of this, as it is very important. The putter you use will determine the success of your stroke. This means, using the wrong putter, will create an inferior swing. For example, if you use a blade putter, you must make sure that your stroke is inside during the backswing and follow through. I'm partial to this putter.\n\nThe Putt Stroke\n\nAnother important factor in the golf putting tips is that your wrists are not part of your putt. Your entire arms, hands and shoulders should move together as a single unit to ensure that the stoke is effective. Otherwise, you end up looking like a mess, and your score is negatively impacted by the action.\n\nWith this in mind, you should ensure your head remains still. You don't want your entire head to swing as you swing. Listen to what is going on around you, and wait to hear the ball hit the hole, your head movement can alter your putt significantly.\n\nSomething else to keep in mind is that you want an even stroke. To do this, your putter should swing back as far as it swings forward. This smooth acceleration will help you to get the best shot possible. If you find this to be difficult, you can try doing it in a counting fashion. Count, one then two back and swing forward one and then two. Keeping your rhythm here will ensure an effective result.\n\nA problem many people have is not putting correctly as well. Any putt that is done within 20 feet of the hole should end up past the hole. If you aren't hitting it within 18 inches, your putt might not be as effective as you would like it to be.\n\nOne other thing for golf putting tips that might help you is that there is a distance between the hold and edges of the green. You should eyeball it every time that you putt. Your goal is to figure out the power it would take to make half that distance, practice on your own at some point to give you an idea of what it will take.\n\nRemember, that if you following these golf putting tips, you should find that your score will improve as you end up becoming more effective using the putter on the course. Make sure you take the time and put the effort into your practice to find the best success possible.\n\nName some things that you have never seen in one of your friends or relative's homes and chances are artificial putting greens will make the list. Unless they live directly on a golf course, most people cannot claim to walk out their back door to practice their swing. Taking it even further, very few people have a putting green inside their home where they can practice at any time of the day or year.\n\nThis is why artificial putting greens are becoming so popular today. They are changing the way avid golfers practice their skills and could be responsible for the next big golf star since they give users unlimited practice time!\n\nWhat are Artificial Putting Greens?\n\nArtificial putting greens look like the greens you tee off on at the golf course and function in exactly the same way, but they are made of artificial materials rather than real grass. While it would take a lot of money and tons of time to make a real putting green in your backyard and putting a real one is not possible inside your house, you can put artificial putting greens wherever you want them at much less expense.\n\nDepending on the type of artificial green you select, you can save a lot of money and completely transform your home or backyard in very little time. These products make it possible to walk out your back door or into your own basement and practice your golf skills whenever it fits into your schedule. This is the big allure of artificial putting greens today.\n\nTypes of Artificial Putting Greens\n\nJust as you can find different sized and shaped putting greens on a golf or miniature golf course, you can find a variety of different artificial putting greens on the market today. There are primarily three different categories to select from:\n\nStandard Greens: These greens are made in specific shapes and sizes so you can quickly purchase them, have them delivered, and follow easy steps to put them together on your own. There is no way to customize them. These are the more affordable alternative for recreational home use.\n\nProfessional Greens: These greens are larger in size and can be designed to closely mimic real outdoor golf courses. You will need more space to accommodate these artificial putting greens and they can be installed indoors or out.\n\nDesigner\/Customized Greens: These are the greens that give you complete freedom to create the perfect golfing space in your own backyard. If you want the absolute best of the best, then go for designer greens that deliver a real golfing experience. If you want something customized to your own home you can get professionals to do the designing for that project as well.\n\nWhich type of artificial putting greens you select determines on your budget and the amount of space you have to devote to this project. Smaller spaces and\/or budgets will require the standard greens while larger spaces and\/or budgets can accommodate the other options.\n\nTo get the most out of your chosen artificial putting greens, pay careful attention to the materials used to create the green and how the green is secured to the ground or your floor. You should be offered a special matting material that goes under the green to deliver the real feel of a golf course. Without that, the feel may be less than authentic.\n\nDo you want to be the envy of all your friends, clients, and business partners? Of course you do, and the best way to \"one-up\" everyone else is to have your own backyard putting green installed. Rather than taking a client to the local golf club you can just invite them over for some wine, good food, and a private putting green right out your back door.\n\nNo, you don't have to live right on the golf course to make this happen! You just have to work with professional designers of artificial backyard putting green products. They can ship you standard artificial sets that allow you to create your own golfing areas very quickly or they can send the pros to your home to help you create an entire golf course for your own personal use.\n\n1. Determine what areas of your backyard you would like to devote to the putting green.\n\nThe first step is to have an open discussion with others living in your home to determine who much space and exactly what area of the backyard you could give up for a backyard putting green. Consider all other uses for your backyard space and make sure you still have room for entertaining, relaxation, and other activities that you or your family enjoys doing in the backyard.\n\n2. Ensure that you have suitable terrain in this area.\n\nOnce you know which area of the yard would be best for your putting green, look it over and make sure it is relatively flat or maybe slightly sloped if that is the type of green that you would like to create. The area will of course need cleared of trees and other obstacles. If you think some landscaping will be needed to make the areas suitable for this project make sure to include that into the price tag and time table for the overall project.\n\n3. Shop around for the sizes and shapes that could be accommodated in your space.\n\nThis is the fun part. Start shopping around to find artificial putting greens that can fit well into the space you have available. The next step will help with this.\n\nYou will need to determine whether you want to purchase pre-manufactured putting green sets that are fast and easy to set up or you want to have something customized to your backyard and your standards. This will be a matter of budget for most people, so price all possible options either way to come to a determination here.\n\n5. Determine whether you can do your own installation or will need a pro.\n\nUltimately, your choice of a customized professional backyard putting green and something smaller and easier to install comes down to whether you want to put it in yourself or leave the work to someone else. It is much cheaper to do it yourself, but having someone else take over is easier.\n\nFinally, find a very high quality backyard putting green made from durable, high quality synthetic materials. It is critical that you don't make a snap decision and find a green that is going to withstand vigorous practice with regular and appropriate care. Read reviews of individual greens to find products that have worked well for others.\n\nHave you ever wished that you could get in more golf time without making your spouse angry or giving up time with your children? Have you ever thought that you could make a lasting impression on your golfing buds if you just had some time to practice putting in private without everyone watching? If so, then your dreams just may come true with portable putting green products.\n\nA portable putting green has many advantages over the golf courses that you typically practice on:\n\n1. They are extremely easy to install and uninstall wherever you want to practice.\n\n2. They are very affordable and only take a one-time fee.\n\n3. They can be taken with you when you move to a new house, so you are never forced to have new ones installed.\n\n4. They allow you to practice in complete privacy.\n\nAnyone who has the money, space and time can have a real golf course putting green installed in their backyard or even in their basement or gaming room. The difference here is that a portable putting green is not a permanent structure in your home. You can take it apart and install it wherever you want, so you never lose your money or have to create a new one if you move or just decide to start practicing elsewhere.\n\nThe biggest value in purchasing a portable putting green is the ability to practice whenever and wherever you want without leaving your family and other loved ones behind. If you want to get your spouse off your back but aren't willing to give up the game you love, then this is a great alternative.\n\nSimilarly, if you want to practice more but also want to spend time with your children, you could merge the two together by teaching your children to play on your private portable putting green. This allows them to learn something new, bond with you, and learn to be competitive and work hard to develop new skills.\n\nThere is a lot to be gained from children learning the game of golf! Besides being a lot of fun, it helps them learn to focus and really strive to get better at something that requires great skill. It can also help with mental development since golf is very much a mental game.\n\nPlus, it's fun, keeps you physically active, and reduces stress. It is one of the healthiest things you could ever do for your home.\n\nYou can also save money by purchasing a high quality portable putting green. Rather than paying high fees at a golf or country club or paying every time you want to get in a bit of practice you could practice right in your own home. You won't even have to pay someone to set it up since most standard residential greens are very easy to put together on your own.\n\nWith a portable putting green you pay one time for the green and never have to pay to practice again! Just make sure that you purchase from a top manufacturer and read online reviews. This will ensure that you get a high quality product that mimics the feel of a real golf course. A portable putting green that is well made will last for many years and provide hour upon hour of enjoyment.\n\nThere has always been a question of where the first game of golf took place. It's said that something resembling the sport was first introduced in the Netherlands on February 26, 1297. However, Scotland is still accepted by many as the origin of Golf thanks to the evidence of the first permanent golf course. In fact, the first membership, clubs, and written rules were established there.\n\nFive years ago (2005), Professor Ling Hongling of Lanzhou University was set on disputing these claims. This was based off of new evidence about 500 years before Scotland's initial game.\n\nAfter much debate it was still found that Scotland would reign as the inventors of the game. The most notable point was that the game we know today is much more similar to what was played on the eastern coast of Scotland. Eventually golf was introduced to England and everywhere else in the world.\n\nHow did the Sport get the name; Golf?\n\nThis came forth due to Scottish words; goulf or gowf. The meaning behind them is \"strike off\" or \"cuff.\" The word \"gouf\"\nwas originally mentioned in a Scottish statue that was on prohibited games. Then again, some believe it originated from the Dutch word; kolf. This refers to a bat or club.\n\nWhere was the 1st course located?\n\nYou could find the first golf venue in Leith, which is close to Edinburgh.\n\nWhat is the name of the first club?\n\nBack in 1744, the Gentlemen Golfers of Leith was created. It held a yearly golf competition, but in 1768 the name was changed to Honourable Company of Edinburgh.\n\nHow did the 1st golf rules develop?\n\nThe members of the Gentlemen Golfers of Leith played with rules drafted by Duncan Forbes. He initially governed the play of the members.\n\nAround the 13th century, the game that those of the Netherlands played used a stick with a leather ball. The goal was to hit the ball and putt it into the hole. The first one to do so became the winner. Keep in mind the hole was still hundreds of yards away like it is today.\n\nIn China a wealthier game developed that used 10 clubs that all looked like present-day drivers. However, these were etched out in gold and jade. The goal in this game was also a hole in the ground.\n\nScotland offered a game similar with a total of 18 holes. This is one of the many reasons why Scotland is still considered the birthplace of golf today.\n\nYou probably know what a putting mat is, but are you wondering why you would actually want to spend money on one? You are right where millions of other people have been just before they purchased their very first putting mat. Ask yourself the following five questions to determine if a personal mat would benefit your home and lifestyle.\n\n1. Do you need a better way to relax and distress?\n\nRelaxing and getting rid of stress is one of the best uses for a residential or office putting mat. Stress mounts day after day and everyone needs a healthy, constructive way to release some of it before it affects their health. Hitting some balls and focusing on your swing is much easier and more enjoyable than hours spent doing yoga or Pilates.\n\n2. Would you like to have something unusual or impressive in your home?\n\nWhen you really want to impress someone, you have to go with a putting mat in your home. This is something that most people do not expect to see when they walk into a friend's backyard for a cookout or into your game room for a fun afternoon of relaxation.\n\nYou can find putting mats of all sizes and shapes to accommodate whatever space you may have available in your home or backyard. This is guaranteed to impress everyone who comes for a visit and make you the talk of the town.\n\nWatch your friends try and top that!\n\n3. Do you find yourself bored during the cold season?\n\nYou don't have to sit back on the couch and gain 10 or 15 pounds when the snow starts fall and the winds start to blow. Putting mats inside the home will keep you active and cure boredom during the cold and blustering seasons.\n\nPlus, you could have the best swing on the golf course come spring if you spend enough winter evenings practice at home!\n\n4. Would you like to practice your golf swing on a daily basis?\n\nYou probably don't have enough time to get out to the driving range every day and practice your swing, though you might love the idea. With putting mats in your own home you can get some amount of practice every single day, or at least most days of the week. Having it right in your own home is extremely convenient and eliminates the excuse that you don't have time to practice.\n\n5. Do you want your children to become healthier and more active?\n\nThis is one of the biggest reasons to purchase putting mats if you have children. While it appears to be a game that kids love to play, it is actually an active game that helps them stay healthy and control their weight. Children shouldn't be conscious of controlling weight, but as a parent it is a great idea to keep it in your own mind and help them out in creative, subtle ways.\n\nIf you find yourself in any of these questions and answers, then you could benefit tremendously by purchasing putting mats for your home, office, or both. You can get healthy in mind and body, impress everyone you know, and get a lot of enjoyment out of your mats for many years to come.\n\nHome putting greens are one of the biggest inventions science has ever delivered. Golf is one of the most loved sports in the world and is something that people of every age, gender and nationality can appreciate. The ability to practice and improve your skill no matter what the weather is like outside or where you happen to live is the biggest allure of owning your own putting greens.\n\nYou may not want to completely give up your local golf club, but you can definitely benefit from bringing home putting greens of professional quality. They allow you to practice indoors when the weather is unsuitable outdoors and give you the opportunity to practice when you couldn't reasonably drive to a golf course or driving range. They also allow you to practice (and mess up) in complete privacy.\n\nThere are clear benefits to owning home putting greens, but many people dismiss the idea because they think it will take up too much space or cost too much. The good news is you can purchase them in a variety of sizes and shapes to accommodate the space you have available and there are different options that allow you to control expenses.\n\nStandard Home Putting Greens\n\nThis is the type of synthetic putting greens that most people purchase for residential use. This is like walking onto a car lot and purchasing a car that is already in inventory. You don't get to add any customized features and are stuck with the original design, but you can take it home very quickly and they are very reasonably priced.\n\nThis doesn't mean that all cars on the lot (or inside the box for your new putting green) will be inferior or of low value. It just means that they come pre-packaged and are designed to be cost effective and easy to install and start using (or drive off the lot in).\n\nIf you want something smaller in size, easier to move around, and more reasonably priced, this is the way to go.\n\nPrices for this type of putting green will vary between $300 and over $1,000, depending on features and size.\n\nProfessional Home Putting Greens\n\nThis is an upgraded version of the standard home putting greens. Most of these will be larger in size and the designs will be more realistic to the feel of an actual driving range or golf course. There may be more options here but prices will also be higher since the quality is higher.\n\nThis would be like purchasing a more expensive vehicle with more advanced technology and features right off the lot, without adding in customized options.\n\nDesigner Home Putting Greens\n\nThis is top of the line putting green real estate. This is driving the newest BMW off the lot with your head held high. The quality will be higher and there will be more room for flexible options and advanced features when you go with a designer home putting green.\n\nCustom Home Putting Greens\n\nThis is where you take a great vehicle and add in all the custom features you dream of having on your vehicle. You customize the entire project so it fits your life, personality, needs and expectations perfectly. This of course is going to cost a pretty penny, but overall expenses depend on the details of the project."}

We've become a society that blames and demonizes people that who became successful while the people hating on the 1% who often busted their butt sit back with their hands out and want the cut. Occupy wallstreeters are the largest group of trash and sum up the voting population of the current joke in D.C.

The wedges are usually decent as well. The CBs have been good some years, and so so others, and that's my feeling about the woods as well. I gamed a Nike driver for years and could never find anything better, but these days their drivers have been getting too cheesy for me. \"Covert\"... wonder how they picked that name? There is nothing \"covert\" about that club... it's like a neon sign that screams walmart. And let's not even bring up putters, we know Nike isn't known for them nor do many people bag them. Rory couldn't even deal for one round, case closed.\n\nThese threads start and end the same way. Most people will say bag what works, period. Rarely what works comes from one manufacturer, and for that reason, most pros don't even bag one OEM (even under contract). You be the judge. If you can stomach the wood options, and your the one guy that likes nike putters, than you most certainly could be an all nike bag. Irons and wedges, easily."}
{"text":"Perfect posture\n\nYour mother probably told you the importance of good posture, and it's likely your golf instructor will, too. Start by standing up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart. Begin with your feet pointed straight ahead, then spread your leading foot out about 30 degrees. Hold your club out at a 90-degree angle from your body. Now lean forward, letting your arms drop naturally, until the club head is about an inch above the ground. Finally, flex your knees until the club head touches the ground. Now you're in the perfect position to hit the ball. If you follow this procedure before every shot, you should find that the perfect golfing posture soon becomes second nature"}

{"text":"There's no doubt that many golf faults can be cured with technical expertise, but there is a growing interest in physical limitations within the body and their effects on the swing. There has been much speculation about the role of fitness, and the types of fitness training appropriate to golf. In the early days there wasn't a great appreciation of the difference between strength and power, and certainly not the increase of strength at the expense of sequence, and therefore to the detriment of full body power.\n\nOne thing is for certain, there is a clear correlation between proximal to distal sequencing, and good golf performance. As with any sport requiring efficiency of motion, power and timing, golf performance can be optimised by efficient distribution of motion throughout all available joints. It would therefore be beneficial to assess and solve any functional issues that might prevent a joint from making its contribution to the function of the golf swing.\n\nThe golf swing can be thought of as 2 parts- the backswing and the downswing. However, in reality thins aren't as simple as that. In fact in slow motion, it can be seen that the downswing commences significantly before the top of the backswing. This may sound a bit counterintuitive, but when viewed in slow motion, particularly in the advanced golfer, the hips, the powerhouse of the swing, begin to move into the downswing before the shoulders have completed their turn.\n\nBubba Watson, (picture reversed) known for his distance off the tee, is a great example of proximal to distal sequencing.\n\nThis leads to massive muscular loading during the transition- During the early to mid backswing, the Thoracic spine is required to rotate to the right, and laterally flex to the left, driven distally by the arms. Since the hips are also rotating to the right a little, this is a fairly gentle right rotation with the proximal pelvis, and distal shoulders moving in the same direction. When the hips start down, they translate, and rotate hard to the left, while the shoulders are still rotating to the right- proximal and distal segments moving in opposite directions- creating massive loading of the abdominals and the lumbar area in a very short period of time.\nMany of the top golfers- Sergio Garcia, Ben Hogan and Phil Mickelson to name a few, are known for the power they create in the golf swing, from a 'lag' of the club head behind the hands, as they approach the impact position. This leads to massive acceleration and power through the ball, and is an aspect of the swing that sets them apart from the average golfer. To draw a parallel to the way in which power is produced within the body, it could be said that every joint in the body is an opportunity for this power in terms of the lag that is produced, as segments move in opposite directions or at different speeds to each other and therefore lengthen and load the muscles that cross them. To take the Thoracic spine as an example, if a player is lacking type 1 motion, sequence will not occur as naturally as if the motion was feathered nicely through each segment.\n\nIn terms of injury prevention and management in golf, training for good motion at the foot and ankle, hips and Thoracic spine can take stress away from other body parts.\nFor example, if a player strives to make a 90 degree shoulder turn, it would be beneficial to optimise thoracic spine motion, to absorb as much type 1 motion as possible to prevent excessive strain on the lumbar area (or elsewhere, for that matter), which due to the orientation of the facets is more suited to type 2 motion. Likewise, a right handed golfer with poor left foot supination and hip internal rotation on the same side may experience some difficulties from excessive internal rotation of the knee during the follow through.\n\nAny such functional deficits can often be restored with well directed exercise prescription, and Functional Manual Reaction (FMR) techniques to change the speed of segments as they move, to encourage separation and relative motion. Whether your goal is to hit the ball further, play for longer, or just to play golf pain free, the use of functional science techniques is the way forward for the future."}
{"text":"How to read a green\n\nOne of the things that makes golf so challenging, and often frustrating, is that greens aren't flat. Every one has some sort of tilt to it so it can drain after rainstorms. Beyond that, there are various bumps, knobs, and valleys that invariably find their way between your ball and the hole. If you've been good enough or lucky enough to be closest to the pin when your group hits the green, you'll have the advantage of being able to see how the other golfers' shots react to the green. There are a few other things you can do to prepare for a course. Before the round, try asking a grounds attendant about the general area. Greens usually follow the slope of the land as a whole. If there are mountains to the west, chances are most greens will slope away from them. If there are bunkers nearby, the architects will have designed the couse so that water will drain around them. When figuring speed, consider the grass itself. The broader the leaves, the slower the green. Bermuda is slower than bent grass. Damp grass is slower than dry. Like many plants, grass leaves will point toward the sun, moving from east to west as the day passes. Putting (PUTT-ing) with the grain is faster than putting against it. Reading a green is never an exact science. The best plan is to play the same course several times until you get the feel of each green"}

{"text":"I didn't like any of the answers you provided, but a few of them were close. I think there's a LOT to the issue. (I can see this being a long post, so I apologize in advance)\n\nMost of the people I know personally got into golf because they were mentored into golf, either by a friend or family member. When I was a teen (80s) I had quite a few mentors I respected, and one of them was the Youth Pastor at my church who was an avid golfer. He had a set of clubs in his office at church and that's how it all started. I asked him about the clubs, asked him about the game, he taught me the interlocking grip, taught me how to putt like a pendulum, and it wasn't long before we were on a golf course driving range with him teaching me the basics of a golf swing.\n\nWhere are the mentors today? Who are YOU mentoring (not just in golf, but in life)?\n\nWe grew up hearing about generation gaps. At some points in history they're large. Sometimes they're small. But thanks to many things, I think today's generation gap is larger than I can ever remember. When I was growing up, I would NEVER talk to an adult with the disrespect that MANY (maybe most) kids today have. They think just because they reach the age of 18 and are still breathing that they are somehow equal to every adult in the world, and that's simply NOT the case. If you're one of the people who thinks that, let me clue you in. Just because you are legally an adult does NOT mean you deserve the same respect as someone who has achieved far more in life than you probably ever will. Tell ya what...go get a degree and\/or become successful in a career, become self-supporting, and start giving back to your community and I'll give you the same level of respect that I give others of us who have done the same. Until then, accept the fact that you have NOT arrived, you have FAR more work to do, and you are NOT the stud that you think you are.\n\nNo matter how much I'd love to mentor kids with these attitudes, the simple fact is most of them don't WANT to be mentored. They want to do it THEIR way and refuse to \"conform\" because their peers have brainwashed them into thinking that conformity is the enemy of personal freedom. And as long as they're not receptive to mentoring, it's impossible to lead them into anything, much less a hobby\/sport like golf which requires STRICT conformity to the rules in order to be appreciated.\n\nLisa and I hit the range at Valley Golf Saturday and again had to put up with some guys, probably late teens or very early 20's, who have a lot to learn about etiquette. As near as I could tell, the three of them were having a challenge on who could kill the ball the deadest, and yelling after every shot. Sometimes they'd sky the ball and end up hitting the roof just over the practice tees, yelling and laughing about that, too. After about 30 minutes of listening to them, one of the guys from the pro shop came up to see if they needed something. My wife explained it later. It's an automated facility, and you adjust the height of the tee using a little touch pad. Well, apparently they were also having a little contest to see what would happen if one of the other guys was constantly changing the height of the tee while the one guy was hitting (probably the cause of the shots hitting the roof) and one of them accidentally hit the \"CALL\" button for the pro shop.\n\nThe younger generation has equated self-discipline with following rules, and following rules is conformity, and conformity is bad. Taking advice...well, that's like following rules, too.\n\nThe only way to get kids these days to do things is to convince them that they WANT to do it. Then you have to convince them that there is a logical reason for every rule. Otherwise you get people who argue with every rule, saying things like \"you can't prove there's a need for the rule so it shouldn't be a rule\" (anyone read the anchored putting ban thread?).\n\nGolf is doomed as long as the younger generation is so high on themselves that they refuse to follow any of our advice, much less our traditions.\n\nOh, it may survive on the PS3 or XBox, but the game itself doesn't have much of a chance with the current \"youngsters\" in my opinion. I can only hope that THEIR kids reverse the trend and actually learn to show respect for others, respect for history, and a desire to maintain tradition that their parents didn't seem to have.\n\nThat's great and good post, but that wasn't really my point - I don't care what they call it - that's just an ego debate for those that worry about semantics and think gold watches are neat and that there is some masculine\/feminine tradeoff when their activity is labeled as 'sport' or not.... IMO - It's fun, it gets people out there - therefore it's good. I like it immensely - I even like most of the people that do it too. Call it whatever makes you happy and don't worry what others do.\n\nMy point was about how non-players try to minimize it and it gets into 'Webster's\" dictionary pissing contests between those that play and those that don't and how that's not really the point at all. The previous poster went through a revelation because he was caught up in that dorky back and forth - he could have not worried about it from the get go and been lucky enough to experience it even earlier in life. The lesson here is, when someone says \"well, GOLF's not a sport\", the response isn't to argue the definition, it's really to just laugh with them and point out why you like it specifically. They might just try it instead of it turning into a pissing contest over a word.\n\nMy other point is about professional level fitness and how it relates to a game such that fitness is good and an advantage for any game for pros not played with a joy stick or requiring shuffling and dealing. Fitness is important to me, you won't get fit playing golf - not the level of fitness I'm talking about. BUT - learning to play golf can very well save the life of someone that's NOT healthy. And, you can 'get fit' training to be good at golf."}
{"text":"Gear Spotlight: TaylorMade RBZ Max irons for women\n\nThursday, July 12, 2012\n\nDon't let the name fool you (it's short for \"RocketBallz,\" an R&D prototype nickname that stuck) -- the TaylorMade RBZ Max irons are not just for men, but also come in a women's version. It's a premium set; each club is made from an ultra-strong steel and designed to add distance (hence the name) while maintaining height and feeling soft, so they retail for $137.50 each, or $1,100 for a set of eight. But since they're equipped with stronger lofts than most other irons (while, impressively, maintaining the height you're used to seeing from the corresponding clubs in other models -- you're just going to have to club down with the RBZs), we recommend you look into starting the set with the 6- or 7-iron and progress to hybrids and fairway woods above that. That way, you'll only have to buy five or six of these (they're available separately, just ask your pro or retailer to order them for you that way), making it easier on the pocketbook.\n\nWhat's the secret sauce behind this rocket launcher? (Really, couldn't they just have named it that?) A pull-face construction (similar to what you see in metalwoods) allows TaylorMade to make the RBZ Max's unsupported face very thin and responsive from top to bottom and front to back. Tungsten weights in the sole (mainly in the heel and toe) help lower the center of gravity to get the ball airborne easily, as well as mitigate the penalties on off-center hits. It's actually a hollow clubhead with a very wide sole, yet it looks sleek and compact. The harsh-vibration problem, common in pull-face designs, was solved by placing a viscoelastic material called Hybrar inside the head, behind the upper part of the face.\n\nThe company says the RBZ Max set is designed for higher handicappers, but we've found that it works well for women of most abilities, down to the single-digit players (really slow swingers are better off with irons that have even wider soles and higher lofts). As with all club purchases, we strongly recommend you go through a thorough demo and fitting process before buying anything, no matter your ability. To find out the steps to take and the questions to ask your retailer, check out our step-by-step guide to buying new clubs."}

{"text":"Main menu\n\nGolf is still not very popular sport among people around the world. One of the reasons may be the fact that it is considered by many as a discipline for rich ones. This stereotype may come from the history of modern golf which dates back to fifteenth century Scotland. In these times playing golf was reserved only for those of high birth. The sport had been mentioned for the first time in 1457 when it was prohibited by the king of Scotland. He believed that it took precious time which should be set aside for practicing archery. Thankfully golf survived those hard times and kept evolving. During the eighteenth and nineteenth century it crossed the borders of the United Kingdom and spread all around the world. Thanks to soldiers and immigrants golf started to be known in British colonies and in Europe. The highest grow in the popularity of this discipline in the USA was observed in the first half of twentieth century. The time of war stopped the grow for a moment but it continued afterwards.\n\nThe only equipment we need to play golf is a special ball and a club with which we stroke the ball. There are many different types of clubs but the most popular are called wood, iron and putter. They differ in a shape and material from which they are made. The players change them depending on how long is the distance to the hole and what way they want to stroke the ball. The game takes place on the golf course which is a piece of land with nine or eighteen holes. Each golf course is divided into several areas which differ in the height of the grass. The place in which the game starts is called teeting ground or simply tee, while the others are for example rough, fairway or green. On some golf courses we can also find some hazards like sand bunkers or water hazards. If the course is quite big the players can move from one place to another using golf carts. It is especially convenient for those who play alone, as they do not have to carry the equipment by themselves. Not everyone wants to hire caddies, who are responsible for that matter.\n\nGolf can be played as individual game as well as in the team. The rules of it are not very complicated because the players' aim is to hit the ball into the holes which are numbered. To win in most cases the golfer has to do it in fewer number of strokes than his opponents. However, stroking the ball in a good way is not as simple as it look like when we watch it on TV. There are few techniques which are used by a golfers depending on how far the ball have to be stroked. Players who want to have a professional golf careers practice many hours a day. Most of them later on works in a golf clubs and teach other players. But there is a small group of golfers whose full-time job is to take part in tournaments. Nowadays people like Tiger Woods gets an enormous amount of money not only for winning but also for advertising his sponsors. That is because golf, as well as any other professional sport which attracts viewers attention, is treated as business. However, as long as the game stays on a certain level and brings joy to people it is not a huge problem."}

{"text":"News Archive\n\nLearn the Punch Move for More Power\n\nThe key to delivering the clubface consistently and powerfully to the ball and eliminating weak shots to the right lies in a trick called \"the punch move.\"\n\nThe most common swing fault I see is a weak shot to the right. Common wisdom in golf says that you'll never see a bunker placed long and right because for righties, shots to the right fall short of the green 99 times out of 100.\n\nShots can go to the right for one of two reasons: a slice caused by an over-the top, outside-in move or an open clubface. Both faults effectively add loft to the club in your hands, turning that 7-iron into an 8-iron or worse. It's no wonder shots to the right come up short.\n\nTo help those who \"hold on\" through impact, I've focused on releasing the clubhead through what I call \"the punch move.\" Releasing the clubhead eliminates the feeling of \"holding on\" through impact, a move that leaves the clubface open and saps you of power and accuracy.\n\nHolding On\n\nMy student (above) is \"holding on\" through impact here. His wrists and forearms have not rolled over each other, and the palm of his right hand faces the sky and the back of his right hand faces the earth.\n\nThe Punch Move\n\nHere my student has properly released the clubhead: his wrists and forearms have rolled over each other and the back of his right hand is facing outward, not down to the ground.\n\nPracticing the Punch Move Grab a partner or a friend. Take your golf stance and have him stand facing the same direction as you - just down the target line. Ask your friend to put his left hand out where your hands will pass through impact with his palm facing you:\n\nOnce your friend is in position, rest your left hand against your left leg and make a fist with your right hand. Put your right arm and hand in an approximate address position. Swing back to the top, and then swing back down. Make a conscious effort to (gently) punch your friend's hand properly, with the back of the hand facing away from you. Repeat this motion several times in slow motion, then grab a mid-iron and try to generate the same feeling through impact.\n\nFrame 1: address position. Frames 2, 3: swing back to the top. Frames 4-6: come down from the top to impact. Frames 7, 8: \"release the clubhead,\" roll the wrist, and make a solid punch.\n\nPunch Everywhere The right hand controls how you release the clubhead through impact. Proper release leads to accurate, more powerful shots. If you hold on through impact, the punch move will teach you to feel the proper release. Best yet, it can be practiced anywhere - in your office chair or while you sit on your couch at night. There's almost never a time when you can't be improving your golf swing!\n\nJerry Smith is the head professional at Tam O'Shanter of Pennsylvania, where he conducts dozens of fittings and lessons per week for recreational golfers.

{"text":"By SwingFix.com staff\n\nIn the world of golf instruction, Erika Larkin has made quite a name for herself in a short period of time.\n\nAfter finishing her playing career at James Madison University and graduating with honors in 2002, Larkin decided that she wanted to teach the game she loved for a living and she has excelled in that capacity.\n\nShe is just one of 20 female members of the PGA of America to be PGA Certified in Golf Instruction and she was honored as the winner of the Mid-Atlantic PGA Section's most recent Teacher of the Year award.\n\nLarkin is currently the Director of Instruction at Stonewall Golf Club in Gainesville, Va., and she was kind enough to sit down with us to cover a variety of topics.\n\nFIVE QUESTIONS:\n\n1. What would you consider to be some popular myths about golf instruction, meaning things that most average players believe are true but actually are not?\n\nLARKIN: I think a lot of golfers think a bigger backswing = more distance. There are many factors in a swing that can increase power and swing speed, but for most people, a longer backswing just causes breakdowns and instability. I tell most people to try and maintain their posture and the width of their arms before I would tell them to wind up more. Groove your control first and you will be surprised that power and consistency will come!\n\n2. What do you see as the biggest benefits or advantages when it comes to the SwingFix teaching platform?\n\nLARKIN: SwingFix's biggest advantage is being able to provide \"homework\" with attaching drills and videos to the lesson, as well as the opportunity to follow up with the student through direct messaging. It's more personal than it may appear.\n\n3. What aspects of the golf swing do you think most of the players you teach have trouble understanding?\n\nLARKIN: I think the \"release\" (delivery of the clubface though impact) is a hard concept (even for instructors!). It's the fastest part of the swing and has the biggest effect on your shot direction and the quality of contact. The best players have the best releases and can control ball flight intentionally by changing it if they want to. A lot of average golfers flip or scoop their wrists too much, too little, too early or too late for reasons related to, or not related to, other swing issues. They may just be misunderstanding the \"release\" sometimes and try to do the wrong thing.\n\nTo simplify the concept, and it does come up a lot in lessons, I usually recommend working on short to medium pitch shots to slow things down and understand what is going on. If there is a problem with the quality or timing of the release it will show up here, and you can then work on trying to fix the problem, whether it be grip pressure, body movement, tempo, ball position, etc. Don't fear - this is why we are here, your instructors, so we can help you figure this out!\n\n4. What advice would you give a golfer who is going to seek out professional instruction for the first time?\n\nLARKIN: In doing your research for a professional, I recommend looking for a well-rounded coach that you connect with (personality, teaching style) that seems to really care about you, and someone that is able to help your GAME and not just your swing.\n\n5. What is the most valuable aspect of the lesson process for most golfers?\n\nLARKIN: Even though several thoughts may be covered during a lesson, I think it's important for the student to walk away with a clear understanding of the priority so they can work on correcting things in the right order. Then, knowing how\/what to practice and what to expect during practice (ex. \"you may see a few of these drill shots go to the right\") the student can make more progress and not detour away from the fix if they aren't getting the results they want at first. It's important to remember that making changes in a swing is a process and usually not a one-step process, so if a student can stick to a plan for change, it really helps both the student and the instructor."}

From there there is a 200 foot straight shot to set up a putt. I did that during the round throwing an anny and got a 3. Another guy in my group did the same thing but did not execute the straight shot. So that becomes one of those holes where you can break it down and settle for a good score, or just chuck it and pray.\n\nI thought 18 was a fine hole. The grassy fairway eliminated a lot of the luck of the bad skip. I did not know that completely over the creek was in bounds on 18 and 8. A spotter picking up a disc would not cost the player any throws. Under the rules he gets to play the disc where it landed. Not knowing the rules might have cost the player some throws.\n\nAnd I was not complaining about #10 because I had a bad score there. I missed a short putt for 3. It just seemed that of the 20 or so players I saw throw that hole, the results were random. I saw weak players get lucky and very good players get very unlucky. After 108 holes of disc golf the luck evens out. I suppose one dumb luck hole tests a player's mental game."}

{"text":"How to Stop over Thinking in Golf\n\nOver-thinking in golf is caused by similar feelings as over-thinking in anything else in life. Fear is what lies at the roots of over-thinking.\n\nFears come in many shapes and forms and plague a golfers mind unless you know how to switch off and change your focus. Fear that you haven't made the right discount golf clubs choice, fear that you haven't calculated the wind speed correctly, and fear caused by not being comfortable with that particular shot or club, fear that your playing partner is catching up with you, and fear that you're just not at one with your swing at the moment. Every golfer has experienced these fears and many more too.\n\nFear is debilitating. Fear freezes you and inhibits your swing. Your mind and your swing go all over the place as a result of fear. Fear that you might hit a bad shot with the discount golf clubs makes that result an almost dead certainty.\n\nIn golf confidence is King. When you are confident in your stroke, confident in your swing, confident in your shot choice and so on you find that your body responds freely and masterfully to this mental state. Golf confidence is what stops those fears creeping in. Golf confidence stops those myriad thoughts from whizzing around your mind and strangling your ability to focus and swing with your discount golf clubs freely.\n\nYou hear golfers say that they need to get out of their head and just play the game. What they really mean is that they need to shift a gear in their mind, move into cruise control, with clear focus, trust and confidence in their swing.\n\nHow does someone like Tiger, hailed and acknowledged as the most focused and confident golfer ever known, lose this golf confidence, trust and focus? It's a long time now since he's won a major, and he was the guy we all thought would top all known records. What caused that loss of faith in him?\n\nSurely though, despite his working on mechanics, he of all people has a strong enough mind to overcome those fears and niggling doubts? I cannot help but think that Tiger has overlooked the importance of his mind, underestimated the power of a golfers mind, especially his mind. He used to have a real balance between his mechanical focus and his mental focus. Now it seems that all of his attention is being placed upon the mechanics of his game, and this is messing with his mind."}

{"text":"Front to back: The backswing is the start of a good golf swing\n\nNoted golf instructor and columnist, Mel Sole offers golf tips for GolfInstruction.com readers on all aspects of the game.\n\nHaving taught many golfers for many years, the one question I'm asked more than any other is \"Once I'm in my address position, where do I go?\"\n\nWell, the answer is more complex than the solution, but I'll do my best to keep it as simple as possible.\n\nMuch has been written about the takeaway:\n\n\u2022 Take it back with the left side\n\n\u2022 Take it back with the right side\n\n\u2022 Take it back with the arms\n\n\u2022 Take it back with the big muscles\n\n\u2022 Take it back with the hands\n\nQuite honestly, I don't think there is one particular way to take the club back in terms of how it feels-only in terms of where the club should be at particular times during the swing. Although we may all have the same bone and muscle structure, we have different perceptions on how things feel. I indicate where the club should be at each point in the swing and then let the student experience what that position feels like and determine how best to achieve it. In other words all I do is tell the student when the club is in the right position. I don't tell my students how to get it there - I let them feel that for themselves.\n\nWhen I teach about the address position, I talk about a target line and a body line. The target line is a line drawn through the ball to the target, and the body line is a line drawn parallel to that line through the feet\n\nAt the start of the takeaway, you want the hands to move straight back along the body line, with no manipulation or rotation of the hands or arms. In other words, the hands are passive and the torso rotates. Halfway up the backswing the club position should then look like this:\n\nAs you can see, the clubhead is still slightly outside the body line. Please make sure you do not confuse this statement to mean the clubhead is outside the target line (if the clubbed moved straight back the arms would pull away from the body). Most of the good players of today have the club in this position, including Nicklaus, Couples, Stewart, Norman, etc. What you do not want is the club to get behind you or too much on the inside-this causes the wrists to rotate and lay the clubface open and ultimately lay the club off at the top of the backswing, a sure way of starting the downswing \"over the top.\"\n\nIf the grip pressure is nice and light then at this point the wrists will start to \"cock\" naturally with the momentum of the clubhead and the club will start to break upwards. At this stage the hands are approximately in the middle of the chest and the club will feel very light in your hands.\n\nContinue with a full shoulder turn to the top of the backswing.\n\nOther points to note during the backswing are:\n\n1. The right knee does not move from its original position -all the way to the top of the swing. This \"stable\" position ensures that the proper \"torque\" is created in the body.\n\n2. The left arm stays reasonably straight-not rigid-throughout the backswing, especially at the top of the swing, a definite problem area for a lot of golfers. Again, if the left arm breaks down you will lose that necessary \"torque\" that is the power producer on the downswing.\n\n3. The weight moves over to the right side at the top of the backswing with the sternum directly over the right foot. This prevents a \"reverse pivot\" and ensures the proper weight shift and will make the start of the downswing a lot easier and more powerful.\n\nMel Sole is Director of Instruction at the Phil Ritson-Mel Sole Golf School.

But there is one more step you can't leave out: Find the cause. Below is a common problem called the chicken wing, where your lead elbow juts out in an attempt to prevent the club from flipping over through impact (see bottom photo).\n\nIn this case, since I know the player's swing, I can tell you that at address, his grip is too strong. And when the club slows down at the top, you can see the result \u2014 the clubface is shut in the hook position (see the top photo). There are good players such as Dustin Johnson and Graeme McDowell who play with a shut face, but most golfers don't do well. And it doesn't take but a few snap hooks before anyone with an ounce of talent chicken-wings to keep the face open.\n\nBeing able to identify and then fix the cause of a problem is why a good teacher gets the big bucks.\n\nThe takeaway: the chicken-wing error occurs through impact, yet the cause is far away at address. If you can't fix your problem, maybe you're looking in the wrong place.\n\nTomasi writes for universal UClick.\n\nAt the top of the backswing, the clubface points at the sky in a shut position, a harbinger of the pulls and pull hooks.\nYou fix the fault by tracing the chain of error back to the root of the problem \u2014 otherwise, it will never go away."}

{"text":"Many amateurs get caught up in trying to be the longest hitter of the golf ball in their group. The truth is that low scores can be produced without really needing to hit the ball very far. Yes, there is a great deal of pleasure that can be gained from seeing the stunned look in your playing partners faces as you bomb a drive over 300 yard down the fairway however if your short game is weak then you will never be able to capitalize on the advantage that you have off the tee.\n\nThe professionals on tour spend a lot of time working on their short game because they know that even on their best rounds they will probably miss a few greens and will need to rely on the short game to help them recover. Here are some simple short game tips to help you shoot lower scores fast:\n\nTip 1: Hit lots of wedge shots from 40 to 120 yards.\n\nThis distance can really make a big difference in your scores especially if you are sharp with your wedges here. Instead of a 30 foot putt for par or birdie, you can find yourself facing much simpler putts from inside 20 feet so you can save par more easily or make the occasional birdie.\n\nTip 2: Practice from very tough and awkward lies\n\nDo not be afraid to practice from very awkward and difficult lies and situations. This will make the shots you face on the course seem simple by comparison. Look for bare lies or buried lies, uphill and downhill lies and stances and learn to hit chips and flop shots from these lies. Always aim for a tiny target and always focus on holing the shot. With every short game shot the target is to hole the shot not just get it inside some 3 foot circle.\n\nTip 3: Practice a lot of short putts\n\nShort putting is critical to shooting good scores and being a great putter overall. If you are confident with the short putts then you will naturally be more free and confident with the longer putts which will only help you to make more of these kinds of putts. Line up short putts from 3 to 6 feet from various lines around the hole and focus on a small target and then just looking and reacting. Do think too much when putting or hitting any golf shot for that matter, you need to turn golf into a reaction sport so that you can take advantage of your natural athletic ability.\n\nTip 4: Build an effective mental routine\n\nMany teachers talk about routines and they are important in order to be a better player. There are two aspects to the golf routine and they are the physical and mental routine. Both are important however the mental routine is more important. It is best to allow yourself to have some flexibility in your physical routine as far as the number of practice swings you take and such. The key element of the mental routine is to reach that moment of decisiveness where you know you will hit a great shot.

{"text":"Forums\n\nWho's Responsibility is it?\n\nare you kidding me? this is the caddies responsibilty. I know there is so much more that a caddie does, but you have to keep up with the clubs. If I was Funk I would be seriously pissed and there would be something happening. Just my two cents.\n\nThe caddie went to the wrong bag and pulled the other guys club (same company). Totally the caddies falt, but you would think you would notice it wasn't your club. Funny that is has happen to Funk twice now..\n\nIt is the fault of both. Having done both I never got the wrong club in the bag, or played another players club. First if you lay your players club across another players bag to retrieve a divot, rake a trap or the get flag, and it does happen, you need to be on it enough to remember where you had put. If another caddie put their players club across you bag you should be aware enough to know it isn't your players. And finally as a player even if it is the exact same club most have characteristics that seperate them from other players clubs, ie markings, different grip, lie or grind. Two people not catching the same mistake? Someone hit the pubs the night before... Done that too!\n\nThat may be, but how does the wrong club get in his bag? I would like to have seen it and at least have it on replay to be sure whose fault. I'm no expert, but I know my own clubs as many of us do, but if someone places a club in my bag that is not mine, I have noted it right away when taking out one for a shot of my own. And what is the caddy doing allowing another club in his pros bag that should never have been there in the first place. I disagree and place most of the blame on the caddy. He is there to take care of the clubs and offer advice when needed. Therefore, his responsibility is primary. And in the heat of competition we all may do some dumb things."}

{"text":"Positioning Your Golf Ball\n\nYou need to position your ball properly if you want to have the correct impact on your ball. The impact of the ball is determined by the position of the golf ball and the way you strike. If you know the trick here, you can control the flight properly. As you start swinging, your club moves around and then up. Then it goes down and back to finish. Then the club descends on the ball. The club touches the ball and continues its motion down into the grass. The divot should be on the object side of the ball. Shorter clubs are made to strike the ball at a steep angle. If you have long clubs then you can swing at a shallow angle.\n\nIf you have short irons-wedges, say around 9-iron and 8-iron, then you need to play the ball in the center of your posture. This helps you get a steeper angle at impact that produces a divot on the target side of the ball. If you have middle irons like 7-iron, 6-iron and 5-iron then play the ball left of center. This helps you play at a shallower angle of approach having a slight divot on the target side of the ball. If you have long irons or fairway metals, then you will need to play the ball two balls left of center. This way you can achieve the shallowest angle when the ball is on the grass"}

{"text":"When I perform a biomechanics evaluation on a golfer's swing, the most commonly asked first question is, \"What is my club head speed?\"\n\nTypically, the player is interested in miles per hour (MPH). Most golfers relate distance to linear speed, because until recently, this was the only measurement of power. However, with the advent and accessibility of biomechanics technology we have the ability to measure club shaft and club head movement in three dimensions and objectively assess all of the components of power and speed during the swing. With this type of information, the golfer can actually measure the impact of his kinetic link on performance.\n\nConcept\n\nWhile the maximum linear speed of the club head is important to power and distance in the golf swing, it is not the only element involved when considering efficient movement. The rotational components of the motion are as crucial to efficiency as the linear components. The club head and the motion of the golf swing both have independent rotational and linear components that have to be considered when measuring power generated during the golf swing.\n\nRotational Components\n\nAs the club accelerates during the down swing it moves around the axis of the trunk, increasing in angular speed. Angular velocity is measured by the change in angle over time, or degrees per second. The body transfers energy from the big muscles of the lower body to the smaller muscles of the upper body creating a dramatic increase in rotation (see fig 1). As we discussed in the last article, the final link in generating rotational speed is the acceleration of the club away from the arms (club release). As the club releases, the angular velocity increases and can reach maximum velocities of up to 1700 degrees per second at impact in a tour level swing. This is why good club release is so important. More often than not, the less efficient swing reaches maximum angular velocity prior to impact, resulting in a decelerating club head, even though the linear speed or (MPH) is quite high. The result is a swing that takes incredible physical effort that may generate high MPH but, more often not, generates less distance.\n\nLinear Components\n\nLinear club head speed or MPH is also somewhat complicated. Remember that the club head travels in three dimensions. Although maximum total speed is important, the 3-D components of that speed are important as well. One way to picture the three components is as follows.\n\nClub head speed direction Up and down on the ball (Y component).\n\nClub head speed direction Inside to out and outside to in (Z component).\n\nThe direction in which you are intending to drive the ball or \"down the line\" (X component).\n\nThe most important of these components is the speed of the club head \"down the line\" as it accelerates into impact with the ball. In the tour level swing, this component increases to a maximum level while the other components decrease (see fig 2). The result is maximum speed and energy which is focused in the direction of the intended flight at impact. In a less efficient swing, speed and energy is wasted in the other two components, which contributes to unwanted ball spin and errant ball striking.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe ability to generate power in the form of rotational and liner club head speed comes from an efficient kinetic link, learning how to better co-ordinate movement patterns increases our efficiency in delivering all the speed we generate from the power generation process from the ground to the ball at the point of impact.\n\nScott Beaumont is from ZenoLink. ZenoLink is a diagnostic tool that used 3D motion analysis for coaches to be able to measure their athlete's biomechanical breakdowns in their golf swing. By measuring hip speed, arm speed, shoulder speed, club release speed and club linear speed, ZenoLink creates separate analyses of kinetic linking, stability, muscular loading and club dynamics; helping a coach or instructor identify functional movement discrepancies that rob the player of power, and to design a personalized Progressive Skills Training program that addresses problem areas"}
{"text":"Ed Oldfield designed the Merit Club to be playable for...\n\nJuly 17, 2000|By Ed Sherman, Tribune Golf Writer.\n\nEd Oldfield designed the Merit Club to be playable for average golfers and a challenge for the best players in the world. This week, the Merit Club president will get to see if his course is up to the challenge when the U.S. Women's Open comes to Gurnee. Here's is Oldfield's hole-by-hole analysis of the course.\n\n1. PAR 4, 399 yards\n\nOldfield's analysis: The fairway slopes to the left, so a good tee shot is important. Players will be hitting a 7- or 8-iron into a large green with many good possible pin placements. It's an average hole. Not too easy, not too hard.\n\nBirdie hole? Possible, but not likely.\n\n2. PAR 3, 172 yards\n\nOldfield's analysis: The first of a variety of par 3s. A downhill tee shot could require a little less club. Anything past the pin could make for a difficult putt. The first couple of holes shouldn't present them with much problem.\n\nBirdie hole? Possible.\n\n3. PAR 5, 499 yards\n\nOldfield's analysis: This is our signature hole. I don't agree with the front tee placement because these players can blow by the water. It takes the teeth out of the second shot. You don't want a long iron into this green. There will be a couple of big numbers on this hole.\n\nBirdie hole? Play for a five and go to the next tee.\n\n4. PAR 4, 374 yards\n\nOldfield's analysis: The fairway narrows down, so the long hitters will tee off with a 3-wood. That will leave them with a 7-iron into the green. Another hole where you need to be below the pin.\n\nBirdie hole? It won't be a birdie hole Sunday when the pin is back left. There's no way to get close from there.\n\n5. PAR 4, 376 yards\n\nOldfield's analysis: It's uphill and definitely will play longer. It's definitely a tee-shot hole, because the fairway narrows down. It's a big green with a lot of places to put the pin.\n\nBirdie hole? It's a par hole, because it will be tough to putt on this green.\n\n6. PAR 4, 366 yards\n\nOldfield's analysis: This is my favorite hole. It's 3-wood off the tee; the long hitters might even take an iron. It's a must to hit in the fairway. It's basically an easy hole, but one bad shot can lead to a double bogey.\n\nBirdie hole? Yes, but you could see a three-shot swing here on Sunday.\n\n7. PAR 3, 151 yards\n\nOldfield's analysis: This hole has a huge green with a lot of contours. Anything left off the tee and the water comes into play big time. It's a challenging hole because of the green.\n\nBirdie hole? Perhaps, but the green will make it tough.\n\n8. PAR 5, 522 yards\n\nOldfield's analysis: It's one of the easiest holes on the course. With a southwest wind, it could be reachable in two. It plays downhill, shorter than the yardage. If you can't reach it in two, you better leave it out to where you can use a full sand wedge. You'll have to spin it into this green.\n\nBirdie hole? Yes.\n\n9. PAR 4, 412 yards\n\nOldfield's analysis: Going uphill, this hole plays about 430. The second shot will require a long iron into a challenging green. This will be the toughest hole on the course.\n\nBirdie hole? No.\n\n10. PAR 4, 410 yards\n\nOldfield's analysis: This one is downhill, and it's not nearly as long. There's a wide driving area, and it's one of the easiest greens to putt. It's not one of the more difficult holes.\n\nBirdie hole? Yes.\n\n11. PAR 3, 175 yards\n\nOldfield's analysis: Players will hit a 4- or 5-iron into the green. It's a big green with some movement. The back right bunkers will come into play.\n\nBirdie hole? Possible.\n\n12. PAR 5, 533 yards\n\nOldfield's analysis: It's a three-shot hole if it is playing into the wind. The fairway bunkers come into play with the wind. But there is a lot of room, and the green is benign.\n\nBirdie hole? Definitely.\n\n13. PAR 4, 354 yards\n\nOldfield's analysis: This is the easiest par-4 on the course. It's either a fairway wood or iron off the tee and then a pitching wedge into the green. The water is more intimidating visually than coming into play.\n\nBirdie hole? Yes.\n\n14. PAR 4, 406 yards\n\nOldfield's analysis: A risk-reward hole. How much water do you want to cut off from the tee? You need an aggressive tee shot to be able to have a middle iron to the green. You should go for the center of the green no matter where they put the flag.\n\nBirdie hole? No.\n\n15. PAR 4, 376 yards\n\nOldfield's analysis: You can cut the corner with a drive and leave yourself only 70-80 yards into the green. This is one of my favorite greens because of all the contours.\n\nBirdie hole? Good birdie opportunity.\n\n16. PAR 3, 167 yards\n\nOldfield's analysis: It's easy or difficult depending on where you put the pin. Anything short left goes into the water. If you bail to the right, you'll have a difficult chip or putt. It's a challenging two-putt.\n\nBirdie hole? Possible.\n\n17. PAR 4 , 380 yards\n\nOldfield's analysis: This could be a turning-point hole. If you hit your tee shot badly, you've got no shot at all. The second shot is a character builder. You need the right club because of the elevated green.\n\nBirdie hole? Take a par here.\n\n18. PAR 5, 485 yards\n\nOldfield's analysis: This is a wonderful closing hole. It's 220 to carry the water. Long hitters will cut the corner and a have long iron to the green. Somebody in the lead won't want to mess with the water.\n\nBirdie hole? It's an eagle possibility. Could be a hole with a two-shot swing."}
{"text":"Free Golf Lessons\n\nDo You hit behind the ball?\n\nby Frank Peter\n\nThe cause may be easier to fix than you think. You may not realize it, but\nyour back shoulder may be dipping towards the ground. This move forces the\nclub to hit the ground too early. Most of the time it happens when you are really\ntrying to get into the ball. Imagine...You're 200 yards out and you've chosen to hit\nthe 4 iron. When you've got it in your head that you have to hit the ball hard to get\nit there, it's natural tendency to start your downswing with the hips in an effort to\n\"really get into the ball\". That may work in baseball, but not in golf.\n\nI'd like to take you through what happens if you make that move in golf. First, get in\nthe your setup position, now take your backswing and hold it at the top. Now move\nonly your hips horizontally towards the target, and notice the way it forces your back\nshoulder to \"dip\". If you've made that \"dip\" with your back shoulder, it's over. You are\ngoing to hit behind the ball 90% of the time, and if you do make good contact, you'll\nprobably end up with a killer slice. Lateral movement is no good for the golf\nswing.\n\nTo avoid this problem, and to simplify your golf swing, keep the lower body out of the\nequation. If you really want to get into the ball, start your downswing with your arms.\nIt's tough to do if you have a habit formed, but once you get used to it, you won't be\nhitting the ball fat anymore. Most golfers over-emphasize the weight shift. If you keep\nyour hips still, the weight shift will still occur, but it will happen naturally.\n\nGet to the top, keeping your leading arm as straight as possible. Now start down at the\nball with your leading arm fully extended. Your head hasn't moved laterally, and your\nhips haven't moved laterally. Now to take this to the next step image the entire golf swing,\nthrough impact, occurring underneath the upper body. Concentrate on keeping your front\nshoulder strong and \"down\" on the ball. This will enable you to keep your swing on the\ncorrect plane, and it will help your hands to keep up with your body. Don't let that shoulder\ncome up and away from the target before impact as that will cause your body to get ahead\nof your hands leading to fat shots and slices"}
{"text":"Golfers of all skill levels make or break their golfing round by their putting ability. It's the one club in your bag that has the most potential of reducing your score. The selection of a putter is as much a personal preference of style and look, as it is about feel and technology.\n\nForm is as important as function when it comes to your putter. A player has to like what they see before they will have confidence in the product. Once a person finds a putter that they are pleased with the aesthetics of, at least half the battle is won.\n\nStyles of putter shapes: Blade vs. Modern is the obvious choice. Blade-type putters are narrow from face to back, and long from toe to heel. Players who prefer a more traditional look tend to prefer blade style models, while players who want a more modern look opt for mallet type putters. Today's mallet putters come in a wide variety of shapes, but are usually almost as deep from face to back, as they are from toe to heel. Through the use of different materials and shapes, a higher moment of inertia (MOI) can be achieved. The MOI is simply the putter head's resistance to twisting. A higher MOI translates into more stable contact with an off-center impact, which in turn means more putts finding the bottom of the cup instead of burning the edge or catching the lip. Placement of weight is critical for how a putter will resist twisting. Face-balanced putter heads are less likely to be influenced by wayward strokes and poor contact.\n\nMaterials and specifications: Should you go with a putter head that has a polymer substance to soften impact, or milled metal for a more crisp feel? The difference in face material will have an impact on how far a ball will travel with a similar length of swing. Those who prefer a firmer feel should stay with putters that do not have inserts. Most putter heads are made from softer steels than irons or metal woods.\n\nPlaying Length: The standard length of a putter is 35 inches however you can customise the length of your putter if you prefer a shorter or longer"}
{"text":"In 1885, Dr William Laidlaw Purves of Royal Wimbledon Golf Club, spotted from the vantage point of St Clement's church a spectacular piece of undulating land with expansive sand dunes.Being a Scot and a keen scratch golfer, he decided that there was only one thing to do with this links land; create a golf course.In 1887, the course opened for play and was named \"St George's\" after the English patron saint.\n\n\"For a course that is still comparatively young,\" wrote Bernard Darwin in his 1910 book, The Golf Courses of the British Isles, \"Sandwich has had more than its share of ups and downs. It was heralded with much blowing of trumpets and without undergoing any period of probation, burst full-fledged into fame.\"\n\nAfter only seven years of play, in 1894, Sandwich hosted its first of fourteen Open Championships. This was the first Open to be played outside Scotland.\n\nRoyal patronage was granted in 1902 and the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII) became club captain. Many celebrated people have been affiliated with the club; the great golf writer Bernard Darwin was president of Royal St George's between 1952 and 1961.\n\nThe course is not a traditional out and back layout. In a similar style to Muirfield, each nine is broadly circular, a loose figure of eight.There is nothing artificial about Royal St George's; there is a natural look and feel to the course that blends beautifully into the surroundings, with wild flowers, dune grasses and the sweet song of the lark. Commanding views over Pegwell Bay and the white cliffs of Dover ensure an engaging experience.\n\nAll the holes are very different and memorable, a true sign of a great golf course. Royal St George's also has some unique features; thatched roof shelters, the red cross of St George on the flags, and that bunker on the 4th hole cut into a huge dune, the UK's tallest and deepest bunker.If you can carry that famous bunker on this 470-yard par four, then you can enjoy the peace of the fairway beyond, called the \"Elysian Fields\".\n\nThe par three 6th is called the \"Maiden\". We'll let Bernard Darwin explain why: \"There stands the 'Maiden' steep, sandy and terrible, with her face scarred and seamed with black timbers, but alas! we no longer have to drive over her crown: we hardly do more than skirt the fringe of her garment.\" \"Suez Canal\" is the 14th, so called according to Darwin because; \"many a second shot has found a watery grave\".The 15th is considered architecturally to be one of the most impressive in golf because the fairway bunkers are virtually symmetrical.\n\nSome hazards are not clearly visible from the tees, but in the past things were much worse. In the mid 1970s, blind shots were considered pass\u00e9, so Frank Pennink was brought in to ring the changes. Three new holes were built and tee changes were made to two other holes. Many, except for the real traditionalists, believe that these changes have further improved the layout.\n\nRoyal St George's represents one of the most difficult tests of golf, requiring courage, confidence and solid ball striking.Severely undulating fairways make good scoring very tough indeed. Often the tee shot will come to rest on an upslope or a down slope, then one needs to hit a long iron or fairway wood into the green from an uneven lie.\n\nIan Fleming, the author of the James Bond books, was a member here at Royal St George's. The golf scenes from the film Goldfinger were filmed at Stoke Park, but Fleming called the course \"Royal St Marks\" in the film, no doubt inspired by his home club. Like Muirfield, Royal St George's is a private men's club and there are no female members. Women can play the course as a member's guest, but there are no ladies' tees.\n\nSandwich is a classic links course, summed up nicely by Bernard Darwin: \"My idea of heaven as is to be attained on an earthly links\". Darwin went on to become president of the club between 1952 and 1961.\n\nIf the above course review article is not accurate, let us know by clicking here\n\nAverage Reviewers Score:\n\nRSG is an excellent course. I like the uneven lies and the undulation. I must also say the final four holes are very strong but it is not the best in England. But quite likely a top 10 course in any country\n\nRoyal St. George's is a luxurious dream for all golfers who wish to play links golf. The undulations in the fairways that meander onto a perfectly cut green. Every whole is a joy to behold that is enhanced by a wonderful view over the large dunes that is Royal St. George's.\n\nPlayed RSG in early November and found the course in great condition with the greens a good speed for November. The staff were very welcoming and the clubhouse is steeped in history. It was a privilege to play there. The course is simply stunning; I've played many links and this was right up there with some of my favourites around Britain (which include Turnberry, Saunton, Burnham and Berrow, Silloth and Royal Porthcawl). If I had to pick a trio of favourite holes they'd be 4, 8 and 14. I agree there are courses with better sets of par 3's but I also think there are no real weak holes on the course - on certain holes you think you've got the measure only to find there re dangers lurking near the green, or on the green with subtle borrows - all good features of a classic links. We played RCP the previous day .... good but not as good as RSG. Just a note: What I can't understand is why there are so many comments below concentrating on negative points. RSG is an old club and still full of old traditions so accept it, enjoy the atmosphere and play golf ... \"When in Rome ...\" or go and play somewhere else :)\n\nI must have missed something here, I really didn't rate it that highly, shame as I was so looking forward to it. The 4th, 8th, 14th are world class holes but the rest are just pleasant links holes. Probably the weakest set of par 3's for an Open course, Burnham and Berrow has got the best set of par 3's of any Championship links course in England. Don't mind the clubhouse rules and members etc : That is what makes golf great. 3 low handicappers playing off white tees all managed to comfortably break 80, none of us broke 80 at Weston Super Mare and one shot 91 Someone please reply and tell me what it is I missed, thank you.\n\nJust an asinine review. The fact that you appear to be marking the course down because it afforded you the pleasure of breaking 80 tells me what I need to know about your values when analysing golf courses.\n\nHarry\n\n27 September 2012\n\nDear John I thought my review was a fair one, RSG is the top rated Club on this website and we visit many Clubs in the Top 100 and we did not get anywhere near the Wow factor here, I still gave it 5 stars. To me, you have to be totally challenged mentally( I know what you're thinking, lets not go there) and for an Open venue it was all too easy. We always get supremely challenged at Saunton, Burn & Berr, I even thought West Lancs had a lot more to offer. We look for enjoyment, fun and then challenge, we all felt it failed to deliver as the No 1 Golf Club in England. Thank you for your response.\n\nWe played this course on a weekday in June 2012 and the course was in good condition and we played from the medal tees. The greens where very true, but surprisingly slow. The course itself is very interesting with a variety of very good and sometimes exciting challenges, but visually much less appealing than Waterville, Ballybunion or Lahinch. The finishing holes (16-18) unfortunately are quite boring and a bit of a let down. The staff in the club house was not unfriendly, but very un-welcoming. The bar closes at 3pm so there is no way to have an afternoon snack unless you want to get a full dinner in the restaurant with jacket and tie. It is the only clubhouse where you have to ring a bell to enter. The Pro was really rude - only his assistant tried to be helpful. After making a huge fuss about reservations beforehand, the course was not full at all. I am happy to have played the course, but for a whopping 175 GBP Green fee I do expect a more welcoming environment. They probably don't care as they assume that most visitors will only come once anyway. Play there if you don't care about hospitality and look for better packages. We lived in the Bell Hotel in Sandwich which really get a high recommendation \u2013 nice rooms, good food and a very friendly staff.\n\nPlayed the course on Aug 2 and have to partially disagree with this review, especially regarding the hospitality. It was very easy to make reservations and to change the tee times. The Secretary of the club has spent with us some time for welcoming us and tell us about the course. The green fee is definitely a little expensive but I guess that is the same for any British Open course. As far as the course is concerned it was fun and enjoyable even though I must admit that courses such as Dornoch, Turnberry, Ballybunion, Lahinch, Waterville are definitely more spectacular.\n\nI played this course in Arpil 2012 and the condition was excellent. The design of the holes is nothing short of fantastic and I can't think of any two holes the same. You'll need to execute a huge variety of tee shots, approach shots and chip shots to make a good score on this course, and creativity and imagination are a must on the putting surfaces. Every club in your bag is likely to see some action with most of the par 4's requiring at least a mid iron approach. Watch out for the par 5 14th, the water hazzard is reachable with a driver off the white tees! I have been fortunate enough to play here 5 times and each time it becomes more enjoyable.\n\nI played RSG this week which is the 6th open championship venue I have played within the past year. The weather was wonderful as was the course and contrary to other reviews, we were made to feel welcome by the club and the members. My favourite holes were the 4th, 14th and 18th and the condition of the course was perfect. Although not my favourite open course (Turnberry and Lytham are my favourites) I cannot wait to go back!\n\nI played RSG but in December last year. Anybody from the UK should know that the condition of any UK golf course will be worse in the winter than the summer. I experienced true greens (not fast but OK) and a course that was presented as well as I would have expected for the time of year. We paid \u00a390 with lunch and we experienced a three club wind and lovely winter's day. The members we met were friendly and even one came and chatted to us at our lunch table. It was an experience that I will hold dearly as I hadn't played RSG before but have played RCP and Prince's. Even in the winter with average course conditions, RSG is a class up from RCP and perhaps two up from Prince's. I could write an essay on how memorable the playing experience was at RSG but dozens of people have already done that before me. RSG is not my favourite links course in Britain, I'd have to give that award to Royal Dornoch followed by Muirfield. In Ireland I prefer Ballybunion (Old), primarily because it has more drama from a landscape perspective. I've just counted up and have now played 34 courses in the current World Top 100 listed on this site and RSG is in my Top 10 on winter merit. I think the comments made by the previous reviewer are juvenile.\n\nI played the course in November with a colleague. Having used this website successfully in the past, I trust the majority of the reviews. I have to agree with the reviewer below that gave an average rating. The staff and members are incredibly unfriendly which set the tone for the day.\nAs a member of one of the oldest 'members' courses I appreciate that the club is owned by the members. However, if the club elects to allow visitors to play, they should treat them with respect, particularly if you are charging in excess of \u00a3100 for the privilege.\nThe course was in very average condition and for links greens that normally stand up well in winter, they were incredibly bobbly. There are some very strong holes yet several very unmemorable ones. On returning to the clubhouse, the reception was so unwelcoming, we drove to Sandwich for lunch.\nPerhaps St George's rests on it's laurels and Open history, but I will not be returning in a hurry and agree that Royal Cinque Ports is a far more enjoyable and equally challenging experience.\nThe fool below who commented on ringing a bell to enter someone's house should be blacklisted. Comparing paying up to \u00a3180 for a round of golf to entering a stranger's house is simply idiotic!\n\nIt is reviews such as this and the one dated 22 March 2011 which do this site no favours. It would be far better to direct the main focus of a review on the course rather than club rules and unfriendly members.\n\nHugh\n\n15 February 2012\n\nI agree with El Gringo some people just live to gripe. At least RSG is open for visitors. Perhaps the whinging reviewer would prefer RSG to have a closed visitor policy like Loch Lomond or Queenwood? RSG is a links course from the very top drawer of links anywhere in the world and I think it's a privilege to play it and we should be grateful to expereince the opportunity.\n\nplayed it yesterday [29th March] in perfect conditions - not bad but certainly not 'great' - if you've been around Ballybunion, Birkdale and County Down [my top 3, in no particular order] then this is a huge let down and not fit to be mentioned in the same breath - front 9 has a nice pure linksy feel to it but the back 9 is lacklustre, with too few truly memorable holes - what really stuck in my throat was that we're still 4 months away from the Open and, already, 75% of the bunkers are out of play as GUR - how long does it take to prepare a bunker?! - worth a visit, but only because the big boys will be there in July...it doesn't, however, merit its ranking as 2nd among the English courses...I've played far better, but then that's just my opinion!\n\nI must disagree with the reviewer here. I find Sandwich to be the most fun course to play. I loved all of your mentioned top three but found they lacked imagination. County Down has the flatest greens I've played for a top links. Birkdale plays between the valley's of grand dunes. Ballybunion... well we all must love it!!! I just find the green complexes to be very interesting and, although the fairways are a bit severe, they are very fun to play from. They never offer a flat lie creating even more challenge. The front nine alone is worth the greens fee. Also, it takes a great amount of effort and time to create a reveted bunker. Especially with the size of some of those bunkers! I do wish everyone could understand how difficult it is to make them look that good. After playing Birkdale I felt the same way as the reviewer above. Lackluster, just because it's in the Open Rota doesn't merit a number one in England. Although I love them all and would love them the most after a round on any of them!\n\nI have played Royal St George's a number of times and agree with the previous reviews that it is a great links golf course. However, the club staff and members cannot be less welcoming. The club were incredibly selective over the time we could book and yet we barely saw another golfer on the course all day which is quite normal for a week day at Royal St George's. You cannot enter any part of the clubhouse except the changing room without a jacket and tie regardless of the time of day. Visitors are expected to ring a bell to enter the club - how pretentious is that? This is a real shame since it is one of the finest clubhouse bars in the country with great golfing memorabilia and historic references throughout. If you do not wish to change into jacket and tie you are ushered into a snack bar that resembles a motorway cafe. The members we did have the misfortune to encounter were incredibly hostile making us feel like we were not worthy of being on their land. The course is clearly being groomed for the Open so expect most of the bunkers to be GUR and the greens were recently treated so fairly slow. I would strongly recommend a trip two miles down the coast to Royal Cinque Ports where the members and club staff are delightful, the course is in excellent condition and the greens are true and fast. There is no question that Royal Cinque Port is a far more pleasurable golfing experience than Royal St George's.\n\nDear oh dear 2nd best ranked course in England. 11th in Uk. 26th in the World!!! You have given it a 3 ball rating. My favourite course alongside Birkdale. Class\n\nAnthony Daniels\n\n22 March 2011\n\nI played RSG this time last year and was blown away, as you will see from my review below. However, whilst I made no mention of the members or staff in my review they added to the experience. The staff were nothing but extremely hospitable and the members very friendly. Yes, the dining room was shut, but we knew that before we went, but we managed to go for a wander and had a good look around throughout the clubhouse. The members we encountered were only too pleased to take photos of us surrounded by all the historical memorabilia. I don't know what happened on the day that you visited, but personally I can't speak high enough of RSG and I can't wait to return in July.\n\ndan\n\n22 March 2011\n\nOK, i will keep this briefer than I feel. We played recently and were of course fully prepared for having to wear jacket and tie in the lovely club house, but that restriction is of course the right of the lucky members (very friendly to us) who allow us to play their course - try that in the USA ! We were treated very well by the professional, caddie master, changing room attendant, extremely friendly steward and all other staff. Yes most fairway bunkers were GUR, surely expected in the run up to The Open, but the greens were fine. The fact that the course was well managed yet relatively quiet allowed us to have a very relaxed morning four ball and afternoon foursomes. My experience of RCP was slightly different in that the course was great but in the club house no-one said that clothing requirements were in place hence I had to finish my lunch on the balcony ! Both courses great but no need to draw a 3 ball distinction I feel.\n\nEd Leaney\n\n23 March 2011\n\nBravo - agree with the review above. Last time I played the course in October the steward and the members were incredibly rude and unwelcoming. I also remember the difficulty my playing partner had in booking the round despite the course being deserted. We were considering playing next month but don't fancy paying \u00a3150 a head if the bunkers are GUR. Thanks for an honest and helpful review.\n\nRich\n\n23 March 2011\n\nAgree with the comments - as the original author suggested (and complimented), good course, but no atmosphere and very unwelcoming - I hope they sharpen up their act for the Open. Judging by the way Anthony Daniels jumps on any slightly poor review of RSG, he is probably either a member or the steward of the course!\n\nRichard Amadio\n\n02 April 2011\n\nI find it quite incredible that any visitor to a traditional golf club such as Royal St Georges should expect the club to change their long standing rules just to please a few casual visitors . I imagine the bunkers are being reveted before the open and they needed protection . Most visitors to golf clubs know the regulations of clubs before they go there and abide by them .I personally change my golfing clothes before eating but then I always have\n\nStephen Pook\n\n02 November 2011\n\nMyself and a friend visited on two occasions in March 2011 prior to the club holding 'The Open\". Is it true that some of the bunkers were GUR but that is quite understandable. The golfing experience was excellent. We also found the staff and members were perfectly friendly and whilst sitting in the bar for a post round drink, (in a jacket and tie as the club rules require), we were engaged in conversation by a couple of members and had an enjoyable chat about the club. OK, so the place is traditional (or a bit old fashioned if you prefer), but we found it to be a great all round experience and would recommend it to any prospective visitors.\n\nIan\n\n07 November 2011\n\nWould you walk into a strangers house without ringing the doorbell?\n\nEd\n\n14 February 2012\n\nI had a similar experience in terms of staff and member attitude and think it is important for visitors to be aware of this. Agree that the golf course is worth the visit, but my local driving range offers a better customer experience. I think Ivan needs to stay off the hard stuff - comparing entering a stranger's house to paying for a round of golf is pretty stupid!\n\nAnthony Daniels\n\n16 February 2012\n\nI am neither a member (although I would love to be, but 180 miles is a little far to travel every week) nor the steward.\n\nJohn\n\n14 March 2012\n\nIan is an idiot - it is not a 'stranger's house', but a golf club open to visitors. The only reason you would walk into a stranger's house is to rob it so you would definitely not ring the bell. That aside, congratulations to the reviewer for actually stating what the majority of golfers have long since known - great course, but unwelcome club.\n\nI played this magnificent course on Monday March 14 and I'am still overwhelmed. It is absolutely fantastic. As it winds it way through the dunes you get to play all kinds of shots (especially from the majestic bunkers). Even though it's an Open course it's not overly tough for the regular guy. That is if you play from the proper tees and steer clear from the bunkers. The bunkers are on the other hand so cool that you almost want to take them on once every now and then.\n\nThere's an \"old money\" feel to Royal St George's. Everything appears understated, perhaps comfy and rather familiar even to the first time visitor. The course appears straightforward enough but it's not easy, even when the wind is light because the routing, in a Muirfield style, is excellent. Thoughtful, strategic play and solid ball striking are required to play this old links. It's not my favourite Open venue, nor is it the most scenic or even the toughest but it's a class act and I'm hard pressed to fault RSG in any area whatsoever but it I think it lacks je ne sais quoi.\n\nWe paid \u00a3130 each for a day ticket at Royal St George's and we all agreed that it was the greatest day of golf that we had experienced. Having arranged our game in advance, we had breakfast (\u00a310) followed by 2 two balls in the morning, lunch (very prompt and reasonable), then a foursomes game in the afternoon. Superb golf, even with many bunkers GUR in anticipation of The Open this Summer. The whole experience is 5 star, with very friendly staff from the caddie master to steward to locker room attendant. For me, RSG vies with the Ailsa course as the most enjoyable Open rota course. Must play. dan\n\nHad the pleasure of playing this brute last week in glorious sunshine and the breeze fairly testing but not extreme. From the outset you can feel the history, the old school clubhouse and thatched roofs of the huts out on the course. Its tough but fair all the way round and if you dont have a decent game with you I can see how it would be a nightmare. Having played the scottish open venues this is on a par with any of them, and reminded me a bit of carnoustie and muirfield in places. There are a few things a feel that seperate these courses from the good, but not 'great' links. Bunkering is the first, every one cavernous and brilliantly positioned, not just dropped by the side of the fairway. The undulations are also key and add so much to the character of these courses and just make them so easy on they eye. Not just the natural ampitheatres that are created but the course management that is required. On many courses you can miss the green right or left without much damage but here you are punished and punished bad!\n\nComing from nairn, a fine track itself I do still realise the difference in quality of this and other open venues. Barely a weak hole on the course and the suez canal would sum it up for me. A par 5 that damands placement and the ultimate confidance in your own swing to avoid any OB the entire length of the hole, excellent bunker placement down the left and a green that if you bail out left is very tough to approach the pin. I would say only turnberry (because of the views), and kingsbarns ( because I dont want to feel like Ive gone 10 rounds with flloyd mayweather every time i play) come above this for me. Still an awesome place and we even found ourselves going out behind a very pacy jimmy tarbuck and sat opposite hugh grant who parked his ferrari next to our less glamorous peugeot!!\n\nSome full reviews in here explain this course well so I will not repeat. But this is a must play that will knock your socks off for weeks after. When the wind blows it will test your mental strength to the limit as this can be a real tough beast when it does. Bring your A game if you can. Brilliant.\n\nI might be a hacker but I can't understand the hype about this place. This is a one hell of a tough track and I agree with that. But being ranked that high I can't understand this.\nYes it is very historic, long and tough but other than that it is a pretty average links golf course. You must be very good to enjoy it and there is very little aesthetics about it.\n\nAs a 'hacker' I would stick to municipal courses and leave the classic open links courses such as RSG to serious golfers.\n\nIvan\n\n02 September 2010\n\nDo you really think it would be in the top 30 if it was built 5 years ago?! I personally don't. Again, this course is good but it is not outstanding. And the main thing about it is it's difficulty. If you ask me Sunningdale Old is a way better course in every respect. And I am not alone in this opinion. Let's leave the municipal courses to those who don't care much about golf at all.\n\nSimon\n\n03 September 2010\n\nYou simply can't compare Sunningdale Old with RSG, they are chalk and cheese and require completely different strategies and mental approach. As to whether it would be in the Top 30 if it was built 5 years ago, sort of a mute point really but personally I believe it probably would be. Also I didn't think it was overly difficult either, I play off 9 and comfortably reached all par 4's in two and didn't come away thinking I'd been beaten up, but I respect your opinion and we can agree to disagree! Regards\n\nleatherwedge\n\n03 September 2010\n\nSimon, is that not the point of these rankings - to try to come up with a ranked list of the 'best' golf courses, regardless of be they links, heathland etc? Personally i'm a links man but have not played either of these two courses, but am desparately trying to get a member friend to sign me on to Sunningdale!\n\nSimon\n\n04 September 2010\n\n@Leatherwedge - I agree completely that this is the whole point of rankings, I just think that ultimately you can't compare an out and out links course with a heathland\/parkland course which is why they polarise opinion I guess, but going back to my original point I fail to see how any serious golfer can call RSG an average golf course.\n\nIvan\n\n04 September 2010\n\nAlright, sir, thank you for your understanding and respect. I believe that I have not grown up to this course yet. Anyways there are no regrets about playing this great classic and I would recommend everyone to do so if he or she has a chance to. In any case there are no regrests about\n\nRoyal St George's is not easy to get to and it is a fair trek from London. The clubhouse is not grand looking from the outside but inside it is an Alladin's cave of golfing memories and memorabilia. The practice facilities are nice (driving range, chipping, putting, practice net) but then that's to be expected at an open venue. After paying the green fees we headed down to the 10th tee, where we were starting. Warning to anyone who starts there: leave at least 10 minutes to walk there and make sure you find a path; we didn't and had to cross patches of extremly tall and thick rough.\n\nMy view of the course and the experience will be somewhat warped as we played the course in gale force winds. Wooden benches were blown over, the flags were bending over at 45 degrees, my powakaddy was blown over and downwind it was pushed by the wind at a brisk walking pace down the fairway. Undoubtably this wind was far stronger than what stopped play at St Andrews at the Open. The course was in immaculate condition. The fairways were very hilly with many steep mounds but they were quick and firm. The rough was thick and it was only a hack out if you went in it. The greens were small and slopy. This made them hard to hit in this wind especially so as they were firm too (11 h'cap). However, it was a delight to putt on them as they were fast, exceptionally true and they had several interesting slopes and burrows. I found the bunkering to be the most severe challenge on the course. Many greens were surrounded by them and many were dotted around on the fairway. Although small they were not particularly deep.\n\nI thought the back nine (our front nine) was nice but in my opinion the front nine was superior and some of the holes were just outstanding. That bunker on the 4th was something else and when i dropped a ball in there it was only a 30 yard pitch over another bunker to safety on the side let alone over the top of the lip. The par 4\/5 5th hole was very interesting and the 'Maiden' reminded me a little of the 'Postage Stamp' at Troon. I preferred the front nine as it wound its way through much larger dunes while the back nine was mostly flat. I also thought the 18th was a little weak. I would have preferred it had the wind not been quite so strong (windy but not like a gale). RSG was a very good, tough course with some truly memorable holes and noticeably better than Prince's. It certainly looked much tougher than St Andrew's did on TV. I would warn you to check the weather before you play but it is certainly worth the trip. They also had a junior rate of \u00a335 which was good value. Only complaint would be that the food stopped at 3 o'clock. I felt that it was a breakfast\/lunch place.\n\nPlayed here in early May - conditions were very forgiving, a lovely sunny afternoon, not too much wind till later in the day and rough was only 6\" high so I wasn't playing it at anywhere near it's fiercest, for which I was thankful by the end of the afternoon. The staff were very friendly,courteous and accommodating - couldn't wish for a better reception. Lovely understated club house, with modern and spacious locker rooms, super lunch - an proper jacket and tie affair, but not to be missed. It was nice to see many members walking with their dogs roaming free. I did find the signage a bit lacking from one tee to the next as you don't have many points of reference. The greens were a little lacklustre , but they had recently been tined and overseeded, but to be fair to RSG I don't think that affected my score negatively. I loved the par threes especially 3rd nestling into the dunes. As others have noted the bunkers are ferocious and discretion proved to be the better part of valour I chose to exit more than one bunker sideways, rather than take two (or more!) fruitless shots at the pin. I wasn't unhappy with my scorecard, but could see how the conditions had been kind to me and how differently things could have turned out, especially as the wind got up on the last two holes back to the clubhouse to remind me that I'd had a cushy day here. I really enjoyed RSG, but wasn't as blown away as some reviewers, maybe recent reviews had made me over-hype it in my mind, for me it felt like a fairer and much better conditioned version of Portmarnock (Old) - I'm not a massive fan of blind shots. It was certainly a great days golf, fabulous lunch and I will look forward to watching The Open there next year.\n\nI played RSG on a clear, windy day in mid-April 2010, teeing off as a single on the 10th hole. The course was in good condition and I found it to be a very straightforward and fair test. Most of the trouble was clearly visable, so my challenge (even as a first time visitor) was confined to executing often-lengthy shots around the fast layout (i.e. not guessing where the greens or danger lay). Greens and fairways were both firm, and well-planned shots were required to get near the pins. Greens were in great shape and putting presented a fair test of nerves, as many putts were lengthy and\/or downhill. As is usually the case, a second trip around the course would have been welcome in terms of utilizing better strategy. I'll definitely make time for a return in the future. The staff was pleasant and efficient, and despite the stature of the course, I was never made to feel unwelcome as a visitor.\n\nI played Royal St. Georges on the 22nd April with my father, despite being a serious golfer for several years this was my first real test on a bona fide links course and I was extremely excited about testing my skills against an Open Championship course and the variety of shots I would need to play.\n\nFirstly the weather was perfect, bright sunny day and merely a hint of a breeze, to be fair we played the course in very benign conditions so the challenge was nowhere near as demanding as it should have been as it's my understanding the wind here can be fierce at times, not that I was complaining! The clubhouse is unassuming from the outside but once you walk in you get an immediate feel for the history of the club with gloriously high ceilinged rooms and walls etched with pictures, honours boards and memorabilia spanning the last hundred years and more. The locker rooms were surprisingly large with excellent changing facilities and the full English breakfast buffet was both plentiful and delicious.\n\nThe pro shop is suitably stocked and the range facilities are excellent as are the chipping and putting areas located just off the first tee. We were unable to play the course from the tips but this in no way lessened the challenge ahead, having not played the course before we were at times undecided about where our tee shots should be aimed. However, what is clear was that the course was playing completely differently to how it will do in The Open next year, for a start my tee shot went right on the first towards the place Tiger Woods lost his ball. The rough was very short so I found my ball first time (as I did many times after straying off the fairways) so I will be interested to see just how much more penal the rough will be next year for The Open as I don't doubt I would have lost several balls during my round otherwise.\n\nThe greens had just been seeded and hollow tined so they weren't playing at their best and were a little bumpy, we weren't complaining as they were still relatively firm and true and the undulations on some greens made 2 putts extremely difficult. The overall conditioning of the course was excellent and the par 4 4th over 'Hells Bunker' is a lovely hole with hugely undulating fairways which looked amazing.\n\nOne thing that struck me was how fantastic all the par 3's were, I loved all of them and the bunkering on each of them (no bunkers on par 3 3rd to be fair) was brilliant and really made you think about where to place your tee shot, I don't think I have enjoyed playing par 3's as much anywhere else.\n\nThis is definitely a drivers course though and it pays be to relatively straight although as mentioned earlier the rough wasn't anywhere near as penal as it would be for The Open, you also need to be pretty handy with your long irons too. I loved RSG and there are so many holes I remember fondly, the welcome from the starter and pro shop was lovely and we pretty much had the course to ourselves too so we played at a pleasurable pace and we're able to really take it all in. We have vowed to go back next year after The Open to play the course at it's peak (along with hundreds of other people no doubt!) but also because we simply loved the place and it has given me a real enthusiasm to go and play as many links courses as I can now over the next few years.\n\nRSG deserves its place in the top echelon of courses in this country, any serious golfer will appreciate the blind shots, the sometimes unfair bounces on the fairways, the deep faced bunkers and the undulating greens \u2013 it's a proper test and one I can't wait to repeat! I just wish I didn't hit driver on the 18th as I ended up in the fairway cross bunkers 300 yards away and my Dad laid up and managed to halve our match, not that I am bitter of course!\n\nIt sounds like you enjoyed it as much as we did a month ago. It's just a truly wonderful golf course. If there are 10 better courses in the UK and Ireland then they must be absolute world beaters.\n\nI would like to start by making absolutely no apologies for the length of this review. The quality of this place commands nothing less than an essay!! As many previous reviewers have said, this place is the gold standard. If Birkdale is better, then I truly cannot wait to play there. Off the course RSG does it in a classy, understated, and low key manner. There are no grand gates, signage or big brash bling, and once you step onto the course you realise why \u2013 it doesn't need it as the course speaks volumes as it hits you with a flourish of brutal and classic links golf holes. As we made our way to the medal tees on 30th March, the caddiemaster wished us luck in dealing with the four\/five shot wind that is apparently not unusual in this neck of the woods.\n\nThe 1st eases you in to your round, but still demands an accurate approach if you are to score well. Then comes the short 2nd with a blind tee shot, if you dare, over two bunkers. Another accurate approach is required to a large sloping green. The 3rd hole is a magnificent par 3 with no bunkers. With the pin at the back it was stretched to 215 yards, the green surrounded on all sides by ominous and imposing dunes. Playing off 11 and with three pars to my name I was obviously on cloud nine as I stepped on to the 4th tee. Off the medal tees the line is slightly left of THE bunker. However, it just gets in your head and, although none of our fourball went anywhere near it, neither did we trouble the fairway. Again the approach is uphill to a raised green which has severe undulations and run offs ready to gobble up poorly hit shots.\n\nThe 5th is quite possibly the best hole on the course and requires another accurate drive (this is definitely a recurring theme around RSG, as is the use of the big dog) to find the fairway and avoid the six or seven fairway bunkers down the left hand side. The approach could well be played blind or semi blind depending on how well you did with your tee shot, and has to be played either through a gap between two dunes or over either one of them if you've strayed off the fairway. Once over\/through the dunes there are no hazards within 80 yards of the green, although the run off areas will again scoff anything not hit into the heart of the green. The 6th is the second of what I believe must be a serious contender for the accolade of the finest collection of par 3's on any course. Although it is SI 17 it is invariably played back into the wind, and when this wind is as strong as I mentioned earlier you have one tricky hole in front of you. Add the four cavernous sand traps and the narrow green into the equation and you could be forgiven at having a double take at the SI. Walk off with a par and be delighted. You've done better than I if you achieve this. The 7th is the first genuine birdie chance for us mere mortals. A 490 yard par 5 lies ahead, although a well struck drive over dunes is again required. If you can keep it fairly straight then you should be rewarded with a long iron approach to the green to leave you with an eagle opportunity if you hit a good 'un. Don't three putt, like I did. You won't make birdie like that!! After a brief respite the 8th is an absolutely brute. A dogleg right of 419 yards, back into the wind, and with a carry of about 150 yards over rough to get to the green. A bogey five truly is an excellent score here as this is a genuine SI 1 hole. The 9th is another short par 4 but once again a good tee shot is required. Even a good shot may be made to look ordinary as it catches one of the steep banks that encourages your ball to topple away off the fairway and leave you with a blind approach. If this is the case then it'll be more about luck than judgement if your little white friend comes to rest on the dancefloor as the humps, bumps and borrows on the green are almost as severe as further back towards the tee. A good shot only needs to catch one of these and it'll be a very tricky up and down.\n\nYou'd better hope that you have scored well during your adventures through the dunes, as when you walk to start the back nine things start to get really brutal. The 10th is a rival to the 5th for the best hole on the course and, although it appears short at 371 yards, it is played uphill, slightly into the wind and the green is perched right on top of a dune. I smashed a driver and a 5 iron to the front of the green and managed to make my par. Others in my group who hadn't quite hit their approach as well as me ended up 30 yards left of the green and about 30 feet below the putting surface, purely because of the severe slopes. In reality, they were fortunate to be there as the alternative would have been at the bottom of one of a pair of absolute chasms of bunkers that stand sentry at the front left. These are the sort of bunkers that require a step ladder to get in and out of. The 11th is the next of the fabulous par 3's. Although it plays downhill and downwind, the pin was eeked out right at the back of the green and measured 231 yards. Needless to say I was delighted to see my 5 iron come to rest 12 feet behind the hole. Also needless to say, I was not so delighted when I missed the putt. And here's the thing with the greens; they are slick and very very true, but don't read too much into them. Instead, just pick your line and commit to hit. If you hit a positive putt it often appears that there is very little break, but if you hit a weak putt then the breaks that you thought could be there seem to be accentuated. I hope this makes sense. If not, I suppose the only way to see what I mean is to go and try it for yourself\u2026\u2026.go on, you'll love it!!\n\nTwelve is a short dogleg right par 4. Along with the 16th this is probably the best protected green as it is surrounded by no fewer than six bunkers. One of these bunkers provided me with the opportunity to play what is the best shot I have ever played. Admittedly I shouldn't have been in there in the first place as I ruined my cracking drive by fatting my approach straight into the biggest and deepest of the bunkers that guard the front of the green. When I walked up and found the ball plugged in the sand about a foot from the face I began to think that I may be in there for the rest of the day. Two of my playing partners suggested the only possible way out was to play sideways to the left. However, that would only have put me in another bunker next door. Therefore, I decided to be brave and aim straight at the flag, which was still the best part of 20 yards away. The shot demanded being struck as hard as possible with the club face wide open in order to get the ball to travel up six feet whilst only going two feet forward. If I could manage this I'd be out. So away we went\u2026\u2026smash\u2026\u2026sand everywhere\u2026\u2026.pain ripping through my left arm as the impact of the club into the bunker face took it's toll\u2026\u2026.and then there was the ball\u2026\u2026soaring through the air having almost lodged itself up my left nostril\u2026\u2026it's still flying\u2026\u2026still flying\u2026\u2026.it might make the green\u2026\u2026it's on the dancefloor ready to boogie\u2026\u2026hang on, not only is it on there but it's only 12 feet away and pin high. I thankyou!!! I think everyone can guess what happened next \u2013 yep, I missed the putt!!! Apologies for dwelling on that for so long, but I still can't quite believe I managed to achieve such a result.\n\nAnyway, moving on\u2026\u2026. The 13th is the longest par 4 on the course but, like the 7th, is played downwind and should allow an approach with a mid to short iron if a well struck drive is played. The problem is the line, as it is another blind drive to a fairway that is not visible at all from the tee. This makes the fairway bunkers all the more hazardous. The green is split in two by a trench that runs through the middle of it. It'll be a good two putt if your ball ends up on the opposite side of the trench to the flag. This green is also situated right next to the old clubhouse at Prince's which was burnt down in 2008. The 14th is a monster of a par 5 at 533 yards and played straight back into the wind again. This is where you really get to test your ball striking as anything hit with a slight push, fade and slice will end up out of bounds and on the Shore loop at Prince's. The burn that runs across the fairway shouldn't really come into play as if you've hit a good drive then there will be no problem getting over it with your second, and if your drive was not so good then just play sensible and lay up. The OOB continues all the way down to the green and the left hand side of the hole is well marshalled by intermittent bunkers. This is an exceptional hole, amongst a course packed full of them. Fifteen is another long par 4 with bunkers in play off the tee on either side of the fairway. The green complex is similar to the first in that anything short and\/or right will run off and leave a tricky chip. And so to the 16th, the last of the one shotters, and a beautiful links hole to complete the set. Bunkers seem to be everywhere and the green appears to shrink before your eyes as you tee up your ball and the wind howls down at you as if mocking your chances of getting anywhere near the pin. Once again you may double take at the SI (this is number 18!). If you hit the green, then well done. Of course, if you are fortunate enough (or unfortunate, depending on how much of a test you want) to play here with little wind then this hole would be a prime example of one which would become infinitely easier.\n\nJust as you think you're almost there and that things may start to ease up, then you come to the fiendish 17th. Give it a mighty swipe off the tee, another mighty swipe from the undulating fairway (if you're good enough to have found it), and then probably a short pitch to the smallest green on the course. Take two putts and be happy with a bogey. Eighteen, another long par 4, is perhaps the weakest hole on the course. However, on probably any other links course it would rank as one of the best, such is the supremacy of Royal St George's. The fairway bunkers are not as well placed as others, but perhaps this is just because they are placed in fairer positions than on other holes, but they still attract any tee shot not hit in the right area (ie mine!). As others have said, to need a par here to win The Open would be a daunting prospect. Fair play to the man that manages that.\n\nUnfortunately I didn't get to sample the lunch in the dining room as it wasn't open. However, I didn't come here for the food. I came for the feast of golf, and I left having gorged like a pig!! To have played my best ever shot on the best course I have ever played made it even more memorable. Had that shot been played on any other course then I would have had real trouble in remembering a lot of the holes. However, the sheer quality and variety of the holes made each one memorable. On reflection, for me what makes Royal St George's so good is the fact that it not only tests a tremendous variety of shots due to the routing, the way that the wind affects each hole differently, and the clever positioning and horrifying nature of the bunkers, but it also tests the player's ability to replicate the same shot over and over again, most notably by hitting your driver almost immaculately. If you manage to accomplish all of this, then you have a chance. But if this is the case then what are you doing reading this, you should be warming up for Augusta next week!!! Anthony Daniels\n\nBravo! What a review! I had just reviewed this course two before you, and whilst you were playing at RSG I was at Deal. But I played RSG the day after! Can I just say that this is the most enthusiastic review I have read and to be honest right too! I was in the bunker on the 12th and I walked off with a 6 so well done for that! It is refreshing to see I am not the only mad man who raves about this course! Again top class review!\n\nAnthony Daniels\n\n06 April 2010\n\nThanks Stefan. Once I got going I couldn't stop! But I think that the quality of the place deserves such a lengthy review and I hope it may encourage one or two others to pay it a visit. If so, I know they won't be disappointed.\n\nSimon\n\n06 April 2010\n\nGreat review, very informative and enthusiastic which reflects very well on RSG. I am playing here on 22nd April 2010 with my father and your review has only increased the excitement I have about playing there, many thanks.\n\nThis course is the best links course in the world by a clear margin. We are golfers here reviewing golf courses, not hikers out for a stroll admiring the scenery. If this was the case Bamburgh would be number one and would remain there until the end of time. I concede that the surroundings are important but the ranking should be for the quality of the golf course alone. Perhaps an additional ranking could be introduced for aesthetics, the equivalent of artistic impression.\n\nIt can be incredibly bleak, which is of course part of its charm but on a fine day, with the skylarks high in the air and a gentle breeze, it doesn't lose much to the other more scenic courses. George's is a big, big course. As others have said it is possible to play a round without encountering another soul and several of the tees will leave the first-timer wondering in which direction to hit the ball. This isolation is quite unique amongst the Open courses and provides the solitary player with a chance to commune with his game and the wild surroundings in perfect peace. It is a driver's course with many of the carries presenting a formidable challenge even for the accomplished ball-striker and quite impossible into the sort of wind not infrequently found in these parts. The turf is of the highest seaside quality and unlike Birkdale, for example, the dunes are used - and how! Only Lahinch & Belmullet have comparable undulations.\n\nI will make brief mention of the clubhouse although once again this should not be a component of the course ranking. The smoke room is the very essence of an established English seaside golf club right down to the matches in the brick frog on the bar. It stands comparison with Brancaster. Lunch in the dining room is on a par with Muirfield. Those of you, like me, who are wondering why there could possibly be eight links courses above it in the rankings, need to commend it even more enthusiastically to our fellow links aficionados. NT\n\nAbsolutely - it's about the course, nothing else should matter. And I agree, RSG is a better track than Dornoch, St. Andrews and Carnoustie (the three links above it in the rankings that I've played). For me, Carnoustie's the only one that's close.\n\nDerek\n\n06 April 2010\n\nYou've raised an interesting issue about rankings and reviews. I can only say that in my reviews I try to encapsulate the whole \"experience\" and for me the setting IS an important element to that - second only to the quality of the course. The clubouse and ancillary services is much less important to me than the setting. The logic of your argument and that of the other respondee is that Turnberry, Dornoch, Kingsbarns etc would be no less worthy of admiration if they were plonked in the middle of a housing estate or a landfill site. Does anyone who loves their golf truly believe that?\n\nNigel Thorpe\n\n06 April 2010\n\nBefore I posted this review I was trying to fathom why there were eight links courses above RSG in the rankings. The recent testimonies leave us in no doubt as to how wonderful this golf course is. I reached the conclusion that the others must be higher because of their scenic qualities. Surely though you wouldn't knock venerable Royal Lytham because it is surrounded by houses or mark down that great east coast links at Seaton Carew because you can see the Graythorp landfill site from the fairways so why elevate other courses just because of their attractive surroundings? I think the feature that does it for me is the fantastic duneland at George's \u2013 if I wanted to show an overseas golfer just what links golf is all about Sandwich is where I'd bring them.\n\nTom\n\n20 December 2011\n\nI've been fortunate to have been able to play many of the great links courses around the world. I've also played RSG about 8 times and always found it to be a great links golf challenge, wonderfully varied and superbly kept. However, I cannot concede that it's easily the best links course in the world. Pacific Dunes in Oregon, Muirfield, Birkdale, Royal County Down, St. Andrews Old, Kingsbarns and Turnberry can all make similar claims and can only be divided in my opinion based on taste or preference.\n\nRoyal St George's has to be on every golfers list! I played it on the 31st March in near 40mph winds at times, and it even though at times I struggled to stand up and my ball was wobbling on the tee, let alone on the greens, it was simply amazing!\nThe course is simply the best I have played! We started on the 10th tee and what a way to start! A great Par 4 with a raised green, which in the wind is incredibly hard to hit!! Then you move onto a cracking Par 3 of 242 yards!\nThen a great short hole, followed by three absolute brutes! Which combined total 1500 yards and they are two par 4's and a par 5!\nThen the beautiful Par 3 16th, and then the closing two holes which if I am honest I can't remember much of, but the 18th tee is certainly a very daunting tee shot bunkers line the fairway, and I certainly wouldn't want to have to par it to win the Open!\nThe front nine though is in another league! The 1st with the thatched starters hut, and the dogleg 2nd, is about as 'gentle' as it gets. Then the 3rd is a brilliant Par 3. The green has two tiers and you play over 200 yards of rough to an island green surrounded by dunes and is the only par 3 on the Open rota without a bunker!\nThen you enter the teeth of the course! The fourth tee shot is the most daunting with the most viscous bunkers on the course, and there are plenty to chose from\u2026. The 5th is a amazing dogleg par 4 where the approach is played through a gap between two dunes towards the sea. The 6th is possibly the finest Par 3 on the whole course, and then the 7th is a birdie opportunity par 5. And then the 8th is the hardest hole on the course, a semi-blind tee shot, followed by an approach of 150-175 yards to a green surrounded by dunes and bunkers. Then the 9th is a solid par 4 where hitting the green, as with most the other greens, is an absolute must!\nThen we ventured into the clubhouse, battered and bruised, and that was just the scorecard! However what a clubhouse! We had the best lunch imaginable in the dining room!\nIn all I cannot help but think the only thing that prevents Royal St George's from being No.1 in England is perhaps the views beyond the course, but then again Birkdale is protected by dunes so there too views are limited.\nI will be back!\n\nIt has been almost a year to the day since I was fortunate enough this play this old English masterpiece, and I'm happy to admit to falling in love with it. So much so, that if I ever have trouble falling asleep, I will retrace my steps.\n\nLike any good relationship it was not love at first sight. When on the practice ground, I was struck by the sparseness of the land. The dunes which become your playground on the front 9, were a distant but tempting view as a handful of members got underway. They turned out to be the only people that we saw that day, as myself and my playing partner spent a magical four and a half hours playing this wonderful links; pacing out yardages, stalking greens and generally treating the course as our own.\n\nI'm tempted to say that the course starts slowly, but that's probably unfair on the 1st and 2nd, but the moment we stood on the par 3 3rd, the course really seemed to come alive. The run of holes which follows has so many highlights, it's like an episode of Match of the Day. My personal favorites were the par 4 5th, par 3 6th, the blind tee shot on the 7th. I could continue like this all the way to the brutal par 4 15th, which was playing into a slight crosswind which managed to stretch the hole even further.\n\nI'm at pains to complain about the last 3 holes as I did really enjoy them and the challenge they provided, but I do feel that they suffer from the sparseness mentioned at the start of the review. However, when the stands are up, I'm certain that they would frame them better, helping to top off the holes which have gone before them. Whilst it's fair to say that the vistas beyond the course are not in the league of a Turnberry, the beauty within is simply stunning, and I found the lack of external 'eye candy' to be a positive, as it allowed me to focus on, what is in my eyes, a true 6 ball course.\n\nEverything about my day here was more than I could have ever hoped it to be. The only negative being my concern that if I ever returned, how could I beat this experience? It's not for me to advise golfers to play here as I would presume it is on the list for 99% of golfers anyway. All I can say, is that I hope you enjoy it as much as myself and playing partner. One last thing, I would be interested to hear from people who have played here and Royal Birkdale, as RSG is lower than Royal Birkdale in the rankings. How much better is it, or are both courses in that top bracket, where truthfully the only thing separating them is a good honest debate over a pint?\n\nVery good course and test of golf especially when the wind blows. Played here on a windy day in march and found the course in very good condition, greens true but not too fast. Front nine is more pleasing on the eye, through the dunes etc, as the back nine is a little flat but having said that is the stiffer test if the wind blows. Better than Hoylake but not in the same league as Birkdale. Excellent par 3's.\n\nThe Gold Standard. This place simply cannot be bettered. Great location - secluded and very quiet. Select membership. Beautiful traditional clubhouse. Great ambience inside. Loved the exclusivity and the fact that visitors weren't allowed in the dining room. The course itself is top drawer. The front nine being the best I've played anywhere along with Royal County Down. Back 9 better than RCD but views not as good. Overall it edges RCD as my favourite. The condition of the course was exceptional, the staff and members very friendly and the two-ball policy as usual was very welcome. I played with my brother, father and grandfather and we had a terrific game of foursomes. The \"oldies\" beat us 3&2 after we couldn't get out of Bjorn's bunker. Best hole - 5th. High point was the glass of malt on the 5th tee...\n\nProper golf. As good an atmosphere as i`ve sampled anywhere this place is pure class. As far removed from The Belfry, Celtic Manor, etc. as it is possible to get. The condition of the course was incredible,the bunkers perfect. Prefered the front 9. As a test of golf it was bang on .Links golf at its finest but it was the overall feel of the place and lack of crass modernism that places it fourth in my overall rankings. Superb.\n\nAlmost 3 years since I played here for the first time, and that might sound silly, but I had forgotten how good it really is. Is there a better collection of greens somewhere? Only RCD has the edge for me, RSG being T2 with Birkdale, Muirfield and Turnberry in my books. All holes have something to offer, something always outstanding. Played in a strong wind and my goodness it was tough! Already looking forward to seeing the Open there in 2 years. RSG is stuck back in time, no lady members here, and they only just recently put distances on the watering systems (which didn't please the boy in the Pro shop too much!!). The formality of the place might put some people off. But I know I'll be back sooner than later. Loved it!!\n\nRoyal St George's is without doubt the finest course I have played. I have played all the Open courses and many, many of the Top 100 Courses but none compare to Royal St George's.\n\nAnthony Daniels\n\n05 September 2009\n\nI am booked to play RSG in March next year and cannot wait.\n\nAnthony Daniels\n\n30 March 2010\n\nWell, I've just got back from my visit here and I feel like I've done ten rounds with Tyson. The guy in the pro shop said that the 4-5 club wind was not unusual. It certainly made it fantastically difficult. What a place. What a course. The best I've ever played.\n\nIt doesn't get any better than this! Wow. RSG is jaw droppingly impressive. Almost every hole is spectacular and the layout means you are with the wind on one hole and against it next. THe final 4 holes are absolute beasts - I can't wait to see how the pro's get on in the run in at The Open in 2011. There are too many exceptional holes to highlight any, but getting successfully out of Thomas Bjorn's bunker was one my many pleasures on what was my best ever golfing day. We topped our day off off Pimm's on the lawn. Amazing. RSG is an experience not to be missed and my 19 pals all agreed this was the best-of-the-best.\n\nEnglish translation of above review: Simply outstanding. With the wind, you quickly understand why even the Pros don't always score that well. The atmosphere was great and the members welcoming, the course is a marvel. Every venture into the rough will be punished. Take the time to watch the ever-changing sky. I'll be back!!\n\nIt took me a while to warm to St George's. The course is big and intimidating and difficult, the wind can really blow and it can wear you out if you're not on top of your game (by the time you reach the 14th green you'd be forgiven for thinking you'd played a full round). Now there are very few places I'd swap it for. You have to drive it well but there are enough tee boxes for you to find your range. The real key is the approach play, as whilst the greens are large, the landing areas are often very small, and the pin positions can be devilish. The 4th is a good example - a lot of people talk about the perilous drive, but the real difficulty is landing it on top of the huge slope in front of the green and keeping it on the small plateau any where near the flag. The same is true at holes like 2, 3, 8, 9, 11, 15, 18 (9 is just marvellous). The rebunkering is good, they are proper deep, difficult, shot taking bunkers that require planning to avoid. If I have a criticism its that the bunkers don't offer enough risk\/reward balance, esp on holes like 5, 13 and 18 where there's no benefit to going near them. The The real joy is that you'll hit every club in the bag during the round. The key to good scoring is your long putting from 60-100 feet, as the slopes are treacherous. Great course to play in winter as the greens stay firm and true but receptive. As at April 2009 it needs a bit more rain to be in good shape as the greens are still a little uneven following hollow coring. If you appreciate it is an old fashioned links course that is bloody difficult but a wonderful challenge then you'll never stop enjoying it. Please make time to have lunch in the dining room as the roast beef is worth the trip alone (and the snack bar isn't up to the standard of the rest of the club).\n\nI played here on an overcast and fairly windy day in mid March eagerly anticipating the test ahead and I must say I was not disappointed. Off the medal tees and with a 2-3 club wind blowing this is one of the most testing courses I have ever played. There is a good variety to the holes with some interesting short par 4's, classic par 3's with penal bunkering and the par 5 \"Suez Canal\" poses a plethora of challenges to anyone who is anything short of being a pure ball striker. Enjoyably most holes are played in what feels like isolation to the rest and the large greens (although still early in the season) seemed true and should be of great speed in the summer months. Highlights include watching your drive soar over the gargantuan bunkering on the 4th and the split fairway, par 4 eighth. I think I will have to play in the summer to get a true feel for the place as there was no definition of the rough and many bunkers were still G.U.R but in spite of this and the fact that the surrounding scenery is not in the same league as say Kingsbarns, it was still a fascinating test of golf. The pro's will not get it easy here in 2011!\n\nPlayed this on Friday 27th February for \u00a370 winter fee\n16 degrees c and not a drop of water on the course, best day of the year and i got a winter rate too!!\nWhen i got there i was hit by the charm and sense of occassion that this course exudes.\nVery good service from the caddiemaster and i was directed to the driving range to warm up.\nThe driving range was immaculate and you can tell immediately that you are at a class golf course, it was like hitting off Greens!\nI started off on the tenth hole and did not have anyone infront of me all-round.\nThe course was immaculate there was alot of work going on with the bunkers, to see the effort they are putting into these for the forthcoming open they are hosting really shows their commitment to making this a great course. Some of these bunkers are monsters!\nMy favourite holes were the 10th, 14th, 15th & 16th; the 16th has to be the best par 3 i have ever seen.\nAs briefly stated before this course is an amazing layout; the quality of the course makes it in a league of its own; the greens; whilst recently hollow tined were very true and very fast, i can only imagine how tough they can be in the height of summer!!\nRough was tough and long but not as bad as i expected in places, so long as you stick to the fairways you wont lose a ball! There are some blind shots and some real risk and reward shot options on lots of holes. There was only a slight breeze; i was lucky- no doubt that if there is a real wind, this course will be the toughest out there.\nAll in all i am overwhelmed at my time at this course and will re-visit to really enjoy it now knowing the layout.\n\nRSG is an excellent Links course even if the British Open weren't played here it would still be one of the best examples of Links golf. RSG has sand dunes, rough, (rough and rough), deep bunkers, blind shots, strategic play is required, the bump and run into greens is almost always an option and you will find the short grass a true \"fairway\" with lots of bounces where some bounces better than others. There is a good practice area to warm up or practice the deep bunker recovery. The club itself is understated (which you hardly see in the United States these days). On a busy day you might see 15 autos in the car park it isn't a place of the tour busses and crazed tourists this is a traditional, classic club just as you would want to experience. The clubhouse is nice and the mens locker room is one of the most posh you will find in GB&I. Once you see the locker room you will understand it was built for the pro's. The lunches in the spike bar need some help for a club this nice they should offer something tastier, I can't speak for the dining room however I didn't bring my jacket and tie. The Starter is a character he drew me a map on the score card of where to walk and where to aim my shots it was very helpful as you can get lost amongst the dunes (not many English links play amongst sand dunes as you would expect which make this course stand out). The pro shop is well stocked with goodies to take home. But none the less the course is why you will visit and it is a real championship test. Bring lots of balls as the rough is deep and you won't find them strayed tee shots (at least during certain times of the year).\n\nA no-arguments \"Cathedral of Golf.\" I have played this every year for the last 7 years (and Harry, please get booking for 2009). Usually we play in April but in 08 we played in mid-June. What a difference. The rough was punishing for having 2 more months to grow. But nothing can take the shine off this course. Every time I play there I love it a little bit more. Every hole has its own distinctive character. I have finally figured out how to play the 4th without being intimidated by the Himalayan bunkering facing you from the tee. But holes 4,5,8,10,13,15 & 17 are just tough links holes without contrived trickery. The course feels as if it was gently carved out of its enviroment. If it had the views of RCD or Tralee it would be impossible to fault. Top-notch...Tim Gorman\n\nI know this is probably not the done thing, but I forgot to mention the food in the dining room. Yes it is a pain putting on the jacket and tie, but the food that you will be rewarded with is worth the effort - better than anywhere else, Muirfield and Rye included!\n\nGreat course and always in excellent condition. Much more quirky then neighbouring Deal and Prince's with quite a few blind shots, especially on the front nine.\n\nThis is a great, great golf course and in my mind unique among the current Open courses. There are several blind or near blind tee shots and a blind second to the fifth which is more reminiscent of Prestwick than any of the other modern Open venues. This course requires first class driving skills to negotiate, and the first ten holes play through and around some outstanding dunes but the inward nine never lacks for interest. I found the greens and green complexes very interesting, especially the narrow eleventh and the devilishly sloped 10th. The steep right slope on 16 proved the ruin of Thomas Bjorn in the 2003 Open, and there are many similar challenges throughout this course. We were able to secure a day ticket to play the course twice, and if you have the means and the stamina I would certainly play this great course twice. The highlight of the club may be Doug, the caddiemaster, who served as starter, caddiemaster, course and tour guide all in one. Our lunch on the patio was excellent, and I recommend the Royal St. George's club sandwich, with turkey inside and a fried egg and bacon on top. Quite an unusual delicacy for a yank like me. Finally, the members we met were various gracious and even arranged for a ride back into our hotel in Sandwich. What a great, great day at a magnificent golf course and a wonderful club. Richard Smith, Knoxville, Tennessee\n\nwhen i played this course, there was absolutely no wind, which might explain why it was not as hard as i expected, but it is still not an easy course\ni found this course real fun, and the holes were great, i just didn't want to stop playing i could never get bored\ni imagine, that if the wind was up, then it could be a very hard course, but it is not so without it.\nas well as this, their sunday roast is very good\ni would recommend this course to anyone who wants a tough challenge, and is a fan of links courses\n\nPlayed here last winter and just about had the whole course to ourselves!! Extremely friendly, helpful and knowledgable starter. He drew diagrams of where to aim are tee shots for nearly every hole, just as well he did as you sometimes feel you can aim in every direction. Had the run of the clubhouse as well, which has a magnificent winners board!! The course itself is the hardest test of golf possible even with no wind. The bunkers are huge along the fairways and greens. The greens weren't the best as they had been hollow tyned, but had wicked breaks. Every hole is fantastic, this is a must play course. Can't wait to return.\n\nPlayed Prince's on the Monday and RSG on the Tuesday, while staying at RSG on Monday night. I grew up in America and have lived in the UK for 11 years and think this is my favorite links course. I usually forget holes on links courses, but can remember every hole at RSG because each had it's own charater in a way that is tough to explain until you compare it to Prince's (which is just the otherside of the out of bounds on the 14th hole). The holes were not unfairly hard, but you do get penalized for bad shots in the rought with a couple of lost balls and expect the rub of the green like any other links style course. A caddie is a must for the first time because there were some tees that you would think you could tee off in 360 degrees not knowing exactly where the fairway is.\n\nPlayed this on a windy late October Day. Fantastic experience but very difficult for mere mortal mid handicap golfers like myself. 4 holes - no points then suddently I began to hit the ball properly and four pars in a row! Bunkers rae a major defense on most holes (take your medicine in the fairways) and only one flat lie all day. In the end Iwas somewhatw eather beaten and battered but 28 points and the pure history of the place made the (very) expensive green fee worth it. The facilities generally are just OK (its an old fashioned club- proud of its traditions) - remeber a jacket and tie if yo want to explore. Pro and Caddie master very friendly. If your in Kent (I was on a family holiday nearby) any keen golfer would would regret missing the opportunity - if you can afford it!\n\nI recently played RSG for the 2nd time and I came away with a very similar perception as I had from my previous visit.\nIt has a very nice, old world ambience: Very nice clubhouse and many tasteful rewminders ofits Open Championship heritage.\nThe setting is however mixed: the initial holes that play away from the power plant are pleasant; however the views back towards the power plant and the pfizer faciilty border on being ugly.\nThe course itself opens well and has many outstanding and very difficult holes. I found the close (17 & 18) weak and somewhat of a let down.\n\nI would say that 17 or 18 are neither a let down nor a relief. 17 is a brute when played into the wind, as it generally is, and it has probably the smallest green on the course which is also a raised target. 18 is a little easier but you must still be long and straight. As another reviewer has said, I wouldn't fancy needing a par down here to win the Open. Fair play to the man that manages that.\n\nIt took me weeks after playing it to fully appreciate it. The greens were large and true but very subtle. The bunkers would eat up your balls. The fairways meandered between mounds and at times you coudn't tell where u were going. its one hell of a test and a must play course.\n\nI played RSG in a howling gale. The front nine were not too exposed and I was 4 over, the back nine were mercilessly wind swept ... 12 over. The course is however magnificent and even in winter plays off full tees and greens. The greens were quick and true and beautifully kept. For such a prestigious and rather exclusive club the officials and green staff I met during the day were very friendly and welcoming. I have played some of the great links course in the UK including the Old Course at St Andrews and this is right up there with the best. It's pot luck whether you get to play in the wind or not but even though conditions were tough it was a day to remember.\n\nPlayed today in pretty strong winds, and it was good old fashioned tough links golf. I think handicaps go out the window when one of your party (of 7) who plays off a solid 4 handicap can't reach a 500 yard par 5 with Driver, Driver and 5 iron!. I know some will say that you also have the wind with you, but I think RSG is cleverly laid out because I felt you played more holes in to the wind than with. We all agreed a very solid test of golf, and good value at the winter rate of \u00a365 a head. Greens were very true and in good condition. The Pro and Caddiemaster were very friendly and welcoming, yes the club has rules, but hey ho, it's the members club and if you don't like some of their rules don't play their course. Only my opinion but I didn't find it stuffy or pompous at all. As for the overall rating I would have to say it is very solid and ticks all the boxes but has no wow factor like some of my favourites \u2013 RCD, Turnberry, Portrush and Kingsbarns. Also it is not as much fun as say North Berwick and I have to say, and some people may ask me to wash my mouth out with soap and water, I didn't think it was as good as Tralee. Certainly doesn't make my personal top 10. Also makes you realise how much of a factor aesthetics can be \u2013 maybe they shouldn't I don't know \u2013 but on a grey February day RSG is pretty grim compared to some of the courses mentioned above.\n\nhaving been at sandwich for the 1993 open i always wanted to play it and got to do that in may and thought the price was a bit steep but didnt care, i just wanted to hit a drive over the 4th and monster bunkers, the course was totally different to anything i had played and was impressed with the layout and condition, the greens didnt look great but boy did they roll well and the bunkers were very hard to get out off. the 10th is probably the hardest par 4 on the course and the conditions didnt help and the rough was savage, lost some brand new balls. clubhouse and lockers were first class and when my girlfriend walked into a lady free zone they were very nice to her, even if there was no one in the room!\n\nDreary, Pompous and dull - no way. RSG rightly holds its place in the Top 20 of GB&I. Dreary and dull? No golfer (regardless of how many courses you have played) could really ever mean that about this course.\n\nJack Hammond\n\n21 May 2007\n\nWhat? It is anything, but pompous and dull. The staff are wonderful and the course is one of the most exciting. He must have had an awful round: quite usual for a first timer!\n\nCarl\n\n12 June 2007\n\nThis is an idiotic statement whether you like links golf or not. Some clubs are modern some are old fashioned, RSG is the latter and is an interesting visit for it. Grow up and don't be so dreary, dull and pompous."}
{"text":"This week I was asked for help by an amateur golfer who was finding it difficult to integrate some changes to her swing. She said her practice swing was great but her actual swing reverted back to her old style most of the time. Golf psychology can dramatically speed up integrating swing changes, so if you're wanting to make changes to your own swing, read on...\n\nGolf psychology says that if your actual swing is different to your practice swing, you must be THINKING something different. If during your practice swing you are focusing on the new swing, then over the shot you are focusing on getting the ball to the target, these two thoughts will create different swings and frustrating results! Time to reprogram your unconscious.\n\nHaving a practice swing that uses a different focus to your actual swing is no good. The two need to be identical - so that your actual swing then becomes an exact mental and physical replay of your practice swing. Rather than a practice swing, think of it as a PREVIEW SWING (we all know that in \"practice\" we can get away with a lot as the consequences are different). A \"Preview Swing\" means that you are using the exact same swing thoughts as you will for your shot. Adjust your routine as follows to make sure you stick to ONE swing and ONE set of thoughts, not two.\n\nWhen integrating a swing change it is crucial that you spend enough time in the \"Think Box\" - the area behind the ball where you think, plan, see the shot, pick your club, and carry out your preview swings. In the Think Box, go through the following steps\n\n1. Pick a specific target 2. See the ball flight as it goes to that target 3. Pick the club that will play this shot 4. See yourself playing the shot with this club. See yourself using your new swing, striking the ball and it flying to the target 5. Step into the picture so you take a Preview Swing with the same new swing, imagining striking the ball to the same target\n\nOnce you have previewed and committed to one clear shot, step up to address the ball - the \"Play Box\". The Play Box is not the place to think about your new swing - you have done that already behind the ball. It's the time to remember the shot you have just played in your mind behind the ball and do the same again. So simply see and feel the shot going to the target and put your best swing on it. Finally, judge your success not on the outcome of the shot but on how similar your preview and actual swings were.\n\nIf you would like more help in using golf psychology to score less without changing your swing, I'm giving away golf psychology tips through a series of six free audio tipcasts for the toughest parts of the game - sign up for my newsletter now if you would like to receive these."}

{"text":"About Golf Instruction Chicago\n\nI have has been a student of golf instruction for many years. Studying the great instructors from the past such as Ernest Jones, Percy Boomer, and Alex Morrison. In recent years he has spent hours going over the teachings of Tom Tomasello, Homer Kelly, and John Jacobs. New instructors like Brian Manzella and Kelvin Miyahira have been studying the science of the swing, in hopes of teaching the golf swing to students. All these teachers have contributed to shaping my teachings.\n\nThe past 3 years there has been a shift in the way the golf swing is understood and taught. Theodore P. Jorgensen, The Physics of Golf, was one of many books and papers to show that the old ball flight laws were wrong. It's now understood that the face at impact determines up to 85% of the direction the ball goes. Terms like zeroing out your D Plane have now made their way into golf instruction. 3D Radar machines like Trackman, and Flightscope have enabled instructors to view a student's swing in ways that have never been realized before.\n\nWith all the technology that is out there it is still up to the student to learn to be able to teach themselves. With a coach explaining and demonstrating, the use of video, and understanding how the mind and body learn, the student will show improvement. Its our goal to make you a better player by using the 3 core teachings we practice.\n\nLearn swing physics The premise that knowledge, rather than muscle memory, is the path to success and that a lack of success comes from incorrect understandings as opposed to lack of ability.\n\nDevelop sound body mechanics Knowing how the muscles and joints work best to create an efficient and injury free golf swing.\n\nTrain your brain to learn. The mind learns best in a playful environment. Studies show that its better to teach yourself. This is done by us guiding you through a process we call D.O.C. Do it, Observe it, Correct it\n\nLloyd and Danielle Mann have been collaborating for the past year in order to best teach and explain the mechanics of the golf swing. Danielle has enjoyed sharing her expertise in kinesiology, anatomy, and biomechanics in order to enhance, demonstrate, and maximize the golf swing for novice and advance golfers.\n\nDanielle Mann completed her undergraduate degree at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. Danielle received a bachelors of science with high honors in Kinesiology and Movement Sciences in 2004. Following her undergraduate work, Danielle received her Doctorate of Physical Therapy from Northwestern University in December 2006. Since that time, Danielle has been working as a level III Physical therapist in Chicago. Danielle treats a wide variety of patient diagnoses including: traumatic brain injury, stroke, joint replacements, spinal cord injury, multiple traumas, Parkinson's disease, and Multiple Sclerosis.

{"text":"Approach Discs\n\nShow:\n\nUntitled document\n\nThe devastating approach disc. This is the most under-utilized disc in the sport. Most people will forego this disc not knowing what its true purpose is. Basically, an approach shot is a throw, not a putt, and it is designed more to keep you near the basket than to get in it, although the best approach is also a run at the basket.\n\nThe Difference between putt and approach -\n\nA putt is usually just a simple flick of the wrist with little or no twisting of the torso, whereas an approach is typically thrown from the side with at least some twisting of the torso and hips. A putt is designed to move significantly slower than a throw. An approach shot, although the slowest throw in disc golf, is still not as slow moving as a putt.\n\nThe Difference Between a Putter and an Approach Disc -\n\nFirst, it`s important to understand that this isn`t set in stone. Plenty of people use putters for approach shots and approach discs as putters. Heck people even use drivers as putters(not recommended). But the true purpose of a putter is for short shots, generally 200 feet or less. Sure, they can be thrown further, but not without a lot of effort, especially if you have a low ceiling.\n\nThis is why, when 200 feet gets a little hard with a putter, we can step up to an approach disc. They move a little quicker, sometimes have more glide. They`ll generally handle a shot in the 150-200 foot range a little easier, allowing you to focus on accuracy.\n\nWhy Not Just Use a Midrange?\n\nOne thing most approach discs do have in common - the ability to stop abruptly somewhere near the target. This is one reason why a midrange disc would be less ideal for these shots. Another reason is the faster speed and higher torque required to make a midrange perform also makes it less appropriate for these shorter shots.\n\nHint: Always keep an approach disc in your bag. It fills in the short distance deadzone between a putter and a midrange.\n\nDisc Golf Trivia -One of the first true approach discs to hit the market in the mid 80`s was the XD, then known as the Aviar XD. At the time it was hailed as a Revolutionary new \"distance\" driver. As a matter of fact the \"XD\" initially stood for \"extra distance\"."}

{"text":"If you're not a golfer, there's not much point in buying Carl Hiaasen's latest book \"The Downhill Lie: A Hacker's Return to a Ruinous Sport\" (Knopf, 207 pages, $22). It's full of insider humor.\n\nBut if you are a weekend duffer, you will appreciate the task this novelist and award-winning newspaper columnist has given himself: break his best score (88) after a 32-year lay off.\n\nWith biting humor and painfully honest self-humiliation, Hiaasen describes his 1-1\/2-year journey into one of Dante's inner circles of hell.\n\nHis path is one that's familiar to anyone who's tried to improve his or her game: new clubs, new balls, swing analysis, lessons, club fitting, and an array of weird training devices and remedies that border on quackery.\n\nThe difference between Hiaasen and most of the rest of us is that this guy can write. He wryly and accurately conveys what struggling golfers (are there any other kind?) experience.\n\nFor example, Hiaasen gets his swing analyzed. Keith, the golf pro, is studying the erratic flight path of his shots on a computer monitor. He's puzzled and calls another pro over to look at the results.\n\n\" 'How bad is it?' I asked.\n\n'Have you thought about taking up fly-fishing?' Keith asked.\n\n'Or maybe bowling?' said the other guy.\n\n\"A second color monitor displayed the computer-imagined lines of each of my drives on a simulated fairway \u2013 the white lines wriggled hither and yon in a chaotic tangle, as if someone had detonated a plate of linguini.\"\n\nMostly I smiled ruefully. But Hiassen made me laugh describing how he sank a golf cart in a lake and how he disposed of the \"scarlet harlot,\" a putter that had betrayed him.\n\nIn his rare moments of seriousness, Hiaasen tells how golf became a way for him to spend time with his father who was never home. His exploration of that relationship, and the joy that his youngest son now finds in a game that causes Hiaasen so much angst, are among the few heartwarming passages of the book.\n\nYes, Hiaasen eventually breaks his old personal record. On Day 409 of his journey, he shoots an 85. But further progress eludes him. \" 'I feel like quitting again every time I play,' I admit, 'then I hit one good shot, and all I want to do is go out and play again.' \"\n\nDavid C.

{"text":"Mental Swing Tips for golfers\n\nIf you want to play better golf and make the game fun instead of stressful, you need to have only a couple solid swing tips to think about.\n\nRemember this mental tip at all times - golf is a very difficult game, probably one of the most, if not the most, difficult game on earth. You are going to hit good shots, bad shots, and even shanks sometime.\n\nIt is okay and a part of the game. Much of the obsessive thinking on the golf course comes from expecting too much from you. Just try to stay positive, have fun and only think about the following five swing tips when you are on the course. Your anxiety and shaking knees will probably decrease, resulting in you swinging better.\n\nKeep your head still. I can't emphasize this swing tip enough. Nobody can keep their head absolutely still when playing golf with the fabulous scotty cameron putter , but if you watch the pros their heads move very little. When you move your head your body moves with it, pulling your swing off line.\n\nVisualize the shot you are going to hit. Think about a very specific target, and only focus on that spot. Block out any negative thoughts, picture, and feel in your mind a good rhythmic swing.\n\nTake your time. Many people are in a rush when it is there turn to hit the ball with the best scotty cameron putter for sale in the market. This results in swings and strokes that are off tempo. Take your time and relax yourself. I am not asking you to slow down your foursome, but you need to be calm on the golf course in order to play well consistently.\n\nForget about the last shot. Play every shot like it is the first of the day. I can't stress enough how important this swing tip is. Most of the mental mishaps on the golf course happen because you are emotionally charged about the last shot or the triple bogey you made four holes ago. Once a shot is done it is over with and you can't change it, so \"hit it and forget about it.\"\n\nWhen you are playing a round of golf you just can't afford to obsess over various swing thoughts. Most people have a million things running through their head as they stand over the ball, which causes most of the bad shots they stress over."}
{"text":"Swing clubs better by following the leader\n\nTo continue, think of the left side as the leader (for righties). The left side control begins right at the start of the swing, because one tends to control the forward swing with the side that controlled the backswing. On the backswing, the right arm is simply a support for the left. Your right arm can help you get deeper into the backswing but only by staying relaxed and letting that left arm pace the backswing.\n\nA tight right arm actually shortens the backswing, cutting off the backward motion and forcing you too quickly into the forward swing. When you throw a ball underhanded, you just let your right arm swing around your body, bend, set and throw without a lot of effort. You should do the same thing when you swing a golf club.\n\nWhen the club reaches the top of the backswing, the speed and weight of the swinging club puts greater pressure on the handle end. Therefore, when the club is started on its return to the ball, it's necessary to exert more pressure with the left hand, simply because it's closer to the handle than the right hand. That is difficult, if not impossible to do, if the left hand and arm are not in control going back.\n\nHow many times do you strike behind the ball and hit a fat shot? That's because you have little control with the left side while the right side dominates. This causes hand action to take place too early in the forward swing, the wrists to uncock too early away from the body instead of moving close to it as you swing through the ball.\n\nA good way to get the feel of this action is to take a pitching wedge, take your hold with your left hand and simply grasp all the fingers of your left hand with your right hand. Start by hitting little shots at first, then gradually increase the swing. You easily can sense the left side leading and the right side following this way.\n\nRules teaser:\n\nIn a stroke play event, a player starts with 14 clubs and in anger breaks his putter on the 18th green. He then realizes there is a sudden death playoff and replaces it. In a match play event on another course, the same scenario happens and the match being square, the player replaces his putter for playing the 19th hole. Rulings on both situations?\n\nAnswer to last column's teaser:\n\nA player marks his ball and before he can remove his marker, the wind causes the ball to move. Ruling? The ball must be marked or played from the spot the wind moved it to.\n\nJohn Lucas is the teaching professional at Sky Ridge Golf Course and can be reached at john98382@olypen.com."}

{"text":"The game of golf is complex and has a steep learning curve, however; using golf divot repair tools does not have to be a challenge in itself. A golf divot repair tool is used to repair the green on the course. When you hit a golf ball onto the green, it usually leaves a ball mark or divot. With proper use of golf divot repair tools, the mark can heal within 24 hours. A ball mark that is left unrepaired can damage the course quickly, and is a pain for owners.\n\nIn order to begin repairing the course with your golf divot repair tools, find the ball mark on the green. Ball marks can be tough to see, so be sure to have your eyes open and look in the immediate area that your ball landed. Once the ball mark is located, place the golf divot repair tool in a 45-degree angle on the outer edge of the mark. Using your hand, push the golf divot repair tool down and forward. By doing this, you are pushing the ball mark forward and centering it, reducing the size of the mark. Using the same push and forward technique, repair all sides of the mark until it is covered by grass and not noticeable. Once you are done, gently press your putter down on the ball mark to level your repairs.\n\nFixing ball marks with your golf divot repair tools does not have to be a chore, and can be relaxing after an intense play. If you do not know what you are doing with your golf divot repair tool, it is best to leave it alone. By using a tool without proper training, you can do more harm than good.\n\nIn the golfing community, it is proper to fix your ball marks before moving onto the next hole. While not a requirement, fixing a hole at the time of injury will allow for other players to enjoy the course for years to come. Improper use of a golf divot repair tool can lead to serious damage to the grass, including tearing of the roots.\n\nGolf divot repair tools come in a variety of styles, colors and sizes. You can conveniently get them with a magnetic ball maker at the top of the tool. This way you can mark your ball and repair the divot it just left. Some models come with a money clip attached to the back side. How handy is that to carry in your pocket! You'll have you money neatly organized and in your pocket for when the beverage cart comes around, plus you'll be ready to repair any damage done by your perfect chip onto the green.

{"text":"Shot proves you can raise levels by knocking the ball into the sand\n\nJust when you think you can't get enough massively multiplayer online RPGs, or that you've seen it all, Shot-Online comes out and shakes things up. Well... sort of. The objective, just like the other MMORPG's, is raising your levels. And instead of slaughtering monsters over and over and over, Shot-Online gives you a different kind of grind: putting. That's right, swinging the club and having the ball land neatly in the sand might boost up your statistics. OK, so the concept is a little silly, but this strangely works out a little - just enough for golf fans. Let me repeat: golf fans; everyone else, there are better ways to spend fifty dollars on golf.\n\nThe best thing going for this golf game is, actually, not the golf. The stuff beyond, such as creating your own team and communicating with others on tour, is where you'll dig it. The leveling-up system is, as expected, not as grand and complex as World of Warcraft or many others, but it's deep enough to spur that sense of competition and addiction. As you become someone for newcomers to freak out over, you'll be able to have more fun. The game's tutorial is also a warm welcome for people a bit confused by how the world is set up.\n\nOnce you actually play golf in this game, however, you'll find that this is merely an OK alternative for when bad weather hits, and nothing more. Playing through tours takes the dedication to sit on your butt at the computer for an ass-long time. Assuming your schedule has nothing on it and you can dedicate a full day to Shot, it's still not very competitive. Winning involves a lot of luck and, simply, higher levels; plowing through the field's handicap is often embarrassing, and probably irritating to others. The whole process of swinging and selecting your clubs is basic and becomes boring very quickly. To mix things up, there are weather effects and a few other little factors that come in to change the likelihood of who will win in the end... but it's not fun; actually, even for the most skilled golfers, it downright obnoxious"}

Anything can create a potential advantage.The word potential is used in rules design to differentiate from actual advantage. if actual advantage was part of a rule people would be on the course all day arguing about the effect of an action. However, You aren't expected to think about actual or potential advantages when applying a rule (unless the rule affirmatively says you should).

And now he only has to win 9 more PGA tournaments to be the top all time winner. He's only 36, so if this marks the beginning of a comeback then as good as tops.\n\nThe thing I want to know is: how does Tiger's ex-caddie feel about this win?\n\nRapmaster2000:The only shot I can recall that he's made that was better was at the British Open a bunch of years back when it was St. Andrews. One of the holes isn't so much uphill as you tee off, the you hit your second shot onto the green, which you can't really see because it's elevated on a plateau. Woods hit his drive into the rough, which at St. Andrews is what most people would call underbrush. No sane person would've faulted him for just hitting it 20 feet sideways onto the fairway. Woods instead, grabbed his club, and having no ability to see the green, no expectation the ball would go where he wanted given where he was hitting it from, and hit the hell out of it. The shot didn't just end up on the green, he ended up with an easy put. It was one of those moments where you could feel everyone else on the course going \"Well, that settles it, I'm going home, just give Tiger the trophy\".\n\nGreatest shot Ive ever seen him hit was the final hole at Firestone in 2000.....Tourney was rain delayed and Tiger had to be at the prime time \"Battle at the Bighorn\" in Cali the following night. He was leading by 10 shots and his playing partner agreed to keep playing into the dark to get finished. On 18, Tiger couldnt even see the pin in the dark from 180ish out, yet stuffed it to a back left pin to about a foot! The crowd was holding up lighters as he strolled up 18 after the shot. The first highlight in this clip\n\nWho would you make the favorite right now? Rory McIlroy has missed three consecutive cuts. Phil and the US Open don't exactly have a great relationship. Bubba Watson missed the cut this week and has only played in two tournaments since the Masters. Lee Westwood can't win a major.\n\nWhyteRaven74:Sure. There's no other game where you can drink all day and make bad plays while being able to blame it on the booze, or conversely make great plays and blame it on natural talent while blotto. It's a win\/win.\n\nIrishHammer:You don't watch a lot of golf, do you?\n\nOh, I think he meant well. It was kind of sort of like that at times in the early days when he was comparatively long. But yeah. Lots of guys as long or longer than tiger these days.\n\nOk, I should've clarified, I'd love to see him walk up to a long par 5 tee with a 3 wood or 2 iron. Obviously on many par 4's and pretty much every par 3 the driver is out of the equation. But a nice 500 something yard par 5, pretty much straight away, where everyone including Tiger normally grabs the driver, seeing Tiger walk up with a 3 wood or 2 iron would be hilarious.\n\nHe doesn't hit his 3 wood farther than the majority of Tour players hit a driver. There are a number of players, especially in recent years, who can either match his length with every club in the bag, or come fairly close. His distance was always impressive but it was never the only reason why he was the best player for a decade. Almost all those guys have more than enough power. That's why so many of them are fade players.\n\nWoods, at his best, had everything between his ears in good working order. He's incredibly competitve and has loads of talent but injuries have taken a real toll. I think it's pretty impressive that he's managed to win twice this year already. He may well still have a shot a the Nicklaus record but it's going to be very tough to do. Five more major titles to go starting from the age of 36. I think Nicklaus had four after that point and it took him ten years. And Nicklaus remained remarkably healthy into his 40s.\n\nI think the best shot I ever saw Tiger make was the last time he won the US Open and got injured. I think it was the third round he shot out from a nasty bunker. The ball bounced, hit the pin, and went in. Anyone who's played golf enough has seen weird shiat like that but that's just what Tiger does.\n\nJohnBigBootay:Oh, I think he meant well. It was kind of sort of like that at times in the early days when he was comparatively long. But yeah. Lots of guys as long or longer than tiger these days.\n\nAt his first tournament this year he was driving 311 yards on average. And his average for the season is down in part because of the courses he's played at. Give him a wide fairway and favorable wind and he'll still hit it a mile. He himself has said that he's changed his approach to driving to increase his accuracy, but that doesn't mean he can't still hit the ball a very long way."}

With simple, clear images and with words that wipe away decades of overly technical instruction, Harvey Penick brings out the best golfer in everyone he touches, but there is one group of pupils with whom Harvey has always had a special rapport.\n\nUnique among great golf teachers, Harvey has worked with and helped -- and learned from -- as many women champions as men. Of the thirteen women enshrined in the LPGA Hall of Fame, five worked with Harvey for a substantial period of time. But beyond these great players -- women like Mickey Wright, Sandra Palmer, Betsy Rawls, Kathy Whitworth, Judy Rankin, and Betty Jameson -- Harvey has taken as much pleasure in the accomplishments of the countless women who came to him hoping only to be able to hit the ball in the air for the very first time.\n\nIn For All Who Love the Game, Harvey shares the lessons he has learned from all the women he's watched in his seven decades of teaching the game he loves. He describes the techniques that can help women gain greater power, discusses the psychological hurdles some women must overcome to improve their game, and gives his tips for developing the parts of the game where women can and should outplay their male partners. He provides a clear image of the proper swing, gives advice on what equipment every woman should carry, and provides wisdom, inspiration, and sound instruction for anyone hoping to improve her game. With the same blend of sage advice and common sense that made his first two books such an essential part of every golfer's library, Harvey shows how every woman, whatever her other athletic gifts might be, can play great golf and enjoy it to its fullest.\n\nHarvey has often said that the day he stops learning is the day he'll quit teaching. Fortunately for us all, that day is still a long way in the future for America's best-loved teacher of the greatest game of all.\n\nDetails\n\nISBN: 9781439128732\n\nPublisher: Simon & Schuster\n\nDate: Nov 2011\n\nSeller Statement: Sold by Simon and Schuster Digital Sales Inc.\n\nCreators\n\nOther: Bud Shrake\nAuthor: Harvey Penick"}

{"text":"Pocketshots Putting Lesson\n\nPocketshots Putting Lesson\n\nVideoJug user Loto123 shows us how. Top European Coach Dennis Pugh takes us through the basic techniques.\n\nStep 1: Ways of putting:\n\nWell there seems to be no end to the number of ways in which you can go about the job of putting. How do I get the right stance? Should I have a wide stance? Should I be bent over it? Should I be tall? Should I be narrow? Should I have a short swing? Long swing? Different grips. Well all those choices fall down to two basic styles.\n\nStep 2: The first style:\n\nThe first style is to understand if you prefer to stand tall, there is this whole complement of basics that you need to fit in with that. And it starts with the putter. A toe balance putter is ideal for those that like to stand tall. And here the Mizuno Bettinardi series Co4 is the putter of choice. What happens now is I can stand up to the ball and make a flowing stroke. But not everyone likes to go with that style, and there is another option.\n\nStep 3: The second style\n\nYou can choose a face balance putter. Here the putter faces up to the sky. It's actually a Mizuno Bettinardi series Co5. And that's ideal for somebody who likes to take a different style to the ball, sets up more crouched over the ball like this, elbows a little bit more apart, more bent arms, a different type of stroke, and have a shorter back swing and a longer follow through.\n\nStep 4: Perfecting the stroke\n\nIt really doesn't matter which choice you make. Whether you are more comfortable being taller or more comfortable being over the ball. But once you've made that choice, then you have to go with the correct selection of putter and then build from that the correct fundamentals within the stroke. So that when you get over a ball you have the building blocks for the perfect stroke already set for you. You've done that on the practice green, and you've done that with your putting practice. So the style you choose and the putter you choose is the first step in the process."}

There is a fairway bunker on the left side. It's a good target to aim at, but don't get too greedy. This large undulating green is guarded in front by a large bunker; therefore, the smart play is to the center of the green. Par is a good score."}
{"text":"Blog\n\nDo you remember the children's song about how everything is connected? The neck bone's connected to the shoulder bone, the shoulder bone's connected to the chest bone, etc. Well keeping this in mind as you begin the new season of golfing as it may help you prevent injuries along the way.\n\nLet's start with the golf swing. To avoid golf injuries, it's important that golfers get their swing technique as solid as possible. Amateur players are at increased risk of injury because their swing will often put excessive stress on the shoulder, arms and the back. Since golf is played at a slower pace a warm up is essential to help prevent injuries. Think about the song at the beginning and work your way down the body.\n\nWarming up the neck. Start slowly and with purpose. Instead of the usual head circles, think about the position you put your neck in from presenting the ball to your backswing and downswing. Your head is in a neutral position. Then pull your arms into your backswing position, now look at the position of your head; it's still facing forward, however, your shoulders have rotated so your chin is now touching your shoulder. For a warm up, stand facing forward and slowly turn your head to the right, then dip your chin and try to touch your collar-bone. Now repeat the other direction. This will warm up the muscles along the sides and back of the neck.\n\nLet's move on to the shoulders. This is where a lot of injuries can occur. With the large amount of torque needed on the downswing, it's critical to warm up all the muscles in the shoulder. Start with small circles and work your way to med and then large. Make sure your hand positions change. This ensures you will hit each different muscle that makes up the rotator cuff; Thumbs up, palms down, & thumbs down. Rotate five times each set.\n\nNow the back. Just saying \"the back\" doesn't give you enough information. There are two specific areas that we want to warm up. First is the thoracic spine (upper back area). The thoracic spine starts just under your ribs and stops at your collarbone. This is also where you want the most rotation in your back swing and not in your lower back region. Taking your club and placing it on your shoulders and rotating from right to left is a good warm-up, but take care to lock your hips in place so you're not rotating in your lower back. Sit down and squeeze your knees together, then place your hands behind your head and spread your elbows out. Now sit up straight and turn to your right, as if you were looking over your shoulder, now drop your right elbow and try to touch your right elbow to your hip. You should feel a stretch on your opposite ribcage (left side). This works the thoracic spine in the two ways it works best, rotating behind you and side-to-side. Complete eight times each side.\n\nThe second area of the \"back\" is the hips. Again, we don't want to rotate through the lumbar spine. It might feel like that is what is happening, however, the hips are made to rotate and have a much better design for it. So stand tall and take your 5-iron or hold onto a pole or rail. Twist your hips in a circular motion as if you're trying to take your front hipbones and touch the pole or 5 iron. Make sure you keep the upper body as still as possible. Also, keep your feet flat on the ground to get a bit of internal and external rotation. Rotate each side eight times.\n\nOk, so you are warmed up in the areas that get the most work in your golf swing. As you move your static warm up to a more dynamic warm up, a slow start as you hit balls will get you fully warmed up and help keep you from injury. The more conditioned you are for your golf swing is the best way to keep yourself injury free!\n\nDiana Del Garbino is a certified golf fitness instructor through the Titelist Performance Institute and coaches beginner through advanced golfers at Muscles in Motion-Professional training studio in Lake Oswego Oregon.

{"text":"The reason for those three-putts isn't the break on a putt, but the speed, says Bob Vermeer, head pro at Oak Hills Country Club in Omaha.\n\nHe said most golfers don't develop a good enough feel for a putt's speed, which often leaves lengthy second putts. He said picturing what the ball will do once it gets close to the hole is a good way to ensure a manageable second putt.\n\n\"A lot of putts are probably made or missed before you stroke it,\" Vermeer said. \"You have to be observant, it helps you with your putt.\"\n\nAnother overlooked factor that helps avoid three-putts is hitting good lag putts. When standing over a 40-foot, double-breaking putt, players should focus on leaving the putt inside a three-foot circle around the hole.\n\nTo practice lag putting, Vermeer suggests using golf tees to form a 3- or 4-foot circle around a hole on the putting green, then lagging putts into the circle from a variety of distances. The drill will help develop a feel for speed, while also working on an overlooked aspect of many golfers' games.\n\n\"Most people don't spend that much time on that aspect that can help you the most,\" Vermeer said. \"If you want your handicap to come down, you should spend half your time with lag putting.\""}

{"text":"Harvey Penick's Little Red Book - Lessons And Teachings From A Lifetime In Golf\n\nSynopsis\n\nHarvey Penick's life in golf began when he started caddying at the Austin, (Texas), Country Club at age eight. Eighty-one years later he is still there, still dispensing wisdom to pros and beginners alike. His stature in the golf world is reflected in the remarkable array of champions he's worked with, both men and women, including U.S. Open champion and golf's leading money winner Tom Kite, Masters champion Ben Crenshaw, and LPGA Hall of Famers Mickey Wright, Betsy Rawls, and Kathy Whitworth. It is not for nothing that the Teacher of the Year Award given by the Golf Teachers Association is called the Harvey Penick Award.\n\nNow, after sixty years of keeping notes on the things he's seen and learned and on the golfing greats he's taught, Penick is finally letting his Little Red Book (named for the red notebook he's always kept) be seen by the golf world. His simple, direct, practical wisdom pares away all the hypertechnical jargon that's grown up around the golf swing, and lets all golfers, whatever their level, play their best. He avoids negative words; when Tom Kite asked him if he should \"choke down\" on the club for a particular shot, Harvey told him to \"grip down\" instead, to keep the word \"choke\" from entering his mind. He advises golfers to have dinner with people who are good putters; their confidence may rub off, and it's certainly better than listening to bad putters complain. And he shows why, if you've got a bad grip, the last thing you want is a good swing.\n\nThroughout, Penick's love of golf and, more importantly, his love of teaching shine through. He gets as much pleasure from watching a beginner get the ball in the air for the first time as he does when one of his students wins the U.S. Open.\n\nHarvey Penick's Little Red Book is an instant classic, a book to rank with Ben Hogan's Modern Fundamentals of Golf and Tommy Armour's How to Play Your Best Golf All the Time"}

{"text":"Free Golf Lessons\n\nOur Six Best Tips for Hitting from the Rough and Other Tough LiesI don't care how good a golfer you are--at some point you'll be stuck in a bad lie. It happens to all of us! Getting the ball out of the rough can be quite a challenge--especially if you don't have a strategy. Here are some tips to help bail you out of a bad situation, and just maybe have some fun doing it!\n\n1. Stand Closer at Address\n\nStanding slightly closer to the ball will create a more upright swing plane, which means the club will encounter less grass on the downswing.\n\n2. Open the Clubface\n\nOpening the clubface (clockwise at address) helps in two ways: First, it gives the shot more loft, which helps it get airborne. Second, the rough often grabs the clubface and pulls it left, so opening it helps keep the shot on line.\n\n3. Move Your Stance Forward\n\nWhen using the short irons, moving forward over the ball will promote a steeper swing and help \"punch\" the ball out without catching too much grass.\n\n4. Adjust Your Distance\n\nRough tends to take backspin off the ball and create a\n\"flier\" that goes farther and takes longer to stop. Adjust your target to allow for the\nadded roll.\n\n5. Use a Steeper Approach\n\nOn the downswing you should feel as though you are\nhitting \"down and through\" with a sharper swing. Don't be afraid to move some\ngrass and take a divot. This is one time to be aggressive!\n\n6. Adjust Your Grip\n\nI normally recommend light grip pressure. However, when\nhitting in the rough, the left hand should be slightly tighter so the club doesn't turn\nover when it hits the grass and pull the shot to the left.\n\n3. Make it Happen in the Mind's Eye\n\nTension can ruin your sand shot faster\nthan anything else. When tension occurs, the swing is inhibited and so is the\nchance for a good shot. Try to visualize a good shot. Stay muscularly light and\nmentally positive. Gary Player, one of the worlds' best bu nker players, once said,\n\"If I am one of the greats, it's for one simple reason: no bunker shot has ever\nscared me and none ever will. Approach every bunker shot with the feeling you are\ngoing to hole it.\""}

The Lab does research on various topics arising from turbulent flows, including new measurement techniques and computer simulations. In everyday life, turbulence is encountered and utilized in water, air, and many other fluid flows. The turbulent motion of fluid is complicated, and at first sight, it appears very unpredictable. Nevertheless, the theory of turbulence is well-established, and in engineering, researchers have a lot of knowledge about turbulence in heating, cooling, and the mixing processes. Simulations using high-speed computers are also utilized to design a variety of flow systems. Q. Recently, many efforts have been made to control turbulent flows. An example known for a long time is the dimples on the surface of a golf ball. This is one classic method for controlling flow. But there are many other situations, where turbulence greatly increases friction resistance in fluid flow. When friction resistance increases, energy efficiency decreases, but on the other hand, turbulent fluid motion is beneficial in heat exchanger, mass transport, and mixing processes. So we thought wed like to control turbulence, in order to reduce resistance while maintaining the aspects of turbulence that are beneficial for mixing.

{"text":"Lodging\n\nTickets & Passes\n\nStowe Country Club Memberships\n\nDon't Miss Out!\n\nGolf Tips\n\nLearning how to Read Greens\n\nReading the greens is certainly more of an art form than a science. Here are some of the basic ideas that you can use. 1) You are responsible for hitting the ball forward\/straight. The ground will make it break\/curve. 2) Look at the overall green. If you poured water on the green which way would it flow? 3)\nIf instead of a putter you had to putt using a small ramp, where would\nyou aim the ramp? This is the line you should aim the putter on and\nthe direction that you should putt the ball. 4) When reading the break you must include the speed as part of your read. 5) Speed is more critical then direction. Use these basic ideas to improve your green reading.\n\nGreenside Bunker Play\n\nBunker play can be any player's worst nightmare, if they allow it\nto be. The first thing when approaching a bunker shot is to not be\nafraid of the bunker, or else you will surely be taking more then one\nattempt to get your ball out. It is important to establish good\nfooting before you attempt your shot. Get your feet comfortable in the\nsand before you hit your shot. After you have your feet set you should\ntake an open stance towards your target, and take a few practice swings,\nmaking sure not to hit the sand. Before you hit, pick out a spot about\ntwo inches behind the ball, this is where you want to hit when\nexecuting the shot. Most importantly be sure to accelerate through the\nball and not stop your swing when it hits the sand. Use these few steps\nand in no time you will no longer fear the bunker.\n\nEliminate your over the Top\n\nEliminating an over the top move is as easy as setting up three\ntees; you just need to know how to set them up. The first tee is placed\non the target line and represents where the ball would be. The second\ntee is placed three club heads behind the ball and on the target line.\nThe third tee is placed 2-3 inches inside the second tee. To use the\ntees set up to the first tee. As you start the club back swing the head\nof your club outside the second (i.e. go around the second tee on the\noutside). On your downswing, swing the club head inside the third tee.\nBe sure and clip the first tee each time. When you get a feel for it\nbegin placing a ball on the first tee. It shouldn't take long and\nyou'll be rid of your over the top move.\n\nChoosing a Putter\n\nThere are several factors in choosing a new putter. The first\ncritical choice is whether to choose a face balanced putter. Players\nwho are either trying to swing the putter straight back, straight\nthrough or who are trying to straighten out a crooked path should choose\na face-balanced putter. To test a putter to see if it is face-balance\nyou simply need to balance the putter on one finger and see if the\nface points to the sky or if the toe of the putter hangs down towards\nthe ground. If an inside to square to inside stroke is preferred then\nlook for a putter that hangs toe down.\n\nLearning to use bounce\n\nLooking at the sole of the club you will see that it has a dig edge and\na bounce edge. The back edge is the bounce edge and you should learn\nto use it to your advantage. Next time you're practicing chipping, drop a\nfew balls 5-10 yards short of the green. Take a 6 iron and open the\nface (add loft). Practice hitting high 6 iron chips to different areas\nof the green. Remember high for a 6 iron is much lower than high with\na pitching wedge. Hitting these shots should give you a great feel\nfor using the bounce and another effective shot to play.\n\nThis shot is difficult because there is so much room for error.\nHowever, if you follow these basics you will start to see more success.\nFirst, when addressing the shot dig your feet into the sand to give\nyourself a good, firm foundation playing the ball just back of center\nin your stance. Second, to compensate for digging in, choke down on the\nclub about an inch. Taking an aggressive downward approach to the\nball think about looking at the front of the ball. This will allow you\nto hit the back of the ball before hitting the sand. That is the key to\nthe fairway bunker shot, HITTING BALL FIRST AND SAND SECOND. Try these\nfew easy steps and see more success out on the course.\n\nLoft is the Key\n\nOnce you have driven the ball right down the middle of the fairway\nthink about making that second shot better. A lot of us will use a club\nwith so little loft such as a 3 iron or a 3 wood. These clubs are\nreally hard to hit because they have very little loft. Think about\nmaking that second shot with a 5 or 7 wood, a 5 or 6 iron, or what we\nrecommend most is looking into getting yourself a hybrid club. Hybrid\nclubs are easier to get up in the air and still get good distance. So\ndon't make it harder on yourself hitting clubs that have a low success\nrate. Hit something with more loft to see more success.\n\nThe Need for Speed\n\nThere is one thing in the short game that will always produce failure.\nThat is deceleration. In every short game shot we must accelerate\nthrough the ball and let the loft of the club work for us. To visualize\nacceleration take a few practice swings right next to the ball and get\nsome grass clippings to fly up. We don't just want to brush the grass\nwe want to break it right at ground level. This proves that our club is\nhitting low enough to let the club do its job. Now, using that same\naggressive stroke hit the ball and watch the high soft flight land\nlightly next to the hole.\n\nMaking the most of your Practice Stroke\n\nThe most common mistake players make with their practice stroke is\nlooking at the ground more than they look at the distance\nbetween themselves and the hole. The purpose of your practice strokes\nis to learn the distance between yourself and the hole. To do this, you\nneed to be looking at it. So, next time you work on your putting,\nimprove your pre-shot routine by taking at least two practice strokes\ngazing back and forth between yourself and the hole."}
{"text":"At age 12, Virginia Van Wie received an order from her doctor that many of us would long to hear from our physician, spouse or boss: Play more golf.\n\nVan Wie was frail and often ill during her childhood in Chicago. Her parents kept her out of school, deciding it best to tutor her privately. After suffering a back injury, Van Wie took up golf at a doctor's urging to get more exercise and fresh air.\n\nThanks to that recommendation, Van Wie went on to develop into one of the greatest amateur players of the interwar period. In a seven-year stretch from 1928 to 1934, Van Wie made the semifinals of the U.S. Women's Amateur six times, finishing runner-up twice before winning three consecutive titles in 1932, 1933 and 1934. She is one of only five players to accomplish the feat. Much like Bob Jones, her male amateur counterpart, Van Wie retired from competitive golf on top, walking away from the game following her victory in 1934 at age 25.\n\nThroughout the years of the Great Depression, the number of men playing golf declined dramatically, but women took up the game at an unprecedented rate. Each year between 1930 and 1936, the population of women golfers increased some 20 percent. As the editors of Golfdom wrote in May 1934, \"The army of women golfers is fast outnumbering the male addicts to the game.\" Van Wie, Glenna Collett Vare and Patty Berg dominated the amateur ranks and inspired a new generation of women to take up the game.\n\nVan Wie learned the game from her cousin \u2013 a member of the University of Michigan golf team and a state champion. The two often played together growing up, frequently using methods that Van Wie carried over to her competitive career: \"Some days we'd just take one club and a putter for the fun of it. That way you learned to play different shots.\" Throughout her career, Van Wie never carried a club more lofted than a 9-iron, a testament to her ability to craft shots from inside 100 yards.\n\nStarting in the mid-1920s, Van Wie, known as \"Gino\" to her golfing brethren, spent her winters in Florida and became a regular on the competitive golf circuit, winning two Palm Beach Championships and four South Atlantic titles.\n\nIn her early tournaments, however, Van Wie was unfamiliar with the complete Rules of Golf. She told a story from one of her first encounters on the competitive circuit in a 1991 oral history.\n\n\"We got to the 18th green in the qualifying round and I had hit two putts. [They] didn't go in, so I knocked [the ball] away. The girl I was playing with told me I couldn't do that. It took me two more putts to get it in the hole to qualify. I found out later I would have been medalist had I not done that. When you five-putt the last green, it can be rather disastrous.\"\n\nVan Wie had bowed out of the U.S. Women's Amateur in the first round in 1925 and 1926, but a growing confidence in her swing \u2013 described as \"perfection\" by renowned British golf writer Bernard Darwin \u2013 helped her advance to the final of the 1928 championship. The 36-hole match was a disaster, however, as six-time Women's Amateur champion Glenna Collett annihilated her, 13 and 12, the largest margin of victory in a USGA championship match to that point, and a record that stood until 1961.\n\nTwo years later, the pair met again in the Women's Amateur final, with Collett prevailing for the second straight time. Van Wie later said, tongue-in-cheek, \"I only lost by 6 and 5, so that was rather encouraging.\"\n\nIn 1932, the two rivals squared off for the third time in the championship match of the Women's Amateur, with Van Wie jumping to an 8-up advantage after the morning round. A bystander said, \"You must feel pretty safe with that lead.\" But Van Wie was still worried, replying that if she had won eight holes in the morning, Collett could certainly win eight or more in the afternoon.\n\nThis time, however, Van Wie finally exacted revenge on her rival, beating Collett soundly. The 10-and-8 victory gave Van Wie the national championship that she had tirelessly pursued.\n\nThe following year, Van Wie defeated close friend Helen Hicks in the final to capture her second straight championship. Van Wie and Hicks were often roommates while on the road, with the 1933 Women's Amateur being no exception.\n\n\"It's a weird, peculiar feeling when you finally get there,\" Van Wie said. \"You're pulling for each other and then all of a sudden you're going to play against each other.\" After Van Wie triumphed, 4 and 3, the two went out for dinner and a night of dancing despite having played over eight hours of championship caliber golf.\n\nBy the following spring, however, Van Wie was starting to lose some of her competitive fire. When asked in April 1934 how it felt to be a two-time national champion, she gave a surprising answer.\n\n\"Elegant one moment and a bit disappointed the next,\" Van Wie told Harry Evans in an interview for The Family Circle. \"Winning the title gave me a tremendous kick because I worked so hard for it, but somehow the whole thing has been a little disappointing. I can't exactly express it. The worst part of it is that I am definitely not as keen about golf now as I used to be.\"\n\nDespite her misgivings about continuing her career, Van Wie played well during the 1934 season and six months later outlasted 19-year-old Dorothy Traung, 2 and 1, for her third consecutive Women's Amateur title.\n\nUnlike many of her contemporaries \u2013 including Hicks, who was the first woman to turn professional \u2013 Van Wie never gave up her amateur status. She turned down a contract offer from Wilson's Sporting Goods, citing that she was \"burnt out\" from competitive golf.\n\nReflecting back on her career and subsequent retirement after the 1934 Women's Amateur, Van Wie said, \"I was worn out after that. I had lost about 15 pounds playing in the national championship. I figured I had proven I could do it and that's all I wanted to do.\"\n\nFierce rivals, but also close friends, the mutual admiration between Virginia Van Wie and Glenna Collett was evident. The pair squared off an incredible five times in either the semifinals or finals of the Women's Amateur between 1928 and 1934, with Collett winning three of the matches. Both also worked with the same swing coach, Ernest Jones.\n\nCollett called Van Wie one of her toughest opponents in her book, Ladies in the Rough, and ranked her as one of the longest hitters of the era. \"Trying to imagine her as a frail young girl strains the imagination.\"\n\nVan Wie called Collett \"the greatest\" player of her generation and lauded her outstanding sportsmanship. \"She didn't give you the feeling she was out there to annihilate you at all. In fact, I think she made anyone more comfortable that played with her.\"\n\nWhile Van Wie feared picking up bad habits from watching other players swing, she said, \"[Collett] was the one person I could watch and it didn't interfere with my game [because] she had such a smooth swing.\"\n\n\"There was only one Glenna Collett,\" Van Wie said in a 1991 interview. \"To me, she had all of the shots. What else is there?\"\n\nIn 1935, the year after Van Wie retired from competitive golf, Collett, 32, won her sixth and final U.S. Women's Amateur.\n\nTo learn more about Virginia Van Wie and women golfers of the early 20th century, visit the USGA Museum in Far Hills, N.J. Several of Van Wie's artifacts are on display, including photographs from the earliest Curtis Cup Matches and her \"special niblick,\" manufactured by Hendry & Bishop, that she used to win three consecutive Women's Amateur titles.\n\nMichael Trostel is the curator\/historian for the USGA Museum.

{"text":"Let's talk about the art of putting. As you all know this is what can save your game or ruin it. Sometimes the hole is as big as a man hole, and others times the ball will not fit. We have all experienced this. All you can do, as a golfer, is give the ball a chance to go in. DON'T LEAVE IT SHORT. Now we have all heard this many times, but understand, what is short? Ideally the ball should still be rolling as it falls in the hole. NOW REMEMBER THIS; the ball breaks mostly while losing speed. So what is short? If the hole was a spot on the green, the ball should roll over the spot and 1 to 2 feet past. Many golfers read the line for this speed, but end up short of the mark. This leaves the ball below the hole on a breaking putt, and will wiggle off line on a straight putt. There is the \"Pro Side\" or the \"Low Side\" of the hole. If you put the ball on the \"pro side\" Your ball has a better chance of going in.\n\nThe only thing you need to do to be a good putter, is to never \"3 putt.\" HA! Easier said than done, right! Well here is a great way to accomplish this goal. Always practice putting! Practice putts you can make a high percentage of times. This means to practice putting from 10 feet and in. If you get good at this distance, it will help to never 3 putt. It will make long putts easier, and helps ease the pressure of chipping so close.\n\nRemember that we play a percentage game and the more we give the ball a chance, the more putts will drop. This is a fantastic way to lower your scores.\n\nTo learn more and find out why my clients keep improving at golf; come see me."}

Putting, chipping and short game drills and pga tips.\n\nTuesday, 16 March 2010\n\nDrill to Stop an Over the Top Swing\n\nWhen a golfer slices a shot the shoulders spin open too much on the downswing which causes the club to attack the ball from the outside. When the shoulders spin open a chain reaction is set in motion that affects the rest of the body, in particular the hips and legs. The momentum of the shoulders opening pulls the right hip out which in turn pulls the right leg out which makes the golfer finish in the classic position of someone who habitually slices the ball. Right Leg Drill to Stop Over the Top Golf Swing\n\nIf a golfer has already tried to cure their slice by working on the correct shoulder move on the downswing, but they are still slicing, try this drill to help bring the club down on the inside for a draw.\n\nTake up your normal stance but before hitting the ball drag the right foot back about twelve inches. It will look as though the feet are aiming miles right but the shoulders should still be aiming at the target - now start to hit a few shots.\n\nThe drill works by anchoring the right foot which makes it virtually impossible for the leg to be pulled out and round. This in turn disciplines the right hip to stay back, which in turn stops the shoulders from spinning open.\n\nIt might take a few hits before the hands realise they must release the club, but after a few short practice sessions, the shoulders will stop spinning open and the downswing will start to attack the ball from the inside."}

{"text":"Lodging\n\nTickets & Passes\n\nStowe Country Club Memberships\n\nDon't Miss Out!\n\nGolf Tips\n\nLearning how to Read Greens\n\nReading the greens is certainly more of an art form than a science. Here are some of the basic ideas that you can use. 1) You are responsible for hitting the ball forward\/straight. The ground will make it break\/curve. 2) Look at the overall green. If you poured water on the green which way would it flow? 3)\nIf instead of a putter you had to putt using a small ramp, where would\nyou aim the ramp? This is the line you should aim the putter on and\nthe direction that you should putt the ball. 4) When reading the break you must include the speed as part of your read. 5) Speed is more critical then direction. Use these basic ideas to improve your green reading.\n\nGreenside Bunker Play\n\nBunker play can be any player's worst nightmare, if they allow it\nto be. The first thing when approaching a bunker shot is to not be\nafraid of the bunker, or else you will surely be taking more then one\nattempt to get your ball out. It is important to establish good\nfooting before you attempt your shot. Get your feet comfortable in the\nsand before you hit your shot. After you have your feet set you should\ntake an open stance towards your target, and take a few practice swings,\nmaking sure not to hit the sand. Before you hit, pick out a spot about\ntwo inches behind the ball, this is where you want to hit when\nexecuting the shot. Most importantly be sure to accelerate through the\nball and not stop your swing when it hits the sand. Use these few steps\nand in no time you will no longer fear the bunker.\n\nEliminate your over the Top\n\nEliminating an over the top move is as easy as setting up three\ntees; you just need to know how to set them up. The first tee is placed\non the target line and represents where the ball would be. The second\ntee is placed three club heads behind the ball and on the target line.\nThe third tee is placed 2-3 inches inside the second tee. To use the\ntees set up to the first tee. As you start the club back swing the head\nof your club outside the second (i.e. go around the second tee on the\noutside). On your downswing, swing the club head inside the third tee.\nBe sure and clip the first tee each time. When you get a feel for it\nbegin placing a ball on the first tee. It shouldn't take long and\nyou'll be rid of your over the top move.\n\nChoosing a Putter\n\nThere are several factors in choosing a new putter. The first\ncritical choice is whether to choose a face balanced putter. Players\nwho are either trying to swing the putter straight back, straight\nthrough or who are trying to straighten out a crooked path should choose\na face-balanced putter. To test a putter to see if it is face-balance\nyou simply need to balance the putter on one finger and see if the\nface points to the sky or if the toe of the putter hangs down towards\nthe ground. If an inside to square to inside stroke is preferred then\nlook for a putter that hangs toe down.\n\nLearning to use bounce\n\nLooking at the sole of the club you will see that it has a dig edge and\na bounce edge. The back edge is the bounce edge and you should learn\nto use it to your advantage. Next time you're practicing chipping, drop a\nfew balls 5-10 yards short of the green. Take a 6 iron and open the\nface (add loft). Practice hitting high 6 iron chips to different areas\nof the green. Remember high for a 6 iron is much lower than high with\na pitching wedge. Hitting these shots should give you a great feel\nfor using the bounce and another effective shot to play.\n\nThis shot is difficult because there is so much room for error.\nHowever, if you follow these basics you will start to see more success.\nFirst, when addressing the shot dig your feet into the sand to give\nyourself a good, firm foundation playing the ball just back of center\nin your stance. Second, to compensate for digging in, choke down on the\nclub about an inch. Taking an aggressive downward approach to the\nball think about looking at the front of the ball. This will allow you\nto hit the back of the ball before hitting the sand. That is the key to\nthe fairway bunker shot, HITTING BALL FIRST AND SAND SECOND. Try these\nfew easy steps and see more success out on the course.\n\nLoft is the Key\n\nOnce you have driven the ball right down the middle of the fairway\nthink about making that second shot better. A lot of us will use a club\nwith so little loft such as a 3 iron or a 3 wood. These clubs are\nreally hard to hit because they have very little loft. Think about\nmaking that second shot with a 5 or 7 wood, a 5 or 6 iron, or what we\nrecommend most is looking into getting yourself a hybrid club. Hybrid\nclubs are easier to get up in the air and still get good distance. So\ndon't make it harder on yourself hitting clubs that have a low success\nrate. Hit something with more loft to see more success.\n\nThe Need for Speed\n\nThere is one thing in the short game that will always produce failure.\nThat is deceleration. In every short game shot we must accelerate\nthrough the ball and let the loft of the club work for us. To visualize\nacceleration take a few practice swings right next to the ball and get\nsome grass clippings to fly up. We don't just want to brush the grass\nwe want to break it right at ground level. This proves that our club is\nhitting low enough to let the club do its job. Now, using that same\naggressive stroke hit the ball and watch the high soft flight land\nlightly next to the hole.\n\nMaking the most of your Practice Stroke\n\nThe most common mistake players make with their practice stroke is\nlooking at the ground more than they look at the distance\nbetween themselves and the hole. The purpose of your practice strokes\nis to learn the distance between yourself and the hole. To do this, you\nneed to be looking at it. So, next time you work on your putting,\nimprove your pre-shot routine by taking at least two practice strokes\ngazing back and forth between yourself and the hole."}

{"text":"News and Blogs\n\nIJGT Rules Blog\n\nAt every IJGT Tournament, players encounter situations where they are unsure of how to proceed under the Rules of Golf. In this blog series, we will be highlighting a scenario from one of our prior tournaments. Real, on-course examples allow us to better understand the complicated set of guidelines we call rules. Contrary to popular belief, the Rules of Golf are there for the player's benefit.\n\nLast weekend during our tournament at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., the players encountered many water hazards at the home of the PGA TOUR. In order to take the proper relief you first need to know which type of water hazard your ball entered which are discussed under Rule 26. The two types of water hazards are:\n\nWater Hazard (Yellow Stakes and Lines)\n\nLateral Water Hazard (Red Stakes and Lines)\n\nIf you would like to take relief under a one-stroke penalty in a lateral water hazard, there are four options.\n\n1) Play a ball as nearly as possible at the spot from which the original ball was last played.\n\n2) Drop a ball behind the lateral water hazard keeping the point at which the original ball last crossed the margin of the lateral water hazard directly between the hole and the spot on which the ball is dropped, with no limit to how far behind the lateral water hazard the ball may be dropped.\n\nAll four options are not always applicable to every lateral water hazard. Option 4 is very rare, but we did see it last weekend on hole No. 4 at the Stadium Course at TPC Sawgrass. The lateral water hazard ran down the right side of the hole. Player A hit his\/her drive and it last crossed the margin of the lateral water hazard on the right side. By choosing Option 4, Player A avoided dropping on a severe downhill lie because the left side of the lateral water hazard was relatively flat. The only tricky part with Option 4 is making sure that the point you are taking relief from is equidistant from the hole with the point where your ball last crossed the margin of the lateral water hazard.\n\nQuiz of the Week:\n\nFor a water hazard (Yellow) you are only allowed two of the options listed above. Which two are NOT allowed? Email your responses to Kyle Wolfe (kylew@ijgt.com). Every correct answer will be entered into a drawing to receive a dozen Bridgestone golf balls!\n\nANSWER:"}

Also known as frog-hair, or fringe.\n\nArtisan\n\nA class of membership of a golf club with restricted rights at a low cost. Historically, many British golf clubs had small artisan sections, drawn from the working classes. Typically artisan members had limited playing rights, could not enter the clubhouse, had no vote on the management of the club, played in separate competitions from the main membership and had to perform unpaid maintenance of the course. Often an artisan club was a separate organization that had negotiated use of a course with a private members club.

In the United Kingdom, it is also known as \"borrow\".\n\nBullarding\n\nPlaying consistently above your regular handicap or regularly failing to achieve in competition play. It is the opposite of sandbagging.\n\nBump and run\n\nA low-trajectory shot that is intended to get the ball rolling along the fairway and up onto the green. Similar to a chip shot, but played from a greater distance.\n\nA short game played over the remaining holes when the main match finishes early because one player or team has won by a large margin. It serves the joint purpose of adding some competitive meaning to the rest of the holes and also for the losing side to attempt to regain some of the pride lost as a result of their humiliation in the main match. It is usual for the loser of the bye to buy the first drinks in the 19th hole afterwards. In this respect it is an almost direct equivalent to a beer match in cricket.\n\nA person, often paid, who carries a player's clubs and offers advice. Players are responsible for the actions of their caddies. Players cannot receive advice from anyone other than their caddy or partner.\n\nA wager, typically in support of one team to win a tournament.

Percentage of fairways hit is one of many statistics kept by the PGA Tour.\n\nFairway markers\n\nFairway markers indicate the distance from the marker to the center of the green. Some fairway markers give the yardage. Most are color-coded as follows: yellow=250 yards, blue=200 yards, white=150 yards, red=100 yards. These colors are not standardized and may vary based on the specific course layout.\n\nFat\n\nA stroke in which the club makes contact with the turf long before the ball, resulting in a poor contact and significant loss of distance.\n\nFlag-stick\n\nA tall marker, often a metal pole with a flag at the top, used to indicate the position of the hole on a green. Also called the \"pin\". An additional smaller flag, or other marker, is sometimes positioned on the flag-stick to indicate the location of the hole (front, middle, or back) on the green.\n\nFlier\n\nA type of lie where the ball is in the rough and grass is likely to become trapped between the ball and the club-face at the moment of impact. Flier lies often result in \"flier shots\", which have little or no spin (due to the blades of grass blocking the grooves on the club-face) and travel much farther than intended.\n\nA short shot, played with an open stance and an open club-face, designed to travel very high in the air and land softly on the green. The flop shot is useful when players do not have \"much green to work with\", but should only be attempted on the best of lies.\n\nA warning shout given when there is a chance that the ball may hit other players or spectators.\n\nFore caddy\n\nOne employed by a golfer or group of golfers to walk ahead of the players in order to spot the fall of their shots and to find their balls.

Today in professional tournaments, ball spotters are normally placed at each hole for the same purpose.\n\nIn matchplay, a contest between two sides, each consisting of a pair of players, where every individual plays his own ball throughout. On every hole, the lower of the two partner's scores is matched against the lower of the opposition's scores. (Four-balls are the afternoon matches played on the Friday and Saturday of the Ryder Cup) In stroke-play, a four-ball competition is played between several teams each consisting of 2 players, where for every hole the lower of the two partner's scores counts toward the team's 18 hole total. The term four-ball is an informal reference to any group of 4 players on the course.\n\nIn matchplay, a contest between two sides each consisting of a pair of players, where the 2 partners hit alternate shots on one ball. The first player tees off, the second player hits the second shot, the first player hits the third shot, and so on until the ball is holed. Also partners alternate their tee shots, so that one member of each team will always tee-off on the odd holes and the other will tee off on the even holes. (Foursomes are the opening matches played on the Friday and Saturday mornings of the Ryder Cup.). In stroke-play, a foursome competition is played between several teams each consisting of a pair of players, where partners play alternate shots until the SINGLE ball is holed. The term foursome is a common reference to any group of 4 players on the course.\n\nFringe\n\nThe closely mowed area surrounding the green. The grass in between the green and the fairway.\n\nVarious informal achievements, both positive and negative; these differ from traditional achievements like birdies or eagles in that the achievements are for unusual things that may happen in the course of a game. Their main use is to add interest to informal matchplay games as they enable players to win something regardless of the overall outcome of the match. They are frequently associated with gambling because money, usually small stakes, changes hands depending on which funnies occur.\n\nRefers to a putt that the other players agree can count automatically without actually being played (under the tacit assumption that the putt would not have been missed). \"Gimmes\" are not allowed by the rules in stroke play, but they are often practiced in casual matches. However, in match play, either player may formally concede a stroke, a hole, or the entire match at any time, and this may not be refused or withdrawn. A player in match play will generally concede a tap-in or other short putt by his or her opponent.\n\nGoldie Bounce\n\nWhen the ball strikes a tree deep in the rough and bounces out onto the fairway.\n\nGolf club\n\n(i) An implement used by a player to hit a golf ball.

(iii) The entirety of a golf facility, including course, club-house, pro-shop, practice areas etc.\n\nGrain\n\nThe direction in which the grass grows, specifically on the green (see below). Depending on the variety of grass used on the green and mowing patterns, grain can significantly influence the speed and movement of a putt.\n\nWinning all the golf's major championships in the same calendar year. Before The Masters was founded, the national amateur championships of the U.S and the UK were considered majors along with the two national opens and only Bobby Jones has ever completed a grand slam with these. No man has ever achieved a modern grand slam, Tiger Woods being the closest in winning all four consecutively, but over two calendar years. A \"Career Grand Slam\" is having won each of the majors at least once, not necessarily in the same year.\n\nIs a variation of foursomes, where each side consists of 2 players. Both players play one tee-shot each from every tee. A choice is then made as to which is the more favorable of the 2 ball positions, the other ball being picked up. Thereafter the players play alternate shots. So if A's tee-shot is selected, the playing order from the tee will be A-B-A-B etc until the ball is holed out. If player B's tee-shot is selected, the playing order will be B-A-B-A etc. The team with the lowest score wins the hole.\n\nGreen in regulation (GIR)\n\nA green is considered hit \"in regulation\" if any part of the ball is touching the putting surface and the number of strokes taken is at least two fewer than par (i.e., by the first stroke on a par 3, the second stroke on a par 4, or the third stroke on a par 5). Greens in regulation percentage is one of many statistics kept by the PGA Tour.\n\nGrounding the club\n\nTo place the club-face behind the ball on the ground at address. Grounding the club is prohibited in bunkers or when playing from any marked hazard.\n\nGround under repair (GUR)\n\nAn area of the golf course that is being repaired.

In some team events, such as the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup (except for singles matches in the latter competition while its overall outcome remains in doubt), a match that is tied after 18 holes is not continued, and is called \"halved\", with each team receiving half a point.\n\nA number assigned to each player based on his ability and used to adjust each player's score to provide equality among the players. In simplified terms, a handicap number, based on the slope of a course, is subtracted from the player's gross score and gives him a net score of par or better half the time.\n\nHalfway house or Halfway hut\n\nA building, generally between the 9th and 10th holes, providing light snacks and refreshments for golfers during their round.\n\nHandsy\n\nA player with too much wrist movement in their golf swing or putting stroke, causing inconsistent shots or putts.\n\nHard-pan\n\nHard, usually bare, ground conditions. Generally, hard-pan refers to hard, dry clay, with very little or no grass.\n\nMany tournaments offer large prizes if a player shoots a hole in one on a particular hole. Indemnity insurance is often purchased to cover the cost should anyone make the hole in one. Hole in one insurance is also available for individuals to cover the cost of a round of drinks in the event of them achieving a hole in one.[1]\n\nA shot that initially takes a trajectory opposite the side of the golf ball from which the player swings but eventually curves sharply back towards the player. Under normal circumstances, a hook is unintentional; however, good players can use a hook to their advantage in certain situations. Hooks are often called the \"better player's miss\", thanks to the fact that many of the game's greatest players (Ben Hogan, for instance) have been plagued by the hook at one time or another in their careers. A shot that follows the same trajectory but to a lesser degree is referred to as a 'draw'. A draw is often intentionally used by above-average players to achieve a certain type of spin. The curved shape ball-flight is the result of sideways spin. For that reason a \"hook\" does not refer to a putt.\n\nHosel\n\nThe Hollow part of the club-head where the shaft is attached. Hitting the ball off the hosel is known as a shank.\n\nAn addition to the rules of golf applying to abnormal conditions that may be found on a particular golf course.[2]\n\nLoft\n\nThe angle between the club's shaft and the club's face.\n\nLoose impediment\n\nA small natural item which is not fixed or growing, solidly embedded, or stuck to the ball, such as a small stone or leaf.

The cut line on the PGA Tour is generally top 70 plus ties.\n\nMainstream\n\nA term sometimes used by golf media to contrast the primary golf tour, or set of major championships, in a country or region, with senior professional golf.\n\n(i) A small metal or plastic disk used to mark the position of a ball on the green if it has been lifted for cleaning etc (ii) one who is appointed by the Committee to record a competitor's score in stroke play. They may be a fellow-competitor.\n\nA form of golf play where players or teams compete against each other on a hole-by-hole basis. The total number of strokes does not determine the winner. Instead, the number of holes won determines the winner. It is possible to win in match-play with more strokes than your opponent.\n\nMedal play\n\nStyle of scoring in which the player with the fewest strokes wins. Most professional tournaments are medal play. Also known as \"stroke play\".\n\nMember's bounce\n\nAny favorable bounce of the golf ball that improves what initially appeared to be an errant shot.\n\nMid-amateur\n\nTerm used mainly in the U.S. to describe a competitive \"career amateur\" golfer who has no aspirations of a career on a professional tour.

Under normal rules of golf one is only allowed to clean a ball in play when it is on the putting green. During exceptional conditions this rule may be waived by a local rule (see Preferred lies).\n\nA do-over, or replay of the shot, without counting the shot as a stroke and without assessing any penalties that might apply. It is not allowed by the rules and not practiced in tournaments, but is common in casual rounds in some countries, especially the United States.\n\nWhen (in relation to the target line) the club-face is angled away from the player's body, ie angled right for right-handed players.\n\nOpen stance\n\nWhen a player's front foot is drawn backwards further from the target line. Used to fade the ball or to prevent a hook.\n\nOstrich\n\nThe single hole score of -5, or five under par. The only way this can occur is with a hole-in-one on a par 6, or two on a par 7. This score has never been achieved and it is unlikely that it ever will considering the dramatic length and rarity of holes over par 5. See Par (score).\n\nOutside agent\n\nIs any agent not part of the match or, in stroke play, not part of the competitor's side. Referees, markers, observers, and fore-caddies are outside agents. Wind and water are not outside agents.\n\nOutward nine\n\nRefers to the first nine holes, so named as links golf courses were set up where the first nine holes went \"out\" away from the clubhouse.\n\nOut-of-bounds\n\nThe area designated as being outside the boundaries of the course.

In match play, a push occurs when neither competitor wins the hole.\n\n\"Qualifying School\", the qualifying tournament on several major professional tours, such as the PGA Tour, European Tour, or LPGA Tour. Q-School is a multistage tournament (four for the PGA Tour, three for the European Tour, two for the LPGA) that culminates in a week-long tournament in which a specified number of top finishers (25 plus ties in the PGA Tour, 30 plus ties in the European Tour, and exactly 20 in the LPGA) earn their \"Tour Cards\", qualifying them for the following year's tour. The final tournament is six rounds (108 holes) for men and five rounds (90 holes) for women. The 2012 Q-school for the 2013 PGA Tour season wast the last one, as the rules of qualification for a \"tour card\" have been changed to eliminate Q-school.[5]\n\nSince 2004 the governing body of golf throughout the world except the United States and Mexico, where this responsibility rests with the United States Golf Association (USGA). It works in collaboration with national amateur and professional golf organizations in over 110 countries.

Players begin all playing against one another until one player wins a hole outright posting the best score than all other playing partners on a hole. That player is then 1 up versus all of their combined playing partners who now form a team against the player leading and try to get the match back to all-square. In a 3 player game, after someone goes 1-up, the match then takes the form of the leading player versus the scores of the other two players.\n\nRub of the Green\n\nOccurs when the ball is deflected or stopped by a third party\/object, e.g. if a ball is going out of bounds and is deflected in bounds by hitting a spectator or a tree.\n\nRun\n\nThe distance a ball travels once it lands. The two distances of a golf shot are first its \"carry\" and then its \"run.\"\n\nA golfer that carries a higher official handicap than his skills indicate, e.g., carries an eight, plays to a two. Sandbaggers usually artificially inflate their handicaps with the intent of winning bets on the course, a practice that most golfers consider cheating.

The modern sand wedge was invented by Gene Sarazen. Although sand wedges were designed for bunker shots, they are actually used for all types of shots within 100 yards.\n\nSandy (or Sandie)\n\nA score of par or better that includes a bunker shot. Sandys are counted as points in some social golf games. If a par or better is achieved after hitting two or three bunker shots on the same hole, the terms double sandy or triple sandy are used, respectively. See Funnies.\n\nScotch foursomes\n\nIn scotch foursomes teams of 2 players compete against each other. Players alternate hitting the same ball. The first player tees off, the second player hits the second shot, the first player hits the third shot, and so on until the ball is holed. To this point, the definition of 'scotch foursomes' is the same as that of ordinary 'foursomes'; however, players do not alternate hitting tee shots as they would in foursomes. If Player A teed off on the first hole and Player B holed the final putt, Player B would not tee off at the second, meaning that Player A could, in theory, play every tee shot on the round. The team with the lowest score wins the hole.\n\nScramble\n\nWhen a player misses the green in regulation, but still makes par or better on a hole. Scrambling percentage is one of many statistics kept by the PGA Tour. Also a two or four man format, similar to Best Ball, except in a scramble, each player strikes a shot, the best shot is selected, then all players play from that selected position.\n\nDescribes a competition for older golfers, or individuals who play in such competitions.

For example, an eighty-year-old man who scores an 80 has shot his age.\n\nShoot your (my) temperature\n\nA round of 18 holes where a given player has a score equal to 98 or 99. Since this is not a good score, it is usually used to deride an opponent.\n\nShort game\n\nShots that take place on or near the green. Putting, chipping, pitching, and green-side bunker play are all aspects of the short game.\n\nSit\n\nTelling the ball to drop softly, and not roll after landing.\n\nSkin\n\nA skins game pits players in a type of match play in which each hole has a set value (usually in money or points). The player who wins the hole is said to win the \"skin\", and whatever that skin is worth. Skins games may be more dramatic than standard match play if it is agreed by the players that holes are not halved. Then, when any two players tie on a given hole, the value of that hole is carried over and added to the value of the following hole. The more ties, the greater the value of the skin and the bigger the eventual payoff.\n\nSkull\n\nTo skull the ball means to contact the ball with the leading edge of the iron, often resulting in a low shot that goes further than expected with little to no spin. A skulled shot is almost always due to a mishit by the golfer. The terms \"blade\" and \"thin\" are also used interchangeably with skull.\n\nA shot that initially takes a trajectory on the same side of the golf ball from which the player swings but eventually curves sharply back opposite of the player. Under normal circumstances, a slice is unintentional; however, good players can use a slice to their advantage in certain situations. Slices are often the most common miss for below-average players. A shot that follows the same trajectory but to a lesser degree is referred to as a 'cut' or 'fade'. A cut or fade is often intentionally used by above-average players to achieve a certain type of spin. The curved shape of the ball-flight is the result of sideways spin. For that reason a \"slice\" does not refer to a putt.\n\nSlope rating\n\nSlope Rating is a number, from 55 to 155, used to determine the level of difficulty of a golf course for a bogey golfer. An \"average\" course has a slope rating of 113.\n\nSnap hook\n\nA severe hook that usually goes directly left as well as curving from right to left, for a right-handed golfer. A snap hook is when a sever left to right hook occurs for a left-handed golfer.\n\nSnowman\n\nTo score an eight on a hole is to score a snowman. So-named because an eight (8) looks similar to the body of a snowman.\n\nSociety\n\nAn organized group of golfers, usually not affiliated with any individual golf course. Members are often drawn from the same workplace, profession, alma mater, or other association.\n\nSpan\n\nMove your marker when in the way of another persons line of putt.\n\nSpeed\n\nThe pace of a putt. Proper 'speed' of a putt will either hole the putt or leave it about 18 inches beyond the cup. Furthermore, the speed of the putt will often determine the amount of curve, or break, in a putt.\n\nSprachle\n\nGenerally, this refers to playing badly. Sprachle is a Scottish term.\n\nSpray\n\nTo hit the ball with a grossly inconsistent direction, compared to the intended target, in a seemingly random manner.\n\nA points based scoring system. The number of strokes taken on each hole relative to par translates into a set number of points, with the winner being the player who accumulates the highest number of points.\n\nTo block another player's putting path to the hole with one's own ball. Now an anachronism since the rules of golf permit marking the spot of the ball on the green, thus allowing the other player to putt into the hole without obstruction. Also, if a ball marker impedes the line of another player's putt, the marker is allowed to be moved in length-increments of one putter-head in either direction.\n\nSweet-spot\n\nThe location on the club-face where the optimal ball-striking results are achieved. The closer the ball is struck to the sweet-spot, the higher the Power transfer ratio will be. Hitting it in the sweet-spot is also referred to as hitting it in the screws.\n\nSwing\n\nThe movement a golf player makes with his\/her body and club to hit the ball. A golf swing is made up of a series of complex mechanical body movements. A perfect golf swing is regarded as the \"holy grail\" of the sport, and there are many approaches as to how to achieve \"perfection\". Although there is only one \"textbook\" golf swing, a perfect golf swing is unique to every individual, and, in fact, it is impossible for a human to perfectly duplicate the textbook golf swing.\n\nOften called a \"gimme\", a tap-in is a ball that has come to rest very close to the hole, leaving only a very short putt to be played. Often, recreational golfers will \"concede\" tap-ins to each other to save time.\n\nTarget-line\n\nThe target line is the straight line from the ball to its intended target. It is also extended backward.\n\nThe area from which you hit your drive or tee shot. The teeing ground for a particular set of tees is two club lengths in depth. The ball must be teed between the markers, called tees, that define the teeing ground's width, and no further back than its depth. Tees are colored, but there is no standard for colors. The \"teeing ground\" refers to one set of tees. Most courses have at least three sets of tees, some have more than twice that many. The areas where tee markers are placed are called \"tee boxes\".\n\nTempo\n\nThe smooth change of the speed of a player's swing from first movement, through the ball strike, to the follow-through.\n\nTen finger grip\n\nGrip style with all ten fingers on the club. Also known as the Baseball grip.\n\nThin shot\n\nUsually, an unintentional, poor shot where the club-head strikes too high on the ball. When taken to an extreme but still at or below the center-line of the ball it is known \"blading\" the ball. Sometimes, when the ball is lying a certain way around the green, advanced players will intentionally hit a thin shot to achieve certain results.[6]\n\nThrough line\n\nWhen putting, the imaginary path that a ball would travel on if the putted ball goes past the hole. Usually observed by PGA players and knowledgeable golfers when retrieving or marking a ball around the hole.\n\nThrough the green\n\nThe entire area of the golf course, except for the teeing ground of the hole being played, the green of the hole being played and all hazards on the course.[7]\n\nTips\n\nThe championship tees on a golf course are known as \"the tips\".\n\nTopped\n\nAn errant shot where the club-head strikes on top of the ball, causing the ball to roll or bounce rather than fly.\n\nTree shot\n\nA bad shot that has hit the trees' leaves, branches, and\/or trunk and has resulted in a negative situation, i.e., going out of bounds, into a hazard, or leaving the ball much shorter than anticipated.\n\nA player can declare his ball unplayable at any time when it is in play (other than at a tee), and can drop the ball either within two club-lengths, or further from the hole in line with the hole and its current position, or where they played his last shot. A penalty of one stroke is applied. A ball declared unplayable within a hazard must be dropped within that hazard.\n\nThe situation where a player holes the ball in two strokes starting from off the green. The first stroke, usually a \"pitch\", a \"bunker shot\" or a \"chip\", gets the ball 'up' onto the green, and the subsequent putt gets the ball 'down' into the hole. A variation is called \"up and in\".\n\nA common grip style in which (for right-handed players) the right pinkie finger rests on top of the left index finger. Also known as the \"overlapping grip\", it is named for Harry Vardon, a champion golfer of the early 20th century.\n\nVaulting dormie\n\nA possible occurrence in match play when a player converts a lead into a victory without passing through dormie, a guaranteed minimum of a tie at the end of regulation play. For example, converting an 8-hole lead with nine to play into a 9-hole lead with eight to play, or converting a 1-hole lead with two to play into a 2-hole lead with one to play.\n\nA pre-shot routine where a player adjusts his body, the club, and\/or practice swings at the ball.\n\nWe Are Golf\n\nA coalition formed by the Club Managers Association of America, the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America, the National Golf Course Owners Association, and The PGA of America to highlight the economic and social impacts of the game of golf.\n\nA type of club where the head is generally bulbous in shape except for the club-face. Named because the head was originally made of wood, although almost all are now metal. Of all the categories of clubs, woods have faces with the lowest degrees of loft.\n\nA tendency to twitch during the putting stroke. Some top golfers have had their careers greatly affected or even destroyed by the yips; prominent golfers who battled with the yips for much of their careers include Sam Snead, Ben Hogan, and, more recently, Bernhard Langer."}
{"text":"A full set\nof clubs will typically consist of a maximum of 14 clubs. The standard\nconfiguration of a set is 3 woods and 10 irons plus a putter. Each club\nis designed with unique specifications such as face loft angle, length\nand lie angle. Each club is designed to perform a different task.\n\nNumbers\nare used to differentiate between clubs. Woods will typically be\nnumbered 1, 3 & 5. However, many players now carry a 7 wood or utility\nwoods to replace the 1, 2, 3 & 4 irons, as they are easier to hit.\n\nIrons are\nnumbered 1 all the way through to 9, plus three specials clubs known as\nthe Pitching wedge (PW), Sand wedge (SW) & Lob wedge (L).\n\nIrons\n\nIrons\nare a very appropriate name for these clubs as the heads are made of\niron. More accurately, they are constructed from stainless steel.\nAlthough when the game was first invented, the same irons took on a\nmuch different feel and appearance. The shafts were made from hickory\nwood, the grips were bounded leather and the heads were handmade\npieces of metal.\n\nEach\niron although similar in shape is designed with varying degrees of\nlength, as well as loft and lie angles. The specifications contained\nwithin each club therefore produce a different trajectory, carry\ndistance and roll distance.\n\nWoods\n\nIn keeping\nwith the tradition of the game, these clubs have kept their original\nname. Before modern technology, these clubs used to be handmade out of a\nsolid persimmon block. Now these clubs are generally made from either\nTitanium or Stainless Steel. The improvement in head design, coupled\nwith graphite shafts has certainly made them more user friendly.\n\nWoods\nusually come in a set of 3, commonly numbered 1, 3 & 5. The number 1\nWood is also known as the Driver, while number 3 & 5 woods can be\ncategorized as fairway woods. Each has different loft, lie and length.\n\nSince the\nturn of the century, Utility, Hybrid or Rescue woods have become\nextremely popular. They are very useful when teeing off for safety, and\nout of light rough. Loft angles range from approximately 18 degrees up\nto 30 degrees.\n\nUnlike the\nirons, the bigger the number the smaller the head.\n\nPutters\n\nThe putter\nis the only club in the bag with no obvious loft on the face. Designed\nto roll the ball along the surface of the ground, the putter is most\ncommonly used but not limited to be used on the green.\n\nThe putter\nis the single most used club in the bag for most golfers. Therefore, it\nis worth the time, effort and money to get the right one. The design\nfeatures to look for are:\n\nCorrect\nLength-\nIf the club is too long it makes it hard for the body to get properly\nover the ball. Too short and you may have to strain your back to get\nyour left eye over the ball.\n\nOverall\nBalance-\nHow the putter feels in your hand is very important. A good quality\nputter should have a feel of overall balance between grip, shaft and\nhead.\n\nWeight-\nTry before you buy and get the putter that feels the right weight for\nyou. The correct weight will enable you to control the speed of the ball\nbetter. General rule is a lighter putter for fast greens and a heavier\nputter for slower greens.\n\nHead\nDesign-\nChoose a head shape that you like the look of. The correct shape should\nenable you to line up more accurately to your target.\n\nShoes\n\nGolf shoes\nare required to be worn while playing golf. They are designed for\nwalking long distances and to provide stability to the golfer.\n\nSpecial\nfeatures such as rubber spikes provide traction while swinging. Added\nfeatures such as Gore-Tex lining make the shoes almost 100% waterproof,\ngreat for that rainy day out on the greens!\n\nBalls\n\nGolf Balls\nare all standard size, they are usually white in colour and all have\ndimples, which vary in size and number depending on the brand. The\ndimple design allows the golf ball to fly in a straight line with\nminimal spin.\n\nThe\nbiggest difference between all the golf balls on the market is price,\nquality, feel and performance. Golf balls are generally either soft\ncover (softer feel) or hard cover (harder feel).\n\nThe\nmajority of the balls you find in pro shops are hard cover balls. They\nare more suited to the average player as they are:\n\nCheaper to buy\n\nLast longer\n\nGo\nfurther and straighter\n\nThe softer\ncovered ball on the other hand is designed with the advanced golfer in\nmind. They perform entirely differently to hard cover balls:\n\nSofter feel off the\nclub face\n\nReact quicker upon\nlanding\n\nSpin more through\nthe air\n\nLess distance\n\nCost\nmore to buy\n\nChoose the\nball more suitable to your skill level.\n\nAccessories\n\nThere are\nprobably too many accessories on the market to list. Ranging from every\nimaginable physical training aid to the beer can holder that sits on\nyour golf buggy, golf seems to be a game tailored for accessories. As\nevery golfer is always seeking that small advantage over the\ncompetition.\n\nHere are\nsome of the more commonly available accessories:\n\nThe Glove\n\nDesigned to help the golfer grip the club better. Also serves to protect\nthe hands from blisters, which are very prone to the beginner. Synthetic\ngloves are more popular these days as they are washable and cheaper.\nLeather gloves are also available.\n\nTelescopic\nBall Retriever\n\nDesigned for the fishing balls out of the water. The same length as a\nregular driver the telescopic feature allows it to extend out to 3-5\nyards. The scoop device at the end allows it to gather up balls on the\nedge to the water.\n\nSun\nGlasses\n\nGolf specific sunglasses are designed to protect the golfer's eyes from\nharmful UV rays, and enhance certain colours that make the ball more\nvisible in bright light. Make sure to get the right tint according to\nthe brightness of the sunlight in your area."}
{"text":"More Info\n\nCorporate Patrons\n\nThe Palmer Cup Format\n\nScore is kept by the number of holes up (won) and the number of holes to play.\n\n(Example: U.S. 2-up, with six holes to play)\n\nWhen a team is up (winning) by more holes than there are holes remaining then the match is closed out and point is awarded.\n\nOne point is awarded for each match won.\n\nIf the match is tied or \"halved\" through 18 holes of play, each team receives one half point.\n\nA total of 30 points are awarded in Palmer Cup competition.\n\nIf a match is currently tied while in competition, then it is considered \"all square.\"\n\nA match is considered \"dormie\" when one side is up by the exact number of holes, which remain.\n\nFour Ball\n\nFive groups of two two-man teams.\n\n\"Four Ball\" play is a match in which each member of the two-man teams plays his own ball. Four balls are in play per hole with each of the four players recording a score on the hole. The team whose player posts the best score on that hole wins the hole. Should players from each team tie for the best score, that hole is halved.\n\nFoursomes\n\nFive groups of two two-man teams\n\n\"Foursome\" play is a match in which the golfers compete on a team against two other golfers and each side plays one ball. The golfers play alternate shots (player A hits tee shot, player B hits second shot, etc.) until the hole is played out. Team members alternate on the playing of tee shots, with one golfer hitting the tee shot on odd-numbered holes, and the other hitting tee shots from the even-numbered holes. The team with the better score wins the hole. Should the two teams tie for best score, the hole is halved.\n\nSingles\n\nTen groups of two one-man teams. \"Singles\" is a match in which one-player plays against another player. A player wins the match when he is up by more than there are holes remaining to play.\n\nConcession\n\nA stroke hole or match can be conceded at any time prior to the conclusion of the hole or the match. Concession of a stroke, hole or match may not be declined or withdrawn.\n\nPairings\n\nEach team captain submits the order of play for this team to the appointed tournament official. The lists from each captain are matched, resulting in the pairings.\n\nExample: Captain #1 submits order of play for his team: Match #1- Stewart\/Watson Match #2- Pavin\/Love Match #3- Janzen\/Cook Match #4- Gallagher\/Wadkins Match #5- Woods\/Mickelson Captain #2 submits his list the same way. The two lists then are placed side by side and the matches are determined. Singles matches are submitted in the same fashion.\n\nNaming of Champion\n\nTHE PALMER CUP Champion is considered the team with the most points at conclusion of two days of play. If the team total is tied at the completion of two days of competition the previous years' winner will retain the cup."}
{"text":"VIDEO: Tiger's miracle par from the pond and golf's greatest water shots (plus one where it all went horribly wrong!)\n\nHonda Classic leaderboard\n\nWater may be the elixir of life but it signals doom for a golfer who finds the drink with an errant shot.\n\nYet Tiger Woods proved at the Honda Classic that, very occasionally, miracles do happen. It wasn't quite up there with walking on water, but hitting golf shots from water is a pretty tough way to play the game.\n\nWoods had hooked his tee shot into marshland on the sixth hole, his 15th of the first round on Thursday. But instead of taking a drop in rough miles back towards the tee, the 14-time major winner chose to remove his shoes and socks, don a pair of waterproof trousers and take a chance on hacking the ball out of the wet.\n\nNot only did he make good contact, Woods managed to send the ball 80 yards or so up the fairway, from where he pitched and putted for a stunning par. A par from the pond.\n\nBut Tiger isn't alone in defying the element. A small band of water babies have managed to pull off similarly stunning shots when in and around the wet stuff. Here's a selection of Sportsmail's favourites (plus one where it all went badly wrong).\n\nWet, wet, wet: Tiger Woods plays his approach shot on the sixth hole of the first round at the Honda Classic\n\n1 TIGER WOODS (Honda Classic, 2013)\n\nTiger takes a walk on the wild side and somehow saves par.\n\n2 VIJAY SINGH (Masters, par-three competition, 2009)\n\nThe greatest hole-in-one you will EVER see.\n\n3 Jamie Lovemark (Frys.com Open, 2009)\n\nYes, his ball really does bounce out of the water. Imagine seeing your opponent do this is a play-off? Troy Matteson did, somehow ignored it, and went on to win.\n\n4 The gong shot\n\nOk, so this isn't in actual competition, but it's hugely impressive. We won't give away who wins...\n\n5BILL HAAS (TOUR Championship, 2011)\n\nGiven that Jay's son needed to make par to extend his play-off with Hunter Mahan, did so, then went on to win and walk away with a cool $10million, this has to be the best water shot of all time.\n\nComments (2)\n\nSeve in his prime did this sort of thing every tournament & won more often than Woods ever will. Surprising how quick DM reporters forget great talent. - davyboy, Fareham, United Kingdom, 1\/3\/2013 20:23\nI have three points on this, firstly Seve didn't do this every tournament, secondly Tiger has already passed Seve's amount of wins by a long way, and thirdly Seve is no longer with us so why would the DM be reporting on him."}
{"text":"Pros: Every hole is in the shade, making for a good summer course. The course does not interfere with the rest of the park, although the main park road is in play on a few holes. Conveniently located close to I-95.\n\nCons: The holes get fairly repetitive. A few holes have some character due to elevation change and nearby creeks, but for the most part, it's just straight through the trees. Many holes don't have much of a fairway. Hole #13 is susceptible to flooding, rendering the hole unplayable at times. The #1 tee is hard to find if you don't know where you're going.\n\nOther Thoughts: A good course to play if you're already in Fayetteville, but probably not worth it if you're coming from out of town."}
{"text":"Latest Features\n\nLPGA.com Sponsor\n\nRefresh your Game with Michelob ULTRA: Putting Under Pressure\n\nRelated Instruction\n\nRefresh your Game with Michelob ULTRA: Putting Under PressurePutting Under Pressure: \"Making Putts When it Matters Most\"\n\nOne of the keys to putting under pressure is to have a routine that you use on every putt whether it is a three-footer or a 40-footer. If you approach the putt visually, mentally and physically the same way you will have a much greater success rate of making both long ones and short ones, especially when it matters. Try this four count drill over the ball. Once you have taken a practice stroke and determined your \"read\" of the putt, take one last focused look and visualize the ball going into the hole. If you can see it go in you have a great chance of making it! This step I call #1. #2 is when your eyes come back to the ball. Now without taking any more time and staying on the same cadence and rhythm, #3 is backstroke and #4 is forward stroke. So set up: 1: look, 2: eyes back to ball 3. backstroke 4. impact and forward stroke. Easy as 1-2-3-4.\n\nThis part of your routine determines the rhythm and cadence of your stroke. This is what I would call a four count putter. The most beneficial aspect to this type of routine is that your mind will stay quiet over the ball and you will basically go on auto pilot. The tempo of the four count will free up your stroke resulting in better contact and more consistency. Also by not thinking about the outcome, of missing or making the putt your focus is placed on just making a solid stroke and going through your routine. Think about a basketball player on a free throw line with time running out and the game on his\/her shoulders. The routine is what allows you to perform at your best under pressure!\n\nKrista Dunton, LPGA\nKrista Dunton has nearly 20 years of experience in teaching golf.

{"text":"Finding Correct Ball Position Will Keep Shots Up\n\nTODAY'S GOLF TIP\n\nNovember 7, 1997\n\nDo you ever pop that driver up, or hit an approach shot to the green fat? If so, maybe all that's wrong is the position of the ball, relative to your feet and head.\n\nIf we agree that the club head swings in a circle, all we have to do is locate the bottom. The bottom is located adjacent to your sternum. However, at impact the low point is moved just forward of center or in line with your left eye because of your hips and shoulders opening (Photo No. 1). This is the position the ball should be in anytime it is on the ground. The stance width varies due to the length of the club, but the ball position does not.\n\nWith a driver (Photo No. 2) you'll notice my left eye is behind the ball or I've placed the ball forward of the bottom to allow the club to be swinging slightly up on contact. The reason for this is the ball is no longer on the ground, but is lifted in the air by the tee.\n\nRemember, locating the low point of the swing arc or cirlce is critical for solid shotmaking.\n\nThis week's tip provided by Mark Wood, instructor with the Nicklaus\/Flick Golf Schools."}

It supports both the US and UK handicap systems which covers most countries around the world. Support for other handicap systems will be appearing in future versions of the software.\n\nReporting\n\nPlayer and Course PDF reports can be generated to give you a professional and informative summary of the rounds you have played.\n\nPlayer Summaries\n\nSummary information can be viewed for any player, giving quick and easy access to all the important information.\n\nThis is available from the Player Information screen.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nView statistics concerning your golf game, including the following :\n\nRounds - View your progress as a golfer by viewing graphs that display your golf scores over a time period of your choosing.\n\nMultiple golfers can be viewed at a time to easily compare them against each other. Additionally, this can be filtered by course or by tee to see how you perform on different courses or whilst playing off different tees.\n\nPutts Per Round\/Hole - The number of putts you average over a round (or by hole) can give you a very good idea of how strong your putting is. A golfer is expected to average 2 putts on every hole so an average of 36 for the round is considered \"par\".\n\nGreens in Regulation (GIR) - Used to indicate how often the golfer reaches the green in the regulation number of shots. The regulation number of shots to reach the green is the par of the hole minus two shots. For example, on a par 4 you should be on the green after 2 shots. This stat is useful for judging how good your driving and iron play is.\n\nDriving Accuracy - Used to measure how accurate a golfer is from the tee. It measures, as a percentage, how often the golfer can land his ball in the fairway. It is a very useful way to measure how well you are hitting the ball off the tee.\n\nScrambling - Used to indicate, as a percentage, how successful a golfer is at saving par when failing to reach the green in regulation. The regulation number of shots to reach the green is the par of the hole minus 2 shots. For example, you are expected to reach a par 5 hole in 3 shots. It gives a good idea about how good your chipping and putting is, as well as how well you cope under pressure.\n\nBounceback - Used to measure how often a golfer can return (or \"bounce back\") successfully from bad holes. It measures how often a golfer shoots under par on a hole following a dropped shot(s) on the previous hole. It is useful in measuring the mental toughness of a golfer and how well he recovers from setbacks.\n\nHazard Save - Measures how often you can shoot par or better on a hole after falling prey to a hazard. This can include bunkers and dropped shots. It gives a good measure as to how well you cope under pressure as well as your bunker abilities, recovery skills and adaptability to difficult situations.\n\nHole Scores - View and analyse your scores on particular holes.\n\nThis can be viewed either as a bar chart or as a pie chart depending on your preference and can also be filtered by hole, tee or the par of the hole."}

For example, I'll use the right-handed golfer. Most golfers learn from the beginning, to make both of the V's created point at the right (back) shoulder. The result is a fairly strong grip.

But I've always wanted to be able to reach more people in less time. This led me to develop my first smartphone app, Golf Shot Fixes, which allows golfers to troubleshoot problems without having to work with me in person.\n\nThe response I got from students was overwhelmingly positive. After developing the app, I continued to pursue ways to help more golfers than those I had time to see on the lesson tee. I know that people have a hard time sticking with an improvement plan if they don't have concrete proof that they're making progress.\n\nThis led to the development of My SwingScore, a smartphone app that grades a golf swing on 15 different technical aspects on a 100-point scale. This system lets players compare themselves to others and shows them the progress they're making with their swing, along with what they need to improve.\n\nIt's simple to use: A player takes a quick video of their swing, then sends it to me or one of my teaching professionals for analysis. We send back a detailed breakdown that includes both their SwingScore and the areas they need to work on. And as they work on the drills we suggest, they can continue having their technique evaluated until they see results."}

In fact, it refers to itself as \"The World's Most Advanced Functional Golf Beverage\" and states that it is a doctor-developed product. Honestly, we can't think of many other golf-oriented beverages, which begs another question: does the white space that this product is trying to fill actually have any white? From our perspective, it's hard to imagine this product getting shelf space outside of pro shops at golf courses and sporting good stores. Unfortunately, this seems like a very limited and difficult way to create a beverage company. As for what's in GolferAID, the product has a very strong vitamin aroma, to the point where your senses immediately know that what's inside the can is built for functionality rather than flavor. Even the slightest sip confirms this, with a pungent vitamin and herbal flavor that has a slight agave note and a bitter finish and aftertaste. Really, we found GolferAID to be a product that we would have to choke down in order to finish the entire can. This seems like another hurdle for an already challenged concept, with other, better-tasting beverages likely available alongside this product. We'd say the same for the packaging, which has a very technical look, almost to the point of being a drugstore style product. Overall, we think that the concept is too limited, while the flavor and packaging could definitely stand to be improved as well.Reviewed on: 3\/1\/2012"}
{"text":"Golf Injuries\n\nGolf is a wonderful sport that has seen a huge increase in popularity in the last decade. Today there are more than 35 million golfers in the United States alone and over 16,000 golf courses, driving ranges, and other facilities for these golfers in the US. Given the number of golfers (and perhaps the average age of the sport that tends to attract athletes on the older side of things, especially compared to contact sports such as football and basketball or high velocity sports such as skiing or tennis), it is no surprise that golfers find themselves with a variety of injuries. A study from several years ago suggests that approximately 60% of professional golfers along with 40% of amateur golfers have suffered either a traumatic or overuse injury. Even with these statistics, golf is seen as a \"low-risk\" sport that men and women can continue to participate in well into their 50s, 60s, and even 70s. Still, even as a low-risk sport, in 2009 alone there were over 55,000 visits to hospital emergency rooms.\n\nAs with many other sports such as skiing and tennis, the primary causes of golf injuries are:\n\nEquipment: Injuries are more likely to occur if using golf clubs that are not fitted for the golfer including improperly fitted clubs, clubs that are not long or short enough, clubs that have too little or too much torque, etc. Additionally, equipment such as properly fitting golf shoes and gloves can prevent minor injuries.\n\nGeneral athleticism: Even though golf is thought of as a low-impact and low-risk sport, weekend-warriors are suggested to keep their general physical conditioning up to speed. Going to the gym several times per week, participating in cardio sports or exercises such as running or swimming can help you maintain your general athleticism and reduce the instances of injury in golf.\n\nProper technique: the majority of golf injuries today are caused by improper techniques. It may be a backswing that tweaks something in your lower back or causes a strain in your shoulder. Learning the right way to swing and hit a golf ball is absolutely key in remaining uninjured."}

It is only with the advanced sand play technique and strategy that you can really develop your game.\n\nYou may have a great round going and then dump an approach shot into the bunker. You may need to get up and down to shoot a career best score. These lessons will help give you the skills and confidence to make the shot when it counts.\n\nIf you get into a bunker like the one pictured above...you will need all the versatility and creativity you can get.\n\nOne Constant : Hit The Sand\n\nThere certainly is one constant between the Basic Golf Sand Play Lessons and The Advanced Golf Sand Play Lessons...you must hit the sand first. Do not hit the ball. All the techniques and strategies and the following lessons will be for nothing if make contact with the ball during the shot. Contacting the ball sends the ball flying with too much power. It will go screaming over the green leaving you another sand shot, chip or pitch.\n\nWhen you contact the sand and slide your club under the ball, the sand will push your ball out of the trap. By playing the shot this way your ball will exit the trap higher and softer. This means it will land gently on the green without too much roll. You will have more control on the height and shot, as well as controlling the distance.\n\nAlways remember...DO NOT HIT THE BALL...HIT THE SAND!!\n\nBe Open...To Change\n\nThe most important difference between Basic Golf Sand Play and Advanced Golf Sand Play is the opening of your club and stance. This is critical in your short game and sand development. Please take your time with the grip, stance and alignment lessons. It is very important that you clearly understand those lessons. It has been my experience that this where most people struggle with golf sand play. It is not the actual swing that is the problem, but the fundamentals. If you lock those down it will be far easier to develop your game.\n\nSo let's grab your wedges and work on developing your sand skills as well as your creativity so that every sand shot you face will be challenging but not scary.

{"text":"A look and learn method can be very effective when watching players that play consistent golf. A few fundamentals must be mastered from driving to putting. They involve taking advantage of physiology, terrain and physics of the game. When collecting a set of golf strategies you should start small with the swing and follow through. Starting off right will save a lot of time. You must use clubs with the right height and may begin with the lighter ones.\n\nA stretch and a driving practice with rocketballz irons is always a good habit before the game. Making sure that the ball is struck squarely and getting a good feel will send it in the right direction. The player should only worry about driving farther after consistently striking the ball off the tee. Next, putting drills should be done regularly and these can be with the simple use of cups and tees for a setup. A flat carpeted area is sufficient but a mini golf course is perfect for gradients. Any opportunity to do the putting drills or get some putting help should be taken. Putting can be the most problematic when trying to lower a high golf score with taylormade rbz irons.\n\nPutting involves good positioning to strike the face squarely and good distance control. The swing must be smooth with follow through remaining square even after striking. This avoids a swing back which ruins the putt with taylormade rbz driver. Slightly overshooting should be part of one's golf strategies as it is better than coming short. Each setup of putting drills has a specific purpose and should be practiced until it becomes second nature. Basics like swinging the arms like a pendulum and not shifting the hands are mastered.\n\nGolfers that always break 80 and play consistent golf probably have gathered an arsenal of golf secrets. Each will probably give a different tip with a different angle to a putt and a swing with rbz driver. Control must always be there with more emphasis on precision as the strikes get near to the hole. Focusing on direction will save the player from spending a whole day trying to get back on the green. Once the play starts playing consistent golf, he will be less worried about a high golf score and more concerned about getting a birdie. If you aspire to reach that nirvana of golf, you have to live it and breathe it."}
{"text":"4 Dimensional nightmare\n\nIf people don't follow the exsiting Rules, there is absolutely no sense in changing them, since the majority won't follow the new ones either \u2013 they will just continue to whine about them and do what they want.\n\nThe existing Rules create a level playing field for all those that wish to play by them.\n\nIf you don't want to follow the Rules, just do your own thing, but please leave the Rules alone.\n\nNonsense, rules change for the better all the time, just not golf rules as they continue to add complexity via a myriad of sometimes conflicting decisions.\n\nPlay it as it lies, get on with it, its not life or death, its just a game!\n\nI agree, Shanks. The world has changed a lot in the last hundred years, but very little has changed in the rules of golf.\n\nYes, there have been a heap of Decisions to clarify where circumstances have evolved that left some doubt as to procedure.\n\nIt's probably impossible for any set of rules to encompass all possible circumstances that might occur on a golf course. But the evidence (i.e. Decisions book) is that the set of rules we have failed to clearly define almost every circumstance that might arise.\n\nIs that because the rules are too complex, or too simple, resulting in ambiguity either way?\n\nMy view is that, in an attempt to cover all likely circumstances, complexity has been used yet has failed its task.\n\nI also reiterate what I said yesterday \u2013 that the existing rules are too tedious for the majority of ordinary golfersSimpler rules not the game.\n\nPlay it as it lies, get on with it, its not life or death, its just a game!The answer to that, I would suggest, is that golf is full of traditionalists. Golf has a much longer history than most other sports currently played and there'd be a lot of antagonism toward any radical changes. Just like when 20\/20 cricket was suggested. The cricket changes had the advantage of a more appealing format for TV, where the money is.\n\nA few changes to golf rules to make them simpler would not appear, to an observer, to be noticeably different.\n\nThe R&A and USGA manage to change the rules all the time, but for the most part, they are subtle and each one seems very minor in the overall scheme of things.\n\nCould a 'commercial entity' make it happen? Perhaps. There have been attempts such as 6 hole comps in a knockout format. But they'd need TV sponsorship.\n\nThe PGA Tour events, over four days, are like test cricket matches, but with an individual winner instead of a team. If the PGA promoted short game formats, they'd be more likely to prove attractive for commercial purposes rather than rules streamlining to speed current formats marginally.\n\nUntil such time as a peak body makes a break from the clutches of R&A\/USGA with the objective of an attractive viewing perspective, all we can ever hope for is minor adjustments to the rules and we all know how they've gone in the past.\n\nIf petty changes such as wedge specifications and 'no anchoring' can cause major flack, imagine what a re-write of the rules would do.\n\nA provisional ball can only be played if the original is suspected of being lost outside a hazard or out of bounds. If the player is 'virtually certain' that his ball is lost in the water hazard and he drops and plays another ball, it cannot be a provisional \u2013 it is now the ball in play, irrespective of whether 5 minutes has elapsed in searching for the original and irrespective of whether he uses the 'provisional' word.\n\nOnly if the original is found within 5 minutes of commencing the search and provided he has not put another ball into play, may he continue with the original.\n\nSo, provided his claim of 'virtually certain' is justified, he has played 2 into the hazard, 3 out, 4 hits the tree. Then, reverting to his original ball, it's a wrong ball from a wrong place \u2013 penalty 2. Assuming it is not nearer the hole than the one that has just cleared the hazard, his stroke with it is No 7 plus whatever else he took to complete the hole.\n\nThere's some buzzing in the bushes that a major rewrite will be made in a few years time, just like the serious rewrite made in 1984, where 47 Rules all stacked in a random pile were reduced to 28 (+ 6 additional Rules no so relevant to the common golfer). The Rules were renumbered, some changed, others were added or removed and the Rules were put in a logic order from tee to green followed by relief Rules.\n\nTrue, there are lots of Rules traditionalists, but I never met a Rules nerd wishing the Rules to be static or as they are or were, \"carved in stone\" as the Rules Critics say again and again, but I guess that most nerds like me simply wants the changes, minor or major, to come from the RB's. Simple as that.\n\nI have yet to see a rewrite or simplification not causing problems or questions or discussions. As long as golf courses are set in extremely different environments and not all made alike\u2026like cricket\u2026they must cover so much more than what can happen on a small, flat patch of grass! That's what makes them special and interesting, IMO."}

I agree that it's lame to spit on the green or on the tee box near where the marker line is that day, but only because people are touching the ground there, or rolling the ball through that area. People don't get worked up about spitting on or near other sports fields, and you're a heck of a lot more likely to roll around in someone's spit if they do it on a football or baseball field.\n\nSpit wherever you want so long as it's not on me, the greens, or the tees.\n\nWhen I lived in New Mexico we'd spit on our golf balls to clean 'em. Towels would dry out so fast in the heat that you couldn't keep a towel wet for more than a hole or so. A little spit, a little rub... clean golf ball.\n\nWhat are you people, pansies? Afraid of spit? Spit is \"disgusting\"? I can think of a whole lot more disgusting stuff - like people who smoke, or people who drive carts to the edges of greens and tees - than a little spit.\n\nHere in around Tokyo (haven't played outside a 200km radius of Tokyo so I can't speak for the rest of Japan), I think it comes down to price of the green fees. Let me explain.\n\nI don't know about the average fees you guys in the US pay for 18 holes, but here, it costs about 150 bucks minimum, added to the fact you have to drive usually 2 hours to get there from central Tokyo. Most clubs force you to play with a caddie (1 per foursome), have a strictly enforced dress code, etc., so people who play golf here have \"expectations\" and preconceived ideas about style of play (in all senses of the term). So they don't spit because:\n\nthe price of play still gives a slight prestige to the game, so \"golfers don't spit\".\n\nif the caddie sees you, well, she (\"she\", because it is usually an old lady) might raise a stink about it.\n\nif you're taking out a big client on the course, this might not give the best impression.\n\nAs for my point of view, well, on the fairway or in the rough, if no one sees you, who cares? You can't touch the ball while it's on the fairway anyway, the spit will be evaporated quickly (and if it rains, what's one more drop of fluid, right?), so it's not like it's gross or anything. Just like anything else, do it discretely, it's a natural thing.\n\nOn the other hand, spitting on the tee box, on the green, while people are taking their stance, etc. yeah, that's a no-no in my book.\n\nVoted the second option. I spit rather rarely, but I do spit. A couple times in my life someone has looked askance at me for spitting and then I feel guilty - don't ever do it close enough to someone that they might be offended. Easy to do if you aren't careful.\n\nI do something else on the course, more frequently than spitting. It would be much more obnoxious\/disgusting if I ever did it on the green. This biological activity requires disappearing behind thick bushes, trees or rocks. Completely out of sight of other humans.\n\nThere's a time and a place for everything, including on the golf course.\n\nLong as your keeping it off the green, I could care less. Me and a couple of my friends chew smokeless tobacco and have never considered spitting in a cup though..? I'm outside so I've never seen the point of going out of my way to spit in a cup, but I've always made a point to not spit on the green and to throw my dip out somewhere in the rough, water, or wooded area.\n\nSome of the more ridiculous posts I have ever seen here... Get over yourselves.\n\nI spit on the course, however infrequent, but not on the green\/fringe\/teebox\/anywhere playing partners might walk.\n\nThank you! Is this seriously an issue for anybody? I mean, we're not talking about wads of half chewed tobbaco laying in a big clump in front of the hole. When was the last time anybody had a shot or putt altered because someone spit in the grass?\n\nI spit on the course all the time...I smoke cigars and spitting is kind of just a part of that...it soaks in, dries up, whatever...I mean, you don't spit in a guy's line before he putts or any other insulting type of action..and no, you don't spit out a big chaw on the green or manicured grass area or whatever, but come on - people don't do that (at least civilized people)...but just spitting on the green or wherever on the course is reason for scorn and a fine?....I don't think so"}

{"text":"How to restrict the follow through?\n\nMarty, I have always wanted to know, how does Ben Hogan have that limited follow through? even with the Driver. Yourself, Elk is the same. The video of Abe Mitchell I have seen, suggests he barely has a follow through yet I see a comment he was not a short hitter. The best and longest ball striker I have ever seen in my life (yet remained a nobody) had virtually no follow through at all, perhaps even less than Abe.\n\nI have always belted myself in the back of the head with the shaft, or even swung right through and pointed the shaft at the target. As an impressionable young golfer in the early 80;s I was a big fan of Jerry Pates reverse C also Ballesteros and Norman who all had an extended follow through. This is probably why my back is stuffed, hence a Hogan-esqe follow through would ease that issue.\n\nHowever no matter how hard I would try to have that 'short' finish, I could not make it happen, and I could not get my head around why I cant do it. So how can I do that?\n\nNow during the week i had my first session hitting balls since I had got the 'move' figured out in my brain, and I think I am on the right track. Well one of the more noticable aspects of the results was that I no longer belted myself in the back of the head, I had that nice finish just like Hogan, Elk, Marty, but it is not something I tried to do, it just happened and it felt good.\n\nSo I think I have answered my question, it is not a conscious or contrived finish, but it is just the consequences of how the follow through naturally finishes.\n\nunfortunately you cant spend all you have into the ball, thats impossible. if that did ever happen you would stop right at impact and that would be more or less an elastic collision so good luck with that. regarding Mr Hogan if you watch any limited footage available of him from the 40s there is no limit to his follow thru and that was the time when he actually participated in and won long drive contests.\n\nThat sounds good in a text book Drew...now how do we apply that to a ball?\n\n@Anton....you can endeavor to spend all your energy through the ball into the ground....what's left after that should be like exhaust....all I'm saying is don't keep firing all the cylinders long after the ball is gone....that's wasted energy.\n\nThat sounds good in a text book Drew...now how do we apply that to a ball?\n\nSounds textbook but in fact, many of the great ballstrikers that are able to \"free wheel\" through impact do this, and each in their own way to achieve both power AND balance.\n\nSince body CoG is (somewhere in your pevic region) and your axis of rotation is (somewhere in your neck region) you need to line them up. It helps to have a good core (abs, obliques, etc.) connecting the two.\n\nCenter of gravity in line with axis of rotation = balance. When you are in balance, you can rotate fast.\n\nApplying this to the ball, some have called this getting into or onto their pivot early. When you do that, with maintaing proper extension toward the ball you can come down and through and back up and around unrestricted, there's no goat hump, no reverse C finish.\n\nYou can add the vertical drop like Moe and Nelson, or not.\n\nSome of many examples:\n\nWhat throws things OFF balance, is lateral weight shifting. When you move lower body weight laterally to the edges of your base of support , you have to canteliever in the opposite direction to stay in balance. Reverse C is the canteliver of upper body weight moving away from the target as lower body weight moves toward the target. Lots of strain on the body that way.\n\ni know what you are saying Martin, i just think there is very little one can do about it past certain speed. its basically becomes something like the more speed you generate the more energy is wasted and the harder that recoil becomes. the arc in relation to body might have something to do with how that recoil is absorbed and then how it looks but it has to go somewhere. its like that hammer throw you talk about, imagine what would happen if a golf ball was in its path and the guy would hold on to that handle. maybe not the case of original poster here, certainly not my case but worth a mention.\n\nI have found your 'slap the right hand' drill very helpful. Holding extended left arm toward the target, then let the right hand go thru the entire swing motion until it slaps the right hand lets me know my thru swing is COMPLET\/FULL..no more to give.\n\nWhen I try this drill with my old right side action, I come up 6 to 12 inches short of slapping my extended left hand....no extension thru the ball?.\n\nUsing the 'move' with the club, by the time my hands are in that slap position I am spent and just hold on to the momentum of the 'mass' to the finish. It pulls me up.. never had that ...I think that is what 'Elk' said in the video."}
{"text":"Specimen LR 1 App.1 Part B\n\nI have probably missed something obvious, but I ask regardless. Regarding the Spec. LR (SLR 1 App.1 Pt. B) pertaining to playing a provisional ball under 26-1, the SLR states: \"...If the original ball is found in the WH the player may either play the original ball as it lies or continue with the ball played provisionally under Rule 26-1\u2026...\"\n\n1. Why does the SLR deny the player the right to play under one of the 26-1 options if there is KVC that the original ball is in the WH? (Is it because the ball is actually played provisionally under 26-1a? Or because it is the very essence of the PB, play the OB if you find it in play, or play the PB?)\n\nYou didn't include the first para of the SLR, which says, in essence, that you can play a prov under any of the applicable options under 26-1.\n\nSo, before you start to search for the ball, you can decide which option you prefer and then play the provisional accordingly. Then, whether you find the original or not, you have already decided the option and played accordingly if you are not proceeding with the original. You can still play the original out of the hazard if you find it.\n\nThe default allowance to play a provisional is in the possibility of your ball being lost outside a hazard or out of bounds. This SLR extends that to water hazards as well."}

{"text":"Thursday, March 31, 2011\n\nLOS ANGELES, California - What OVER THE TOP GOLF does is give amateur golfers a golf instruction method by which they are guaranteed, at the very least, to perform the most important part of the golf swing correctly. The role of your torso is to provide power through rotation and weight transfer. The roles of your other body parts, regardless of how much golf teachers emphasize wrist cocks, delayed hits and the like, are merely supplemental. Improper weight shift is a distance killer. Many excellent players have what could be considered bad golf grips but all great golfers use their torsos properly. At a minimum, after learning the OVER THE TOP GOLF method, this is something you will have in common with them - even if you are a 30 handicap.\n\nPick up any book about golf instruction. Online you can find even more places to learn about the golf swing. One common thread you'll find is an emphasis on weight transfer and the rotation of the body. It should be the basis of your golf swing and is the foundation of OVER THE TOP GOLF.\n\n writes \"The body's most important movement in the swing is torso rotation.\"\n\nMany golfers have serious swing flaws like an improper weight shift, for instance. In a conventional golf swing, as your body turns, the weight should transfer from your right side to your left side. If a golfer has a tendency to hang back on the right side, as many amateur players do, torso rotation is interrupted. Now you don't have to worry about it. Learn the OVER THE TOP GOLF swing and your problem is solved. Trust me - you will automatically transfer your weight properly. And you'll be absolutely amazed by the difference.\n\n\"It is interesting that, in analyzing the physics of a golf swing, we see that the arms and wrists play a somewhat passive role, and yet a powerful hit results. So where does the swing energy come from? It comes from the muscles in the torso and shoulders which swiftly rotate the golfer's arms and club through the swing.\"\n\nThe preceding quotation is from the highly technical article  in which the golf swing is analyzed, dissected and discussed in very specific detail. In addition to mathematical formulas that only Sir Isaac Newton could understand, there are many interesting theories explained in layman's terms. Well, not really but take a look for yourself. Remember folks, the optimal release angle to uncock your wrists is \u03b8o = 55-60\u00b0.\n\nThe article that you linked to was nothing short of amazing. Please don't ever let any of those mathematical thoughts creep into my head while I'm swinging a golf club. It was pretty much the exact opposite of what you taught me. Ridiculously complex vs. simply simple.\n\nGolf swing instruction online isn't quite mainstream but you guys are a growing business. Lots of competition though. Most amateur golfers dream of swinging like Tom Watson so they will buy his DVD. They aren't Tom Watson though. I'd prefer a more practical approach. Something I could actually use. Good luck"}

{"text":"Trouble shots are all about risk and reward. Here I have to hit the ball over a few trees to get it to the green. This requires some adjustments to my setup.\n\nTo hit the ball as high as possible, place the ball forward in your stance, near the heel of your forward foot. Next, open the clubface to increase your club's loft. Finally, tilt your body away from the target. Keep your weight on your back foot during the swing and finish high.\n\n8The Short-Sided Solution(s)\n\nEven players with great short games have trouble playing the ball from the short side of a green. Leaving yourself very little room on the green to land the ball creates a dilemma; do you try to land the ball onto the fringe and let it release toward the hole, or do you hit a short high shot to land the ball softly so it doesn't roll past the hole?\n\nFirst, you need to consider the circumstances: the lie, the firmness of the green, the amount of green between you and the hole, and the fringe's condition. Next, visualize the entire shot: its trajectory, the landing spot and how the ball will release.\n\nIf you plan to hit the ball onto the fringe, you'll hit a chip shot with a lofted club. Place the ball back in your stance and square the clubface with the target. Make a normal chip shot motion and land it on the fringe to slow the ball down. Then it will release onto the green.\n\nIf you want to play a lofted shot, change your setup. Move the ball farther forward in your stance (opposite your left foot) and open up your sand wedge. You'll still make the same chip motion, however, you'll have to make a longer swing. The shot will get up higher more quickly and land soft on the green.\n\n9The Three-Footer For Your Career Round\n\nIt's easy to say that every three-foot putt is the same, but depending on the situation, your mind-set changes. Consider what happens when you have a short putt to shoot your career-best round.\n\nMost golfers in this situation get ahead of themselves. They think only of the outcome. They get excited and start to fear that they'll choke.\n\nThe key is to focus on the process and stroke the ball with confidence. Here are a few ways to do that:\n\n\u2022 Take a mini time-out as you start your preshot routine. Become aware of how your body is feeling. Take some slow, deep breaths to calm your mind.\n\u2022 Acknowledge that this putt is for your personal best and then turn your attention back to the process. Use a question to focus on the process like, \"Where is this ball going to enter the cup?\"\n\u2022 As you look behind the ball, visualize the putt going in several times.\n\u2022 Then, finally, take a practice stroke that matches how you want to stroke the putt.\n\nThe next time you have one of those important putts, remember to shift your attention from what the putt means, to how you're going to make it.

Enjoy!\n\nMany of my students have tight hamstrings. Many of my students lose control of their posture and angles in the golf swing. These two elements are closely related and can be cause and effect!\n\nNow just think... if you try and bend forward from your waist to touch your toes, your knees will want to bend if your hamstrings are tight. In the golf swing we are bent over from the waist and we start with our knees bent. However, at the moment of impact, the goal would be to get your front leg relatively straight in order to clear that hip. At the same time it's important to hold your original posture (bent from the waist). So, if your hamstrings are tight you will either keep the front knee bent to compensate which causes a slide and loss of stability OR you will stand up out of your posture because of the inability to stay flexed at the waist while keeping a leg straight.\n\nCertainly there are other reasons why one may stand up in a golf swing, but hopefully this gets you thinking about stretching more often. Try this standing stretch. Put your feet close together- then roll up a towel and hold it in between your knees. Raise your heels on the edge of a book or foam roller. Bend forward as far as you can. Hold this position for 3 seconds and repeat 8 times. Try this again with your toes raised up instead for an even better stretch.

{"text":"from the inside\n\nDanc, the natural action of our bodies when trying to weild something like a golf club is to have an out to in swing. For a straight shot, we need the club head travelling down the target line through impact and the club face square to the target line.\n\nFor the moment, let's ignore the fact that all the angles are constantly changing. Just think of an average of what's happening through impact.\n\nBecause the natural action results in out-to-in, we need to feel as though we are doing an in-to-out so that, in fact, we are about straight down the line.\n\nWe don't want to be trying to direct things within the swing, so we want to try and 'point' our downswing (or swing plane) as a bit in-to-out. Keeping your right elbow (RH golfer) pointing down and tucked in toward your right hip should help.\u2026...Hitting from inside (draw swing) allows for better compression of the ball. It allows the club face to wrap around the ball using the shaft as a fulcrum. The ball stays on the clubface fractionally longer thereby transferring more energy into the ball.\n\nOut to in (slice swing) is a more glancing blow and the club face tends to open more through impact, less compression less distance.\n\nFor mine it doesn't matter which way you do it (within reason) as long as you either;\n\nThe difference is margin for error. To keep a drive in play or an approach shot on the green requires a high degree of consistent precision. Club path needs to be within 5 degrees either way, and club face needs to be similarly precise. At 125 kmh and faster.\n\nBabe Ruth famously pointed to where he was aiming once in his career. A golfer tries to do that with every shot (albeit with a stationary ball)!\u2026\u2026Danc, Here's an article to read of the comparison between golf swing and base ball hitters, with both sports they create the same power generation process from the ground up. This was based on research we did comparing US tour players swing sequence with a base ball hitters swing sequence in 3D. Golf and Baseball comparison\n\nDanc, you didn't hear an explanation from the TGM guys. There are no mysteries in the golf swing. There is complexity but Homer Kelley solved the complexity through enough detail and thus took the mystery out of it years ago. Complexity is very much preferable to mystery.\n\nThe shaft (and attached hands, Weeties) is moving down the face of an inclined plane on which the ball has also been placed, up-plane or before the low-point of the arc which is under ground. The low point is a little bit out from the ball, and under ground.\n\nThis is all illustrated in the Golf School Articles \"Fix Your Golf Swing \u2013 Parts 1 and 2\", the first articles at the bottom of the list. In fact, at the beginning of Part 2 there is a heading that says \"The Out\".\n\nSince the plane is inclined the path is inside out relative to the body as seen on the ground through the plane. The blur of the clubhead delivery line should be seen ideally moving into the impact area at about 12 degrees on average, in-out, depending on plane angle inclination and golfer's height. There is a training aid that you lay on the ground and hit balls off with a 12 degree angle built in. I believe you get it from Chuck Evans (YouTube). This is why we say aim at the aft-inner quadrant of the golf ball.\n\nYou don't have to try to do this. Just take it down the plane angle. Down and out are simultaneous. The result is forward. You never try to go Forward. You wll go OTT or flip the left wrist. The out-to-in fault or OTT is a plane shift to a plane tthat is open to the target line. The body got in the way.\n\nThe hand path moves up and in from about opposite your right hip when compared to the ball target line, on a good swing. The club head will continue down and out.\n\nSwinging out to right field set my swing back years. I took it at face value and swung my hands from inside to out through impact. This resulted in a very big inside to out club head path and pushes and hooks.\n\nThe reason that your hands \u2013 or to be more specific the point where your two hands meet on the handle \u2013 come in and up is because that is how we are designed to throw something down and out \u2013 we pull in the other direction. That's the release.\n\nObviously if you look at the two hands the left hands starts below the right and then the right hand moves below, so there is an aspect where the hands continue to move down if you were observing from front on \u2013 the right hand passing the left and heading down. So you could think about the hands moving down maybe all the way to impact. Maybe.\n\nIf your hands moved in a nice circle which bottomed out around your belly button or left hip then down and out from a hand perspective would be right. But we actually begin pulling the hands up against the downward force of the club. The hands and club do not move on a nice single plane throughout the swing swinging the hands down towards the knees on the smallest possible arc is key swinging the hands down towards the knees on the smallest possible arc is key.\n\nThe man who hits at the ball rather than through it has no sense of rhythm. Secrets of the Master \u2013 The Best of Bobby Jones\n\nTo add this, hence Razzar depending on where the ball position is, for a driver the COM doesn't move in front of the ball. How ever the center of mass does press forward although at the point of impact the com stabilizes or stops moving, this has to happen to allow muscles to contract to accelerate the upper body. The com stabilizing also allows the upper body arms to rotate and accelerate around the axis of the spine.\n\nThe deceleration of the upper body and contraction of the muscles in the lats an arm contracting is what causes the arms to accelerate. When the arms decelerate is what causes the club to release(unhinge) and accelerate into impact. If the arms keep on accelerating the club can not release effectively. For the club to release correctly and accelerate into impact the arms must slow down.\n\nBase ball the same applies same patterns and same chain of events. Baseball is on a vertical plane, golf in on a inclined plane no real difference.\n\nIn golf the club is just moving on an incline plane like Razaar explained the club moves down and forward also in to out.(Down, inside out, forward and back inside) How ever it's due to the arms working around the axis of the spine on and incline plane or bent over position is why the club moves down, inside to out, forward and back side again.\n\nBase ball is a vertical plane and move around the spine and forward. however depend on the pitch it can also move a very similar plane to the golf club is you are thrown a low ball.\n\nThe club dynamics to golf of how the clubs moves on a path and it's magnitude and direction is not really not much difference to any rotational sport like base ball or tennis. The only difference is with golf we are bent over or on an incline plane apart from that the club dynamics is similar to any other rotational sport.\n\nOther sports are instinctive, reactionary and or spontaneous not so with golf. There is no such person as a natural golfer. The closest is probably a natural left hander who takes up the game right handed and vice versa. Consequently it is difficult to transfer skills across from other sports to golf. The golf swing is not a natural action. It is a feat to be able to hit the ball on the first couple of attempts.\n\nIt is a more difficult game to learn for people over the age of 20 than it is for somebody under 20. The experts agree than it is more difficult for us to learn new skills after we reach 20 because the way we move and perform actions is firmly established at that age.\n\nWe were talking about this same subject recently. I asked Jake Higginbottom what age he was when he first shot par or under. He was 12 yo. Cam did the same thing at 12 yo. Most of the kids in the Aust Team would be of the same ilk as would most of the top touring professionals.\n\nSorry so what is the difference between golf and other sports then that makes everyone struggle so much with golf? PRECISION?\n\nPractice swing divot is straight, actual swing divot is badly out to in\n\nI'll hazard a guess and bear in mind that I'm a hack playing off 19. And from the ghetto to boot.\n\nAll other racquet\/bat sports are linear extensions of our arms. The golf club has a bend in it at the hosel, varying degrees of loft for the club face. In short the club face is always travelling on a different angle and plane to our usual racquet\/bat sports.\n\nThat's what I think the point of difference is and that is what makes it difficult to hit.\n\nfoster said you all should take note from golf savvy and his gps and stop fken trying to get your golf swing perfect,perfect is for losers they are never happy,perfect actually stops people not only in golf but in life from attempting new things as they feel they will never achieve them. so forget the golfing machine and forget ground forces,their all a joke. like i said in another thread the only thing i found in the ground was worms and gravity"}

{"text":"Swing Thought: Your Third Eye\n\nSlice-Free Golf helps you achieve a position where your shoulders will actually feel closed at impact. A great way to get the feel for this critical impact position is to imagine you have an eye directly in the center of your chest.\n\nIf you're a slicer, that eye will most likely be looking AHEAD of the ball at impact\n\nIn the Slice-Free Golf swing you need to achieve the positions shown where the imaginary eye is looking slightly BEHIND the ball at impact.\n\nIt is also very helpful to have the actual eyes in your head, and your face, focusing on a spot just behind the ball."}
{"text":"June 27, 2011\n\nCause of the \"Yips\"\n\nThe Yips are a sudden twitch or jerk that strikes a golfer as he prepares to take a swing. Now, researches at the Mayo Clinic have looked into the cause of the yips and are closer to figuring out what causes that annoying jerk or twitch in some golfers. Dr. Charles Adler of Mayo Clinic will discuss his research.\n\nTed Simons: They're notorious among golfers. They can ruin a perfectly good round with one little twitch. They're the yips, and they can really mess up your mind and your golf game. Researchers at the Mayo Clinic have been looking into what causes the yips. Here to talk about the study is Dr. Charles Adler, a Mayo Clinic neurologist and researcher. Thanks for joining us.\n\nDr. Charles Adler: Thanks for having me.\n\nTed Simons: Lets defines terms here. What are the yips?\n\nDr. Charles Adler: Yips are people who putt or chip and get an involuntary movement. Usually they describe it as a twitch, a jerk or sometimes a tremor.\n\nTed Simons: You said putting and chipping. Some people think they have the yips was a driver, possible?\n\nDr. Charles Adler: I think possible, but traditionally, people talk about it mainly with putting and chipping.\n\nDr. Charles Adler: I think it's accurate in many golfers that performance anxiety and that's one of the cause of yips. Our research is geared at looking at whether everybody is more of a psychological or neurological type of yip. We believe there are a number of golfers who have a golfer's cramp, much like musician's cramp or writer's cramp. It's a neurologic disorder.\n\nTed Simons: So it's not the kind of thing if you're walking down the street, your hand goes like this. Only when you're holding a putter and -- why then?\n\nDr. Charles Adler: If you saw someone whose hand shook.\n\nTed Simons: Yes.\n\nDr. Charles Adler: Just as they're sitting here then you wouldn't be surprised if their hand shook when golfing.\n\nTed Simons: Yes.\n\nDr. Charles Adler: The research we're doing, people, like you said, don't have a movement disorder when they're just walking around and it's just during that task. We call it a task-specific movement dystonia or a task specific movement disorder. Again, musician's cramp, people who play the violin and people who write, and only when they're writing, no other activity, typing, only when writing do they get a twitch or involuntary movement of their hand.\n\nTed Simons: That suggests overuse. Do you think do you understand the musician with the cramp and the writing so much your hand freezes up? Overuse here in terms of putting.\n\nDr. Charles Adler: There's a lot of discussion about it being due to overuse. Nobody has proven whether these task specific dystonias are truly due to overuse. It may be a genetic predisposition. And in the setting of overuse, that's when they get it. And then we all write but don't all get writer's cramp. Many people play instruments and yet don't get a musician's cramp. Same with golf.\n\nTed Simons: Talk to us about the study. What you did and how the research was conducted.\n\nDr. Charles Adler: We did a study where we took 10 people who complained of the yips and 10 who didn't. We had them in the lab at Mayo clinic and we studied hand movements and forearm movement. This study was done at ASU at the practice green at Carson golf course with my colleagues both in Mayo and in ASU and studied 25 golfers who complained of yips and 25 golfers who did not. And we videotaped them and had surface EMG, which is an electrical recording device to look at movements of the muscles and contraction of the muscles. And then had their wear a glove which measured joint position at the fingers as well at the wrist. It also measure the rotation at the wrist.\n\nTed Simons: Did you find that they gripped tighter, change throughout the putting stroke? I'm trying to get this neurological situation down here. Because again, some folks think the yips -- I actually read this once, where a putting instructor thought that with the yips - when you're taking the putter back, you're thinking you're aiming too far in one direction and your mind says compensate, compensate, compensate. And by doing that you start poking at it.\n\nDr. Charles Adler: I have read that as well and can't say it's incorrect. In the research, we've done, we've identified a number of individuals that have an excessive amount of rotation around the wrists. Some have co-contractions, so their wrist flexors and extensors contract at the same time. People who don't complain about yips mainly do not have that. We think there's a percentage of people, 10, 15, 20 percent, maybe higher that have a neurologic cause as opposed to a performance anxiety or choking cause as you described.\n\nTed Simons: And it seems as though you don't hear about young people having the yips. Always the older guys and complaining and they've got the belly putter because they just can't do it. If it's neurological, why don't we see more young folks out there with this?\n\nDr. Charles Adler: This was followed in line with all of these other sort of movement disorders. They occur as one ages. Think about tremor, think about Parkinson's disease, think about people who have writer's cramps and musician's cramps. Similar pattern usually occurs in their 40s and 50s and maybe 60 in terms of the onset. So same thing here.\n\nTed Simons: What kind of treatment are we talking about? I know it's early in the study and this of course is looking at golf. But as for the golf aspect, what do these folks do?\n\nDr. Charles Adler: The first -- first of all, the study was not a treatment study. We didn't actually look at any treatment modality. That's the point of what I hope will be the next study. The first treatment option as with the other type of cramp, change your grip. Use a longer putter. People say doesn't that prove it's not neurologic? And the answer is no. If you have a writer's cramp patient, we often change the size of their pen and how they grip the pen to get them to compensate. Various oral medications can be tried and depending on the patient, there are a couple of other options. Toxin injections used for writer's and musician's cramp and there's even surgical intervention with deep brain stimulation surgery. I'm not saying that should be used on golfers.\n\nTed Simons: That's what I was going to say.\n\nDr. Charles Adler: There's one golfer who has had that. A professional golfer. That's something that would need a lot more study. But that's way down the line.\n\nTed Simons: Quickly, if someone has the yips, is that a concern, a health concern?\n\nTed Simons: A computer hacking group that's targeted the CIA and the U.S. senate turned its attention to Arizona last week. Lulz security, or Lulzsec, claimed responsibility for hacking into and stealing files from the state department of public safety's computer system. Here to talk about all of this is Ken Colburn, CEO of valley-based data doctors. Ken, it's always a pleasure.\n\nKen Colburn: Good to see you, Ted.\n\nTed Simons: When they say they hacked into the computer system, that's not correct.\n\nKen Colburn: DPS actual computer systems were never breached. What happened was a handful of I think seven to eight actual email accounts that belonged to officers were compromised. So there's a huge difference between the whole system getting hacked and these guys having their emails exploited.\n\nKen Colburn: That's true. Everything we've seen in the evidence - the forensic team went through the files to see \u2013 did it jive with what they were saying. And they're consistent with these being email attachments, primarily because each file's author, we can dig into the metadata to see who actually created the file. And it was a myriad of people unrelated to the people who got hacked, which is very consistent with you receiving emails attachments from others.\n\nTed Simons: Basically, talking about emails, this -- one of these, I didn't change my password enough? How did they get into these emails?\n\nKen Colburn: We don't know for sure. DPS might know, but they are obviously not yet discussing that. But one of things we saw was that the passwords were pretty weak and a weak password makes it real easy. We posted something on our facebook page to show you how easy it is to break into something with a weak password.\n\nTed Simons: What's a weak password?\n\nKen Colburn: Six characters, either all numbers or all letters. Takes about 10 minutes for the software that the hackers use to \"guess\". There's the dictionary attack where they can just try every word in the dictionary. If you use those common mistakes, they'll get into your accounts so fast it's not funny.\n\nTed Simons: These were rural officers \u2013 kind of out in the sticks who may not had the latest up-to-date computer equipment as well. Did they target these people? Find these people?\n\nKen Colburn: They're making it look like S.B. 1070 was a cause and everything what's happened. They've shut down and so many things have happened. From the beginning, I have said it's a cause taken up because of a hack. So inadvertently came across information and look what we have here and then it took up the sick S.B. 1070 cause because if it was hack based on a cause -- now was that the cause that drove the hack? They wouldn't have gone after the rural officers. They would've literally gone after the DPS system and would have seen a treasure trove of information being released.\n\nTed Simons: How do you inadvertently come across like this?\n\nKen Colburn: The hacking community, the way they take advantage and make use of computers all over the world is that they create what are called BOTnets. These are robot computers and unfortunately a lot of people watching this, they're unwittingly participating in these BOTnets right now because they sell for a trick that allowed a piece of software to sneak into their computer. And this person can use it along with 10,000 other pieces of computers that have all been compromised and say, at 2:00 in the morning, attack the PBS website. And that's what happened when PBS.org was taken down. It's a denial of service attack. It's a complexity. They have to compromise a bunch of average Joe computers, and this is my hypothesis, they ran across one or two DPS agents' computers and saw they were DPS agents and had these attachments and said, let's run with this.\n\nTed Simons: We keep hearing don't open attachments you're not familiar with and don't go to websites you're not familiar with. Because these things can infiltrate. If -- one of these officers simply open an attachment they shouldn't have or -- ?\n\nKen Colburn: It's quite likely, especially when you consider they're rural officers. I've contended that were probably compromised at home or on an unsecured computer they own or had access to. You think about the fact that email is so accessible and can be accessed from so many places. There's not enough time to talk about all the potential ways they were compromised. If they went into an internet caf\u00e9 that has key login software, or if they clicked on a file that allowed something to get in or keeping their security software up to date, there's a million things that can take you anywhere you want by clicking on a link.\n\nTed Simons: One employee who can check their work email from home, that person slip up there, a house of cards comes down?\n\nKen Colburn: It's possible. Depending on the access level they have. In this case, based on the evidence, because all they have are email attachments, they didn't get any further than those email attachments. If they had, they could have had this huge database, they're releasing all kinds of information from our organizations much more damaging. Fortunately for DPS it was mostly benign email attachments and certainly disconcerting files but nothing dramatic like a true break-in.\n\nTed Simons: These things raise the question: How protected is sensitive government information, how protected is my sensitive information?\nKen Colburn: Unfortunately, there's no such thing as a 100% secure system. Other than the really high end, nobody knows about military grade networks we don't have access to. When it comes to the public internet, it's not very secure and it's -- it behooves all of those folks that run websites, you know, this is a wakeup call, anyone could be the next target. Despite the claims of being political and what have you, they're just anarchists and primary hack for the adulation of their friends and Lulz -- doing it for the fun. That's the name of that organization. Fortunately, they've closed up shop, but it's not over.\n\nTed Simons: How difficult is it to find suspects? Do they leave -- if someone is coming into your system, you would think someone would leave a trail. They don't leave trails?\n\nKen Colburn: Not at all. There's a number of different ways where you can't get into the technical aspects but the movies where you see they take over a computer and this computer takes that computer -- that's the way they can blend things. They're going to take advantage of the folks I'm talking about out there that are infected and used as a zombie, using those computers to do the hacking and damage. It's real easy to be anonymous on the internet if you know what you're doing, unfortunately.\n\nTed Simons: Last question: Are we more at frisk our own P.C.s or someone else we exchange email with or our work? I mean where is the greatest risk?\n\nKen Colburn: The biggest problem everybody watching this has is themselves. The human being is the biggest security risk. Because all it takes is one trick email, one thing, no matter how well you've protected yourself, if you fall for a trick. A common one was, Ted, I can't believe you got caught on video doing this. You get an email, oh, my goodness, and you are just clicking around, you're not thinking about security. You're thinking, I got to see this video. When you get there, you have to update your video player, and -- boom! You've let them in.\n\nTed Simons: If someone wants your banks account number or social security, because you have to do this or the other. Red flag.\n\nKen Colburn: And teenage household with high speed internet. Highest risk group out there. And if you're a parent of a teenager, better do your homework.\n\nTed Simons: Ken, good stuff, good to see you.\n\nKen Colburn: Thank you, Ted.\n\nSupreme Court\n\nTed Simons: Good evening and welcome to \"Horizon.\" I'm Ted Simons. The U.S. Supreme Court today struck down a key part of Arizona's Clean Elections law. That's the law that provides public funding to help candidates run for office. Here to talk about how the high court ruled is attorney Dan Barr, a constitutional expert from the Phoenix law firm of Perkins-Cooey. Thanks for joining us\nDan Barr: Thanks for having me.\nTed Simons: What did the court rule and why did they decide in that fashion?\n\nDan Barr: Well, the court ruled exactly what people thought it was going to rule from the oral arguments back in March. You had five justices led by the chief justice, holding that the matching funds provision of the Clean Elections law violated the first amendment. The court was looking at it from the perspective of a candidate who refuses or declines to participate in the Clean Elections Public money. And saying that those candidates are faced with sort of a Hobson's choice, you reach a point where if you spend any more money on your campaign, that triggers matching funds from the state and by raising money for yourself, you're actually raising money for your opponent.\n\nTed Simons: And matching funds means if you and I are both running and you're private and I'm public, and I get to X. And what you spend beyond X. So what you spend beyond X I get? And the court said that's an infringement on your free speech rights?\n\nDan Barr: Infringement of free speech rights because I have the choice of if I spend the money then you get more money from the state up to a certain level, and I shouldn't be put to that choice. If I want to spend my own money on the campaign, I should be able to do that without fear that the state of Arizona is going to give you money and then allow you to run ads or do whatever that will harm my campaign.\n\nTed Simons: Basically says you would have to limit your free speech in order to not benefit my campaign?\n\nDan Barr: Exactly.\n\nTed Simons: Ok.\n\nDan Barr: Exactly.\n\nTed Simons: Is that -- is that -- does that make sense?\n\nDan Barr: Well, to the defense it doesn't make sense, Justice Kagan writing for the defense says wait, we're not forbidding anyone from saying anything. All that's happening are we have more speech. If someone wants to spend more money, great, but the publicly funded candidate will get to respond, get more speech. Chief Justice Roberts says, no, the state of Arizona is putting its thumb on the scale and the person who wants to speak more and spend his own money shouldn't be faced with the prospect of having then to combat other candidates. It's not just one candidate. The Supreme Court gives the example of what happened in the fourth district of Arizona. The fourth legislative district. Where you had one candidate running as a privately funded candidate against two -- two publicly funded where you get -- I forgot the term. The Multiplier Effect. In the multiplier effect - If I'm going to spend one dollar of my own money, the state is going to give one dollar to each of my opponents, therefore, increasing the opposition to me.\n\nTed Simons: If I get this correctly, what Justice Kagan was saying, this wasn't necessarily an infringement on free speech, its subsidizing speech and that's not the same as first amendment right or a first amendment damage, correct?\n\nDan Barr: Exactly. She went through a bunch of cases in the past where subsidizing speech is not a violation. You're actually promoting free speech.\n\nTed Simons: Independent Expenditure Groups were mentioned by Justice Roberts. Talk to us why Chief Justice Roberts said this would be a problem on speech rights on their accounts.\n\nDan Barr: Because the Independent Expenditure Group wants to, say, support your candidacy but put to a choice. If they say, I'm going to run an ad in favor of Ted Simons, then that will trigger the matching funds for candidates A and B who are running against him. So I have a choice. I can do that or instead of running an ad in favor of Ted Simons, I am going to run an ad supporting some position he's in favor of or I have a choice not to speak at all. And Chief Justice Roberts said when you're put to that choice that violates the first amendment. The independent expenditure group shouldn't be put to the choice of running an ad for Ted or for a cause he supports or not speaking at all.\n\nTed Simons: And there are limitations as well if the independent expenditure group doesn't want to donate to my ideas, whatever the situation is, that's limited. The matching funds to my opponent, those aren't limited?\n\nDan Barr: Correct.\n\nTed Simons:-- in how they're used?\n\nDan Barr: And chief justice Roberts also says, you know, if you're the beneficiary of an independent expenditure group, you may not want their help.\n\nTed Simons: Uh-huh.\n\nDan Barr: Ok. You may disagree with their views or view what they're doing is not assisting your campaign. The problem is with the matching funds, the state of Arizona would then give the amount the independent expenditure group to your opponent who could then use it directly for his benefit. So that goes, according to Chief Justice Robert's view, the benefit of your opponent and not you.\n\nTed Simons: I noticed in the dissent, Justice Kagan says it's a good and legitimate way to deal with the cancerous effect of corruption on campaigns and like Chief Justice Roberts said, maybe but that's not what we're dealing with. We're dealing with an infringement on free speech rights.\n\nDan Barr: And he addressed the rationales. Burdening a candidate's ability to spend his or her own money doesn't impact on corruption. If I spend my own money on my campaign, I'm not being corrupted by that.\n\nTed Simons: Uh-huh.\n\nDan Barr: He also noted that public financing does nothing to prevent politicians from taking bribes. Interesting, somebody commented today that many of the politicians caught up in the Fiesta Bowl scandal are publicly financed candidates.\n\nTed Simons: Mm.\n\nDan Barr: So Chief Justice Roberts was saying that the state hasn't really proven the matching funds help in combating public corruption.\n\nTed Simons: And according to Justice Kagan, and you mentioned this before we got on the air, did she refer to the Goldilocks rule?\n\nDan Barr: The system that the state of Arizona set up, the Goldilocks solution. That's when faced with public financing, you don't want to give too much to the candidate which would burden the state. And would be wasted money and you don't want to give too little because you don't have candidates participate. So the Goldilocks solution is where you're giving the just right amount. And Chief Justice Roberts said, the Goldilocks solution, whatever it is, can't be dependent on someone exercising their free speech rights.\n\nTed Simons: Last question: Obviously, Clean Elections survives the matching funds has been ruled unconstitutional and yet, if you and I are running and I'm a publicly funded candidate I can only go to X. You can go to X plus one. I can't go to X plus one at all.\n\nDan Barr: Or X plus 100.\n\nTed Simons: Yeah.\n\nDan Barr: Or X plus 1,000. So that's the current state of the law. You're going to get a lump sum from Clean Elections and you're stuck with that.\n\nTed Simons: What do you think as far as setting precedent for other laws, similar efforts around the country? Is this a biggy in terms of that?\n\nDan Barr: There are seven other states that have matching fund provisions like Arizona's and clearly they're laws are probably infirm now. But the future of public financing, the state is free -- public financing is that the state is free to give -- there's no Goldilocks solution. Going to have to figure out if the sum is adequate enough at the beginning of the campaign to make the candidate competitive."}

{"text":"Report Card\n\nJuly 2005\n\n1. Tiger Woods, 1, 274 (-14)\n\nGrade: A\n\nWhat worked: The putter, which failed him at Pinehurst. His 120 putts last week were a tournament low.\nWhat didn't: Well, he hit four bunkers. And he didn't secure the win until the back-nine Sunday. What about the PGA: Four times since '97 he's had his worst major finish at the year's final major.\n\n2. Vijay Singh, T-5, 281 (-7)\n\nGrade: B\n\nWhat worked: No stat shined, yet he was T-5, gutting out a similar finish to the year's other majors.\nWhat didn't: He took 124 putts, his lowest in a major in '05. But that's misleading. He didn't putt. What about the PGA: If he converts on the greens at Baltusrol, the two-time champ should threaten.\n\n3. Ernie Els, T-34, 286 (-2)\n\nGrade: C-\n\nWhat worked: He made 18 birdies despite hitting only 37 fairways and 52 greens in regulation. What didn't: Els took 37 putts Saturday when he fell out of contention for good.\nWhat about the PGA: Was T-7 in the '93 U.S. Open at Baltusrol, his first made cut in a U.S Open.\n\n4. Phil Mickelson, T-60, 289 (+1)\n\nGrade: D\n\nWhat worked: Through three rounds Mickelson played the front nine in seven under par.\nWhat didn't: He was nothing if not consistent on the greens, taking 33, 33, 33 and 32 putts per day.\nWhat about the PGA: Has a star-crossed PGA history, being in contention (six top-10s) as often as not.\n\n5. Retief Goosen, T-5, 281 (-7)\n\nGrade: B\n\nWhat worked: He hit 47 greens the last three days, tied for best in the field during that span. What didn't: Bounced back from Pinehurst, but another poor final round (74) leaves work to be done.\nWhat about the PGA: He'll get another chance to rebound, but it's likely the year that could have been.\n\n6. Sergio Garcia, T-5, 281 (-7)\n\nGrade: B\n\nWhat worked: Had his best Open finish ever--and fourth top-10--thanks to 69s in the middle rounds.\nWhat didn't: Garcia took 131 putts. Among players in the top 10 only Fred Couples took more.\nWhat about the PGA: He missed the cut three of the last four years, but expected better this time around.\n\n7. Adam Scott, T-34, 286 (-2)\n\nGrade: C-\n\nWhat worked: One of the week's longest hitters (eighth, 329 yards) and better putters (12th, 123).\nWhat didn't: Everything in between. He hit only 53 greens (T-58) and made just 14 birdies.\nWhat about the PGA: A T-30 finish sounds right. He's been consistently underachieving in majors in '05.\n\n8. Jim Furyk, MC, 148 (+4)\n\nGrade: F\n\nWhat worked: Like most players Thursday he hit the ball a long way, averaging 329 yards per drive.\nWhat didn't: Three three-putts in a first-round 78, kept him from the weekend despite a 70 Friday.\nWhat about the PGA: Once an automatic top-10 major finisher, he has no top-10s since his U.S. Open win.\n\n9. Padraig Harrington, did not play\n\nGrade: None\n\nHarrington withdrew from the British Open after the death of his father, Patrick, three days before the tournament began. What about the PGA: It depends on his frame of mind, but if he decides to play, he'll likely do well.\n\n10. David Toms, DQ, 74 (+2)\n\nGrade: Inc.\n\nWhat worked: His honor goes unchallenged, penalizing himself for a violation no one else saw.\nWhat didn't: The admirable DQ hid a flawed round. After the 74, he likely would have missed the cut. What about the PGA: Hasn't done well in NYC-area majors, with a MC, a T-45 and a T-20 in three tries."}
{"text":"5? Oh I thought it was a 3 day cruise. My bad. 5 days is not so bad. the 3 and 4 day cruises are a bit tight.

{"text":"It's not enough that the Masters is all about pressure and winning one of the most prestigious tournaments of the year (hence the name). It's not enough that the players are trying to overcome one of the hottest players of all time (Tiger Woods). The issue that has players fretting the beginning of the tournament is something else--the greens.\n\nWhy else would Retief Goosen go back to the same putter that he used in 2001 when he was playing arguably his best golf? Why else would Padraig Harrington spend four hours on the practice putting green? It's not like these guys have lost their edge--it's simply that they are trying to get an edge against the glassy greens that Augusta National seems to bring year in and year out.\n\nIt was so much of a concern to Ernie Els that he went to Augusta two weeks ago--and didn't even play--all he did was ask a local caddie to help him with the putting and to get a read on what things may be different now and things that he could use to give him an advantage. It again proves how complex and intricate the game of golf is, and it also shows that players are not about to bow down to Woods and just let him win. He hasn't won there since 2005, but we are talking about Tiger--he's the man. As one of the best putters in the game, it will take moves like what Els did to overcome the huge advantage Woods already has."}
{"text":"The first three ball flights have one thing in common, the club is headed straight down the target line. If you are standing behind the ball the target line is a straight line from your ball to the target. How your club impacts the ball in relation to this line is called path. This affects which direction the ball will travel. When one of the first three ball flights is employed the path is straight down the target line, or the club is moving straight toward the target at impact.\n\nThe top goal of every golfer is to hit the ball straight. Often times this is more luck than skill but it is important to understand what is happening to repeat it more often in the swing. The key is to get the club to travel straight down the target line and have a square club face at impact. This means that the club is moving towards the target and the club face is perpendicular to the target line when impact is made. When these are both done the result is a straight shot that never leaves the target.\n\nWhile the straight shot is the most desired there is another shot that is far more common in the game of golf, the fade or slice. Most golfers that play the game recreationally hit this shot, even thought they may not know why. The fade is the result of the club moving straight down the path but with the club face being open at impact. This means that when the club comes into contact with ball the heel, or back of the club, is ahead of the toe. This makes the club head point to right at impact and imparts spin that causes the ball to curve to the right after starting at the target.\n\nThe last of the flights with the path heading down the target line is the draw. This is the exact opposite of the fade. When the club makes impact with the ball it is still traveling down the target line but the face is closed rather than open. The toe of the club is ahead of the heel at impact. This causes the ball to start at the target line and turn to the left because of the spin caused by the closed club face at impact.\n\nIn the following articles we will cover the final six ball flights. When a basic understanding of these is accomplished it will become much easier to understand the golf swing."}
{"text":"I don't believe it is a double standard at all.... TW was held to the same standard when he was 23 and had a good history of behavior as Rory is now. This is life. We are not judge just based on our actions - rather also on our history. That's not a double standard. If McIlroy starts to throw clubs more regularly, the public and the media response will heat up. That's consistency - not a double standard.\n\nAnd also, I don't think the amount of media coverage is either an indicator of right or wrong or a measure of double standard. The media is not a judge\/jury - they just report the facts that interest their readers\/viewers.

But as it tracks toward the green\u2013DOINK!\u2013it hits a power line and bounces into the rough. What do you do? According to Decision 33\u20138\/13 in the Rules of Golf, a course can enact a Local Rule allowing for the replay of the previous shot without penalty.\n\nNote: You don't have the option of playing the ball from its new position. However, if the course doesn't have this Local Rule, play the ball as it lies.\n\nPOP QUIZ\n\nQ: You think the ball you just hit is in a water hazard, but you're not sure. Can you play a provisional ball?\n\nA: Yes, but if it turns out the ball went into the hazard, the provisional ball must be abandoned, and you must proceed with the original ball.\n\n\/Christoph Niemann\n\nRule 18\n\nThe ball moved, but is it a penalty?\n\nFirst, know the definition. A ball is deemed to have moved only if it comes to rest in a new place. But a ball that oscillates has not \"moved.\" If the ball moves after you've addressed it (outside a hazard, \"address\" means taking your stance and grounding your club), then add a penalty stroke to your score and put the ball back. There's no penalty if it is moved by an outside agency (a spectator, squirrel, etc.) or as a result of actions such as searching for it in\na hazard, removing an obstruction or a loose impediment on the green. But you still have to replace it.\n\/ Shuhei Matsuo"}

As my reply messages have been rejected by AOL, I will answer it here. )\n\nImmediately I think yes, of course, so I do a search on the internet and find that\n\nHypnosis can improve your golf game and concentration! Also, an article about The MENTAL game of golf. Many athletes have used and continue to use hypnotic techniques to improve their game. Tiger Woods admits to using visualization. This is a technique often used in hypnosis. The imagination can be used to improve many areas of your life, including athletic ability. How many times have you seen the better team lose? They may have more talent and ability, but sometimes the less than stellar athletes are better prepared mentally. They don't get discouraged if someone drops the ball. They just keep playing their best until the game is over. They don't give up and sometimes that is enough to \"Psyche\" out the opponents.\n\nWhen someone is in the hypnotic state they can practice their golf game mentally. And feel all the feelings they will feel when they win, or beat their best score. This mental rehearsal has been shown to keep a person in good condition, even when they have to sit out for several weeks to recover from an injury. There have been some studies done with college basketball players in some CaliforniaUniversity. The players who had injuries, but continued to practice in their minds, played with the same skill as those who actually did practice! And a later study showed that the best combination for top athletic skill, was something like 75% visualization plus 25% actual physical practice. And fewer injuries resulted from the visualized practices!"}

{"text":"Long Nose Woods and Feathery Balls\n\nThe industrial revolution of the 18th century brought large changes to the population of the the United kingdom. People swarmed into the towns and cities, and they prospered as national and international trade grew. The average middle-class man also had Saturday afternoon's off which many Scots used for playing the fast growing pastime of golf.\n\nThe game of golf spread to the outer edges of the British Empire with clubs being formed at Bangalore in 1820 and Calcutta in 1829.\n\nHickory imported from North America became favoured over Ash as the wood of choice for many hand tools and golf club club makers began to adopt it for shaft making.\n\nWith more players flocking to the links several general carpenters and trading companies local to the dozen or so clubs that existed in Scotland began advertising themselves as specialist golf club or golf ball makers. The more well known include:\n\nHugh Philp started as a general joiner, but his skill and reputation grew rapidly and in 1819 he was appointed Official Clubmaker to the Society of Golfers of St.Andrews (later renamed the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St.Andrews in 1834 ). Philp opened a small shop near the Union Parlour public house and took as his apprentices both James Wilson and his nephew through marriage Robert Forgan ( who later established the largest golf club making business in the world ). Philp's clubs were so coveted that other makers were known to stamp their clubs with his name, and it is said that three times as many clubs were stamped with his name than were actually made in his workshops.\n\nAllan Robertson was a club maker also, of which only a few specimens still exist, but he is mostly known for his skill in making feathery golf balls. He took as his apprentices Tom Morris ( who in his lifetime became celebrated as the architypal golf professional the world over ) and Lang Willie and the three of them worked from Allan kitchen, with balls being sold through an open window. Allan's business records show that he sold 1021 balls in 1840, 1392 balls in 1841 and by 1842 teh number had grew to 2456 balls. Legend has it that one day in the late 1840's Tom ran out of featheries whilst playing golf on a particular nasty day on the links and was loaned a new type of gutta-percha golf ball by his playing partner to complete the round. When Allan heard of this so called betrayal he promptly terminated Tom's employment. However, within a few months Allan was known to be producing gutta-percha balls himself after realising the new balls were more robust and cheaper.\n\nAllan Robertson\n\nDevelopments in golf\n\n1806 \u2013 The selected Captain of St. Andrews Golf Club drives himself into office being the only competitor in the monthly meeting. Prior to this it was an open competition, but the elder memebrs voted for a change in the rules having been outplayed by talented youths!\n\n1834 - The King grants the title of \"Royal & Ancient\" to the Society of St.Andrews Golfers.\n\n1836 \u2013 The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers moves from Leith Links to Musselburgh.\n\nA typical set of clubs of this period was very much like that used for the preceding 400 years, although many players had adopted small headed irons for playing from troublesome spots ( usually called Rut or Track irons ), and irons with very little loft ( called cleeks ) were becoming popular as fairway conditions improved. Additionally a few players began using very heavy iron headed putters. However, wooden clubs were still very much in the majority due to the continued use of the feathery ball."}
{"text":"He's not Bubba long but he is long. For his frame he bangs the ball that's for sure.\n\nDisagree. He is Bubba long (though Bubba is not the longest on tour), but like Tiger early in his career, he has problems with controlling distance with short irons.\n\nWho is the longest on tour? Bubba leads the PGA Tour in driving distance, carry distance, ball speed and club head speed. If he's not the longest on tour by leading EVERY category then I don't know who is...\n\nHis ball speed average is nearly 3 mph faster than anyone else on tour. He even has the highest measurable ball speed at 188 for one swing. He's definitely the longest on tour. Rory is absolutely no slouch though, 177 ball speed is absolutely moving it.\n\nI spent hours at the range (which slopes gently uphill, so you can see a drive that goes 335 then another bounce past it at 340) at the Masters last year and in the space of 45 minutes DJ, Bubba, Phil and Woodland warmed up.\n\nDJ and Phil were both pretty close, DJ a fraction longer. Bubba was hitting massive cuts and draws, about 10 yards further on. Woodland was generally about the same as Bubba, except for his last shot which he went after. Suddenly there was a lone ball sitting at the top of the range, 35-40 yards in the clear.\n\nIf I need a PGA Tour player to long drive for my life - I'll be taking Woodland.the averages reset every year, and has already been said but rory used the slope and shot shape to get a ton of roll where ricky hit into the slope. if it was wet rickey would have out driven rory by 10-15yards. but it wasn't wet, in fact the fairways were rock hard. it was a helluva shot but rory doesn't carry his 3w farther than rickey does his driver. he just hit it so far on that shot because of 40-50 yards of roll\n\nWhat you're describing is range shot which is something along the lines of long drive champion. Woodland will not attempt that swing on the course if he's in play for anything.\n\nOn course tight fairway\/bunkers\/hazard\/pressure swing length is what really matters.\n\nI can see where you are coming from but I disagree.\n\n1) His swing was still quite controlled.\n\n2) It was his last shot before heading to the first tee at Augusta - I still don't think he was going all out\n\n3) His swing earlier in the year when he went for the green on par 4 (tee shot ended in a trash bag I think) was much more aggressive than this one - so his does to them on the course.\n\nGiven only two holes are used and given shots with all clubs are recorded - not just the driver - then what you are hoping to find out is simply not going to happen - the stats are simply not good enough. So we are down to anecdotal evidence and I am quick happy with my opinion because you could literally tell which shots went further, even by just a few yards."}
{"text":"Golf tips from a Pro- Golf Psychology\n\nAuthor: Pete Popovich\n| Photographer: Photography by Anne\n\nWhat separates the best from the rest in anything? It certainly is not the amount of time spent acquiring or improving their skill. If that were the case, the person who practiced or worked the most would win every time. It is not the person with the best technique, because there are so many techniques that work. What separates those who succeed from those who have ability to succeed but fail to do so, is the way they think, i.e. their brain and how they use it.\n\nWhen put in an uncomfortable situation, the body and brain will always revert back to comfort. This means that when put under pressure, you will do what you feel comfortable with no matter if it is the right course of action or not. Understanding what to do in a particular situation will help you break through plateaus and comfort levels and take you to higher levels and more success. For those of you who think getting to the next level is the end-all, let me shed some light on it. It is not the end. It is just the beginning of going to yet another higher level. The process never stops, and as long as you are willing to do what it takes to achieve success, you will attain it.\nBeginner\u2014high handicapper\n\nGolfers in this category are beginners or those who have been playing golf a few years and are just starting to understand how to swing and play the game. Most of their time has been spent at the practice area without much time on the course. Due to this, they are overwhelmed by all the variables (sand traps, out of bounds, water hazards) when they do step onto the course. Here their attention quickly shifts from what they want to accomplish (practice tee) to what they do not want to accomplish (on course dangers), and here lies the problem. Why? Because whatever direction you point your attention is the way you will go. If you are constantly thinking, \"Don't hit it in the water,\" what inevitably happens? You hit it in the water. Why? Because your brain does not comprehend negatives, i.e. \"don't do this or don't do that.\" All it knows is \"water,\" and because your attention was aimed in that direction, that is exactly where you hit it. To improve, you must focus on what you want to do. \"I am going to hit this onto the green\"; \"I am going to hit this in the fairway,\" etc. If you do occasionally hit a bad shot, that is simply human nature. Accept it and move on while knowing you are a novice and the future holds the chance to improve.\n\nMid-Handicapper\u2014accomplished 5x\/week-er\nMost golfers in this category have been playing for quite some time yet are finding it difficult to break through a plateau. Progression came at a quick pace early on, but now progression has slowed and oftentimes is at a stalemate. Breaking 90, 80 or even 70 for the first time is often the goal of this golfer. Expectation is the killer of this group. Why? Because they know they have the ability to raise their game to the next level and believe it should be there all the time. If it is not, they either become discouraged or practice harder. What this group often needs to improve is commitment\u2014commitment to how they will hit each shot and committing to that shot regardless of outcome, despite what thoughts might jump into their head and sabotage the process. For example, if you choose to hit a bump and run up the hill with your 7-iron instead of flying the ball to the hole with your lob wedge, keep the thought of that 7-iron in your mind thru the entire process. Changing your mind while over the ball or mid swing, will only hurt your chances of improving. If something is important to you, would you continue pursuing it if you didn't receive a commitment from it? No, so why would you not commit in your golf game?\n\nAdvanced player and professional\nMost golfers at this level have spent a great deal of time working on their games. Their technique is consistent due to long hours on the practice tee. However, they are not reaching the level they desire compared to the amount of time practicing. Why? Because any golfer who spends an excessive amount of time working on technical aspects becomes attached to technique. When it comes time to play their brain is not tuned to playing golf but is attuned to playing swing. These players need to learn how to let go and let the technical aspect stand on its own. They have just spent countless hours honing technique, but when it comes time to trust it, they are unable. Like a child attached to a favorite blanket, a golfer's attachment to technique is comforting, but it inhibits the golfer from reaching the next level. Once the golfer quits thinking of technique, improvement can go forward. The swing might falter a bit at first, just as a child standing on his own for the first time falters; but he soon self-corrects and so becomes stronger. The more he stands on his own, the stronger he gets until standing on his own becomes automatic. When technique becomes automatic, a golfer can commit to each shot and get back to playing golf without entertaining negatives.\n\nPlaying golf to your potential requires strong thought processes. Regardless of handicap, the more you can apply the proper thinking, the better you can play. Practicing our thought process allows us to take our game from the practice tee to the course, where we can avoid thinking in negatives, commit to the shot, and, ultimately, trust our technique to reach higher and higher levels of accomplishment in a great game.\n\nIf you would like to know more about psychology in golf and how to improve your game, call the Golf Performance Academy-Hilton Head at (843) 338-6737, e-mail pete@golfacademyhiltonhead.com or find us on Facebook at Golf Performance Academy-Hilton Head"}

What has changed is that an \"Exception\" has been added:\n\nException: If it is known or virtually certain that the player did not cause the ball to move, Rule 18-2b does not apply.\n\nThis means that if you know your ball was moved by something else, such as a dog, a person or another ball, or you are virtually certain that wind or water caused your ball to move, you are not subject to penalty under Rule 18-2b.\n\nIf some agency such as a dog, person or ball moved your ball, you would need to go the appropriate section of Rule 18 to determine if there is a penalty to be applied. In all these cases, the ball must be replaced.\n\nIf wind or water moved the ball, there would be no penalty and the ball would not be replaced but would be played from where it came to rest. In general, it would need to be quite a windy day with fast greens to apply this exception.\n\nWhat if the ball merely falls into a small indentation on the green after address? Decision 18-2b\/11 states, \"Gravity is not in itself an element that should be considered when applying the Exception to Rule 18-2b; therefore unless it is known or virtually certain that some agency other than gravity (e.g. outside agency or wind) caused the ball to move after address, the player is subject to a one stroke penalty under Rule 18-2b and must replace the ball.\"\n\nWhen Rule 18-2a Is Still Applicable\n\nIf you have not addressed your ball then Rule 18-2b would not apply, but you should be aware that Rule 18-2a (Ball at Rest Moved by Player, Partner, Caddie or Equipment) may apply. Rule 18-2a says that if you caused your ball in play to move you may be liable for a penalty. Rule 18-2a lists a number of circumstances when the player is not penalized, but in all other cases there is a penalty. Regardless, Rule 18 requires that your ball be replaced.\n\nFrequently, players know they haven't addressed their ball and think they can't be penalized, but they may still have caused the ball to move. (For example, if you bounce your club off the ground 2 inches behind the ball and the ball drops off a small tuft of grass at that same instant.) Your action could easily have caused the ball to move and you should be penalized one stroke under Rule 18-2a."}
{"text":"Weather and Ball Flight\n\nA golfer can know everything there is to know about their ball flight: how far each shot of theirs with every club travels, how to manipulate the ball in the air, the physics of the flight of the ball, and the physics of the striking of the ball on the clubface. But if they don't know anything about how weather affects their ball's flight, then they often will find themselves very frustrated on a North Myrtle Beach golf course.\n\nEvery kind of weather can influence a ball's flight; it is just a matter of how each weather condition can affect the ball's flight. Generally, the most common influential natural force on the ball in the air is wind. Wind can make a huge difference with what club a golfer hits and where the golfer is aiming. A general rule is that if a golfer is hitting in the opposite direction the wind is blowing (called \"hitting into the wind\"), that golfer should take a club higher for every 10 mph of wind. For example, if a player is playing into a heavy 30 mph wind from 150 yards, where they would normally hit a 9 iron, they should take a 6 iron to get the ball the proper distance. The same goes for if you were playing in the same direction the wind was blowing (called \"hitting with the wind\").\n\nAnother common influence on ball flight is precipitation. Any form of precipitation will influence ball flight, whether it is rain, snow, sleet, hail, or fog. Many times when these forms of precipitation exist no golfer will be on a North Myrtle Beach golf course\u2014especially snow and sleet, rare occurrences in South Carolina. However, there may be times when it is necessary for a golfer to play in these conditions. For these cases, it is generally accepted that a longer club is necessary in order to get the ball to the target in these conditions.\n\nAn influence that will affect the ball's flight every time a golfer plays is temperature. Unbeknownst to many golfers, the temperature outside has an effect on how the ball performs. For example, in cold weather, the ball will generally be a colder temperature, causing it to not compress as much when it strikes the clubface. This causes the ball to travel a shorter distance. In warmer weather, the warmer ball will compress more, causing the ball to travel a longer distance.\n\nHumidity will also affect the distance of the ball, in that the bogginess of the air will cause resistance toward the ball in flight, decreasing the distance it travels. If a golfer understands these weather conditions while playing at Eagle Nest Golf Club and any other North Myrtle Beach golf course, they should be well on their way to lower scores in adverse conditions. However, a mastery of the proper golf form should be obtained first"}

{"text":"ARCHIVES\n\nI heard about a disc golf course in Lincoln Park. Where is it located?\n\nAlso, are there other courses around that I am not aware of? I know of Mont du Lac, and the three located by the colleges (LSC, Scholastica, UMD). I am missing any others?\n\n6 Comment(s)\n\nI'm pretty sure there isn't a disc golf course in Lincoln Park, or anywhere in the West End neighborhood, but the Miller Creek course by Lake Superior College is very close to Lincoln Park and shares the same creek as the park does, so someone might have referred to that one as the \"Lincoln Park\" course and confused you.\n\nThe Lincoln Park course is there, it's just not very defined. There are none of the chain baskets to target. However, if you look around people have put tape and things around trees and you must throw the disc and hit the tree between the two markers.\n\nWhen I was photographing for my Virtual Northland website there were two groups of people playing.\n\nThat's pretty much it in the area as public courses go. Superior, Miller, UMD, CSS (if you can call that a course), Mont du lac, Morgan Park, and Lincoln (if you can call that a course). There are three private ones that are around but two of them are extremely sensitive to strangers playing. The best way to find out about all the courses in the area is to play the handicap league at Mont du Lac.\n\nI personally think that, as far as disc golf in the area goes, you can not get any better than the two options at Mont du Lac. It's not for beginners but advanced beginners can enjoy the Eagles Peak course and intermediate and up can enjoy the the Cedar forest course. Outside of Highbridge, 75 miles away (also created by the guy that did Mont du Lac), it's the best disc golf around.\n\nThe baskets have gone in at Lincoln Park. I heard this summer it was approved, but didn't think it would happen so fast. The T-Pads are spray painted on the ground, sidewalk and road. Basket #3 seems to be missing. We tried it out this last Monday, and for a 9-Hole in the city, it's not bad at all.\n\nFor the missing hole 3, we just played a little off the side of Basket 2 and shot for Basket 7. Keeps you moving smooth."}

{"text":"So until you learn the disc you will sometimes throw one far and fast but in the wrong direction.\n\nThat being said, your competitors are throwing wide rimmed drivers so you need to as well once you get to the higher levels. I carry 7 Nukes in my bag plus backups and they are essential to my game.\n\nIf you don't have the arm speed to handle a Nuke, start on a Nuke SS (an understable Nuke with huge glide). Don't give up on your traditional drivers as you will need them for control shots. The sooner you start experimenting with a Nuke the sooner you will learn it and be ready to use it in competitive rounds.\n\npask2155 wrote:so the wider the rim the more inconsistent a disc is???\n\nThe wider the rim the more precise you must be to control it. This is why putters are easier to control than mids and mids are easier to control than drivers. At the top of the evolutionary scale sits the wide rimmed drivers. The Nuke has the widest, sharpest rim allowed under PDGA specs.\n\nI tested and dabbled with various Nuke prototypes for a year before I decided I needed to learn the disc. One day I was playing a hole out of my reach. It was a tight uphill tunnel with a low overhang. Because I knew I couldn't get within 60 feet of the hole, no matter how perfectly I hit the hole with my primary drivers, on a whim I threw a Nuke. What was the risk? I was only going to get a 3 if I drove well or poorly, so what the heck? I chucked a Nuke, did not throw it perfectly and it sailed past the hole. Hot damn! How did that happen? That was no Nuke fluke, just what the disc could do.\n\nOnce I realized the potential it was a matter of learning the disc and slowly moving it into my tournament bag then repertoire of shots. Now it is my primary long range driver.\n\nmoney 21 wrote:so what discs has the nuke replaced for you. I keep moving up to the wde rim the moving back down to the speed 11 discs.\n\nI think this is the right way to do it. It takes a while to figure out the wide rimmed drivers. Just like a hole may be risk or reward, so too are drivers. You have to learn when to trust a disc and when not to, dependent upon not just the shot but your current ability to control it. So experiment with wide rimmed drivers. Put them away when they create too much chaos and pull them back out when the time is right. But keep chipping away. Eventually, when your opponents are beating you with a superior weapon you have to set up. You won't win many gunfights with a knife.\n\nI find the key to controlling a Nuke is nose angle. The nose is the leading edge of the disc as it flies. If I don't release a Nuke flat-dead nuts flat- it is not going to start out flying straight. This is why a poorly released Nuke is a scud missile.\n\nZ Flashes, Proline Rogues and Z Crushes were my primary drivers. All 3 of these discs are in the same family, basically the same disc in varying stability. Flashes fly straight, Rogues anhyzer and Crushes hyzer. All are superb control drivers.\n\nI used to carry a stack of Flashes. Now I carry one. The rest replaced by Nukes. My Rogues and Crushes still get a lot of use. When distance is essential I throw a Nuke.\n\nso i'm not really hearing about any drawbacks from the NUKE. It sounds like a pretty solid disc... It goes far and somewhat temperamental as expected. Are there other discs that consistently go further with more tolerances?\n\nthe nuke is a solid disc. the advanage over some of the other wide rims is it comes in a lot of different plastics. it has the same disadvantage as other wide rim disc n the plh and dome are going tho play a large role in its flight.\n\nmark how much more distance do you get from a nuke over a rogue or flash? i can only get the nuke out about 10-15' farther then my surges. Have you thrown the hurricane much, so don't confuse the different Nuke molds. The OS is OVERstable, extremely so. The SS seems to be popular with less powerful or hyzer dominant throwers. Also be aware that you will want to actually feel the standard Nuke, as the ESP and Z models are from slightly different molds. The ESP has a slightly taller rim, IIRC. The X Nuke (not sure which mold) is an anny bomber for me, and has given me my longest throws, bar none. I carry a pretty new ESP, and a beat Z or new X, in addition to Forces and Avengers. Depending on the course, I often take the Nukes out. Overall, the Nuke mold is the easiest disk for me to throw far, but as Mr. Ellis advised, it does require some input on the throwers part to learn to throw, and then to learn when to throw it. Good luck, and post up if you have specific questions. KP\n\nStrictly speaking stability ain't even the correct term i've been told. Stable is so falsely used even in the incorrect way we use in disc golf. Often times people mean more OVERstable when they say more stable. But stable is the least false term when it means straight flying so more stable should mean straighter flying. A Nuke that has been broken in will flip early in the flight and fade near or identically the same than a new one. Maybe a very beat disc could lose some of the fade but it takes time. The shape of the disc is such that the disc will fade hard in the end"}
{"text":"Wedges And Utility Woods Designed For Lower Scores\n\nUtility woods are clubs that are designed to get the ball out of a trouble situation as easily as possible. A look at utility woods provides shows us why they are easy to hit from difficult lies. Many utility woods have higher lofts. High lofts help get the ball out of the rough quickly. Remember, the key is to get the ball back in play as quickly as possible when you hit it in the rough!\n\nDon't hesitate to consider a #7, 9 or even an 11 wood when it comes to selecting a club for escape from bad lies. A utility wood might not hit it as far as a #3 wood, but there is no doubt you will get the ball out easier and more consistently. Many Tour pros carry these types of woods with great success.\n\nMany utility woods have what is called a low profile. This means that the heads usually aren't very big and are definitely not very tall. Low profile woods typically have face heights less than 35 millimeters, with faces less than 30 not uncommon. The idea of the low profile (also called low center of gravity or LCG), in addition to lowering a club's center of gravity, is to prevent the club head from twisting when it is hit from the rough. The smaller the head, the less chance there is to get it caught in the grass, making for straighter shots. Plus, the low profile woods have much of their weight on the sole. This makes it even easier for you to get the ball in the air quicker with these kinds of woods. Examples of utility woods of the low profile design in the Dynacraft catalog are the LCG and the popular Tour Caliber.\n\nA number of utilities also have rails on their soles, including our LCG. Often these rails are fitted with dense weights. Our LCG features heavier copper weights in the rails for a lower CG. These rails lower the weight of the club even more. Any time a player can get weight under the ball at impact, there is a better chance for the ball to go higher out of the rough. Usually the higher a ball goes, the more accurately it goes as well because of the extra backspin from the higher shot. A trend in golf today is to use heavier metals in utility clubs. These heavier metals, such as tungsten, copper or brass, also have the effect of getting the ball in the air and out of trouble quickly. When combined with lower profiles, these clubs provide players with clubs that make getting out of trouble easier than it has ever been.\n\nWedges and utility clubs can be keys to lower scores. Getting the ball out of trouble more efficiently can only lead to lower scores. Low profile or specially weighted clubs give your customer an advantage; adding a properly fitted one to his or her set will take strokes off their handicap. Choosing the proper wedge will help the player get the ball close to the hole, not only after he has made a good recovery with a utility wood, but when he's hit the perfect drive near the green. Take time to choose the clubs best suited to the player's game and watch the scores come down \u2013 quickly!"}

{"text":"You're making an unsupported assumption. There is nothing in the tone of his post that would lead anyone to that conclusion.The Holly Saunders stuff seems to put some people on edge, not sure why, I say bring on the Holly pics!!Looks like she is trying to figure out her score on the hole. Or maybe on which hole I will score? Yeah, that's it!\n\nHave to agree. A few weeks ago I was playing with a couple friends and had an elderly lady paired with us.\n\nMy only complaint was that I didnt light up a cigar because she was riding with me, but we actually had a good time. (And she was a much faster player than my 2 friends)There's a group of 50-60 year old, 4 ft tall Korean ladies that walk at our club, and they're surprisingly fast as well. Faster than 90% of the average players around here. They don't waste any time, and from what I've seen, they actually don't play too bad. Now their husbands, who play from the blue tees at 7001 yards are a different story. They don't hit the ball far enough or well enough to play from back there, and always back up the course behind them. I wish the ladies would give them some lessons on how to play faster.\n\nI can play with just about anyone, but its not a lot of fun for me to play with really bad players. If someone can break 100 and at least advance the ball each time I can play with them. What I can't deal with is someone who has to hit the ball 4 times before we get to my drive. That's gets old in a hurry.\n\nThat being said I still prefer to play with friends, although I have had some great rounds with strangers.\n\nWomen are usually pretty quick because they don't have to chase the ball all over the course. Less drastic misses, tend to hit short and straight, don't fart around on the course like guys do. There's a bunch of older, bogey handicap level women and my parents club. They can be tough to keep up with.I have found that it is a good motivator for pokey players to be playing behind women who play at a good pace."}
{"text":"5 Golf Swing Tips\n\nBy: Tabatha Smith\n\nBreak Studios Contributing Writer\n\nThere are many styles and techniques used in the popular sport of golf, and here are five golf swing tips to help people who are new to the sport. As golf has grown in popularity over the past few years, it is expected that the sport will continue to attract the millions of people from the baby boomer generation. It is a great way to socialize and exercise at the same time.\n\nConcentrate on the target line. A consistent golf swing takes concentration on the target line or the straight line between the ball's position and the hole. Too often, golfers get caught up in the techniques of hitting the ball instead of focusing on the actual swing and the final destination.\n\nKnow the proper swing setup. The setup is just as important as the swing. Grip the club lightly with enough pressure to stay in control. Stabilize your weight on the balls of your feet rather than the heels, and keep the knees flexed. Keep your back straight and lean forward from the hips without curving your back.\n\nLearn to swing for direction before learning to swing for distance. Beginners to golf often find that keeping up with experienced players may be difficult because of the speed at which they can swing and hit the ball. While it is admirable to hit the ball great distances, it is more important for the beginner to practice and master the skill of swinging consistently to control the direction of the ball even though it may not go as far.\n\nRealize that every golf swing takes focus. When golfers start to see their balls go off course, they are safe to assume that they are not focusing on each and every small movement when swinging. As seen by the professional golfers on television, every swing is thought about, planned, and then executed.\n\nStretch before playing. The game of golf is a physical sport and each swing stretches the muscles in the arms, back, and legs. Take the time to swing at a few practice balls or to perform a few stretching exercises prior to the game. You should see improvement in your golf swing and avoide injuries to your body."}

{"text":"Category Archives: Marketing\n\nI have a lifelong obsession with golf. It started in 2nd grade when my parents scraped together enough money for a starter set and a series of playing lessons at a local par 3 course. Even though neither of them were serious players\u2013 I guess they thought I'd enjoy it. And I did. A lot.\n\nDon't read that the wrong way.I'm not a country club kid. I've never belonged to a course where I got my own locker or had an account on file with the restaurant.\n\nInstead, I grew up playing city-owned munis and family-owned courses. In middle school, my first membership to the local golf course cost my family $50. That also included an annual pool membership, ice rink membership, and anything else the Mishawaka Parks Department charged money for. I didn't grow up playing with kids named Chip or Trevor. We were more of an Adam, Mike, and Tim kind of crowd. But golf was my obsession. All summer long, every day, I play 27, 36, or 45 holes of golf.\n\nHere's what I learned about success in golf that translates to life: We don't have equal access to success\n\nOne fact that I love about golf, especially professional golf, is that anyone can become a professional in 7 days. Unlike any other professional sport on the planet I can start on Monday as a nobody and win a million dollars on Sunday. Just about anyone can enter a qualifier. And if you manage to qualify you are in the same tournament as the card carrying professionals on Thursday. And if you make the cut on Saturday, then manage to win on Sunday\u2013 they will hand you a big check and a Tour Card for the rest of the season.\n\nFat chance trying that in baseball, football, or basketball.\n\nBut that almost never happens. While there are several PGA Tour members who rose from poor backgrounds to earn their card on Tour I can't name a single person who is currently on Tour who started as a Monday qualifier and turned a good 7 days into a career.\n\nIt can happen, but it is nearly impossible.\n\nInstead, if you look at those who made it, you'll see that their success is a combination of 3 qualities.\n\nTalent \u2013 Talent is the constant. Talent is the difference between learning skills well enough to be pretty good and being a winner. Over the years I've played with and coached hundreds of people. But when you walk the course with a person who has a natural talent for the game\u2026 it's amazing. Most amazing is that these players can rarely describe to you the mechanics of what they are doing. They just try stuff and it works.\n\nAmbition\/hard work \u2013 Talent isn't enough. I've met plenty of talented players. Each high school team of 12-15 young men had 3-4 players with enough talent to take them to the next level. But if they aren't single-focused enough they won't advance in the game. An ambitious person never stops practicing. They putt in their living room. Hit wedges in their backyard. Keep a 7-iron and a bag of balls in their trunk to practice between meetings. They play 9-holes before work and chose vacations with great practice facilities.\n\nEnvironment\/resources - This is the X factor. This is the difference between a good local golfer and a professional. They have access to amazing resources. In most cases, their family has invested in them from a very young age. They played in expensive junior tournaments. They have great equipment. They have great coaching. And it results in opportunities to get to even better tournaments, more finely tuned equipment, and the best coaching.\n\nYou can be pretty good, above average, with two out of the three. But you'll never be excellent. There are millions of guys putting their clubs in their trunks right now who have endless talent and ambition but aren't in the right environment with the right resources to make it to the next level. And this weekend will be full of guys who pull up their Mercedes at a country club, with access to the best environment and resources and absolutely no talent for the game.\n\nI don't care about golf. What does this have to do with you or me?\n\nWe each have something we were created to be amazing at. There is something in our lives that we have talent, ambition, and resources to be the best at.\n\nIdentify that thing\u2026 no matter how obscure the niche`\u2026 and you'll find the success you know you deserve.\n\nIs this the best time ever to start a small business?It sure seems like it!\n\nCountless brilliant minds, long cooped up in boring corporate jobs, are on unemployment and unable to find new corporate jobs.\n\nThe internet has made the world pretty flat. You have a good product? You can move it online for about the same per unit price as the big guys.\n\nCulture has a distaste for big business. Enron, big banks, BP, Monsanto, Wal*Mart\u2013 we're all questioning if we can trust giant. But we know we can trust local.\n\nThe genie has left the bottle. With all of that knowledge leaving big business\u2026 these folks know how to run a business, are well networked, and know all the tricks of their trade.\n\nIt's never been cheaper. Seriously, in a bunch of states you can legally start a business for less than $100. Using existing free tools like Craigslist, Etsy, or Ebay you can advertise a product for free. (Or darn close to it.)\n\nPeople are more willing to buy thoughts, ideas, designs, and concepts than ever before! Consultant isn't just a fancy word for unemployed anymore.\n\nIf you are thinking about it, let me encourage you on two quick things.\n\nThere is no time like the present. I started my first company in 2005 and sold it in 2008. It wasn't scary. It was fun!\n\nWhile I don't agree with all the MBAs out there that you need a business plan to start a small business, I do think you need to do the 30 minutes of work in setting everything up legally. Get a Tax ID, get a business bank account, get a business license if its require, form the right tax entity to protect yourself. None of that is hard and you don't need a lawyer to do any of that.\n\nHere's a bi-product I love. All of those small businesses need a website. Which supports my cottage industry.\n\nWhether you are aware of it or not, there is a raging battle going on about the concept of free vs. paid content on the internet. Big names in media like Rupert Murdoch have drawn the line in the sand\u2013 they are going to make people pay for news content. Others have embraced the Google model of an advertising-based system of free content. Last week Seth Godin took the debate to a new level. He is firmly in the free camp while Malcolm is in the the paid camp. Of course, most of Seth's income comes from consulting, speaking, and book proceeds\u2013 so Seth may be in the free camp for some things, but his paycheck comes from paid content too.\n\nInside the church the same debate has just begun. And all of these questions lead back to the same two central questions that newspapers are wrestling with, \"Since creating content isn't free, who is going to pay?\" \"In a world of free content, where is the ethical line?\"\n\nTwo Sides to the Content Coin\n\n1. Gospel-oriented content should be freely available. As someone who has successfully started an internet business in the last five years I know the power of free. Ask Tim Schmoyer. Ask Ryan Nielsen. Nothing draws traffic to a youth ministry website quite like free. In the youth ministry world there is an expectation of free content. There is a righteous indignation when you question the ethics of free, too. No one cares that it costs me thousands of dollars to create, host, and market \"free\" content. There is a general consensus that stuff about youth ministry should be free and you shouldn't expect anything in return for free lessons, videos, music, etc. \"Don't ask me to click on an ad. Don't ask me to sign up for a newsletter. I need something free because I don't have budget to buy stuff.\" I've gotten nasty emails from folks who insist that all content about ministry should be free. These same people often are in paid ministry. So they want to get paid for using someone's free content. Talk about wanting your cake and eating it too! Sheesh.\n\n2. Gospel-oriented content should cost something. Of course, the ironic thing about the free thing is that the people who think ministry content should be free want to get paid by their churches, ministries, or non-profits. If I told you that you shouldn't get paid for being a youth pastor you'd get angry with me! There is a certain immaturity to the free thing. At the end of the day there is no such thing as free content on the internet. Someone sits down to write something, they save it as a PDF, they post it on a website, and they offer it for free to anyone who wants to download it. It seems free when it isn't. That computer cost you something. The education that powered your thoughts cost you something. The time you spent creating it\u2026 was it for work you were being paid for at the church? If so, does that content even belong to you? If it was your free time, isn't that time worth something? If you don't think your time is worth something why should I use your stuff? When you posted it somewhere on the web, who paid for that server space? If it's on a well-known site, who is paying for the building of that site\/brand? Who is paying for maintaining it? If you added graphics to the content, who paid for that? If you had someone proofread it, who paid for that persons work? That doesn't seem free to me.\n\nThere is no such thing as \"free\" content, even Gospel-oriented content, so people should expect to pay something for the works they use. The real question is, \"Who should pay?\" In the old media world the user was expected to pay for the content. You subscribed to a newspaper to get the content and the profit in the model came from advertising. You wanted a book so you went to a bookstore and bought it. In the 1980s and 1990s most of us in ministry would have thought it immoral to copy books and give them to friends, copy cassette tapes and give them to students, etc. But now there is an expectation that advertising will somehow pay for all the content I want\/need. That's the new media age. Free to me, let advertisers foot the bill. Wouldn't it be funny to see a pastors salary supported by advertising? He'd preach in an outfit that resembled a Nascar driver's suit! It's always funny to think about real world applications of stuff we do on the internet everyday, isn't it?\n\nDigital media has created an ethics dilemna for people in ministry, hasn't it? There seems to be a feeling that the parable of the talents can't possibly relate to actual money. People who advocate for free content will concede\u2026 \"It's OK to break even, just don't get rich!\" So if content cost me $500 to produce a lesson\u2026 why is it wrong to want to return $1000? (Like the parable) Don't you remember the parable\u2026 Jesus called the man who just broke even a wicked and lazy servant. What then would Jesus say to people who intend to invest $500 in content and give it away? Super wicked and super lazy?\n\nWe would never walk up to an auto mechanic and expect him to change our oil for free simply because we are in ministry. We would never go to the dentist and insist that he give us free dental. We would never go to the grocery store and expect the grocer to pay for the pastors food. And yet we have no problem with this when it comes to Gospel-oriented content. Something is out of whack, isn't it?\n\nAs with all things that seem to leave us in a quandry\u2013 I am wondering if there is a 3rd way.Is there a way that is both ethically satisfying and free? Is there a way that is both affordable for ministry folks and pays for itself?\n\nChime in. I don't pretend to have all the answers. If you're in the paid camp\u2013 speak up! If you think everything should be free, give me a counter-punch.\n\nLast night I was listening to the latest episode of This American Life about origin stories of new industries and companies. Many well known companies have a myth that they started in a garage. Even if it really isn't true, people want to believe that their company was created by someone with a crazy idea who invested her last $2000 on an idea and got started in their garage. For some companies, like Hewlett-Packard and Apple, there is truth to it and the garage has become a corporate icon for innovation. In the case of Google, they have tried to capture that feeling so much that in 2006 they actually purchased the garage which housed their offices for a few months in the early days.\n\nIt made me think of the virtual garage in which YMX was built. A few friends sat around in an AIM chat room one night and envisioned a new place for youth workers to hang out. That night the idea went from light bulb to a URL and was a big moment. Just 2-3 weeks later I pulled an all-nighter when we opened the site and in 12 hours went from idea to profit. For me, that was an iconic experience I will look back on for the rest of my life.\n\nIt made me think of garage start-ups right now. I thought of Bob Carter who started The Pod Drop in his basement. In just three years he has taken his small iPod repair business from his basement to franchises. I thought of Derek Johnson who started Tatango. In just 2 years he has taken his idea of a group texting service from his parents basement to hundreds of thousands of customers. We don't need to think of the garage story think it couldn't happen today. Today's economy has forced the brightest minds on the planet from the board room to the garage. Out of this recession will come the next great innovations that shape the next 30 years. The question isn't if it will happen. The question is, \"Will I take my idea and run with it or will I end up working for the person who took his idea and ran with it?\"\n\nMore importantly it made me think about the fact thatfor most people\u2013 there is never a garage. There may be dreams of a time when you are passionate about a new idea\u2013 about thumbing your nose at the man and going on your own\u2013 but for lack of something [money, time, guts] it never happens. Most of us, even leaders of great organizations, never get to be a part of it in the beginning. The garage is merely a legend. We get hired some time well after the good 'ole days of wheeling, dealing, and turning heads. If you got hired today by Apple or Hewlett-Packard you would never be allowed the freedom to truly innovate in a garage to try to make something happen as it's simply too complicated now. You have to make payroll, you have to mitigate loss, you have to protect the brand, you have to guarantee the shareholders a return, etc. Certainly these jobs require leadership, but a type of leadership that knows how to innovate in mature ecosystems.\n\nMy challenge for you is simple. Whether you a leader for a government agency, school district, church, non-profit, or even a small business\u2013 my challenge is the same. Spend some time in the garage. Ask big questions. Thumb your nose at the status quo a little. (Even the status quo for excellence you created.)\n\nStarter questions:\n\nIf we were to start a church today in this community, knowing what we know now, what would it look like? Where would we meet? What programs would solve the most systemic problems in our community? How could we manifest the Gospel best? What behavior would we thumb our noses at? Who would be the most crucial people to invest in? Who would we not care if we pissed off? Who is the most unreached people group in our town?\n\nThis doesn't have to be about a church, does it? Make your own questions for what you are passionate about and go to the garage.\n\nIf you live in the United States, you are the proud owner of the second largest pool of retirees next to the federal government. And as a bonus you also get a small and dying breed of cars formally known as General Motors. We just spent over $80 billion to bailout a company that is only worth $7.3 billion. You can walk onto a dealers lot right now and participate in the largest liquidation of assets in the history of the world.\n\nAnd we still haven't fixed the one thing that forced them into the red in the first place: 500,000 retirees.\n\nGeneral Motors is the classic case of over promising.\n\nOver-promise #1: I remember talking to a GM executive about the business model as he gave me a tour of their Warren Tech Center. I asked him how often a customer was supposed to buy a new car according to the company? His answer made my jaw drop. They built their business model on the assumption that you would buy a brand new car every 3 years. No wonder their cars sucked! They only expected you to own it 36 months. No wonder they failed! No one in their right mind could afford to buy a brand new car every 3 years. They were absolutely lying to themselves. Their competitors built cars that lasted 10 years or more. Honda and Toyota owners hit 100,000 miles and knew that their cars will easily make 200,000 miles. Meanwhile, GM was building cars that were meant to be traded in at 36,000 miles.\n\nOver-promise #2: In the mid-1980s, when Toyota and Honda made it big in the United States market, GM was stupid to continue the retirement program. There was simply no way that they could afford to continue the program\u2026 but they lied to their employees and sold them the lie that if they took care of GM, GM would take care of them for life. The smart thing to do back then would have been to convert the program to 401k and make no promises of retiree health care. Instead, they oversold a promise they couldn't keep. Worse yet, to deal with payroll issues they started early retirement programs which meant people in their mid-50s were walking away from GM with a \"guaranteed\" pension and health care. There are currently tens of thousands of people in the United States who have now been retired from GM longer than they worked for GM. No company can bear that burden. Companies struggle just to pay benefits for current employees\u2026 How did they think they could insure 500,000 non-wage earning retirees?\n\nMy point isn't really about GM, it's about over-promising. Here are some ill-effects of over-promising.\n\n- Advertising becomes useless. It doesn't matter how much money you spend on ads as people won't believe you anymore.You can't hype up a product launch or an event that you've oversold forever. When you don't deliver you are just reminding customers how much you betrayed them.\n\n- Your word becomes useless. When you break promise after promise, soon people won't trust that your on their side. They will see that you only want their money and you don't care about them.\n\n- Your product becomes a joke. I was in a meeting yesterday about search engines and someone used the word Yahoo\u2026 everyone laughed. Yahoo has become a dinosaur of a search engine. The only thing memorable about Yahoo is that stupid song, Yaaahhoooooo. You can't advertise and promise a web service, you can only deliver. This is the #1 reason you can't trust Bing.com to be any good. If it was so good why are they spending $100,000,000 to advertise it?\n\nShifting gears:The evangelical church has become a classic example of the over-promise. Part of the church becoming more about programs and business models is that it has fallen into the trap of needing marketing and advertising like the business models they copies. The result is a lot of over-promising. \"Come to the marriage retreat, it'll fundamentally change your marriage.\" or \"Sign up for our next church production, it'll be awesome.\" or \"Bring your friends to the revival and they will get saved.\" In a world where the awesome is so readily available churches do nothing but give away trust when they advertise promises they can't deliver. I've seen church events marketed like they were going to be on par with Disney or Broadway or Oprah and deliver like a trip to the town carnival, a middle school play, or a cable access show. At the end of the day the church spent more effort marketing the event, production, or program than they did making the program awesome. It is a sick cycle that is killing thousands of churches.\n\nThe better way: Wouldn't it be refreshing if churches just delivered? Wouldn't it be amazing if they didn't sell themselves but just helped people? What if they invested in training their volunteers and staff so much that the church didn't need to make promises, that their programs and ministries truly worked to change lives? You wouldn't need to advertise a life-changing marriage retreat\u2026 because results would advertise themselves. You wouldn't need to hold a revival because every church service, small group, and youth group meeting would see people come to know Jesus. You wouldn't need to hire a killer band and create a worship experience because people were authentically worship Jesus.The best advertising a church could ever invest in is a changed life.\n\nIf you are a church leader I want to challenge you to think about your programs. Think about how you talk about them. Think about how you market them. And remember:\n\nDon't promise, deliver.\n\nDon't hype, deliver.\n\nDon't sell, deliver.\n\nDon't measure, deliver.\n\nDon't sub-contract, deliver.\n\nDon't advertise, deliver.\n\nIn a low trust, high expectation world the best way to succeed is to undersell and deliver.\n\nEntrepreneurs get this. Start-up businesses get this. New franchises get this. Church planters get this.But no one in an older business, church, franchise, or industry can comprehend this.\n\nYou have grown your audience as much within what you are doing today as you will ever grow it. You primary demographic already knows about you and has decided whether to be a customer or not. They have decided whether to become a student in your college or not. They have decided whether or not your to attend your church.\n\nPeople largely make decisions on your project, widget, consumable, or institution in an instant. Five seconds or less. (Test it yourself, watch TV commercials. How soon until you decide if you are buying that product? I thought so.) Spending more money to advertise the same thing over and over again is just a waste of money. This is why Super Bowl commercials can be deal makers or deal breakers for companies you've never heard of.\n\nThis is why marketers dump millions of dollars onto the airwaves and see little return on their investment. This is why church marketing sucks. Once you can identify who your audience is\u2026 your best possibility for growth then shifts to customer service and care. Can I keep the customers I have? Can I provide them such an amazing service that they tell their friends that they have to go there, be there, or be your customer?\n\nGrowth comes as you lead your organization towards the edges. When you help your church or college find a new demographic, there is growth. When you design a new product that changes the game for an old industry, there is growth. When you serve a need that everyone wants but no one offers, there is growth.\n\nWhat's the first step in determining how to find my edge?\n\nSpend time and discover where you are failing. Spend time finding out where everyone in your industry fails. Spend time finding out what churches in your area aren't doing.\n\nHint: Studying successful companies, institutions, churches, or whatever will only lead you away from growth and into their market. Learn from their best practices, for sure, but don't study them to copy them. Their edge won't ever be your edge"}

{"text":"Golf Drill To Improve Your Pitching Feel\n\nWhen you watch golf on T.V. you often hear the commentators talking about feel shots. Especially when a golfer is faced with a pitch shot. So what do they mean when they talk about a feel shot?\n\nWell, what they are referring to is that the golfer will not have a specific yardage for the pitch shot. Instead they will have to feel how far to hit the golf ball. They will have to feel how the ball is going to react when it hits the ground. They will have to feel what is the best shot to get the ball close to the hole.\n\nEssentially a feel shot in a game of golf is a short game shot that requires your imagination to try and get the ball close. It is not your stock standard pitch shot.\n\nIn this article I'm going to give you a simple exercise that you can do to improve your feel around the greens, so let's get started.\n\nLet's say an average pitch shot is in the 20-50 yard range. So to improve your feel for this type of shot you need to go out to either a practice green, or you can even do this at home if your backyard is big enough, or just go to a park or reserve where this exercise will be safe to do.\nGet some golf balls and with an underhand action toss the balls to your target.\n\nBy doing this it will help your rhythm and tempo when you go to pitch a golf ball, because the tempo and rhythm used to toss a ball should be similar to the tempo and rhythm required to hit good pitch shots.\n\nWhen you're doing this underhand tossing drill notice and be aware of how your hand adjusts to produce different trajectories and distances.\n\nDon't just do one trajectory when doing this exercise. Do high tosses, low tosses, medium height tosses and everything in between. Get a feel for how the ball reacts when you do this. Notice how your hand adjusts for different tosses.\n\nOnce you have done this for at least 10 minutes then get out the club you normally pitch with and hit some pitch shots to the targets you've been tossing balls from. When you do this you'll notice that you have a much greater feel when pitching, which can only help to get your pitch shots closer and slash shots from your scores."}
